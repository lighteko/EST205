0,This is Marilyn Phillips again if you don't help me straighten this problem out I'm going to have to move on to something else because you're punishing me for something I did not do I don't think this is fair and I don't think it's right and I don't think you should have a right to do this to me after I have told you it was not me you're keeping me locked out of Facebook when that's my business not your business I have not done nothing wrong so Facebook you you tell me WHAT,1
1,"I tried everything to sell my stuff but still nothing! These people from the Offerup customer service are idiots! They didn't help me at anything. I give up by now. Nobody is going to buy my items and no one has messaged me! Offerup - You suck at everything! I'm going to install the buying and selling app that is faster, quicker, and more convenient than Offerup.",1
2,Set to local only it still shows items shipped from across the country. Useless search and filtering.,1
3,Great place to make extra $$,5
4,"I'm relatively new to Offer Up, but it's working out okay. Why have local+shipping be the default, and after I change it to local only have it switch back the next time I open the app? If I wanted to buy from afar, I'd go to a certain worldwide auction site. And the ads... Just backing out of an ad prompts a video ad, making me want to close out. Otherwise, I've found some great deals locally and have learned the closer to home, the better.",3
5,"some people ""offer"" things and evan take payment but Don't and i guess the money is returned",4
6,they didn't show up. what a waste of time.,1
7,This is my 1st time on the site. wish me luck.,3
8,"People post stuff which they claim is for sale but then don't respond when you give them offers. Sellers don't respond to questions about the things they're selling. Advertisements play during the app which is extremely annoying. The most annoying part though is that if somebody offers to sell something for $100 and you offer them $100 three times and it's been in 2 weeks and they still haven't sold it, why won't they sell it to you? Maybe they could tell you that would be wonderful.",1
9,"I tried to sign into my account, but it wanted to verify my identity, so it was supposed to send me an email with a password, but it never did, so I called and just got the run around.",1
10,"The app would be great if you could get just one person to respond regarding any purchase you'd like to many. I have offer the going price for the majority of things if like to purchase, but if people aren't really serious about selling there items what's the point.",1
11,I gave it one star for one reason. The app said it is not compatible with my phone.,1
12,"App ads now hijack phone, and the ""install"" buttons are located in places ""back"" typically woukd be. Typical millenni-tech industry scam.",1
13,"App is very slow to use at times, hopefully update will improve app..",3
14,Great App,5
15,You guys don't do anything when accounts and profiles violate Offer up rules.Sellers are leaving customers stranded when both parties agreed upon time and place. Wish I can rate this website zero .,1
16,I clicked locale up to 80 miles. Stop showing me cars across the country...,1
17,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. SEARCH ALERTS FOR SHIPPABLE ITEMS STILL CANNOT BE CREATED. THIS PROBLEM WAS REPORTED MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO, BUT OFFERUP WILL NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. INSTEAD, THEY WILL MERELY RESPOND WITH A REQUEST TO EMAIL THEM.",2
18,"If you're not a premium member, your post is available for 30 minutes to premium members only. This app sucks if you're not a premium member.",1
19,wonderful people very Very nice,5
20,very helpful,5
21,simple,5
22,good,5
23,godo,4
24,Update. Pop-up an doesn't work with VPN. Down grade on app score,3
25,it's great if you're trying to get rid of stuff and need money quick,5
26,it is very helpful for buying and selling..,5
27,Recent update is not good cant get to anything cant pick categories this needs to go back to the way it was!,1
28,Hate recent update cannot easily access the categories,1
29,"This app is so frustrating. First of all the amount of ads that flood the home feed is absurd. And the ads are also maliciously that lead to me getting a virus on my phone. Then amount of bots on here trying to steal your information is absurd. They message you the second you put up a new post and it's frustrating and ruins a lot of the user experience. And lastly is the paid subscription. Without it, it's virtually impossible for someone to stumble upon your post making selling fell redundant.",2
30,"too many ads, too many notifications, app takes too much time to load.",3
31,I love it.,5
32,"So far I am having fun and I am happy to be selling on here it's so easy to do. I use to use depop ,but omg they messed me up to many times and trying to restart your store and all your followers is not fun and I had to do that 3 times. I haven't had one problem here at offerup so yes come join in the buying and easy ,fun way to sell .look forward to seeing you guys üë¶",5
33,Have sold to Good people,5
34,really good app üëå,5
35,What happened with the search categories? Everything was organized before now it's harder to search for items.,1
36,I normally don't write reviews but I have had it with this app the ads are so annoying I ended up uninstall this for that reason,1
37,"great deals , everyone so far have been super nice , it's been nice meeting the people I've met so far.",5
38,great app,5
39,"It's all scammers. I see the same item all posted on new accounts. You bid on the item and it's always l can't seem to accept the payment, can you try again. I'll just mail it to you and you pay direct. It's the same reply word for word on all the fake accounts. Second cookie cutter reply is what's your phone number so they can try their verification scam. All the new users have the same images and same items for sale. Just look each time.",1
40,"Awful app. If I say that I don't want to buy things that'll be shipped and all the app shows is stuff that'll be shipped, I think everybody who works on this app should be immediately fired.",1
41,Letgo was way better its ruined now,1
42,"awesome, I have benefited with a lot of great deals.",5
43,very positive experience. very happy.,5
44,"Great App fir local Sales. Never had any issues, most people I've dealt with are genuinely honest. Highly recommend..!!",5
45,2020 offerup > 2024 offerup,1
46,"Offer up has really gone downhill. Here's what drives me nuts about this app. - Can't see prices unless you click on a listed item making browsing for items very innefficient - Random ads pop up and if you try to click out of the ad it starts downloading the advertised product - Getting notifications for ""newly listed items"" but not actual messages from potential buyers. Or perhaps there's so many generic notifications that the messages get lost in the junk mail Rip offerup",1
47,Ive had a much better experiance with people on offer up. Craigslist has more stuff but offer up is catching up. Edit 8-31-24. As a premium tru you member Offerup sucks now. They charge you to post which I understand its right keep the scammers away. All it does is makes it a dealer cesspool. Also I get banned all the time for no reason for 24-48 hours. If you try and contact someone from offerup good luck. In a few years I don't think anyone will be using it. I get most my sales from Facebook.,2
48,Why are you showing listings in Florida when I live in NY and set set my location 30 miles from me uninstalled,1
49,"The search filters don't even work. Wanted dressers for pickup within 30 miles of me and it showed clothes, yard supplies, and other random stuff ALL ACROSS the US, and most required shipping. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Stupid.",1
50,super easy to sell my stuff! I love it!!!,5
51,App is quick to sell your info. New update loses the side menu for faster or specified searches. Now the app is full of ads and seems like you need to search thru entire sell items to find one thing. Definitely a 0 out of 5.,1
52,Ne and the kids were on their side yesterday,5
53,the offer up app is awesome keep up the good work.,5
54,I love this app because they don't steal your money so I gave this app 6 stars so thank you very much...,5
55,To many adds and dealer listing's. I want to buy private. If I wanted a dealership I'd go to their websites,1
56,"Way to many adds, this app has become garbage",1
57,Ads randomly coming up while trying to view items to purchase.,1
58,"cool app. works well. some what more dependable then the sellers themselves, lol.",4
59,i love it is my best app to look and trust for goods,5
60,"OfferUp discriminates against women. I reported a man for being extremely rude and within 24 hours, OfferUp disabled my account. They claimed that I must verify my phone number to reopen my account despite that not being required in their terms and conditions. I find it more than a little suspicious that such punitive action was taken against me after I reported a man being rude to me. (OfferUp responded to my review to save face, but I already emailed them, and they did nothing.)",1
61,Selling and buying are fun.,5
62,"Update 8/30 Where is the categories menu? Horrible update yet again. This was a 5 star app. Sold and bought a lot. Unfortunately, this update ruined the app. The UI is horrible. I hope the developers realize their mistake soon.",1
63,Can not download on cell phone :( (Use too...not any more),1
64,let's me find cool stuff,5
65,they have cool stuff that you like you need for good price good bargain,5
66,"Is there a way to mute or a way to not see a certain seller in the search results? Some sellers flood my search results which I don't want to see. Please add a feature if I block, I wouldn't see that blocked seller im my search. A new feature like if we can know if I dealt with the buyer/seller in the past or not would be cool.",5
67,The app doesn't even work right,1
68,I like it just people are tight just stick to your price,5
69,This app used to be good back in the days before you added all the extra ads into the results. Sometimes you click on a picture thinking it's a local listing and you are redirected to a website. The fact that you also added video ads it's ridiculous. Is it bad enough that it's filled with ads already and now you add video advertisements that you cannot skip until the video is over. You have never added the listing prices on the results which makes me not want to search anything,1
70,awesome üëå,5
71,easy to post items for sale super easy to look for items for sale.,4
72,I love OfferUp!.. I found the car that I wanted and the car is in great condition!!..And The owners were very nice and honest üíØ.. My experience was great üíØ,5
73,Has a setting to show local-only listings. Doesn't work.,2
74,"Disappointed by how many ads I see that are of immodest women. Like women with tights, or with form fitting clothes. It's really annoying how often they are shown. I'm a clean minded man and I understand if there was maybe one ad out of ten times I shopped on offer up, but I see these ads every time I shop. Multiple time too. Very annoying and I wish they would be removed. Remove the ads and 5 stars because the app works good. Thank you.",2
75,Back at 1 ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
76,used to be a good app but now all i get is notifications of things i may be interested (which i'm really not) and no message notifications at all from things that i'm selling. i only find out because i open the app to see what notification i just got. plus most if my items got sold on facebook marketplace or even craigslist. lately this app is a waste of my breath.,1
77,so easy to use,5
78,love the free stuff.,5
79,This place fu.... sucks they locked my account cause I made 4 purchases they said my shopping habits wasn't normal activity so just locked me out and for the 4 items I never received because I couldn't communicate with the sellers that were sending me the items I had already purchased. Also worst customer service since I never got a reason as to why my account was locked beside the botnet messenger telling me i reached my buying limits,1
80,"I've been scouring the app for good deals and almost all the deals I find when I go to talk to the seller they tell me they want triple what they asked for on the selling price. Please be careful. Also alot of the ""free"" items are just items they want payment for but aren't willing to be honest.",1
81,"This app used to be great, but now the experience is so painful. It's chock full of ads. To promote items you sell you have to pay $$$ per item per day. Would rather go back to Craigslist and eBay.",2
82,easy an simple to use this app...,5
83,too many addicts,3
84,"Used to be good, but now full of adds, irrelevant suggestions, and a very flaky seller community. 2000's craigslist was more reliable and safe.",1
85,"Predatory promos & scam deals. OfferUp ""offered"" me a 3 day free trial promo & said I'd be charged if I did not cancel within the 3 days. They charged me the SAME day I agreed to the promo & absolutely refuse to refund me. I've taken my listings down & canceled my account. I've moved my listings to another app that doesn‚Äôt prey on their customers. Update: I was instructed to email them and I'd recieve help/better care. All they did was email me to confirm account closed. NO help with refund.",1
86,Drives me nuts with seeing things for sale and not the price on it before I click and open Link... .,3
87,Like offer up as a place to buy and sell things a lot more than the other's. That's why I pay for promote. Because I feel that they got the together pretty well. And it has people that need money for there over head. Thanks for being the number 1 buying & selling app for locals & my self .,5
88,Can't use VPN. Womp womp,3
89,I like the stuff that people selling their stuff,5
90,I sold something they made me a label and I sent it out I accidentally mailed out the wrong item instead of giving the buyer a label to send it back to me they refunded him told him to keep the item I sent him which was worth alot more then what he was supposed to get them they took me off the platform and haven't responded to me since. They are thieves. Sale at your own risk,1
91,‚òÆÔ∏èüåûü•≥,4
92,"Annoying people on here who don't seem to read at all. I'd rather sell by word of mouth, Facebook marketplace, or even craiglist.",1
93,"My previous review was 2 stars for burying new listings. Now ALL listings are buried under the sea of scammers and businesses. Please add a feature that allows us to weed out all of these listings. If I wanted to pay retail, I WOULD NOT BE SHOPPING ON OFFER UP. AND even blocking these swindlers does not remove their listings from search results. This is ruining the platform. It's becoming more trouble than it's worth. And it seems to be the same with anything I search these days. :/",1
94,The share feature seems to not be functional at the moment,5
95,Enjoy finding items with this app,5
96,nobody ever responds to my questions I have been unable to purchase about 10 items now due to buyers not responding.,2
97,There are way too many ads on this app. It takes me forever to find items that are being sold by an actual person.,2
98,Great guy to buy from. Responsible prompt and professional.,5
99,Zero stars,1
100,they have a lot of good items cheap!Check offer up out.,5
101,You have to pay to post now. Even if it's a free item. So weird.,1
102,Garbage app. Difficult to navigate now. I used to buy and sell on this app all the time. I could even deal with the ads. Deal breaker is now you can't search by category as before. Absolutely deleting this app. I'll use FB marketplace instead.,1
103,"I don't want your notifications about ""this week's challenge"".. I don't know or care what that is. I shouldn't be getting any notifications unless it is regarding a listing. There's also no categories so I can turn this type of notification off. Reporting your app to the application store for unnecessary spam and refusing to allow me to choose which type of notifications I receive.",1
104,I like this app.,5
105,very good,5
106,this app is trash. enough with the pop-up ads,1
107,Hate it they deleted my account for cussing üòÇüòÇüíØ I give it a fat 0,1
108,"New update makes searches incredibly slow/laggy. I hate the fact that you cannot search past purchase history or deleted messages associated with purchase history. update 11/29/22: newer updates still laggy AF when clicking new search. Update 05/14/23 : it took six additional months, but lagginess has actually been fixed finally. Update 3/25/24: lowering another ‚≠ê for ads. Update 8/29/24: new search algorithm is terrible and provides unrelated results rather than actual search parameters.",1
109,love ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç,5
110,New update took away the ability to search my category or select category or by default change the sort order Ruined the program,1
111,Why my account being chared frequently without any activity from my side. I used the app for a month and it was not helpful in marketing. But I still get charged even while not using it,1
112,"Had to stop using. Full page pop up ads interfere with searches. About half of every page is click bait from Chinese company Temu. Ads are hard to distinguish from real listings because they are only slightly smaller than real listings and have sexual connotation (cleavage, tight body suits, etc). Try to search for local, pickup only items but still get listings from across the country. Local businesses (mostly selling tools or cell phones) list hundreds of listings basically for the same stuff",2
113,To many unwanted advertisement..Iinterfers with the shopping purpose .,2
114,Ok these updates get worst ever time now you have to go into the search just to select a catagory? Not only that now i cant even search within that catagory cause it wants to just do a whole new search. Now i cant go to cars and trucks catagory and search for car with blown head gaskets cause its just shoing me headgaskets 5 miles away instead of actual cars where the distance peramiters are way different then just 5 to 30 miles away compared to 25 minimum to over 200 miles for CARS AND TRUCKS,2
115,"this app is trash. do not recommend unless you want to get scammed. developers allow and ENCOURAGE scammers to post on here, then use the stereotypical ""please email us, we're SO concerned"" response. We even did an entire livestream PROVING these developers are scammers. DO NOT USE unless you want to get SCAMMED. Reported to google Play as well for allowing scams. Look at ""MOST RECENT"" reviews and you will see they are scammers, proving my point. Developers like this need to be BANNED.",1
116,newest feature is all searches result in pretty much random listings. Meaning you cannot search for a specific car. And nobody can search for your car. Pretty bad move.,1
117,Useful app but annoying ads. New search functionality is terrible. Their implementation of targeted listings is terrible. I want to always see latest posted not what you think I want to see. Garbage.,1
118,love it,5
119,New Update Has Removed The Tab for Categories which is essential for searching items most users misplaced when listing their items,2
120,Great app easy to use,5
121,difficult to navigate.. trying to edit a listing is challenging..,3
122,the old OfferUp was so much better ever since they merged they've completely effed up this app,1
123,"""Notifications"" should not include automated (and unrequested) search results for something it ""thinks"" I'm interested in. I don't search anything in here (and I hesitate clicking on any item) simply because I know I'll be bombarded with marketing and user-engagement attempts to get me to browse that thing more. Super annoying.",2
124,App keeps crashing picking photos. Reinstalled 3x still crashing,1
125,quality and value have declined as owners of OfferUp app make every decision to squeeze every dollar out and give less and less value to their users. I make 90% of my sales through Facebook marketplace and Craigslist now. Getting worse by the minute.,1
126,Let's me know what I'm facing gives me warning where I'm wrong at !üòÇ,5
127,My exhaust ad keeps being removed and the rules specific state it can be posted . I did email a reply 2 time's I'm selling exhaust only catalytic converters are prohibited they have none on it they are hollow core an and mine are not cats there called all flow test pipes,1
128,Good,5
129,"I love the app and that you can see the local items for sale, but most people don't respond and it's confusing why they would post items for sale and then not respond when they have an offer or mark the item as sold so they aren't bothered unnecessarily.. I'd like to rate it higher but I've not been able to purchase anything as of yet because I haven't received responses.",3
130,"Hello OU, This app could be one of the best for buying and selling items. However,  scrolling thru listings is an extremely frustrating process when over half of the listing are ridiculously old or the items have already been sold and the seller doesn't bother to remove the listing.   This is why Craigslist is better as they have listings that auto-expire after a pre-set time 3 weeks or a month and allows the seller to easily continually repost the same listing and keep it active until it sells",1
131,I love Offer up. They make it very easy to sell and post items. Offer up is definitely one of my favorites and they have been very good to me. Definitely recommend to anyone serious about buying and selling. Thank you offer up.,5
132,"Offerup Offered me to apply for a Business Account.They call me,i tell them we have to think about it. They Decide to close my account. I always follow their Policies on Sales.i noticed Offerup called me, before disabling my account. So i called them,They knew why I called. they said i violated their Policys because i posted my address on the description.They said the only way i could get my account back was if i Have a Business account. I feel Extorted and Screwed over. Horrible Experience",1
133,Awesome,3
134,flagging doesn't work efficiently And server speed is A bit slow Notifications don't work unless it's adds constantly lagging and double clicking on the shipping screen and I don't know why shipping is automatically enabled I don't want to ship any of my products constantly freezing with the loading overlay when I try to turn shipping off and I don't let it double click Post asked for help I get error 422 every single time I haven't sold anything yet probably because it's not very user-friendly,1
135,"Service fee is too high. And seriously, video ads? You're not being serious OfferUp, are you?",1
136,"Horrible design, deleted. It doesn't save any of the settings. I turn off all notifications except for messages, and it keeps sending me recommended items for sale. It won't save my preferred search distance. I don't want any item that has to be shipped from 4 states away, yet it keeps showing me items that would be 12+ hour drive to go pick up",1
137,Great so far.,4
138,"too many adds when I signed up 6 years ago, I loved the app. now not so much. bann the ads",2
139,no log out button link on your web based page anywhere. looks much better now,3
140,too many ads forcing people to pay premium,3
141,I offerUp alway fine what i need .,5
142,App will no longer load after years of use,1
143,Allows me to sell things easily!,5
144,All my listing were deleted no notifications and all allowed to be posted via rules page,1

148,"Yes, I know this app is what you make of it, but I will tell you the second time I tried to sell in this app, there are so many trolls that are like, hey, I want your stuff and then back out at the last second to try to keep you off the platform by giving you negative experiences that it just makes me distrust people, to the point where I'd rather not sell to anyone and just donate it to my Catholic charity.",3
149,"Love it but after 2mins of scrolling, it lags so much. I've tried it on my computer and still get the same issue. Have to close and scroll as quickly as I can to get back to where I was.",3
150,Great app. Easy to use!!!,5
151,I wish you could the items show larger in the pictures,4
152,"Horrible app. I unsubscibed a few weeks ago and yet somehow, they still charged me. I need that $20 back and they have a no refund policy, I don't even sell on this app because nobody buys on there. My items sell elsewhere much more. Take your business elsewhere. They charge your card Even tho you unsubscribe. Mercari and poshmark is better. I would give 0 stars if I could.",1
153,I have brought3 trucks in one car off of here with no issue,5
154,Why is there not an option to DELETE listings instead of archiving them?! This is the only selling app I know of that doesn't allow this...,3
155,"Saying I have to pay fees? Also says I have to update, but there is no update. The worst part is I can't contact anyone for help.",1

158,"Great, it's awesome site",5
159,Edit: Way to many fruity ads! If it persists I'll delete it!,3
160,I don't like that you can't delete the ads. other than that it's good,3
161,the ads suck. you should offer free trials to view the ads,2
162,I do not like the constant alerts regarding your products and job offers.,1
163,video ad popups are the worst Edit: There is no reason to contact. I have been a user of offer up for years and have even paid for advertisment and premium accounts. I know you need to make money to continue providing the service but you already have ads all over the place and that's fine and subscriptions for that. Having video ads while browsing is a BIG no no. Sorry,1
164,"It used to be good, now is trash. Those pop-up ads are annoying.",1
165,"Good, understandable.",4
166,This never would be like LETGO. Its not accurate in many ways.,1
167,Revised review. Was just frauded and on offerup when you don't accept and don't review you should be able to get your money back..not so..even the seller admitted to not send item I purchased and I should get my refund yet I'm being given the run around and not given my refund when I never received the item I paid for. Beware fraud is rampant and customer service is non-existent,1
168,you guys are awesome! simple connections to finds! or sell your items! instead of filling up the land! wonderful idea! keep up the good work üëè Lisa,5
169,"Repeat repeat repeat Every time you leave to check other things when you come back tO offerup you have punch in your parameters again price range, distance, very annoying.. Ads are very intrusive.",1
170,"They removed the info that allows you to see how long ago something was posted. Also, now there's ads that pop up out of nowhere",2
171,Sucks very hard to cancel,1
172,Why do I want it ... Never did never will DL IT,1
173,"This app used to be good, every time I sell something they say that the customer has two days to check the item, and if the customer says that the item is damaged they take the person words, probably without asking for proof, and some time the customer say that they have been already charged but I never get the money.",1
174,Bad.,1
175,Offerup Sucks.,1
176,I gave beautiful clothing some brand new about 12 items and got 9 dollars. They sold 1 dress for 44 dollars. Shameful,1
177,Great app,5
178,My account keeps getting hacked. Other than that I love offer up.,5
179,They pick and choose who they allow to post on their site,1
180,"It would be super convenient, the idea is good... but I have written to more than 6 people who sell items and I have been waiting for a week for them to answer, Nobody answers... so it doesn't make sense",2
181,This app just got worse. It's search engine is horribly in accurate. Pretty sure it's been hacked.,1
182,Horrible I prefer marketplace on Craigslist,1
183,Great for buying things to save money and great for selling also when you need to get rid of some things or need money,5
184,The app will not let you use it with a VPN on. Don't waste your time. There's plenty of buy/sell apps that don't restrict your safety.,1
185,love posting,4
186,Great way to sell your unwanted stuff. so far good experiences.,5
187,Works as it should.,3
188,I actually actually bought my last car from here. It was easy and smooth transaction. I like this app.,5
189,"Things can certainly be posted with some pictures, but any selling that occurs seems to be purely by chance/luck bec they give those who already have money priority.",2
190,I think you guys are thieves and desperate to get money.I received a pop up saying try offering premium for 3 day free . So I tried it and 2 hours later I looked at my account and I was being charged.,1
191,You're all trash for putting forced ads üòí you guys are going to have a special place you know where.,1
192,have some real buyers and they don't mind meeting in person,4
193,Have not tried selling. But 7m sure it's easy,4
194,"love this site, unfortunately my wife and wallet do not...LOL",5
195,Much success finding rare items and also selling them!,5
196,Sold items and offer up refuses to release my money. It's been more than the 2 days that the seller is allowed to inspect the item. They inspected it and said all was good. This company is a scam,1
197,I want to manage my listings from my desktop pc. I hate being forced to use my phone to compose text.,3
198,I absolutely love this site.... great deals.... all the time!!! preciateit,5
199,Dope app,5
200,Dead app. INTRUSIVE ADS. No one posting. Intrusive ads make it annoying to browse. Fb marketplace better alternative which is sad to recommend fb.,1
201,haven't had much luck yet... maybe you have to spend money to offer up in order to have luck,3
202,"Offerup will spam your device/account with notifications, even with turning notifications off. After bringing this issue up with support, they have failed to offer any solution beyond making sure the notification settings are turned off. This is incompetent behavior. The problem persists with their site on desktop as well. This rating is more a reflection of their inability to fix their issues and repeat the same advice despite being told it doesnt help.",1
203,"Every 18 posts there's an ad, and every so many times you view a post, you get a video ad. This has become annoying as hell.... I understand ads pay some bills, but g'damn, too many. I rather watch infomercial if I want ads. This is ridiculous.",2
204,great app,5
205,"Their billing is deceiving. Listing an item for sale using promote plus auto enrollees you into auto payments, they offer no refunds whatsoever even after contacting them within an hr of the new months payment says I already pre paid for the whole month. The item listed seemed to get little traction, which i don't blame on offerup but I received 90% more inquiries on Facebook marketplace.",1
206,"shadowblocked me after posting a car, tried archiving it and reposting it would not list until I paid $7.99 for a second car even though it was the same ad.",1
207,I sold an item but faced a lot of problems with shipping. I received an email with shipping QR code but it was broken and could not be viewed. Didn't get any help from support either.,1
208,"Too many ads, scammers and listings of vehicles for sale, if i wanted to buy a vehicle would go to damn dealership. If you try and search for something, it mostly shows items from far away that need to be shipped.",1
209,Everyone want a bargain and change there mind after my deal exchange for their bargain.,3
210,Pretty good platform and easy to navigate,4
211,no longer what it used to be.,1
212,Had 1 listing on here for 2 months no views at all. Then they gave me a email recently saying my account violated the community guidelines?? They deleted the account. TBH I was about to delete it because I wasn't even getting views anyways. Just use Craigslist or maybe Facebook marketplace but I don't like FB.,1
213,I have sold a few things through this app. It is useful and doesn't take long to sell quality items. It has a good variety for the purchaser.,5
214,I love it so much,5
215,more listing formating w be nice,3
216,Software was not compatible with my 2 year old phone ü§≥ so NO way to connect with offers üò≠,1
217,Terrible app now ads every other click I'd recommend any other app but this one,1
218,It sucks,1
219,"Started placing ads whenever you tried to back out of listings, idiotic move.",1
220,awesome üëå,5
221,Careful if you get a call and don't pay for the business service they offer you they will delete all you're adds. Business account $500 and up a month,2
222,"Once good app has been destroyed by aimless devs. The search function is completely broken. Search results are just a random selection of things that OfferUp thinks you want see, but they're wrong. I only want to see what I searched for. Go back to only populating the search with matching titles and keywords. I contacted customer service, but they weren't helpful at all. Could be a 5 star app again if they go back to the way it was.",2
223,"Had a listing posted for a little over a week when suddenly I got an email that I was perma-banned for violating terms and conditions. I read through and cannot find the condition I could have possibly broken. Emailing about anything gets no response as it seems they don't have anyone monitoring anything, just bots. Was looking forward to utilizing this platform, but they have decided that will not be an option. Users beware. Seems they have no problem banning accounts without reason.",1
224,Too many hostage ads (have to exit the app to get rid of the ad). So frustrating!,3
225,the App is great. 90% of my experience has been positive.,4
226,Now you charging to post each. Uh why do that? We're all are just going to go to marketplace. Bad move. It's just going to hurt the company if you're not feeling the effects already... Mm,1
227,Love it,5
228,"They stole my Money üí∞ even though my buyer got her items, scammed by OfferUf",1
229,Awesome App,5
230,so Usefull,5
231,never been disappointed with any buy. best app ever!,5
232,everything that everyone wants or needs,5
233,"Worst of all the selling platforms with ads. GTFOH. Need ""ship on your own"" option where it lets you add your own tracking number like all the other selling platforms. Don't bother.",1
234,nice app.,5
235,Keeps sending notifications with stuff it has nothing to do with me,2
236,Best App Too Get Your Quick Money Fix...On Folks Nem Grave. Se Yeuueueue,5
237,"awesome deals,save money on many items,can find a lot of what you're looking for in one place",5
238,Charges your card without authorization and lies about what you had listed for sale n lies about things sold that you never listed or even owned! Lose app n find other local sales apps,1
239,Just a bunch of ads and bot accounts now. Just use fb marketplace,1
240,everything is priced perfectly and the customer works with the owners.,5
241,This App is very laggy and slow!,1
242,this app used to be the best. now with all the adds it has become a little ridiculous. I get it but still has made it slower and more frustrating.,3
243,"Has some of the most annoying ads any app can have. Until I can find something better, will continue to use, but use as last resort to sell.",2
244,"i block a user, and i still see their junk. do i have to purchase premium? this is crazy!",3
245,It was a great app until they decided to ad video ads every time u look at a post,1
246,"It was 3 stars, but the ads are so bad! I'll be looking for something, then I'll get one of those ads that requires you to restart the app, and I'll just close it instead and go to fb marketplace",1
247,Best go-to app if you're tryna make some extra money for whatever you need it for!!,5
248,"The filters are horrible. I only buy locally. However when I try to apply local 5 mile filter range, somehow they still show sales 2000 miles away. I don't want to buy items that need to be shipped. I want to meet my seller face to face and buy my items near me. Please fix your filter problem",3
249,great app,5
250,I like the deals and the ability to post items for sale. The app does send notifications of items that don't stick to what you placed in your search which causes you to browse through many unwanted items to get to what you are looking to find.,4
251,Offerup has gone downhill. After a recent update it plays unskippable ads after every message. Also it notifies you of suggested items in your messages (cant be turned off). Despite years of using offerup I'll be switching to facebook marketplace like everyone else.,1
252,Good,5
253,"1) 2022: Got ripped off on a mower. Offerup erased the whole transaction. Made numerous attempts to contact OfferUp, all of which were ignored. Maybe the seller was one of their IT? 2) 2024 Gave Offerup another chance. It downloaded Pandora without my permission. This triggered cascade of invasion intrusions; a highjack. This is a clear violation of Google policy. 3) Offerup won't let you use a VPN! I felt like this played a role the highjack. This is too sketchy for me. On to FB MkPlc :(",1
254,Very friendly people. Helpful with getting it loaded. Needs a little work but I think it was a good deal. Thanks guys!,5
255,something went wrong message all the time,1
256,you can definitely find anything you want at a good price thankyou,5
257,Why would you put up with intrusive ads in a shopping app? They are just as bad as those free games. Don't waste your time with this app.,1
258,There are allot of ads now. Never used to have any.,4
259,It charge me$19.99 unauthorized and not giving me an option to request a refund. I have no items for sale why would I pay to boost nothing. Hackers are in control of offer up people.,1
260,"I can't even give it a two. They stole LETGO, so you only have one site, to go, to now. Whatever you post won't be purchased. You'll purchase a new phone, or lose the old phone, before it sells. You can buy, like 1 out of 60 times. 59 people won't answer messages, and then one day, you'll get a 3 day late response, to travel ALL THE WAY, to someone's house.. I guess sometimes, if they need to get high, they'll drive, to you, quickly. I don't know if that's a good thing or not. That's my opinion.",1
261,So many ads for what reason? Just use Facebook marketplace,1
262,I'm denied my camera,1
263,Awesome!,5
264,Good app. annoying ads,3
265,Got a temu add. Deleting app now,1
266,"People are trying to sell -Roblox- renders of vehicles on here as real vehicles, there should be a filter that doesn't allow such weird and obviously fake items",1
267,"Used to be a nice place to find stuff now it's all ads for Facebook, Amazon, and anything else that pays them enough. If you want local deals it will force you to look at all the shipping, drop seller, and ads before you find anything in your local range even if you pick it in the options and say no shipping it will always show the ads and shipping. First. No exception.",1
268,"This app is a big scam. I tried putting my stereo up for sale and i got only about 3 text messages asking for the stereo and all were scam numbers. And when I deleted and blocked this app, lo and behold, i get a message from a scam number asking about my stereo. App isnt worth the sht.",1
269,Love the app is great,4
270,unable to state my claim of innocent with scammers scamming me no reply from this app via email it's sad.,1

272,Itz koo 2 make a couple/few $$$$ n also 2 buy koo stuff for a couple/few $$$$(dependent solely on ur definition of a couple/few $$$$$ ofcourse).,5
273,Too many Temu ads that lock in.,4
274,"No help, no customer service",1
275,I've tried to buy something I love and no reply even though I can see they were active. How sad. Great shipping prices compared to others but what's the point if no response. üíî,2
276,"easy to use, and I'm often able to sell/gift items I no longer need.",5
277,I have not had any offers and when I had my sister do it it told her I was blocked and wouldn't allow her to make a offer,1
278,love this app,5
279,"I'd rate it zero if I could, can't even find shoes in my size anymore after their update as of 8/21/21",1
280,"The app itself I have no issues with besides... When you get the preview, I wish it would give me the price as well. My biggest issues with the app are the sellers! A few sellers became upset that I wanted to check out an item that I was going to pay $150.00 dollars! Most of the sellers it a hit or miss. So many people are so flaky these ...",4
281,cannot see responses to my post's,1

He told me after getting off the phone lf I changed my mind please contact him asap..When getting off the phone he had my address and phone number for the delivery today at 9am..At 8am mr. Adams text me while in my garage making space for the generator. The text read are we still on for 9am...I responded once I made it back into the house 30 minutes later YEP...He hasn't responded on this app or his phone since this 845..,1
288,People post things in in areas that shouldn't even be posting to me you guys just let him do it it's frustrating and trying to look for something specific you can't go to that you got to go through all these f****** other ones before you can even find me you're looking for if you can find it again I don't read and write and you make it very hard,2
289,Slow,1
290,whatever your looking for it's here no doubt,5
291,"Continues to charge on a ""promote plus"" even if you archive them item. There is no way to delete a posted item besides marking as sold, which it asks you not to do unless the item is sold.",1
292,got what I needed! quick and easy !,5
293,"It's not a terrible platform, but it is by far one of the worst of the reselling platforms out there. I don't know how this decision got made, but someone decided it's better to not show the price alongside the image when you search for products, until you tap on the product. This forces you to jump through more menus, and prompts more ads to pop up on your screen, as you are forced to tap through more and more listings. Not only is this a waste of time, it genuinely ruins analytics for sellers.",2
294,I tried to sell my van and was told it would cost $20 to repost it since I had taken it down. I dont own a dealership,1
295,"Recent pop up ads are very annoying. There's no way developers accidently put them in there. If you want people to use your app, maybe make it so they can use it without being interrupted while browsing for items every 5 minutes. Great way to lose users.",1
296,How do I demand a refund from offer up that I did not authorized. I would my refund of a 8.99 back from who ever took it from offer up. Did not agree or authorize it.,1
297,Great app,4
298,"They don't care about any customer's reports at all. bought some electronics from a guy with great rating, thought there would be no problems. Turns out device wasn't working right. Seller stopped responding. Tried to report him - got only automated respk se that my report received. Month later checking him - his rating is even better then before... Zero Customer Support",1

306,"Exceptional App for locating the MOST cost effective Bang for my BUCK, US Currency! Kudos to OfferUp!",5
307,Everytime an AD takes over my screen I leave and go to ebay or Facebook market. The app is good for about 5 minutes of my time and then I have to leave. Like many others probably do.,1
308,"Used for years, but now that there's forced ads, I've un-installed and switched to marketplace.",2
309,Good,5

322,does anyone shop here anymore.,1
323,It hasn't posted my listing since the 17th of august!! I'm mad!!,1
324,4 stars because I like the app but I dislike the lack of features. Can we please have the option to send more pictures and videos in the app? Or to at least upload a video to our listed items? Update: I just sent an email with a list of recommended upgrades that I'm sure users would love. It would definitely drive more people to the app and make them want to use its features.,4
325,good,5
326,People frequently don't reply. Still have good ratings. No way to rate someone unless you buy or sell with them.,3
327,do not like the apps popping up,4

329,best place to find something that you need for the best price. you don't need to pay fees like ebay.,5
330,"Too many ads, impossible to use",1
331,I'm so annoyed and frustrated that I keep getting recommendation messages in my inbox when I've disabled these notifications. The only messages I want to recieve are for my own posts.,2
332,It's forcing you to pay to receive messages. When I made an offer on item That include shipping and the shipping coast On the saler account The seller accepted my offer And then told me he can't ship the item after the money is gone. After long text messages between me and the saler. I have screenshots for it. I complain to the support it was zero response other than automated Messages and then they Deactivated my account for asking for my money,1
333,"App developers are aggressively antagonistic to its customers by hiding any references to how to cancel its promotion subscriptions. They make it infinitely easy to sign up, and infinitely difficult to cancel despite making it seem as if it is easy to cancel, by saying ""automatically renews, cancel anytime"", because they hide the cancellation option instead of making it a prominent tab feature like they do for everything else. By hiding it, they lie to customers when they say, ""cancel anytime.""",1
334,"0 Stars!!! This is the worst app I have ever used. This app is full if scams and people who don't respond, if you report it, nothing happens. There are more buy/sell apps that actually work and care about customer safety, this one does not!",1

I've offered to pay $50 more than the price they listed so they would get more money after Offerup takes their cut of the pay, and they all refuse and only want payment off the app where my purchase is not protected. Offerup needs to completely block phrases like ""Paypal, Pay. Pal, Cashapp, Ca$happ,"" etc. There are so many scams",2

345,"Full page, unskipable ads",1
346,it's good,5
347,Great,5
348,This is the worst app on the play store. Not only does it not work they have no support to fix any problems. Even though it shows that a message was sent to a buyer the buyer. Ever recieves the message you sent about their post. If the buyer marks sold on the post you messaged about that he didn't get you will get a notification that it was sold. If you buy now from a item from a seller it says it didn't go thru and to contact support support but you get a notification it went thru. No support.,1
349,"The app is super slow, and my God how many temu ads can you run on there????? Still don't allow ""looking for"" posts which is stupid... and you can't delete old posts you made just archive them, even if you don't have the item anymore. I don't like seeing other things for sale in different states or ebay listings on the main page.

358,I don't really like the pop-up ads. very annoying üòí üôÑ. please get rid of the ads,2

413,I used to love offerup but the ads are insane now. You get straight full screen ads that you have to wait before hitting the X on the top. I've switched over to Facebook Marketplace. Much better.,2
414,"The ads they added a year or so ago are super annoying. Also, I wish that the default view was pickup instead of having to change it every time",3
415,üëç,5
416,better than Facebook marketplace.,5
417,Have to pay to get messages,1
418,I sold some through them and I never received my money,1
419,Everytime I'm looking at something it blacks out,1
420,"Buyers are flakes. Wasted time and gas for meetups that never happened. Here's an idea, option to go membership route. Still offer the free but member sellers and member buyers will be charged for flaking out. Maybe have a cancel feature an hour before meetup without charge. The flaker will pay an amount to the flakee (person that showed up).",3
421,I've downloaded OfferUp in order to find a suitable replacement for a vehicle that was unfortunately totalled. This car was being used by my grandson to attend college. What I've found is many of the vehicles listed are not quite on the up and up. And some are listed by 3 or 4 different people in different cities.,3
422,In the past several years that offer up has merged with let go I have only been able to sell one thing on OfferUp in years but when I was using let go when it was in its own independent company I was able to sell many things very quickly on letgo and now that I am forced to use OfferUp I've been unable to sell anything for years because no one uses this app,1
423,"I have had nothing but positive interactions in this app . But use common sense,if it sounds too good to be true,it usually is",5
424,Not seller friendly.,2
425,"New to offer Up, posted one item and sold in three days. Woo-Hoo Great communication with buyers. Looks like I will be posting more items! Thank you Offer Up",5
426,app doesn't ring or show me notifications unless I open it and check my inbox,1
427,"easy to use, things sell pretty quick and most of all there are no stupid rules you get kicked off the app like mercurial. Offerup is my choice to use. JC",5
428,I bought a car that was nothing as described,2
429,"This app has gone bad to worse in terms of functionality. Also, too many scammers and time wasters on this app.",1
430,I'm new to OfferUp. I got lost in Temu ads and had a hard time finding my way back to what I was viewing.,4
431,Letgo was great. This kinda killed it.,2
432,modern CL,5
433,you shouldn't have to pay just to get responses from people that have already contacted you.,1
434,Used to love this app. Now every ad force installs app on your device. Do not download,1
435,Prices removed from the search results. You have to tap every item to see it's price. Ridiculously bad design.,1
436,"Used to be great. Now occasionally, I get ads that I cannot close without clicking on. The second I click on it, it tries to install some bs app.",1
437,Still observing the app and the developer Right now I don't know what to think ?,4
438,"May be the most trusted out there so far, but way too manny ads. This ads are worse than the invasion of UFO if some day become true... i think the reality are them, AI response made me balance from 5 stars to 3 wish i can split it in half but i cant.",3
439,This app needs better AI capabilities,5
440,It's a great selling.app I wish they had more free options as well,5
441,"Be careful what you tap on. Once you view a post your ""feed"" will become filled with nothing but ads for that product. I tapped on a mower and a fridge and suddenly that's all I see now. I'll return to Craigslist where I can just see what's new without bias. Also, as with any online marketplace getting a response from a seller is nearly impossible. I don't even know why they lost items. Offerup doesn't offer any way to help with this. Complete waste of an app.",1
442,Nice,5
443,I've only had positive experiences so far from the app. It's easy to use and I will keep using it for bargains,4
444,"In regards to uploading pictures, you can't go into folders that you have established in your photo gallery. That really sucks cuz I have a folder of all the pictures of the car I want to sell. But noooo I have to give myself glaucoma by scrolling nd scrolling.",1

451,"Their policy's are trash. It's worse than the old Craigslist and just as bad as Facebook marketplace. If you give them low score they expect you to waste more of you time emailing their social media department. If I could ,I would rate them 0 stars",1
452,It is a great app to buy some car stereo. Or anything you need. I consider you trying. Have a awesome day,5
453,"notifications are delayed and it would be nice to have prices posted on picture listings, and order not to have to click on everyone to get the price.",2
454,"Customer service is NON existent. What a shame, I used to love letgo. ""offer up"" has ruined it, I have been waiting to get paid for a shipping sale, when I have "" fast deposit "" and I can't get anyone to answer me or so anything.",2
455,yup,5
456,"I inadvertently hit the premium and tried to cancel literally within a minute and I was denied a refund. THEN, I had a very strange man inquiring about an item I am selling that wanted my name, address, phone number and email. After several exchanges, I realized he wasn't looking to purchase the item. You can guess what he was after. This app is filled with creeps and criminals AND the service sucks! Sell on FB marketplace or somewhere else. NOT WORTH IT!!",1
457,If I could give it less than one star I would. It offers a 3 day free trial and if you use it and then properly unsubscribed it still charges your account. Before they come back at me to email them I did and they said I already paid and will not be getting a refund. So I do not recommend this app. It is a scam!,1

465,quick and easy to use get results fast. I'm glad I choose offer up,5
466,"Just because am currently outside the USA, why can one not still use the app?",2
467,"At least in our area, this app is useless. I rarely ever get anyone to respond back if I express interest in an item for sale. There are so many old ads that have been up for over a year. Most people aren't even around anymore. The listings are the same things over and over and over. It's unfortunate because I'm sure this is a nice app but in my area, it's just a waste of time and energy",2
468,it's a great way to make extra money buy from people in your local area,5
469,"says i ""may be in danger of of policy violation"" ???? app blocked me from messaging people. i haven't broken any guidlines! i haven't copied and pasted or given/requested any personal info, and i have purchased maybe 5 things on here. I have a 5 star rating! my last message was literally ""deal. I'm available tomorrow if you can meet then?"". utter rubbish of an app. Edit: this app and company is still awful. Reviewing again in 2024, still trash",1
470,Funny,5
471,"Alot of scammers, thief, and criminal activities out of control and when you filed a formal report with police also with offer up customer support they don't really do anything . Therefore instead helping to monitor the platforms better all they did just remove the actual victim from the platforms and when you questioned why did they removed your account and they will only send you 1 simple messages ( you violated community guidelines and posting rules) and that will be the only one they give",1
472,Would give it zero Stars if I could,1
473,"Could you guys NOT limit ad views that aren't promoted? I've used OfferUp for years now and used to get 100+ views a day no matter what item I posted.. now, I'm lucky if I get 40 after the last update. Honestly, you aren't the only service to offer a selling platform and if things don't improve, I have no qualms about taking my business elsewhere and I'm sure there are more than enough people who feel the same way. Do better or watch your app slowly die. Choice is yours.",1

477,very good people on time good product fair price will buy from them again,5
478,awesome thanks,5
479,"Offer up is getting worse every day in many different aspects. I'm sorry to say but I felt like they don't like genuine people just go looking for deal got banned when there scamer and thugs, thief acount still hanging around to pray one person to the next. Whenever you reach out to customer support, there is almost nothing really fixed, but you might get banned instead. I hope there is someone who is higher up management can really look into this matter that has been going on for a while.",1
480,It's like impossible to unsubscribe to the subscription that I signed up for inadvertently I didn't even know I was subscribed. Why do all these online apps have to be so shiesty like that? Don't they make enough money honestly?,1
481,I keep trying to set a different price and to fix the location but it keeps coming up error update I've uninstalled and reinstalled five times and it keeps saying the same thing is this app isn't going to work w work then get rid of it I even have the auto update set and it won't update there is no update button reinstalled at 5 times and I can't fix my ADD cuz it says error update if this app is not going to update then get rid of it I want it fixed needsfixexd,1
482,I feel like people who trying to buy with checks are scammers they don't have cash app chime but want your email and other pictures of your items i think duplicate is the problem my views are going out of business now i bought have to take different photos,2
483,The deals that you find are on the up. this is the best place to find item's and the prices are fair.,5
484,good,5

500,response on products is horrible getting fake inquiries to check the account is difficult to get into to check payments,1
501,it's awful,2
502,To many adds,1

It's amazing that they can charge for you to promote stuff out but you can't even use the app. 100% garbage. And then when I try to send a report that says 429 can't even anyone,1
513,The best app that I use,5
514,Offer up is a app for you to sell your stuff ... not a store üòí.,1
515,safe and convenient,5

522,Cool idea just not used it my area.,4
523,"Overall I'm not pleased with this app. OfferUp limits you on how many listings you can post a month(EXTREMELY annoying)& User interface is not aesthetically pleasing. Ads sneak in sometimes too. I personally had a lot of problems fixing my account when I changed emails since I had stopped using OfferUp for years, but they keep your number on file so you have to go through their customer service (nonexistent back then). Was bummed when OfferUp bought Letgo since letgo was better.",2
524,"HORRIBLE. A lot of sellers don't respond or are dormant. And when did this app start allowing bidding? A lot of sellers only offer MAKE OFFER or ASK . So you bid on it and then you don't know if it was high enough or not. Wasting time waiting for a response that comes days later. Then when I choose to buy, I get a response saying I made a shipping offer instead. Sucks. This is basically eBay. UPDATE: I reached out to customer service twice and they could do nothing. All email contact too",1
525,Buying is great. Selling I'll rate it the lowest. I believe they stifle your sells unless you pay them and you item still may not sell. Untrustworthy üëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæ,1

548,- 2024 Update: It's increasingly more difficult to find local items because the ads for similar online items are literally half the feed now. Also now I'm getting full page ads that I can't close out of. Kind of my last straw...moving to FB marketplace. It was good here until it wasn't.,1

People shouldn't create apps if they can't run and maintain them properly.",1
610,"ads are fine, popup ads are not.",1
611,Truly üéÄ üéÄ Appreciate.,5
612,works as described üëå,5
613,ads,1
614,Banned my account for no reason and this ads are horrible,1
615,offer up was good but now it won't let me post it won't let me make a new account I don't understand why I emailed them and nothing also charging $8 a post if ridiculous,1
616,Looking for non dealership vehicles but keep getting those in my search.app.sucks,1
617,Could be a lil more organized,3
618,"Unskippable ads ruin the experience. Hard ""Uninstall"" from me.",2
619,Tried to mix craigslist and eBay. Sketchy eBay type support with sketchy Craigslist style meet ups. Stick to Facebook marketplace.,1
620,Very good.,5
621,good app for buying and selling your own items. I love it!,5
622,Unable to use safely with my server protection.,1
623,have not sold one thing and I have tried several times,1
624,"OfferUp is a great tool. We use it to clear out some of our inventory for our Amazon store. and we use ot for personal things we need from time to time! Have been on both the giving and receiving end of some great deals!! Thank you, OfferUp!",5
625,After using the app for a while I noticed that there more and more scammers on offer up and the worse thinng is when you report that to customer support they mostly don't do anything but turn around they might just block you because from what you seen and reported to them. There was never someone actually taken care with any response mostly just a very generic email send out with the same messages and repeatedly over and over. I would have never joined offer up If this is how they operate.,1
626,"uninstalling, I only going to be scammed once, thanks for nothing!",1
627,Great app,5
628,interesting where is anti monopoly commission üòï,1
629,Use to love this app until they added all the adds. Now I'd rather look on fb market place.,2
630,DJs can't advertise,1
631,"works good, love this app",5
632,There is no such thing as customer service on this app. Or for this company,1
633,"WARNING!!! If an app or website won't allow you to log in while using a VPN, then they can't be trusted. You don't need my EXACT LOCATION, my zip code should be more than enough.",1
634,Sellers don't honor their warranties and this app keeps them as clients,1
635,OfferUp is great !! Keep up the service,5
636,"Annoying ads. It's not just the background ads you have to avoid swiping by accident, it's the fact that the whole screen randomly gets held captive by an ad that won't go away unless you close the whole app. Annoying and not worth.",1
637,It's a Hassel having to open the post just to see how much the item is. They need to show it,2
638,"For every intrusive advertisement, you lose a sale.",1
639,Its turned into Temos ad section. lame,1
640,"Idiots , a Notification is not a message, that's why i got mine off .",2
641,"Subscription service is pure greed. You would think it would apply to your entire account, but no, they want you to pay for each posting. This app would be great if it wasnt for that. I understand everyone is out to make a buck, but there should be a limit to greed.",1
642,the place to go buy things or sell things,5
643,Awesome,5
644,Useless if you are in specific states! My first experience giving this app a try and attempting to make a purchase and I get a message that shipping is not supported to or from the state of Arkansas!!! Guess I'm uninstalling and can will look elsewhere.,1
645,"What the hell is the point of entering anything in the search field, when this app ignores it? Also, it keeps adding everything to alerts on it's own. Time to uninstall this.",1
646,phenomenal loved it,5
647,This marketplace is filled with scammers. Avoid it.,1
648,Not sure why you guys don't show the price with the pictures? Do you expect me to tap on every listing on there to get the price?,2
649,too many bots,2
650,I just don't like how they added ads,3
651,too many advertisements,4
652,"Do not subscribe, I was scammed by this app. You pay, but your item won't be listed.",1
653,Filled with people that don't answer messages. Most posts seem fake and after a couple of days the app will ask you to send a photo of your picture ID . They make you sign an agreement that you let them use all your personal information as they see fit ( including your personal address) Deleted immediately after that. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. PLEASE READ ALL THE USER AGREEMENTS.!!,1
654,"I used to love selling on Offer Up but lately, I've had nothing but issues. I can post the same item w/ only a different logo & 1 listing shipping is available & the next listing shipping is unavailable. It isn't against shipping policy, only weighs about 3 or 4oz, & can fit in a 4x6 Bubble Mailer or smaller. New valve stem caps for a tire. The inconsistencies are frustrating & already sold some. No other app has issues. New IOS, latest version of app & CS isn't helping, may have to quit selling",1
655,"Is this a bidding app??? I don't understand how it works, Sorry I really don't understand, Please let. me know,,",1
656,excellent,5
657,"Said free trial and then charged me for a month with no refund immediately. Never even got to use it because they want your license info. Seems like there are a lot of recent bad reviews. The bot says to email, but already did and I get the same auto reply I got the first time. They don't even have a real customer service team it seems. I thought maybe the reply to this review meant I could get somewhere, that was silly of me.",1
658,Beware. Lots of scammers on this app.,3
659,was good now there is a ad every 60 seconds,1
660,Just use the site on your web browser. You get fewer ads and you can actually see the listing date.,1
661,There is nothing wrong with the app and I would rate it 5 stars if it wasn't for the unskipable ads promoting fake mobile games. I think advertising mobile games like this is abhorrent and the fact that it's being promoted on well known platforms is disgusting in my opinion. I'm just getting sick of it.,2
662,I bought a Phatmoto 79cc.It was everything I expected and more.The people were great.,5
663,Worst selling app ever don't waste your time. Trying to sell something on there is impossible and they want to charge you for it when you can do it free on Facebook.,1
664,great buy from a great person recommend this person honest on the info of the product,5
665,if offer up can I have the option to send pictures like 5 miles app has that feature. thanks,5
666,simple app to use. many sellers and buyers in my area üòÉ,5
667,you can find anything and everything you could ever want at a reasonable price,5
668,"always been good, keep up the good work",5
669,Great app that's free to post,4
670,too many fake posts and not enough serious buyers,3
671,nice app,4
672,"This app won't let me cash out. I will NEVER use this to ship items again. I have a deposit account and it is telling me, I need one, even though I can see it RIGHT THERE.",1
673,I never get a response when I message a seller,1
674,love this app. store,5
675,Can't use on my laptop,1
676,"I'm disappointed in the location function of the app. I have all my settings set properly and I continue to get a screen saying the app can't establish my location. With items listed for sale and the app malfunctioning, it's useless to me.",3
677,This app is so slow....it used to be fast....not sure why it's so slow....I have it updated...there's no option to update it...probably will erase it for the slowness on the app only.....no its not my phone I only have 3 apps on here and I have a Samsung galaxy.....it's definitely the app!!,1
678,this is a real good app to buy and sell things on I really like it,5
679,This app is garbage. 9 out of 10 listing's are scams. They do zero to combat the scams because I have reported scams and the listing's are still active. Don't trust your personal info on an app that clearly provides a platform for thieves and con artist to thrive.,1
680,This app has seriously gone downhill.. nobody buys anything off this app anymore.. this app is outdated and not used really.. this is more for advertising than actual selling..,1
681,freezes constantly. switches from for sale to jobs without prompting. doesn't respond. it's almost impossible to use and makes my entire phone crash. fix your app please.,1
682,I had very lil activity.. I don't think i t was over priced .that may be my opinion. the few people that did inquire seemed to be scamming.. the trust levels on both parties seem sketchy.. I felt I was held to get a monthly charge of $21.00 out of me. had I sold it here or got more serious inquiries I wouldn't mind paying that fee. I don't have enough products posted to pay a monthly fee. I'll probably just be on the buying side because the seller side didn't work for me.,1
683,Dont Work! Seems Kinda useless! Also shifted the promoction? Also charging me for time long after i canceld!,1
684,Awesome üòéüíØ,5
685,Downloading OfferUp is analogous to narcissistic abuse! 2 Thumbs DOOOOWWWWWWWNNNNN,1
686,To be honest with you I'm going to purchase a vehicle and then I will uninstall this app thank you no more questions,4
687,DOING GOOD,5
688,Cant even sell a car for free anymore,1
689,App won't accept my debit card so I can't even ship items except for cash which makes the app completely useless to me.,1
690,to many adds all over the place especially from Google.,1
691,"My listings get no views. I try buying items from other sellers using ""buy now,"" but an offer is sent instead of an instant transaction, and sellers never accept the offer. I try messaging sellers, but I get no replies. This app has been a huge waste of my time.",1
692,"I've posted several offers to purchase and a question, and no one ever contats me back. I'm thinking this app is bogus and exists to glean your info and try to illicit your compliance to scam you? This app is a scam!!!",1
693,most people don't answer,2
694,obnoxious ads and messaging system is subpar at best.,2
695,"This app is a SCAM. As a buyer, they take most of your sale. As a buyer, you're worse off. They have extremely deceptive policies. Once you purchase an item, there is NO WAY to cancel your purchase, even before it ships, even if the seller is inactive. It states on your receipt that it gives the seller 3 days to ship before they issue a refund, but that is a LIE. It's 7 days and you just have to wait to see if you will get your item. I have reported them to the BBB, the FCC and NCC. Buyer beware",1
696,"It used to be a good platform to sell. Now, if you do not pay the premium, it doesn't sell, and worse yet, the ads when your browsing items for sale. I stopped browsing as frequent and stopped posting will probably uninstall soon.",1
697,Sucks that you have to pay to sell stuff now,1
698,Be aware of fake items! Offerup does nothing about it when you find it you got a fake item.,1
699,no one ever responds,1
700,"App is worthless. I typed in several key words for searches. Nothing obscure, and I have a search radius set up. It doesn't matter what you are looking for, there might be a few ads pertaining to your search amongst a sea of ads for anything and everything. If by chance you find exactly what you're looking for it's 100s of miles away.",1
701,It's the best way to find what your looking for hands down,5
702,great app,5
703,It is glitchy and full of ads...,1
704,the seller was very pleasant to item was very well presented,5
705,I can't take pic how do I unable the camera,5
706,good app,5
707,"They tell you one thing, and then they switched it up. Even when you have physical proof of what they had said. I would recommend other apps before using OfferUp, unfortunately. Update 7/31/24: The statement still stands true. I've sent them an email 1 week ago today at the email they provided, and they never responded back. Be wise and pick another app to sell or buy stuff.",1
708,8 z,2
709,good investor,5
710,Said 3 day free trial. Charged me on day 2. Shady.,1
711,Why all of a sudden it won't load the description of an ad up so you can read it but the stupid ads under it load up.I have tried clearing the cache and even uninstalled it but hasn't fixed it so annoying( update they fixed it I have been in contact back and forth and they stayed on it so no longer have that issue thanks ),5
712,I am able to sale and get a great deal. I love this app.,5
713,offer up is like an addiction for me especially the tree stuff . Everything at anyone's finger tips. it's easy to navigate around the app and the people are always polite and never had a complaint about any thing I had bought or got for free. oh and it actually saves me gas which saves me money offer up thank you,5
714,great app. just wish it had a translation button,5
715,"Log in is so damn waste of time and such a run around , I gave up just trying to log in to use the app , should be minus one star",1
716,I'm a fan for the savings,5
717,Nothing sells,1
718,I liked this app best for its exact searches. Now it's keeps pushing items that are nowhere close to what I'm looking for and it hides what I searched amongst the bs. I'm over it.,1
719,It's a great tool for trading items around,4
720,great app for buying and selling items recommended many,5
721,It's still just bots and you still can't block their posts. Full page ads every few minutes. Garbage app.,1
722,They redid how they search and it is now garbage. You can't search specific things and get specific corresponding results. Now I can't find things that I want. I'm uninstalling it. It is no longer useful for me.,1
723,super slow not enough serious buyers lots of tire kickers.,1
724,Better than eBay!,5
725,Awesome App to buy and sell. It's a must for anyone in a small business or just selling items. I highly recommend.,5
726,"great personality, item better than expected and good price",5
727,if you need it it's probably on here,5
728,"Offer Up is a great idea, and the app should be a helpful tool to buy items, but the app design is absolutely terrible, and the website is no better. It is ridiculously confusing to find saved items (if they are even anywhere to be found!), and the search results are so filled with ads that you don't even know where your true matches are. The design is so bad that I have given up on this site numerous times and went elsewhere to find what I needed.",1
729,Just a nice simple app to use!,5
730,"Whereas every single other company will work with you, I accidentally canceled my free trial a single day late and they refuse to refund me the 20$ for the whole next month. I have never encountered another company that works that way. Also, it doesn't even seem to be helping to promote my post",1
731,"Disgusting how much it has changed now they want to make the category therefore if you sell clothes you can do so if you pay because your ""free posts"" are over. They already hasld so many adds on their search page. How much more money do they want? Pathetic",1
732,Uninstalled immediately after getting a forced ad. Gross tactics guys. Great app for look for cheap stuff but at the cost of getting slapped random ads. Skip on this one guys,1
733,Great app .. however really don't like now that they have mandatory ads unless you pay for the upgraded version,4
734,üëé,2
735,Deleted my account no explanation was my first purchase,1
736,it was much better as let go.. I saw so many sells and made a ton of money. I don't make money here.. Facebook marketplace has become better than this app..,1
737,"LISTEN. Bugs, ads, crashes. DO NOT INSTALL. FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE IS BETTER.",1
738,This a is dope app I have gotten all kinds of things from it that I need and at a great price and aside from that I have sold all kinds of stuff I didn't need or want anymore,5
739,made 2 purchases and both the seller did not have item,2
740,love the app. easy to use.,5
741,"The app is ok, could do better with search and sorting returns. This is no eBay, support is lacking, seller only respond half the time. No limits on how long an item was listed or if it is still for sale. A lot if guess work. In need of better support interface and seller response time. I have sent messages to sellers and waited weeks or months without reply.",3
742,"Went to post on app after months and now it deletes my postings, says I didn't pay a fee. There was no fee showing to pay. It asked me if I wanted to do promotional marketing bt that was optional. So now it says I have wrong version, How? I downloaded what u have on playstore and it says I need the version ending in 5 and not the version ending in 2 which is what you all have posted. And what fee to post? Not showing and never did. So now it's a paid posting app? With different versions????",1
743,I hate the new update. It got so strict and so many false reports from a bot. Guess im moving to facebook marketplace.,1
744,Congrats... you've ruined the search engine,1
745,It's a bit buggy,3
746,Let go was better,1
747,"Update Jul 2024: still garbage, the local search still comes up with posts on the other side of the country. Do your job developers! Horrible Truly garbage. From the spam notices trying to get you to buy cheap Chinese garbage. To the fake notices claiming to have something you were previously looking for but not actually, to the millions of scammers, to the abandoned posts... This is truly one of the worst takes on a yard sale app.",1
748,"The app itself is great, but the way you guys started to incorporate adds really suck. I get that you have to make money, and advertisements are the best way to do that, but getting redirected to an add makes me want to not use the app. It doesn't make me want to pay for a membership. I think you should understand that most, if not all, the people on this app are looking for deals, not subscriptions.",3
749,I'm trying to get support assistance for some reason on the app you don't have any support to be able to help people when they're having an issuemy issue is I got flagged trying to give away my yard sale left over to anyone it's a free item why are you flagging me ? Please contact me to explain why I can't give away stuff when tons of people do it everyday??????,1
750,My descriptions for the items stopped loading after the most recent update (July 2024). This was after I cleared the cache and force stopped the app.,2
751,Great App!,5
752,UPDATE: This app is horrible at notifying me of messages in real-time. I got ONE notification that I had a message and when I opened the app I actually had FOUR missed messages saying that the buyer had arrived. By the time the notification came through she had already said she had to go...10 minutes before the app notified me! Definitely better to use the alternative selling apps. (Devs: I have messaged you several times about this problem over the last year and nothing has changed),1
753,Great web site,5
754,Love the app. Most sellers are pretty good.,5
755,Customer support never answers emails from customers with a question.,1
756,"Haven't used it yet, but getting it installed on my computer is a BIG challenge. app showed up on my phone but I want to use it on my computer at home. after I get it on my computer and am able to post something I will up grade the star ratings.",1
757,Need to make it easier to sell. stuff .,3
758,"Was a decent app until.... Here I've purchased and sold many things. The problem now is that I will NOT turn off my VPN for you. Obviously VPN is a service I purchased for a reason. I have an account, you know I'm in the US. If you continue to block me from your service I will uninstall this app and go somewhere else. Edit: I did end up uninstalling this app a while back and decided to try again today. Well, I'm still being blocked for using my VPN so I'm done with this app.",1
759,Remove the stupid ads,1
760,I love using offer up it helps me to sell and buy at a convenient option,4
761,"It would be better if you could see when the item was posted. I don't see that anywhere. If it's an old post and they forgot to remove it, I'm wasting my time. Other than that, I really like the app.",4
762,NOTHING BUT SCAMMERS! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS APP IS A JOKE. NOTHING BUT SCAMMERS ON HERE AND ASKING FOR YOUR PHONE NUMBER. UTTERLY A WASTE OF TIME! DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR,1
763,There are too many ads with adult content.,1
764,No it's just a lot of ads,3
765,great deals on this site,5
766,Ad after ad,1
767,"Great! Made the offer and got the car on the same day, just like my previous car last year. Messenger works well. Search is easy. Thanks!üòÄ",5
768,Very reliable app and the selection is pretty vast.,5
769,very good app it dose its job,5
770,"Uninstalled it, too many ads.",1
771,I need the number for customer support now!!! You had no authorization to take money from my bank account I'm gonna sue,1
772,"Offer up is useless. Whenever i post something i somehow get 100's of views but no offers. So i decided to drop the price to a ridiculous low price. I went from $400 to $50 and still no offers for weeks, but plenty of views. It makes no logical sense ANYONE who i know or on OfferUp would jump on a steal like that no doubt about it.Offer up sucks i with there was a better app where people actually see my items. Even if you promote your item you will get maybe 1 message a month even if its steal",1
773,Searching sucks. Notifications don't always work. It's easier to find what I want on a desktop web browser on the OfferUp website.,1
774,very patient,5
775,"It was a good app, when I searched for things it would give me what im looking for and organize them by certain criteria. Now when a search like a deps swimbait (a fishing lure) it's gives me random things that have the word depth in it. It's also very slow and people can't send pics of items to each other which leads to sending them through phone numbers, which offerup then warns us about doing.",2
776,The app should say how long ago they posted the item.,3
777,"Everytime I have an ad it makes me want to close the app instead of blindly scrolling to buy. Aka, spending less time on the app!!",3
778,Awesome response. All that I have purchased was good.,4
779,trash! even when you choose buy now the buyer never follows through and accepts. or ships the item. waste of time.,1
780,pop up ads get annoying,2
781,it's great thank you offer up.,5
782,"Great seller, Alex is quick to answer any questions.",5
783,It just takes people like almost a year to reply üôÑ,4
784,use this app over the years. I have always been happy with it.,5
785,"Re-purpose central! I find the deals by setting up ""Alerts"" for goods I am looking for and responding quickly. The ""Shopping Areas"" are easy to set and change by using Zip Codes. No phone numbers are used. It's against Offer Up policy. Negotiating is done online or after meeting with the seller. Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Help our planet, less in the landfill, and you can pay less for things you need or want. Happy shopping!",5
786,"what is wrong with Offer Up Lately is been very Laggy it's so Annoying, I'm sorry to say it like this, but I'm frustrated because I use it A lot.",2
787,downhill since they forced ads and especially let temu redirect you constantly,1
788,sold out for ads. can't just look for something you want without some add getting shoved in your face.,1
789,I've been able to sell things easier on here. the entire process is easy and feels safer to me than trying to sell something any other way.,5
790,App is trash nobody ever responds to offers.,1
791,to many ads people don't respond,1
792,Easy to use and I can usually find what I'm looking for in a snap at a good price,5
793,Too many scammers that want to buy outside of the app. Waste of time.,1
794,Great Service,5
795,good,5
796,üëã‚úåÔ∏è,5
797,good app you can find just about anything for sell.,5

799,I never get any messages things are overpriced I think it sucks,1

805,every purchase has been an ease.,5

807,Great resource.,5
808,STILL Horrible compared to letgo the only decent thing is international shipping but even then I cant even get anyone to reply this app is a nightmare with all of the inactive people on here the chat system deletes old chats ant that is a huge pain if this app can fix the inactive people problem and the fact that old chats delete after a certain amount of time then I'll consider using it. Also none of my listings from letgo nor my perfect 5 star reviews transferred onto here BRING LETGO BACK!,1
809,It's a scam want you to pay to advertise. Had multiple items for sale for weeks not even a message. Put them on FB sold within a week.,1
810,"Yes , the other day I needed a table and I found one real reasonable.... Do anything.I don't like about offer up.It doesn't take out, The advertisement of The old , That's been there for over several months a year or 228 months.. Once it's sold it should be taken out of the advertisement.. Of opera. But overall I do like it.Thank you",5
811,"Convenient , fair, and a very pleasant experience! No Hassell! Will recommend to Friends and Fam. totally! Thank You...",5
812,"Back to 1 star, devs don't care their app is complete trash. Ads have gotten out of control and no option to disable the recommended items that are completely irrelevant, after you've already purchased something you'll continue to be notified of the same item until you close your account and uninstall... That's the solution CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT AND UNINSTALL!",1
813,There are too many scamer and no real customer support . It's worse than before merge with let go. Customer support untrained makes people think the website more supported to scamer but not a regular people who just looking for deals. I would stay away if not necessary,1
814,"Great app...Pretty comical the prices on some of this stuff though... **EDIT**If you list an item at $0, then that means it's free. Put a price up or don't list it. It makes no sense at all.",3
815,Always giving up as of frD,5
816,Stupid,1
817,So far so good! I've only done business with people who know what they want.,4
818,"Great App Used it a few years back, sold a few items quickly . Had no problems here. üëç",5
819,People are incredibly nonresponsive,3
820,"One of the worst UIs, terrible UX. There's no decent excuse for a gallery of pictures with no visible prices when browsing ‚Äì unbelievable. With the number of people posting ""best offer"" there really needs to be an option for it because they clog up the feeds marking them as ""free"". It's just a frustrating and totally unfriendly interface.",2
821,awsom way to fined new interest,5
822,Not sure need more time to see if any of their items sale,3
823,"it's good , if more people would follow through the app it's self 4 üåü",4
824,I got a car and a TV on this site without any hassle,5

828,Great items at a good price.,5
829,Lots of options,5
830,I like it alot,5
831,"to whom it may concern makes things a lot more easy and more safer you get to meet some really good people,so who ever came out with this idea üí° is a very great genuine person with a bright idea üí°!",5
832,location. have to keep typing zip code,4
833,Amazing,5
834,Used to be free to sell and buy now. They want to charge for every post come on. Give me a break. Don't get it,1
835,I don't need it at all,5
836,Good,5
837,Very satisfied since using this app!,5
838,"Awesome app,easy to sell and buy.",4
839,"Posted brand new halloween mask, bout 8 of them.. all of them got denied. But yet women can sell used underwear 4 seckual reasons.. that is unhygienic. Plus the ads u have are 2 much, seriously! Gon uninstall again, gave this app a 2nd try and disappointed again.",1
840,"Had this app for a while, even used it successfully to buy and sell. After a while of not using it I opened the app to get and ad for some game. Immediately uninstalled. Too many apps that do the same thing to deal with ads and data mining.",1
841,üëç,5
842,no buyers. Just lots of annoying notifications,1
843,"I've only been on Offer up a short time but my experience has been very positive. Sellers have been nice and informative. Some getting back to me immediately and keeping me in the loop on what is going on. Items that have been sold, pricing and other helpful information. I may also be doing some selling myself here.",4
844,works well! A vacation/pause selling for x days would be great,5
845,Literally can't sell a single thing,5
846,I don't like how people say free then want you to bid,1
847,When the ads start it bugs out and can cause you to accidently approve install of unwanted apps. So trash.,1
848,It's been a great resource for selling and buying virtually anything you can think of.,5
849,Really bad offer up blocked my account after they offered me a service to pay $500 a month to post on there platform I denied there offer then they offered me a service for $250 a month and after denying they're service again they deleted my account I was posting on offerup since 2020 with 5 star rating since 2020 and just because me as a 5 start rated seller didn't want to pay a monthly service fee they blocked my account and deleted it. Stop being greedy offerup.,1
850,Don't download this up. You will start receiving Chinese ads. Pathetic,1
851,Horrible this would be better if I dolidnt get offered 80% lower price for everything,1
852,I've used this application for years and loved it.....something happened recently that you don't get shown what you are searching for. Another great app ruined.,1
853,Horror stories and many scams. The Offerup management know about the scams but are not willing to do anything about it. half the accounts are fake scammers accounts. a lot of the listings are old and the sellers don't respond or do not even accept the full price buy it now offer. I believe that they are fake listings just to make believe that there are a lot of good deals. I submitted many complaints but without any response.,1
854,"Put up several listings over a week ago, I have over 50 views on each but only received offers from two scammers.",1
855,Posted free puppies and you deleted the post so what I'm supposed to be stuck with dogs because I can't post them screw you your trash so is this state,1
856,LetGo used to be great. This app is just bombarded with ads and requires money to list an item. Don't waste your time.,1
857,good to find good and cheap stuff.,5
858,"Please bring back the FREE section! FB has several buy nothing groups & you can't compete without a FREE section that's obvious. Making us search & scour through a bunch of nonsense doesn't make you competitive. Also, you need to allow users to send photos & videos via Chat like Messenger since Marketplace has come in as a competitor. Sending photos is very helpful whole chatting.",4
859,best,5
860,was great until the pop up adds took over. now it's second or 3rd on my search list,3
861,"Sucks fix bugs I'm gonna delete if you don't fix you never get back to me. Your support team is lame just fix so I don't have to delete for good. Now I can't use my phone since this update from a hour ago. I recently updated and it doesn't give me my messages. Doesn't make a noise when I get notifications. Please fix bug again or I will delete, because now I do all the work and your app don't work right please please fix. Then I will update my review untill then I'm going to keep it the same.",2
862,"very difficult, user unfriendly to use",1
863,Thieves,1
864,"This app sucks! I opt for local pickup only, maximum 30 miles! But still only see listing's for items on the other side of the country! ""Reach out to customer service""?! No thanks....I've got better things to do...just make the app better",1
865,"So finally it's working much better but still crashes, not as much. But those ads are harassing.",3
866,Expensive and It has so many ads published,2
867,I love it!!,5
868,this site is great!,5
869,Lacks really common features and is really difficult to navigate through because of it.,2
870,To much scammers who don't buy nothing or want to sell anything.,1
871,Ok I guess,3
872,"This app use to be great, years ago. I fkn hate it now. It has such a delay lag for the app to respond to what I click on, and it will just crash and close out randomly, always when I'm searching for stuff. Can't stand how horrible this app functions now. üñïü§¨üëé",1
873,I think this app is a bunch of BS. I messaged over 20 different people and offered good offers and not 1 word back from anyone. They want you to pay for other users to see your offer im guessing.,1
874,Search results are absolutely horrendous now after the new update. It only gives results for the first word in your search terms now.,1
875,easy and quick notification,5
876,"Wrongfully banned my account. I had created an account for the first time and verified my identity and everything. Made a purchase on a camera and 3 hours later, instantly banned. Supoort has been entirely disgraceful in this process. Due to this, I will just take my business elsewhere. Clearly, Offerup has no intentions of fixing this matter. Edit 2: Don't waste your time talking to support. There is not a real person on the other end of these emails.",1
877,Love the verity and for me local items to purchase and pick up is awesome. I have purchased several items from offer up no complaints here,5
878,Great deals I can't find somewhere else,5
879,excellent,5
880,Offer Up the Best Selling App!,5
881,Made a sell on here,5
882,"Good, not great. It's easy to post things to sell, and it's easy to buy stuff for sale. But, the message service is terrible. It takes forever to receive messages; often you don't even get a pop-up notification. And, the item location seems to be off. When I search by ""distance from me"" and put a radius of 10 miles, it'll still show me things way far away, even when I select ""Pickup Only"" Also, the pop-up ads have become harder to X-out. They put a fake ""X"" that takes you to the site.",4
883,"we're paying commissions. stop showing ads and asking for premium subscriptions. your services aren't free. Get sooner responses, get earlier access to posts !!!!!? Is there anything you will not nickel and dime? Quit pimping sellers and customers.",1
884,Insists on including non-local/shipping options.,1
885,The best,5
886,Not sure how offerup pretent to compete with other apps such as Facebook marketplace now with all the super annoying full screen intrusive ads popping up all the time. Small Ads at the bottom or top are fine with me but this is too much. Uninstalling.,1
887,bad experience and the admin doesn't help the situation whatsoever,1
888,There has become way too many ads on here.,2
889,"I'm currently trying to contact customer service but it's hard to find and no till free number. I have an item I purchased but the person didn't send it in the 3 day period causing them to deposit funds back to the card. I wrote them on their forms without a response, I e used their virtual assistant but did nothing but say funds were back on the account. I contacted my financial institution to "" we haven't received anything our end, plz contact offer up"" Assistant not responding any more!",1
890,amazing individual. she is very courteous. very helpful. will definitely do business with her later great person!,5
891,Why can't I allow access to certain photos only? Obviously. Why do I have to give you access to all photos?,1
892,I love it,5
893,I have sold and bought on offer up.,5
894,"Aug 2024: It's now to an unusable app, where there's little to no admin moderation on listings by businesses! Was searching for an item, resulted in 90-95% local business results. Results consistently pulls listings from out of state when I filter for ""local"". I dumped this app after 8 yrs of use. From 1 star to 0 STAR! Read the other REAL reviews. I'm not the only one! Same robot response to those reviews that gets NO RESOLUTION.",1
895,Cool,5
896,Blah,1
897,Good üëç,5
898,Ruined by ads,1
899,"horrible, shows ads like sketchy app, which you can't close despite cross/close/back button.",1
900,First time shopping this appt.,5
901,"These adds make me just want to use Facebook marketplace, sorry guys, I loved the app before. I know you guys need to make money but this will kill this app If it gets rectified I'll absolutely change my rating.",1
902,Always like offer up.,5
903,"not tryna get rich so if u keep it simple, don't get diarrhea from low offers, (that's literally the point), & have a ""set it & 4get it"" approach, u'll see it's user friendly, EZ $$. i was told no one buys a fireplace heater in summer. (hold my beer) sold it on a 102¬∞ day... to a fireman. so pull out the awkward box & start snapping pics. whos cryin bout ads/shippin/prem.bennies? u charge yer client extra when he wanna do the weird stuff with the woopie cushion right? gotta pay to play kids.",5
904,No sales,5
905,I always use offerup instead of yardsales lol,5
906,don't like having VPN on.,3
907,they have great information on there Items,5
908,"Why one star? - Can't rate sellers unless you get a ""notification"" from offerup. So if you grt scammed, you can't leave a review warning others about a certain seller - Getting refunds seems unintuitive and not straightforward. As in there was no place in the app to manage that. Again I emailed support and it dealt with buttons I didn't even have haha. I just wish you could manage orders better. If so, it would be a much better app.",1
909,New update banned many many accounts without explanation. Mess up my 5 star account for no reason and when asked why they banned the account they just said it's a permanent ban and I cannot make a new one. Didn't even tell me why,1
910,Why is my account blocked!?!?!?!?! I verified who I was!!!!,1
911,"This app is onboard with the Reset, digital ID, social score agendaüö©üö©üö©I verified my email,phone #, pic & social media yet I am now required to give personal information (dob/ss# & pic of DL or ID) claiming that's how they keep their users 'safe' from bots & scammers. Neither of the offer up 'scammers' I crossed paths with & reported were ever removed nor was I reimbursed or refunded. They kept my $ & removed my account! Offer up SUCKS. I don't recommend.",1
912,"The app before the ad rollout was good. Since then, ads and insane amt of LAG. This app hands down eats up all the memory on my phone. 3 gigs worth just searching for 5 to 10 mins and trying to scroll !!! This needs to be fixed. I've already switched platforms because of this.",1
913,"HORRIBLE!!! Where do I start? The people using this offer up these days are nothing short of rude, inconsiderate,selfish,greedy and flat out scummy and grimmie people! They ask all interested in something manage to weazle an address out of you then just stop texting!! Or say their on the way and then never show! These people should be arrested for sure I'm worried they are going to rob me now ! Whose to say they won't ? They aren't answering texts for some strange reason so I guess report them !",1
914,this how i make a living üë≥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® offerup for president!,5
915,"Ads everywhere, messages freeze and crash the app. The whole app feels sluggish, i don't know what happened it used to work fine user interface wise atleast. Update 7/21/24: Still a garbage app. Ads everywhere, slow and poorly optimized, oversaturated with bad listings",1
916,"what can I say about OfferUp? it's widely used. it's got a decent interface. although I wish you could simply prevent yourself from getting returns from New York City even if you live in nearby New Jersey. because what if you don't want to pay the tolls to go there? I don't care if the Bronx is 18 miles away, but I don't want to go there for any reason to pick anything up",4
917,offer up stole money from me...,1
918,"love it, nice and easy!",5
919,OfferUp is a great app. I got what I needed fast and with no problems. üôÇ,5
920,"Sold and purchased many items on Offerup. It's easy to communicate with other people, easy to post, and easy to complete transactions.",5
921,Didn't like,2
922,You know this app seriously I can't stand you know why they personally made it a true vendetta to ban me from the app because of the fact that I had a lot of cool stuff. And what is sad is when someone wanted to drive to my apartment at 2:30 in the morning from LA. Was trying to bring me McDonald's driving in my apartment complex I catch getting out of his car listening to apartments he would call my number. So I called the police on him and I got banned for protecting my wife! Screw this app!!,1
923,Always good.,4
924,"quick payer, thanks!",5
925,This app is all ads,1
926,They Didn't even post my hats,1
927,"Too Many Scammers, few real buyers AND impossible to stop the subscription. I have searched every possible place in Google Play and keep getting charged.",1
928,love it,5
929,The search algorithm has changed. It's now gives you many more useless results if you are searching for a specific item such as an item by size.,1
930,Look at that ordered so much stuff and never received any of it and probably got charged for it too lots of money üòÖüí∞,2
931,Now instead of showing me what I am searching for I get a bunch of things kind of like it. Search algorithm is bad now and wastes a lot more time.,1
932,"Uninstalling this ""no-privacy app."" You invade the users privacy. Cookies? Just read your ""policy"". Feel less like a user friendly & more like a realtime stalk & sell info app Car dealer&promo items & paid ads show up first. Local sales ""low priority"". Many car scams. Can you put a time frame on posts so they expire after 2 weeks? Can't take 2 year old posts serious. Is this garbage app owned by TEMU? ADS ADS ADS. Try pickup items, u then c ads 4 sim items on Amazon. Freezes up lots.",1
933,Just un-installed. App can now open web pages without any action on my end.,1
934,I love making money and I do here,5
935,"haven't sold anything, think it a out dated website",1
936,a good way to make extra money by getting rid of old stuff around the house that you don't want anymore its just there doing nothing getting away and just stacking up..,5
937,"Larry was nice and respectful. The transition went smoothly. Yes, I will buy from Larry again.",5
938,"Old things or items marked as claimed could be removed faster & notifications for items on your saved search are only done based on the item description and does not include price range you've selected but, otherwise great app. I use it often.",4
939,"I was given fake money, don't trust this at all",1
940,Bad comunication methodo,3
941,always find what I need,5
942,Very helpful to sell stuff,5
943,Have has alot on here but haven't made a purchase because already sold or no contact maybe try again but don't know yet.,3
944,Great tool!,5
945,Ever since the current company and or entity purchased OfferUp a couple years ago it has continually gotten worse and worse. You basically have to purcbase the premium membership to get anyone to respond to your msg. I used to love it but now it is almost unusable.,2
946,Shop here all the times,5
947,It would be great if it had the Option to Repost/Renew items at least once a week.,4
948,"Spam pop up, forceful ads. Less ad on browser.",1
949,make a trade only options for sneaker heads into trading also.,5
950,"Since the last update, sometimes when I open the app, it will only show half the screen. The bottom half gets cut off. I have to exit the app and clear the cache in order for it to work normally. Also annoyed at the number of temu, amazon, and other ads that are cluttering up the app. This should just be for private party sellers.",2
951,Works for me!,5
952,"This app is really great, I have purchased everything from sneakers to a really KooL rug for my house. I have also posted a few items for sale as well. The app itself gets a little glitchy at times but other than that, it's a great app and support is actually very caring about you and always answers back right away. I would recommend it to everyone!",5
953,"Ads have increased more, now covering the whole screen and forcing you to watch videos. App used to be good, and premium is too expensive. Deleting account.",2
954,Great way to make extra cash and find things you need at a lower cost,5
955,"I used to use the app pretty often and I stop using for a little bit know I need to see ads and videos every time I text someone, so now they want to force you to pay to avoid this annoying ads",1
956,The advertisements are ridiculous.,1
957,I just wish the sellers who sell shoes put the accurate shoe size trying to browse through the BS is ridiculous do you put size fours or size 5 put them down as a size 38 so people be careful while you're buying shoes read it all ask questions and enjoy your shopping,5
958,will be buying a car on Wednesday on here,5
959,Temu adds takeover the screen randomly. Don't like it. Is this Offerup easing us into adds so we pay to not see.,3
960,üòÇüíØüôèVery Great Experience On Here!!!!,5
961,Contains ads that forcefully install apps without user consent. You need to re-evaluate the ads your app is serving up to users because this is how malware is spread.,1
962,"Messages are surely not sending. Been trying to communicate with a seller, weve both sent messages but they clearly aren't in response to previous messages Edit: even though they respond to reviews saying to reach out, its still an automated email they dont answer. EDIT 2: they messaged one time, didn't address the problem, and never responded theres no real people to talk to at the company, no phone number, nothing",1
963,They dont allow use of VPN for privacy and data protection.,1
964,Who posted that comment?,1
965,"I just joined this month, and have sold two items and just got a request for another. üëç I've been gone for awhile when didn't sell fast enough, But I'm back with new items ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
966,no one can see my posted picture. I shared my link with friends and people say they see my profile but doesn't see my post.?!?!,1
967,"People sell based on sentimental value rather than actual value. Great platform, not so great sellers. People come on here looking to get rid of things but suddenly try to become retail arbitrage pros.. ridiculous",1
968,I used to love this app. Now the ads are out of control and most features are behind a paywall. This app has become unbearable to use. I'm deleting this app.,1
969,good,5
970,"it's easy to navigate and whatever you're doing, buying or selling offer up makes it easy and convenient for you .",4
971,communication has been a little slow not the fault of this app at all so far pretty pleased with inventory & availability,5
972,excellent way to find things,5
973,"Great app. No issues. Thanks, devs. :)",5
974,I love offer up 1 of the best apps to buy and sell items with no hassle or misunderstanding. I would recommend offer up to anyone looking for a good condition reasonable offer,5
975,I miss when the original letgo.,1
976,Useless. I've tried dozens of times. nobody responds.,1
977,no way to rate people when they back out of a meet to sell to you,3
978,"You're automatically signed up for half a dozen email lists when you log into the app, and even after you remove yourself from them you get marketing emails that you have to unsubscribe from",1
979,First I was scammed out of 240. by Steven if Edgewater Appliance Repair...he took my money but did fix my washer. .. John if Edgewater donated a washer to me when he heard my story. I'm 76 yrs old..God bless John.,5
980,"I gave this app a second try. Instead of buying, I was selling, and it was just worse in every way. All I can say is if you want something, save up for it and buy it new. If you want to sell something, go to a pawn shop or a thrift store and sell there. Dont waste your time and money on the plethora of scammers on this app.",1
981,"Awful app was doing just fine buying and selling good ratings from a lot of people.. Then apparently another seller hating on my good prices or someone that didn't like my prices reported me and they ban me no explanation have been trying to contact them and all the help I get is a Bot and a email that's explains absolutely nothing just says that I have ""violated"" something and they give no explanation neither they try to help to fix the problem.. I'm done with this awful app. God bless you all",1
982,Good,5
983,OfferUp is nice and thank you,5
984,Horrible support team and customer service. Tried multiple time to get sincere assistance with account lockout. Cant get any explanation or help. OfferUp major fail! Very frustrating for 2+ year member.,1
985,Too many ads,1
986,good app,5
987,No use No hand-me-downs,1
988,"Awesome, convenient, very useful tooƒ∫ I use for some years now. Thank you OfferUp.",5
989,"I used to LOVE this app, but the pop-up ads make it feel scammy and has made me lose interest, I was mainly a seller and it's OK as a seller, but as a buyer, it's frustrating.",1
990,Just another scumbag ad site allowing people or companies to list items like mattresses for $1.00 or even $0 wasting people's time trying to figure out who's scamming and who's not. Thanks but I'll just go back to Walmart. Bye,1
991,Good,5
992,This app charged me 7.99 and I didn't authorize it my stepson added my debit card without me knowing I just want my back MY REFUND WAS DENIED TWICE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO USE THIS PLATFORM,1
993,"Overall, great app, very useful. BUT, there REALLY needs to be an expiration on these ads. Even Craigslist requires regular renewal. I'll be looking something up, so excited to find it, then reach out to the seller. No response.... oh, upon closer look the ad is 5 YEARS OLD..... Time to clean up the clutter OfferUp! Update. Seems like over time I'm getting less responses to items I inquire about. And the ads have gotten too intrusive. I will be uninstalling this app.",1
994,never get any real offers here and end up with tons of click bait and spam,1
995,The best way to buy and sell stuff online.,4
996,Great,5
997,Very good but it keeps sending messages that I don't want..,3
998,awesome!!!,5
999,Too bad,5
1000,"I was on offer up from day one with more than 250 five star reviews until I posted THC vapes & they kicked me out. Before posting the vapes I checked on offer up & saw numerous other accounts selling the same thing so I figured it was ok, offer up should've & could've gave me a warning but they just kicked me out.",1
1001,Too many scammers,1
1002,"UPDATing review to 1/3 of a star. they love making this trash worse every day. don't waste ur time here, unless you want ""entrepreneurs"" haggling over stuff that says FIRM PRICE. why do i have to reset my location every single time? why is the default including shipping (vs just local) if that's the best way to get scammed?",1
1003,Awesome,5
1004,We sold a few things quickly.,5
1005,Ok,5
1006,Hi I need to be reimbursed my 20 dollars,1
1007,Photos continuously fail to upload. Very frustrating. I have tried everything.,1
1008,Adds? Really?,1
1009,I've sold my own items on here for quite some time now. And I've been able to find decent stuff close by so I do think this is a good app.,4
1010,Alot of scammers that claim they can't ship through the app and try to workout shipping cost from the app.,1
1011,"Your app is very cool, but I got banned for no reason. If you have a reason, tell me please and let me go as a warning",4
1012,It just not the same any more You upload a new sale an you will be lucky if it gets at least 5 views This app sucks it's better fb marketplace 100%,2
1013,"Very disappointed that I can receive notifications that someone is messaging me while I'm abroad as an American, but can't even open the app even with VPN just because I'm temporarily outside of the United States even though I live there and have stuff listed. Very inefficient. Marketplace on Facebook is better.",1
1014,I love it. better than ebay,5
1015,paying for an item without my confirmation is absolutely stupid and feels criminal! you ppl are insane! I feel violated! who conducts business like this?,1
1016,too many sellers just cancel your full price offers... it's bs,1
1017,Absolutely useless waste of space on my phone. Latest update decimated any hope of finding items you search for. Looking for Chevelle parts...how about this Ram bench seat? Skip this app it's garbage just like marketplace.,1
1018,"I like the idea of offer up, however, it is really annoying when businesses put all of their 400 items on display. They overshadow the posts of everyday people selling their items..",1
1019,Too many ads,2
1020,"Still haven't received my payment through offer up and I sold the item may 20th, and I set up a deposit account and have proof he recieved the merchandise and is happy with it, I seen my money asap offer up!",1

1022,great ..appreciated,5
1023,Great app. Easy to understand and navigate. I sold an item thanks to OfferUp. üëçüèºüíØ,5
1024,"WHY in the world would you no longer be able to see when someone one posts a vintage post . Perhaps a month ago, 3 years ago. Who's brilliant idea was this ? This is a bargaining chip for people like myself they like to buy things . Taking that away not only diminishes my chance perhaps the person moved away with coincidentally people post things when they're moving . People that post things that are what year old , 2 years old , and I'm waiting for a response. Great job üëç",1
1025,Excelente,5
1026,"Offerup forces you to use the app to sell. And when you do, they won't let you use android's DocumentsUI to upload pictures. They'd rather violate your privacy by having full access to your albums.",1
1027,Unreal...signed up for OFFER UP BUT CANNOT SELL ANYTHING. FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK. TO sell you have to down load APP BUT you cannot download app on computer. IT asks you what other devices you want to download app and takes me to my phone. I want it on cimputer NOT phone and you cannot install it there. WILL not use as can't. NOT user friendly.Drop it,1
1028,I love how it's so easy to go to the search bar and find something exactly what I'm looking for. Great app I really enjoy it,5
1029,Great day,5
1030,"Returned to lower my rating. App was good til they rolled out their attempt to make it more ""profitable"" for shareholders. Charging for car posts reduced the supply of cars for sale on the app. No way to filter out dealership posts so most cars are actually dealership inventory and even searching by a low price won't help because dealers set the ""price"" at $1 so they take over the priced searches too. It got worse when they added random popup advertisements. So, i use facebook marketplace now",1
1031,well it's ok,3
1032,good App üëç,5
1033,"This app is terrible. The first time I used it the seller blew me off after driving to meeting spot. No matter what the developers write in response to my comment, don't trust people who use this app.",1
1034,"Offerup is cool. You can find New and Used items in your area. Always meet at a public place for your safety for in person transactions.. BUT credits you earn expire after a week in the app , I don't like it , and I hope they Fix it soon..",3
1035,Great app promoting local communities.,5
1036,"FYI... Full screen ads are NOT ""faster and more fun"". This WILL make people uninstall and just use a browser instead.",1
1037,"Removed my 1 star to give a better review. This app will put you on banned for selling video games you own. Nothing says anything about selling video games or accounts on their TOS. They will deny responsibility for their actions of the banning process. If they ask for contact, they won't do anything for you. you're better off on another app. I was selling 1 of my accounts with a lot of evidence that it was my own account.",1
1038,App is terrible. Full of spam and fake ads. This app should be rated 0,1
1039,Very pleasant experience. Seller was fair and friendly. Will definitely purchase from him again.,5
1040,Is good,5
1041,"Great app, very helpful.",5
1042,great just needs to be able to adjust distance better,4
1043,God Bless The Person That Came Out With This App I Can Bet It Has Helped Many Starting With Me Thank You,5
1044,This is easy to use and customizable. this gets faster results than others. the only unfortunate thing is some people don't understand that I live 35 miles west of H.,5
1045,horrible,1
1046,You can't even buy a single thing without getting logged out and your account locked so annoying!!!,1
1047,Ok,4
1048,"I've been using OfferUp for a while now, but the ads have gotten out of control. Every time I try to browse or post something, I'm bombarded with ads. It's becoming incredibly frustrating and is really affecting the overall user experience. If this doesn't improve soon, I'll seriously consider switching to Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. The app has potential, but the ads are just too much. Please address this issue before you lose more users.",1
1049,Too many ads,1
1050,I like offerup its a good apo,5
1051,to many adds,1
1052,Always very good üëçüòä,5

1056,"New Review!!!... Still With The ADDS!!üí© Stop The Damn ADDS!!! (No-one likes adds!!!) Just let us send our messages to eachother, and try to sell or buy!! We are all on a time crunch and don't have the time for the damn adds!! Also...Create a section where people can post an item that is up for an Offer!!! We are all tired of idiots posting their items for free but it's really to make an offer!! (Not Free) as they say! Man you would think that for being Offer-Up you would have had that covered!",1
1057,"been trying to cancel for months, I can't figure it out. BE CAREFUL, DONT DO IT",1

1059,love it,5
1060,"Very difficult to use app, unusable at times. Insane amount of lag. I can't post anything because it keeps loading a post that I tried to make before the app crashed, and all of the images are blank and won't load, and won't let me delete them. Clearing the cache doesn't fix it or restarting or anything. Half of the postings you see are ads. What they've done to this app in just the past few years is ridiculous. Can't tell actual people selling from ads.",1
1061,I grate app to buy and sale,5
1062,great,5
1063,"They closed my account and claimed I broke their policues but all I do in this app is sell pokemon cards. Nothing else! Ppl that might not like you, can press a button that sells your item. They can claim that they sold it to you, and write u a terrible review. Even if they didn't even make business with you. You should be able to see the price without clicking the item. It's just annoying. Imagine having 35 listings and such good reviews and lots of views like 6k, and then it all disappearsüò°üò°",1
1064,Updated: They've started injecting forced video ads now. This platform is actually worse than Craigslist. It's 100% impossible to find local listings from actual sellers that aren't bots. And the bot report button offered does nothing. They don't go after the spam bots. At least you can filter out duplicate spam bot postings on Craigslist but tbh shopping on both OfferUp and Craigslist are joyless af. Don't waste your time shopping on this app.,1
1065,I always enjoy shopping from OfferUp I have found a lot of amazing deals,5
1066,Dookie stink app. They implemented a way to show you an unstoppable fullscreen ad every three listings you click on. They purposely block posting on the desktop app. I have tried using the report button on shipping scammers and it's error 404 on the app and desktop. Zero way to contact support in app. The ship feature is terrible and prime for scams. At least the app does let u sell things tho. Edit: Oh thanks! I can reach out to customer service via email now. Added a star.,3
1067,App has helped me through gaining sales for projects that I've covered through donations in recycling. Very helpful thanks.,5
1068,"What happened???? Filled with auto popups, adds and installing apps like Pandora and forcw opening them. not cool",1
1069,"None of the Sellers respond back, or if they do, the item is sold already. They leave their ad up on OfferUp for months after it has been sold. Waisting my time. No Seller Ever takes down their ads when they have sold. Useless, i thought Craigslist was bad.",2
1070,Do not buy anything expensive from this app. You can get scammed and offer up will not do anything to help you.,1
1071,used the App and worked fine. Now the notification are slow at alerting and also not hearing any sound. Which makes you lose potential buyers.,3
1072,The used car section has been completely taken over by dealerships. There is no way to filter by owner. A great deal of people would benefit from that feature. It gets really old looking at car ads within your filtered price range only to find out that most of those options are just dealers listing the down-payment in order to lure you in. It's a scummy practice that offerup should step in and handle. I will no longer bother looking for used cars on offer up.,1
1073,Ty/Christ jesus for ever and ever,5
1074,"I hate this app, I ordered two things from shipping, one of the packages never came and wasn't updated at all in the USPS tracking site, and the other im still waiting for it, and it also still says ""pre shipment"" label!

1075,Although I pay for boosting my items every month. I haven't got any exposures from it,2

1083,I hate OfferUp I wish let go come back,1
1084,So easy to use and navigate,5
1085,"This app used to be really good until they added in the post boosting for money, ads popping up after viewing every other listing, and getting notifications that new items of a certain category or search were posted and when i immediately view it it's either stuff that's been up for weeks or saying that it's gone. I've pretty much turned off my notifications at this point and go on once a day to see if I've got a message about one of my listings.",2
1086,you can't contact the seller after the sale,2
1087,Easy to post and navigate!,5
1088,"Ads are very intrusive, keep downloading applications trying to close the ad. I have been using it way less now than before.",1
1089,"When I made a request to buy a ps5, two of the sellers never responded. It keeps telling me to get premium so they will respond. That's not right at all",1

1095,"Doesn't work, never get replies back",1
1096,Offered a 3 day trial to turn around an hour later and charge my Google pay $20+,1
1097,Ads are predatorial like I am using a sketchy website.,1
1098,only problem I have with app is my offer up texts get changed up by offerup.but it's a good app.i love it.except that dumb repeated question they allow on here( is this available,4
1099,Allows scam ads. Very slow to load. The app used to be better a few years back. If not for the scam ads would rate 3 stars.,1
1100,Used to be great but now there's terrible unskippable pop-up ads ON TOP OF the promoted and ads among the listings. They'd rather squeeze pennies from the ada than keep users and have a functional product... and that's just pathetic.,1
1101,Love this app,5
1102,Pay money to sell stuff? suck a turd offer up.,1
1103,Great App!,5
1104,thanks very kindly,5
1105,One of my favorite apps. Wonderful. Such a pleasure,5
1106,"Difficult to use, can only be used on mobile, posts cannot be deleted ever. What a mess.",1
1107,It's really unfortunate that this is the worst app because they're are a lot of fun items. However the app will not accept either of my cards. I have contacted customer service multiple times to no avail. The first time I was actually told I violated the terms of service and there was a block on my account. Funny thing is that I just downloaded the app that day and hadn't listed or interacted with anyone. Every next time I tried i was just told to try a different payment method. What a joke.,1
1108,You think changing settings will trick us to sign to keep using NOPE IM DONE WITCHA DONGLIKERS,1

1114,Pretty good at website for buying and selling......,4
1115,Can't upload items to sell app crashes,2

Constant notifications reminding you to use the app no matter how much you use it. If you turn those off you won't get messages from buyers or sellers.",1

Impossible to delete sale post once uploaded pics you can either archive or mark sold but it stays as sold in folder even if the ITEMS WERE DONATED TO CHARITY.

1183,not the best too many false notifications,3
1184,they charge now to see anything updated,2
1185,horrible app where sellers never ship the items that you pay for and when offerup has to refund you the money the seller puts the same exact offer up that they never shipped to you. There seems to be absolutely zero accountability for sellers and for offer up themselves. do yourself a favor and do not use this app.,1

1190,great site for shopping new and used,5
1191,Too many ads and hardly any views. 30 days on offer up is about the same number of views as 2 days on Facebook. There are ads even when you are just looking at items that are for sale. If you try to sell anything you better be patient. Even more ads and pushiness for you to subscribe to garbage.,1

1198,I'm sick of dealing with losers selling garbage. Not worth it to try to be cheap. Shows ads for scam sites like Vacaras. The reviews aren't reliable because sellers don't have to say who they sold it to if they don't want a bad review and then that person can't review them. I've gotten scammed and had people not show up for the meeting several times. You don't get accurate search results.,2

1226,Great App To Sell Unwanted Items.,5
1227,UPDATE YOUR APP NOW! APP CRASHES when trying to upload Pics to Post Items. Its absolutely horrible. Never had this problem every until a few weeks ago. The app cant even process 5 pictures before it crashes... FIX NOW PLEASE!! We need an update,1

There is a report feature but there are way too many bad posts. Even searching is a chore- people adjust title & info fields to get as many views as possible, ads. Free category is the worst: 90% are ""make me an offer"" or business advertisements. I also have to reset my search every time, it keeps changing back to 30+ nationwide shipping when I just want local!",2
1230,Used to be pretty solid but since they started pushing non-stop temu ads it's become annoying. I'm looking for alternatives at this point. You can't look at more than two items without a temu ad that has a skip video button that's 2 pixels wide so you cant select it.,2

It's like the only ad on there and it makes me not even want to use your app. Get better sponsors, or tell them to make an ad that isn't so damn gross! Also, don't respond with ""please reach out to customer service"" like I notice you have for every other negative review. You should reach out to them. Your lucky enough to get feedback from everyone who took the time to post a review. LazyMF",1

This app wasn't useful and it's now it's making me jump through hoops to stop a monthly charge. Absolutely do not recommend.",1
1237,The OfferUp app is so lame. I would rather have the offer up on my Facebook to work but it won't work on my Facebook page for some reason and I really don't know why on my phone or on my Apple iPad either,2
1238,app doesn't let you add a payment method so cannot buy anything,1
1239,too many ads and not many listings,2
1240,"Used this app for years it all went downhill .To many ads and scammers, when you first post, they get like 3 people interested, but then your ad goes dead they never show. I believe it's the offerup company trying to keep your interest. Dont use",1
1241,"Used to be kinda decent, sucks now",1
1242,Was a decent app before they started force feeding screen full timed adds to you every other listing and charging you to get rid of it like some cheap video game. Also started charging for listing more than one vehicle for sale a month even though they'll take down your vehicle for unknown reasons just to make it so if you want to relist you have to pay. Very disappointed with the way this app has fallen and is making the decision to choose fb marketplace 1000x better.,1
1243,temu ads and cars. What happened?,1
1244,"My account was blocked. When I inquired I was told, it was flagged by mistake. The app says I have 3 messages but when I go to messages there is nothing there. I did receive 2 emails from some guy but looked like phishing. It has been a complete waste of time.",1
1245,good app,5
1246,"why is there a charge to sell stuff ,there was no charge before,unless you wanted to boost you idem .",3
1247,Found my car here.,5
1248,"Please change the setting that prompts users to add searching location upon (first -open of the app) This causes different location to show on the profile Whereas it was just a searching location , (Searching location should not be showing on personal profile , even without verification)Please look into this matter",2
1249,"While I do like the app and features, the advertisement can be ridiculous. Tried closing out an advertisement and it installed siruis xm radio app on my phone. Normally I have no issues closing out advertisements. It gave me scammy website from the 90s vibe.",1
1250,Scammers lurking with faulty products. Best to pay digital or anything with a receipt so you can get money back if this is the case. Don't buy using cash,2
1251,"The amount of scammers is a absolutely insane. For every 1 real buyer, there will be 20 scammers asking for your phone number, paying with fake cashapp, avoid this app if your susceptible to scams.",3
1252,great site,5
1253,Great own,5
1254,No time for this kind of shopping.,4
1255,"Its so dumb how theyre adds now , üëéim deleting it ,",1
1256,I took off all notifications outside communication with seller and offerup keeps sending me unwanted notifications,1
1257,muy bueno gracias,5
1258,"They charge now to post.. I found out when I posted a couch for free. I refuse to pay for something I am givin away 4 free. I'm just going to post(for free) to a competitor mainly FB. MY FIRST POST OF THE MONTH & THEY TRY TO CHARGE ME. NO THANK YOU.*I 4got. OfferUp sent an email threatening to remove my post if I didnt pay(which they did remove)& asked to make sure I downloaded up2date app to ensure payment. * now I get a ""noreply"" email asking to to speak to customer care...I get an autoreply.",1
1259,it's a good app. no crashes no complaints,5
1260,"Requires no VPN at all, no sorry. What's the point of having a VPN tonprotect my privacy if everyone wants me to bypass it and give them free unrestricted access? No thanks.",1
1261,"Beware! Creepy app so privacy invasive, out of nowhere will require you to become a TrueYou member from start otherwise it won't let you post/buy. Useless if you contact Support, unless you want to waste time. Advise to the wise, you have the power to decise who you share your info with!",1
1262,Very good website. Helpful in every way at helping me make sales.,5
1263,"Complete BS, very easy to get fraud customers / scammers whom will ask to send you via Zelle and ask for the linked number and email! While you only link one of them to your Zelle. They ask for both to find a way to scam you and access your Zelle account",1
1264,great way to buy and sell.,1
1265,"giving me the location around the area you set it up .. I set within 20 miles from where I live, but it still gave me an area out of my range",4

1268,Been using this app for for years now I have sold a lot of things and I have gotten a lot of things made a lot of money OfferUp is my go-to for quick easy money,5
1269,way too many ads and app crashes a lot. App also freezes,1
1270,Amazi,4
1271,"there is no guarantee when you buy items listed on the platform, when you sell the item, it will delete your account and tell you to refund the buyer, I contacted the buyer and he did not receive the refund! I tried to contact customer service, and it responded like a robot: ""It appears a technical issue caused your account to enter a locked state. We‚Äôve made some changes that have resolved the issue."" Then nothing changed, this is stupid!!!",1
1272,Whatever..,3
1273,What's up with the ads on OfferUp? you're forced to watch them? Bad decision.,2
1274,"Slow loading, adds are very annoying and your messaging is not working properly üòë please immediately bring back let go 1000, times better",1
1275,Haven't used the app yet.,5
1276,This was originally 1star...they have good deals and a way to connect with people so they should get 2 stars. Only 2 though because items aren't removed after a period of time. just turns into a fishing game hoping something is still available for sale when you reach out. They now also have advertising that interrupts your searches...just kinda annoying.,2
1277,Uninstalled after years of use. It's a giant ad machine now. Used to be an effective shopping tool.,1
1278,Too many ads.,1
1279,If you click on something to look at it to see more information about something then go back into the search you get ads that stop your progress and it does nothing but take up my time while I'm searching. I've only got so much time in a day to look around and I'm not gonna have an app that takes up my time by making me watch ads so I'm deleting letgo. Very aggravating.,1
1280,I have proven sales of Millions. Why is it three four maybe even 5 years since I've sold anything from OfferUp advertising. I'm selling stuff on other places. So surely it's me not OfferUp.,1
1281,Very easy to use! Unfortunately it shut down and now I can't reinstall because of location problem üòï,2
1282,OfferUp is awesome,5
1283,"The worst app for buying things. worse than modern day Craigslist! Love eBay, mercari and Poshmark, but offerup the sellers have no customer service skulls and don't know to communicate in a timely manner. I miss the beginning of eBay and Craigslist.",1
1284,Trying to get past the ads is impossible,1
1285,I'm just starting to use the app but what I can see it sure seems like a good I'm going to continue,5
1286,NO WAY TO STOP THE DAMM THING.,1
1287,"Terrible service and in my humble opinion a scam! After listing my furniture and paying a promotional fee, I was informed that my account was removed due to violations of our Posting Rules and/or Terms of Service. After a review of your account, they have agreed to restore the account. Your account is now active. Keep in mind, I've NEVER used this service or posted to this account before this week. When I explained this was an obvisous mistake, and asked for a refund, they refused!",1
1288,"Haven't had a good experience,never received my order after two attempts.",1
1289,I've never had an issue with any seller or buyer,5
1290,"All I ever get is fake accounta wanting my info.. ""what's you cell number"" every time offer up sucks",1
1291,"3 day free trial a scam, it still made me purchase for the month and took the money out immediately. when trying to find help which in itself is hassle, I found that they don't offer refunds on promotions once purchased. I sent my inquiry about this nonetheless and hopefully it went through. if you plan on using this app to sell anything be wary of the promotions since they more than likely will steal your money and not refund it when they supposedly ""offer a free trial""",2
1292,Takes absolutely forever to get a refund. You pay for an item and when the seller doesn't ship it still takes forever to get tour money back.,1
1293,I deleted my app for offer up by mistake and now I can not sign in with it anymore. Please help me reactive it I had important sells on it,3
1294,Nice,5
1295,"OfferUp doesn't allow you to access the application if you are traveling, even if your account is registered in the US. It's a flaw in the process. I have listings posted in the US in my hometown, but while I'm on vacation, I cannot answer messages from interested sellers. Update: June 3, 2024 I reached out to the support team as they requested in their response below, only to hear that 'At this time, the OfferUp app is only accessible within U.S. territories.' It was a waste of my time.",1

Firearms not considered family friendly; toy replicas considered harmful; an empty hard bow case is dangerous...",1
1297,Their pop up ads acting like malware earned them this üí© ranking. Do better offer up,1
1298,"Platform has been ruined by obnoxious ads, predatory algorithms, and data collection.",1
1299,Sucks now that it charges to post stuff. I will delete and use Craigslist and Facebook market place that don't charge you.,1
1300,The App sucks now! Back in the day you would rid of your things quickly. Now the only way to do so timely is on FB Marketplace! Offerup will no longer push your listing's to Sell unless you pay them too! It's not the same. Use FB MARKET!,1
1301,Good,5
1302,OfferUp charges too much.,1
1303,"so far so good. just did my first 2 sales and waiting for my payment. similar to eBay, just less on the fees that eBay makes an arm and a leg off of you with",5

1306,great app,5
1307,"Haven't used it yet, I just know.",4
1308,wow,5
1309,I love offerup. one of my favorite apps.,5
1310,Completely oriented for resellers and scalpers. Not for people trying to sell used items. Especially if you aren't shipping. You have to pay for listings to appear and the older the listing the less likely it is to be viewed. The notification system only notifies you about things the platform thinks you'll buy very loosely based on search history within the app. I missed several messages from potential buyers because there aren't any notifications,2
1311,Too many annoying people who want everything for free. Too many lowballers.,2
1312,This used to be a good app. Now everytime I click on something taken I'm taken to a Temu website. User be aware.,2
1313,I love it,5
1314,people false selling cars on this app,3
1315,A lot of fake bot accounts to make the app look there are more people using it than really are. Seller will almost always ghost you just before the sale or meet up it happens almost every time.,1
1316,wonderful üòä,4

1326,"Deception Abounds They push the promotion feature constantly, so I purchased one day. Well after I purchased it when I was trying to exit the app and save my posting it looked like I had not. So I almost bought it again. I went toy bank account first and saw the sale had gone through. So I just exited. But every time I went to look at my posting it they had it in my face again and again. Plus, my organic views BLEW AWAY any views I got from the promotion feature. No way to contact anyone",1
1327,"This app is a haven for businesses trying to sell you new stuff. It's intended use for buying used stuff from individuals who live nearby is week.

It's frustrating to get the information I want.",2
1328,This app is absolutely awful. Every single time I try to post furniture it immediately takes it down and says it's against community guidelines. I can get in touch with a support team to tell me WHY! Would not recommend.,1
1329,"Terrible App; I was recently went searching for a used tool. I had no interest in buying something I couldn't pick. I set my search to local pick-up only. Wouldn't you know every post that came up was either an ad for business or a posting from out of state. This gives me the impression that this app or its engineers could care less about what the user wants, and they will tell you what you want. Because of this, this app will be deleted and never used again.",1
1330,magnificent,5
1331,Good,4
1332,This app shows me items that are not local even though I specify I want local items.,1

1338,"Ive used this app since 2015 and at the time it was the percect no hassle way to sell household items etc. Since letgo buyout there are too many adds, and yes I know thats how the site is paid for for the free people. Just seems ashamed ...all is rising , even the price for no commercials or extra ads I still appreciate the all i clusive service offerup extends when selling things that have to be shipped but you are compensated there as well. I guess what I am saying is less is more. Thank you",5
1339,Sellers never reply.,1
1340,"slow, annoying adds",1
1341,Offerup good. Me like offerup application for me phone. She works so okay.,5
1342,nice and easy transiton. nice person to deal with. answered all my questions and ran smoker to show that everything works. A++,5
1343,The application is very good,5
1344,Always good vibes,4
1345,Easy to use app.,4
1346,Constantly having to reinstall to upload photos to sell. Would be 0 stars but I've sold stuff just annoying how much data needed to reinstall just to upload photos. I'm assuming the people who made the app learned coding from a 3rd grade camp Edit: since the last reinstall no issues so far. It is better than marketplace but 5 stars would be listing services as well. They have jobs. Let us list cleaning and contract services it'd be 10 star app since no others let you do that.,4
1347,"I've bought and sold many items on OfferUp, but be cautious of everyone... and don't let folks meet at your home. God bless and enjoy life.",4
1348,This app keeps getting worse and worse. Now they've removed the date the item was listed. Why? Is no one using the app anymore and you guys want to pretend year old listings are still available? You're just wasting people's time and killing the app more and more with every update.,1
1349,Blah blah blah,1
1350,1968 continual $ 12500. or a Trade it for a 36 or longer toy holder.,5
1351,Don't know why I'm even on here. nobody ever actually contacts you back when they ask you something,1
1352,This has turned into pure advertisement! Sucks can't use it for it sole purpose! What happened to let go!?,1
1353,This used to be a great app. Now it's all ads and random stuff. I look for forklifts and I get forklifts from California that'll ship for $3.49. I don't live in California. Or I get an add for a forklift company. I've resorted to FB market place for local stuff and Craigslist (again). It's so jacked up now.,1
1354,add the ability to load video,3
1355,"Ads on this app is getting ridiculous. The ads on the search results aren't enough for this money hungry app. Each 3-5 item you view there will be a pop up ad the plays, taking over your phone until the countdown for the ad is over for you to allow you to click the skip ad button. Search results are inconsistent with location. Yes they read your text and SELL your information. They have bots inquiring to your ads.",2
1356,easy to manage,4
1357,I'm not paying you $40 to use your app.,1
1358,"The app removed my listing about a yard sale because I did not specify the specific items available. The tool failed to work properly for the use case that it was built for, which is selling your items. Extremely disappointed enough to post this one star.",1
1359,Ok it's nice having stuff left over at the end of life care,4
1360,Very low sell rate. If you don't pay your item selling is almost impossible.,1

1369,very poorly built app. unreliable notifications. I knowing video advertisements.,2
1370,"I like this app. There are several categories to list and locate items. Titles are easily understood. The descriptions are short and to the point. Sometimes it takes a day, maybe more to get a response from a seller, but that's not the App.",4
1371,works good!,5
1372,"I used to like it when it was free. And now they're charging you when you're trying to make some little money. I understand if you own a business, but what about the people that don't? And just trying to make it buck or two..",1

1379,scammers on this site,1
1380,"This marketplace is a platform that promotes scammers. I got banned because I claimed a payment that a buyer was supposed to send back the item, but he sent me an empty envelope instead and kept the item. I emailed the offerup support and sent them pictures of the empty envelope that the buyer sent, a couple hours later my account was deactivated. I got scammed with the complicity of offerup. This is Very sad and unfair üò¢ üòû",1

All you companies don't get it. Trying to bleed the turnip and destroy a decent products including apps because of the bottom dollar. It's disgusting, it's idiotic, and I promise you in the end, your once promising app has been turned into a dumpster fire so you guys can create some extra Revenue.",1
1387,Just downloaded but it's asking me to pay in order to post my items for sale not sure why I thought it was free to sale your stuff on here. It keeps asking me to subscribe,1

1392,site has gotten better. they've cleaned up a lot of the phasing ads. Best site for selling all kinds of items.,4
1393,*update. So offer up sent a reply saying they would help me. I emailed me back and all they did was send me a generic email. Horrible! Uninstalling and drop to 1 star! So I tried the premium 3 day free trial. Thinking it was going to be this amazing thing that was going to boost my listing. I've had it active for over 4 hours and I've only had 2 views! I was expecting a lot more traffic and some decent offers. I have had no offers at all! At least on Facebook marketplace I got some offers.,1
1394,"Forced ads with no way of not touching ad. Downloads the app advertised. This actually should not be allowed to auto download because that is not permissable. Bypassing your permissions on the app allowed. Please play store, look over this",1

1396,Useless,1
1397,"The data tracking on this app is absurdly invasive. DDG blocked over 160,000 data tracking requests from this app in less than 48 hours. This app also used to be pretty good until they started to make you pay to get any views. Unfortunately selling anything now is just a waiting game.",1
1398,it doesn't show prices on preview pics. I have to click on every item to see the asking price. it is absolutely ridiculous,2
1399,Ok.,5
1400,lack of communication with the sellers and the app itself.,2
1401,This used to be the go to app if you wanted to sell or buy something but after letgo joined it got worst and collapsed. It was nice when the 2 were in competition against eachother improving rapidly. The purchased ads messed things up and the lag/delay when scrolling and clicking on things on app really made me stop messing with it. Not the same anymore. Life moves on,1
1402,Forcing me to watch full screen ads? Time to uninstall. Sorry.,1

1447,come on dude show us some stuff,1
1448,"It's an alright app. I've installed it a long time ago for the purpose of buying my first car. And let's just say that leads me to my first issue with this app. ‚Ä¢ One thing this app should require sellers to do is display the mileage of the vehicle they are selling. When I got my first car, they didn't specify the mileage of the vehicle, and they just said it was running great.

1450,"The app is ok but the people selling on here are scammers!! Beware people. If the seller doesn't want you to pay through the app or use cash app to pay, they are scamming. You send them money and they make a shipping label for item you thought you bought and they dont send it. Then you cannot get in touch with them.",2
1451,This app is still not as good as Letgo was and it's been 4 years. There are full screen ads that destroy the whole browsing experience. Once one of those come up I just stop using the app.,1

1453,Ads....are you kidding me,1
1454,A strong and stable platform. I've bought and sold with great success and nary a hitch!,5

1456,Instantly un-installed when it hit me with an unskippable full screen 30 second ad. As if banner ads and paid promotion scams weren't bad enough.,1
1457,Too much,1

1463,lo mejor de lo mejor,5
1464,Unevenly enforces policies across different sellers for the same exact products and recently extremely frequent ads. Edit: email has been sent 2 days ago. How long do responses take? Final update: even the Google review trappings is an auto bot response.....,1
1465,The new standard in community buying and selling.,5
1466,well it's slower than molasses on this state ish phone but otherwise I will say it's nice and convenient for those trying to make a buck.,3

1468,"Unless I'm using it via web browser or on an iphone, this app barely loads anything in a timely manner even when updated. I'll be trying to load my inbox before my phone screen times out and that's if the app doesn't come up with an error. I'm rating 3 stars, however, because despite the lengthy load times, the layout is simple and straightforward just like the brands purpose. Its helped me get rid of and acquire new things.",3
1469,It's so amazing if you are not promoting you are treated like a freeloader and your post are hidden making it impossible to sell any of your product I have been monitoring this for sometimes now I even lowered an item on site from 3000 to the lower hundreds to see and still nothing WOW I love offerup and I am ashamed of what's going on just charge me to post or should I leave be honest,1

1472,"Never wanted this app , was auto installed by something. Garbage",1

1490,your app ad accessed my browser which it didn't have permission for to access a sweepstakes winner giveaway webpage.. THIS APP IS NOT SAFE!,1
1491,This app is becoming üí© with the popup ads. It literally wouldn't let me exit the ad or exit the app and forced Sirius XM to download. All great things come to an end and OfferUp is getting there rather quickly.,2
1492,it ok got used to market place,5
1493,not very good condition of items very often.,3

I've been in the business of buying and selling items on the internet and it's many platforms for years; so I'm quite knowledgeable as to which products sell best, how to price ect.. Since the merge with ""LetGo,"" I have gotten a ton of views on all of the items I post, however it's very rare for me to actually sell anything. And the few messages I do get are 95% scammers trying to obtain my my phone number for fraud purposes.üëé",2

1502,I would give negative stars if I could they lie and say item was delivered when it wasn't and try to keep your money! horrible experience!,1
1503,the ads are the only bad thing,4
1504,Love it,5
1505,IT'S ALL GOOD,5
1506,terrible app..they intentionally leave off the title and price so you have to click on every item before you even know what it is. they do this so they can track your clicks and show you more ads. no regard for user experience or usability .. just sucking every bit of usefulness out of this once great app. like a private equity firm took it over or something. just curse words and an uninstall from me after using it a few days to buy a local PC. scammers and ads. this app deserves irrelevancy,1
1507,the best place to find cars on other stuff cheaper,5
1508,Good üëç,5
1509,best website,5

1512,Updated 2024: This is now a CLICK BAIT app ! Beware of pop-ups while using this app ! It will try to install apps to your devices ! Updated 2022 Was a great app ! But I had to delete it 5 times and it still doesn't work right ! It's quick to go through your phone and photos but freezes up when trying to post things.

1523,Great üëç,5
1524,never had a bad experience.,5
1525,Apps that auto install? I accidentally taped on an ad and had Pandora auto install I thought it was a fluke. Well today I accidentally pressed on a virus xm ad and had that install without my permission that should be illegal.,1
1526,"I have been using this app for several years and it has always been flawless. But lately Commercialization of this app is getting worse and worse all the time. More and more ads, intrusive ads that take over the screen. update No further issues with inappropriate ads. Your ""similar to"" suggestions are worthless! They are not remotely similar. Mostly just kids toys. Do you guys even double check your algorithms? I haven't seen a decent suggestion in months.",3

1536,very easy to navigate and intuitive,5
1537,one of the best apps to look for something that you need or that your looking for.,5
1538,"Feels like lots of scammers are on here. I definitely prefer Mercari over OfferUp to sell products. I keep receiving weird messages on offerup and have never had issues like this with Mercari. I even reported some messages but some don't get addressed by the app creators. Feels sketchy and uncomfortable, so I am removing my products from offerup. Plus, offerup doesn't let me ship large items that weigh more than 20 pounds or have sides greater than 18"" I am not trying to meet people, only ship.",2

1541,"not liking it so much at the moment, I've have sent several messages, one of them was read, the others say delivered, and not one single reply. there needs to be a time limit on items, if the person hasn't logged in for a while or the item has been listed for so long, then it needs to be deleted, so there are not a bunch of useless postings to go through.",1
1542,tired of selling to people who lie and say product doesn't work but won't return for money. too many scammers,2

1551,it helps,4
1552,Easy to post and navigate the site.,5
1553,"app is good but the whole setup sucks. sellers rarely send items, they should be penalized for doing so. I have tried to buy so many things here but out of more than 20 times only three of them had actually sent me the items, all of the other ones don't even take the time to send a message. sellers are full of üêÇ üí© here. besides if you ask about the items on their message center almost no one replies. I don't know why offerup allows these people to sell stuff on this platform.",2
1554,"It works well. I have one suggestion though. When marking an item as sold, we should be able to select multiple people who bought it. For example, plant cuttings.",4

So in summary their costumer support is horrible and they do not want people to buy things on the app.",1

1567,awesome,5
1568,Been kind of down about OfferUp lately it hasn't sold much of my stuff it's been better on Craigslist to be honest with you maybe you should get your market to be bigger,3

1570,I find what I need at fair prices,5
1571,I'm able to shop and sell without anxiety or any trouble with customers.,5
1572,very useful,5
1573,some of the ads are years old and OfferUp never removes them which should be automatic after 45 days like Craigslist and most of the prices of vehicles are a lie or are just the amount down. the actual full price should be mandatory,1
1574,"Far more trouble than it's worth. Being bombarded with unskippable ads might be the single most infuriating thing to have while trying to navigate this app. Add to that the ratio of serious buyers to BS is 1 in 10 and you realize very quickly that this is like FB Marketplace but worse. I've had some sales but in the Pittsburgh area, I'd rather throw stuff in a dumpster than try to hassle with listing on this app. The promoted ad structure very flawed, they're irrelevant to the search and blend i",2

I have since deleted Facebook but still have people I haven't talked to in 20 years following me and I can't remove them. Blocking people doesn't prevent them from seeing your posts!

As for a buyer I could see that some people just lose interest or change their mind. A quick response would be nice versus no response. As for seller's, I don't understand why somebody wastes yours and their time by wanting to sell something when they don't respond to offers. And when you report them, offer up does nothing.",5

1669,incredible way to sell your items! love it,5
1670,Quick and easy.,5
1671,Still terrible: This app is clearly designed by tech people who have never bought and sold anything professionally in their lives. They have no idea how to properly conduct business between parties. Complete amateur hour...,1
1672,A big thank you to the Developers of this app you are extraordinary brilliant. To the sellers and buyers it's a win win deal.,5
1673,Good,5

1675,very good app,5
1676,"More ads now. They are letting pawn shops use bots to spam EVERYTHING, most listing are pawn shops accounts. The pawn shops also NEVER do business in any meeting place, you may as well be messaging local businesses and not the local community. What's worse is, this includes every pawn shop in all surrounding areas. Maybe I'll throw bricks with offerup logos through their windows until you guys stop enjoying the profit from it.",1
1677,"So much about this app. I didn't like it much after the change from LetGo. There were too many fake ads. Now, they have that scam site, Temu pop up every time you scroll down to see items. They also removed the choice of pick up from the screen. It is as lame as using the website. I guess it is time to use Craigslist again. Thanks for ruining the app.",1

1683,OfferUp does not deserve any stars the problem is y'all keep deactivating my account then it asked for update and then I have to sign up all over again,1
1684,Has gotten progressively worse and now has incredibly tacky advertisements,2
1685,A great way to meet Nigerians.,1
1686,Buying and selling locally works well. But the sheer amount of scammers on this is overwhelming. It's a chore to shop as most of the time you are just on guard against being scammed,2

1689,most people never respond,1
1690,"OfferUp demands an invasive ID verification process, which they conveniently reveal only after you‚Äôve jumped through all the initial setup hoops. They expect me to trust a third-party service with my driver‚Äôs license just to browse yard sale quality goods? Absolutely not.",1
1691,"Update: Fake Reviews. You won't sell anything on here anymore, app is completely useless. You can see the response from the developers. The same complaints for years. Not going to waste my time engaging in a company that doesn't fix what people have complained about. App is flooded with duplicate postings and old ads. You can flag them but it does nothing. Better off selling on Facebook marketplace. I use to sell stuff all the time, in the last 10 things I posted, not a single engagement.",1

1700,I refuse to submit to strong arm tactics of bombarding us with pop-up ads along with the constant ads mixed in with posts from users. Now you not only get paid from the ads but now you want us to pay you to stop the pop-up ads. I love in California and am already being bled dry from my lame government now you expect me to pay you to stop the pop-ups?!? Nah I'd rather just delete the app.,1

1709,Added a couple items to sell. Never got any views or offers. Prices were on point. Got tons of spam emails about other stuff on the platform though. Would use something else....,1
1710,great place to find unique items,5
1711,I am going to post more art today,3
1712,"The app itself is free and easy to use. Expect 99% of buyers to lowball you by 80 to 90% or no sale. Better off using ebay if you want to sell your item at the price it is worth, even after ebay takes their cut..",4

1714,Was a great app however now you got full page ads that come up and you have to shut down the app to get it to come off! Fire your head of development!,1

1720,"a lotta scams up here, but if your patient you can find and sell what you need to.",5
1721,"This app is a completely rigged scam. They will only deliver the messages and offers of people and items they are making money off of. If you aren't ""premium"" then it's pointless. Don't waste your time. I ran tests on it and I couldn't even get it to deliver offers, asks, messages or anything to even myself without being ""premium"". Honestly pretty shady operation and consider this your disclaimer.",1
1722,good option for sale...,5
1723,I'm in Colorado I'm looking for used vehicles within 80 mi of where I live and it's showing postings for California... It did this last time when I was looking for stuff to buy on this app... It is a pleasure uninstalling this from my phone...,1
1724,I think this app has gone way down hill since they tool over let go. Very clunky and outdated.,1
1725,compared to other second hand sites offer up has many more products for cheaper and the biggest part is that the shipping doesn't cost more than the item you're trying to buy,5
1726,too many ads and stuff now. miss the old offer up,2
1727,Nobody ever responds to any messages or questions. Never had one good interaction on Offer Up compared to Ebay and Mercari where people actually answer you. The user base is horrendous,1
1728,Extremely clunky. Lags my phone to point every input if its recognised isnt done u til a second later. The search function can seemingly crash bringing you to the home page. The inbox seems to have the same issue. Offerup has become probably the worst programed marketplace I have ever seen.,1
1729,"Predatory billing practices, awful customer support. Other users are rude and inconsiderate, don't bother with this app.",1
1730,"The greed of the people behind this once awesome app will be it's downfall. It used to be a great way to find anything you could think of, gently used items from neighbors that helped save money and reduce waste.

Uninstalling. Do not recommend.",2
1731,To me seems like Temu has taken over. Flooding the app,4
1732,I did not had a good experience at all. Returning after years when I heard from a friend that it was a decent place to look for good deals. I unfortunately have had bad experiences with sellers not responding and/or taking weeks to get back to. I cant believe I went back to this app. Now I know why I left. Go to eBay or any other app as they are better experiences. Unless you have a patience of a saint. I'll steer clear.,1

If OfferUp doesn't resolve these issues soon, uninstalling this app is just around the corner for me.",2
1754,"This place use to be great before implementing ads. Now, you have to pay in order to have early access to new postings. You have to wait 30 minutes to see a new post if you don't pay. I just go to FB market place, ebay, even craiglist.",1

1771,Great üëç,5
1772,Good app,5
1773,This app is getting worse and worse and offer up does not realise it! Sellers have old post and don't remove them! Sellers have items for sale and they do not respond in a timely manner Seller want to be begged to get the money for their items instead of seller making an interest of selling their items! App is just getting burned put by all these sellers and buyers too. Too bad there's no other selling app to start fresh all over again with enforced terms and cond's for sellers and buyers! üòî,1

I mean 12.9% to ship an item is insane. Y'all deserve negative stars honestly.",1
1780,It's very annoying that they don't show the price on a listing. They force you to click on it so they can bombard you with ads.,1

1803,They gave me a free trial which I cancelled prior to the end date. Then I get my credit card bill and they still charged me. They don't give refunds. And it is very difficult to find cancel-the-app instructions. I would not sign up for this app if I were you. Does google really need to scam people to make money? . . . Shysters!,1

There are no in your face adds, the adds that the app does have are only if you want to visit the site and OfferUp makes it obvious that it is an add.

1871,no price info at a glance and many scams. i tries for a week to get a new phone. most people are scammers asking for cashapp. other don't ship even tho the app says they do. I have tried over 20 listing and I can't get the people or the app to work. I hoestly wonder if most of the listing are fake AI or scraped from other sites and posted. I will use swappa for a new used phone.,1

1879,If you ain't first you're last!,4
1880,Randomly locked me out of my account one day citing community guideline violation. I've never violated any guidelines. Update: contacted support & they didn't reply or help with anything.,1
1881,"It is none of your business if someone is or isn't hsing a vpn or proxy. More than that, even on the main playstore page the amount of dats it shares with others is pretty wild. Pass.",1
1882,everything on here is over year old post you can't hardly find anything to buy and you don't sell anything on here,1
1883,"Search is a mess, listings do not show prices, much less offers recently. Seems to be fading.",3
1884,Nothing but scammers on on this app.,1
1885,Great platform best selling app I use,5
1886,Temu popups every single gd time I try to use the app.. if I wanted to use Temu id use it... ..... There is no need to respond with the typical copy and paste response. I see the email address.. customer service isn't going to do a thing about it...,1
1887,bed,1
1888,It's good for businessman too selling an buying price,5
1889,love offerUp,5
1890,"Ads pop up when going through menus and you cannot back out or skip them all the time. Removing app, there's others out there and don't need to deal with this.",1
1891,The popup ads are way too much. Shipping being the default is also a bad experience.,2
1892,Don't download this app. Pathetic interface where you can't delete your posts and archive is garbage. Tries to get you to pay for more views on your items. Do better,1
1893,"Useless app , charges money and shows you ads and you get bunch of scammers. Waste of time.",1
1894,Has video ads just for browsing that's just being plan greedy. üòî,1

1898,slow app,3
1899,it won't get messges or can't get the messges as well,1

1902,brand new to it so far so good we'll see,4
1903,too many ads,2
1904,Stealing my money I did not sign up for anything I want my cash back,1
1905,The absolute WORST app for buying I've ever encountered. I bought 3 items in the last month and ALL were cancelled for non shipment. Some of the people I bought from responded to me before I bought and they were verified just never sent the item. There's no accountability for sellers on this app which leaves the buyer up a creek,1
1906,This app awesome so many deals and everyone I've met is so kind,5
1907,pop up ads? really?,1
1908,Love the app,5
1909,wonderful app,5

1911,Works for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
1912,"very good buying/selling platform, highly recommended!",5
1913,Never review an app but I hate this app so much now it's insidious what they are doing. They made up things and create non existing issues to make you pay with little to no value. The intentional button placement so you can accidentally click on their promotion feature. (We all know and hate) Posts only premium members can only see the first 30 minutes. Welcome to hell...,1
1914,Everytime I use this app I have problems. And customer support rarely ever help.,1
1915,would never know what I was looking for is only a few miles away.,4
1916,many diff items being sold here,5
1917,people don't respond. offers from Offerup just disappear...,3
1918,easy and great deals,5
1919,I lost sale bc I didn't know how to confirm. This is the worst I'm sorry I wasted hours posting bc I can't get anything sold here,1

1921,"offer up app is great, getting a response from sellers is different story!!",4
1922,great app,5
1923,I haven't been able to sell anything on offer up in around 3 years. I'm thinking they only cater to city folk,1
1924,great finds. better than C-list.,5

1930,"awesome app! easy, user- friendly . helps sell your items and also has interesting variety of for sale stuff",5
1931,"It's ok, the problem is getting the seller's to communicate faster. I have waited as long as 4 days for the first reply from some seller's, usually I give them 2 days, then move on.",3
1932,They told me to ship put a product to a customer. they now refuse to give me the funds the customer paid to me until I provide them with my personal information that is none of their business and an invasion. of my privacy!!,1
1933,Used to be decent but now you're stuck with full page ads you just have to wait to time out. Search filters are pretty useless. If I want to see something 20 minutes from my house it'll still show me things half a world away. Sellers don't respond. Many items listed are several years old. What good does that do? How hard is it to remove items after a set amount of time to be sure that we're not looking at things several years old? I'm just deleting this app.,1
1934,No lo install en mi cell phone,1
1935,These people on here are flakes,1
1936,App sucks now. It's all companies posting their jacked up prices. Nothing local anymore.,1

1939,Great deals !!,5
1940,so many scammers,2
1941,"What a joke.offer up is garbage. Especially if you ship and sell thru the app. Good luck getting paid been 8 days and no money. I've put several different accounts on the app. Nothing works. And I'm told ""we release updates sometimes so be on the lookout for that on Google play"" ...no.. you must be joking.",1
1942,"If you don't pay for their Premium Service, they disqualify all your items & claim your Items are unattainable & a violation of terms & conditions. And disable your account. You lose access to the app if you don't pay for Premium service. I say get rid of Offer Up for discrimination.",1
1943,"Account was suspended without any prior notice. I was just listing a pc for sale. I had an issue with someone threatening to come to my house without me present and when reported, I got a chat ban for saying I don't appreciate your attitude and do not wish to sell to you. What is going on?",1
1944,üíØ,5
1945,"Update: forcing us to accept the crazy privacy policy where they may collect and share everything is the reason you went down to 1 star. Luck you 0 stars wasn't an option. Can be improved. It's very inconvenient to click on every list just to see its price. If only they would display the price on each list thumbnail on the search page, I would give 5 starts then. I like to search quickly and the way the app is now makes me hate searching.",1
1946,They will not stop charging me even after asking to cancel my account three times.,1
1947,Great aap,3
1948,Has been very positive!,5
1949,Just a junkie app full of adds. Don't waste your time.,1
1950,"Offer up sent me a $30 gift card but I cannot get it.Because the page does not exist . wth ? why even send that stuff out if you don't intend to honor them ?? I think I will quit using offer up because I am not really satisfied with it , Everything I sell I usually sell it through Facebook marketplace instead .So there you go .",2
1951,love the diamond art.. Such a way to relax and enjoy quite timeüòä,5
1952,"App used to be great, but now, not so much. Shows nothing local, and unless you believe someone will ship you a moped or snowblower over 1K miles for $5 -$15, it shows nothing believable either. And yes, I set it to local only, and it showed nothing in my state. What a letdown!",1
1953,COMPLETELY AWFUL!! ZERO NOTIFICATIONS RECEIVED FOR OVER A MONTH. FIX YOUR SYSTEM! JUST TERRIBLE AND OFFERUP HAS DONE NOTHING TO RESPOND TO ME AFTER SEVERAL TIMES I'VE REACHED OUT.,1
1954,Unable to cancel when done!!!,1
1955,I have had my account for years with no problem then it stopped working. I don't know if it was blocked and I have no idea why? It no longer let's me make replies to ads.,1
1956,I had both the Listing Fer Autos Subscription & OfferUp Premium because I needed to promote an auto listing. But I couldn't promote until I got Promote Plus. So I need a refund for the other Subscriptions.,1
1957,"I've been a user of this app for a few years now and just love it. I don't even use Ebay that much anymore because it's easier to list items for sale on here, and when you buy, if it's not what you expected, it's easy to return. This app has gotten much better over the years and just keeps improving.",5
1958,Filter is useless. Still throws items in that are out of search range and that have shipping when you just want items for pickup. Lots of items from wholesalers.,1
1959,They started doing these mandatory ads that don't go away. Even if you try to exit out. I will never download this app ever again,1
1960,"So having mid-scroll ads that take up half the screen wasn't enough? Now I actually have to sit through a 30 second ad every time I send a message or scroll too far down? No thanks. Doesn't make me wanna buy premium, it makes me want to root and use AdAway Update: Patched the ads out of the app and now it's almost worth two stars",1
1961,Good,5
1962,Should be able to see free things before anyone else,5
1963,"It's okay, but your ad is always buried, unless you PAY to have it made into a Premium Ad. I also don't like not having the ability to dispute someone's review of something you sold. I had one b*tch get upset because my item wasn't 100% new. Even though I specifically said, it was ""LIKE NEW""... and it was. I'd bought a bicycle, but I couldn't return it because I rode it down the block once. It didn't fit my body. So I put it on OfferUp and she complained. I had no recourse. So I deleted the app.",2
1964,all scammers. Difficult to use,1
1965,awesome app,5
1966,"This app is still bs no matter how many so called ""updates"" there are.....there is always some kind of error you can't see what you selling you can't see messages that you have about the things your selling.... -5 stars should be a thing. How this app has 4.0 stars as an over all is a joke",1
1967,easy to use,5

1969,Love this site üòÅü•∞,5
1970,"This app sucks. I wanted to sell a few items since i was moving. It somehow decided I was a bot and wouldn't let me communicate with any of the people that WANTED to buy my stuff... unless i provided photos of my drivers license, etc. I'm uninstalling it now, it's garbage. Waste of time, and they're obviously data miners. Bye!!!",1
1971,"The app is good, but the people that has item's to sale, some a lot most of the peoples have they item's way way over priced until it's crazy, why put item's on a app or any where for sale with outrageous prices, when we all know that most apps like this is for the people that don't have a lot of cash to buy items at store's because of the high over priced items, so that's why we all come to apps like this to try to find items in the price range that we r able to affordüòé‚úåÔ∏èPEACE OUTüòá",4
1972,Not that great,3
1973,BS I just got charged for a Premium offer up account. I didn't ask for that I don't have that and I don't appreciate it. What the hell is wrong with you people??,1
1974,Its a good app and easy to use but if you ship something they charge you 20% of whatever your oder is which is a scam and then Absolutely nobody whats to buy anything.,3
1975,"I Love this app, because there's a big selection, of things you can buy, sell, or even trade. Plus you can also post free items. üëçüèæ",5

1980,Way too many ads now. 4 items in a row and 1 every other line is an ad. Beyond dead,1
1981,Great App to Buy and sell your stuff. I'd recommend it to all my friends,5
1982,it's good to have multiple ways to sell things ..,4
1983,If people would just realize that their stuff that they are selling is used or is not brand new because not going to the store and would actually sell it for the prices according as in at minimum 25 percent off any store price then this would be a much much better app I love this app I use it everyday it is awesome but people need to stop thinking what they have is like gold,5
1984,I'm a down to earth person. Buying used can be just as rewarding as buying new. I've found some great items on Offerup. We buy used cars sometimes. Right üëç Rock on Offerup !!!!!,5
1985,Needs more feedback,3
1986,Latest update destroyed this app still bad!,1
1987,whenever I send messages inquiring about items that I am interested in the person I'm sending the message to isn't receiving my anything.,1

1997,Long time user. Now the app is awful. I message people and no one responds. I posted things for sale no one looks at them for months or at all. This app sucks. It's either a scam app or a fake app to farm data. Fake app. No useful and a waste of time.,1
1998,each time I go to the site to look for something I can find wut I'm looking for each time and take care of wut you look for and you will find just that üëÄ get in to the app and start looking you will find just that and more saves you money at the same time üëç good luck shopping,5

2000,"Much worse than it was a year or two ago. I'm advertising things here for considerably less than I see them on eBay, and getting no responses. WTH? Also, the stupid app keeps notifying me about items matching previous searches. I don't want that! But there's no way to turn it off.

2007,"This app sucks, it used to be really good, but lately all the updates made the app horrible Been a long time buyer but suddenly offer up wouldn't allow me to buy anything with my debit card and they take so long to fix the issue I decided to completely delete my profile and forget this app.",1

So as you are clicking to try and navigate in the app, you accidentally click on downloads of sponsor ads. What a horrible way to make a few cents. This app was once great and has become garbage. They have dramatically reduced traffic as well. You're better off with Facebook Marketplace.",1
2014,OfferUp sucks really bad! They don't ban scammers the app always freezes and has issues mostly due to their horrendous ads. Cant use VPN. And now they play super loud annoying forced sound video ads... Really??? Now full page apps after every message and some are deceptive. Edit: another ad update. Now they have force video ads that play when you back out of a post. I'm so glad I stopped buying and selling full-time as a flipper on this website I will be using Facebook marketplace primarily now,1

2017,very professional,5

2027,Push ads automatic one star uninstalled,1
2028,Great format. Some reasonable Buys. Problem is finding what you are looking for. But that's typical of any used car site. I bought a car through them a few years ago and I'm looking for one again. Great app for exploring what's out there. And good luck at finding exactly what you're looking for. It's better than a lot of sites. I can say that in good confidence.,4
2029,nothing selling,1

I usually meet up with people in my local area but if you do find or sell yo someone further away it has a shipping option between buyer and seller. everyone on here is verified so less worry",5

Multiple searches with a specific term in a specific category end up with a bunch of unrelated results from other categories. It's like hunting through a ton of spam. Super annoying and defeats the whole purpose. Just started in past 3-4 weeks. Did an app reinstall, etc to try to fix but no change. Doesn't do it on all searches, about 2/3 are clean. Please help, I'd be happy to update if this gets fixed. Thx!",2

I set up an account and verified my info before traveling out of state for work where I needed some used appliances and the app would not even let me contact sellers in the area unless I verified my id again through another service. I paid more to just get everything I needed at a used appliance store and not waste my time waiting to get verified again.,1

2075,"Awful. As if it wasn't bad enough there's items from years ago that don't exist, as well as ads every 4th item, now there's pop up adds that take over the entire screen and block you out of using the app. How is that ""fun"" for the user? Deleted account and app. And no I won't reach out to customer service. Waisted enough time with this garbage app.",1
2076,I used to love the app but now with all the ads it seems like even yall are out here trying to make a buck don't like it.,1
2077,Love the things I find on here...and selling stuff quick.,5
2078,I use to love this app but now they have Ali express spam nonstop and they made it where you can't scroll on top of the ads like you can the posts and it keeps taking you off the app to AliExpress when you don't wanna go and are just trying to scroll past. It's unethical and I'm getting tired of it. Already stopped using mecari over their b.s and offerup will be next,1
2079,Great üëçüèæ üëåüèæ and great prices and great deals I would highly recommend,5
2080,works well,4

2082,"Really? Advertisements that pop-up and block UI, then redirect? You could not have ruined this app more. Sucks now",1
2083,I've been using this app for years and I haven't been able to use offer up for about 2 weeks now. Can you please tell me why,5
2084,They have ads now running all over the page it sucks now it use to never have ads getting worse then YouTube.,1
2085,"Worst app ever. Searches are irrelevant. Notifications are irrelevant. It keeps sending me new listings for shoes and I have never once searched for or clicked on any ads for shoes. They send you a welcome email that tells you they're giving you a $30 gift card, but every time you get the email, the link goes to a ""page does not exist"". Overall, a huge waste of time.",1
2086,it ok.. not the best though.. don't get any help...,3
2087,"too many adds. adds with scams attached. I am surprised that OfferUp allows them on its site. when the price looks too good, don't go there.",2
2088,"It's got ads now that you have to watch, it didn't before.",1
2089,this is so Kool has saved us money and we have met great folks. I recommend to at least take a look you might find what you're looking for we did!,5
2090,Use to be a great app now it's almost all businesses selling products instead of local individuals mine as well just use eBay or Amazon not to mention most items are way over priced. All the ads suck as well. If I could give this zero stars I would this app has become absolutely junk.,1
2091,"My conversations get automatically deleted so I can't follow up with people who bought or sold. Major issue as let go even let that happen. Ever since the app sold to OfferUp, it's gone down in quality. More full screen ads, less reliable buyers, and poor selling. Switching to marketplace from now on.",1
2092,Good üëç power to the people,4
2093,"although people is hard to pay for merchandise at its proper value, it's entertaining to look at the staff and meet up with people.",5
2094,"Why tf should I have to look at Amazon listings, when I'm on OfferUp? Terrible interface, with Nobody running the show. Old listings; never updated when sold. Prices not displayed. Lagging/Golitching issues. This app is a mess.",1
2095,trying to get answers from sellers is like pulling teeth,1
2096,nice app thank you,5
2097,the best,5
2098,Best app ever,5
2099,"Thus far, all I see are ads by Temu and Amazon. I search for an item and the first several hits are from commercial (Temu or Amazon) sellers even though I specified PICKUP and within 30 MI.",2
2100,"Wish i could give negative stars. Don't even know how this app is still rated so high. Can't believe how bad this is now. People I am trying to purchase from are not getting my messages. When I am offering full price. Most having a ""fast response rate"".",1

2111,Easy to use and make local contacts and transactions.,5
2112,I love offer up I have gotten a lot of things on offer up,5
2113,"Very time-consuming to edit items posted already. It won't scroll all the way to the bottom without having to load often and starts over after you edit one. Also, I have notification settings on and recently I'm not getting my notifications when I'm getting a message",1
2114,the app is k,5
2115,buggy app doesnt notify on phone doesnt load quickly constantly frustrated doesnt allow easy dletions of job search so i get no notifications on stuff i need to sell but i get tons of notifications of people sellimg stuff like what im selling ( ummm why???) and jobs im not interested in and never searched nor to mention buyers are cheap and flaky dint show dont call just Ghost. oh and Tons of Scammers and Tons of businesses selling full price and trying to buy from you so they can resell,1

2120,Found some good finds with good deals,5
2121,love the filter and shipping options would be cool to have a looking for post option .,5
2122,it was decent until they went heavy ADs. algorithm is all messed up too. I search for specific things and they show me stuff I'm not looking for (mainly due to the sponsored AD payment). OfferUp I give you a big booooo and thumbs down.,2
2123,Too many ads hate it,1
2124,Like the app!!,4
2125,Ads,1
2126,"Just didn't get enough foot traffic, too many false and scammers trying to contact me. I don't know what the owners can do to stop the scammers. But they did contact me immediately upon my review ‚ò∫Ô∏è",3

2130,The App is way to use and made my first sale within a couple days.,5
2131,Very easy to use. Worth the time to set up an account and get your little legal side hustle on...,5

2133,Muy buen app encuentras muchas cosas necesarias y a muy buenos precios...,5
2134,great way to find reasonable items,5
2135,Fake sellers. Full of spam.,1
2136,"Garbage. Eff offer up. I messed up and allowed the app to update. Now there's ads, and you can't see when something was posted. And full screen ads at that. Hitting DELETE.",1
2137,Worst app ever. Go back to original format. 10/10 just now said we all can't stand using this app at all now and the letgo app was awesome. This one is slow glitched bad layout and having to redundantly add my search radius+pick up only just makes me think you are not meant to design apps.....,1
2138,Beware if your having it shipped. No way to tell how long something has been listed and if the seller is still active. Waisted 2 weeks for a tool I needed for work bc seller was scamming/ abandoned account w/o removing posts,2
2139,Thisapp is really good,5
2140,"Terrible app it worst than Craig list, to many miscellaneous items that are worth nothing, as well illegal reselling products that clearly mentioned not for resell. Old post from seller scene this app started out. This platform control you not the product it self sight...... This app belongs to be delisted like stock",1
2141,Ridden with spam now.,1
2142,keeps freezing !!!!!,1
2143,"App is inconsistent, non-user-friendly, and does not notify you of offers or how to read/find ""conversations"" regarding items you've posted. I don't think I would recommend this app.",2
2144,Offerup supports scammers. Beware of using their services. Absolutely do not give the app any of your banking/cc info. Untrustworthy. You have been warned. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
2145,"Downloaded and made an account because I found a crazy deal on a graphics card. Purchased it, $600 was taken from my account, item was set to sold, so far so good. Next morning, I wake up to an email saying that my account violated community guidelines and had been terminated. My payment was reversed and the listing was reopened. I check immediately and it had already been sold again. Support gets back to me and told me it was just a ""technical issue"". All around shady experience. Not worth it.",1
2146,"They app had the best ease of use, great filters for specific items and suggestions. However having ADs that are Unskipable, 3-8 second long ADs within a set time frame of scrolling is unbearable. Then, charging to remove ADs is just pure greed. I didnt mind the banner ADs or occasional advertisement product but videos really?!?",1
2147,Love this app,5
2148,Cant change my shipping address to new home address...,3
2149,best app ever,5
2150,"May 2024 50% owned by TEMU Explains 50% of the visual ads in the way of everything. App going way, way downhill. Mandatory to join Truyou. IDENTITY GRAB? Was a good app. Now I'm lock out from recieving any messages. Yes I already cleared the cache. Never give ID info to an app....",1
2151,"Don't bother. I've been using offer up for years. This is just ridiculous. Full screen ads that randomly pop up and you have to wait for them to time out. Then you have to worry about the filters not working. I'm not looking for things 80 minutes away from me with shipping, but try to tell the app that. Doesn't matter. And how hard is it to remove listing's from 2, 3, 4 years ago? The people are not going to answer. Sc4olling in listing's you don't want to see & aren't available anymore for ads",1
2152,Great App to find some Awesome Deals.,5
2153,This was a decent app but the constant ads are ruining it. There are better options thay don't inundate you with ads.,1
2154,Too many Ads now,3
2155,Horrible there's nothing ever good and it shows too much new stuff not used.,1
2156,offer up never used to be full of ads but after sifting through those you can still buy and sell merchandise. And I bought a amp yesterday and there's no where to rate the seller.,3
2157,Filled with ads now... not a great app amymore,3
2158,"Buy, Sell & Trade. The service fee is bad but Offer Up has contacted me so I changed my review. They do care, They are super bummed about the service fee? üòï I'm satisfied that things will change in the future with this top notch customer service. Way to not miss the mark guysüéØ",4
2159,Love offer up. It's very user friendly for buying and selling. I've used the app for both buying and selling. There's a great range of different items up for sale.,5
2160,Trash,1

2162,Great app for selling stuff and not having to give out your number or home address,5
2163,"when I get responses, I like using this marketplace. It's usually me reaching out to people a few times and never getting a response. The few times I bought things, it went perfectly. It's no fault of the app maybe, but idk...don't want to use it if I'm not gonna get any replies ever.",3
2164,This app is hacked,1
2165,i love offer up I find everything I want on this app,5
2166,POPUP FULL SCREEN ADS WHEN TRYING TO BROWSE. JUNKY INTERFACE... overloaded with too many advertisements. Too much click bait and switch. Best to go to Facebook marketplace or Craigslist to avoid the headaches of this app.,1
2167,Too many ads,1
2168,cannot upload pictures nor edit on Windows pc/website,1
2169,Good app,5
2170,easy to post and can communicate directly to sellers or buyers in the process.,5

2174,Nothing better,5
2175,OH soooo GOOD üëç,5
2176,"I am getting charged, and I have no idea how to unsubscribe to this",1
2177,I have used offer up for years. All of a sudden it will not upload photos and I have done everything I know to make it work including deleting the app. With all the stuff I had on my old acct. Just to see if it was that acct. I reloaded it on my phone and it still will not upload... Frustrated seriously.....,2
2178,OfferUp has great deals!!,5
2179,so far I have no issues with it and I can lift up on this site that I can't list on marketplace what's the biggest thing I like,5
2180,not bad just learning how to use it .....,4
2181,So much ads. I honestly miss letgo it was a much better app. Now you get ads everywhere and the worst part is the amount of scammers and products that aren't Available. Greed ruins everything,1
2182,Don't tell me I have to download your app!,1
2183,Bots ads and no longer perseon to person sell or buy. This ap is now trash. üñïüñïüñïüñï hope the company loses money.,1
2184,Hard to figure out like when u wanna sell something,3

2186,"MINUS 10 STARS! Had item up for sale for a year. Didnt sell.Archived it. Unarchived about 3 weeks ago, OfferUp deleted my post. Said it violated their public health policy.

2187,It pretty much dead if you're trying to sell PS3 games or anime figures. The site's audience is too small and not diverse. Your reply is just an automated response. It's quite clear that they didn't even read my review.,1
2188,great app! love it,5
2189,"great app for the most part people reply quickly, and it connects you to alot of stuff for sale",5
2190,Great place to shop,5

2192,"Way too many ads. Don't want Esty items on offer up app. I don't sell items, i just buy so i don't want my info on app. Says there are 4 msgs but when i click on it there is nothing. App also disappears in the middle of me brousing. Was going to uninstall but maybe this review will help.",2

2196,"There are better prices than I find on Marketplace, but it doesn't help much when it seems like 70% of the sellers don't answer your messages.",3
2197,No customer care at all just Ai responses to complaints have been attempting to collect payment for a item sold for over a week now i do not recommend selling anything on this app it is easy to get scammed and there is nothing you can do about it they stole my items and money,1
2198,New to it,3
2199,Worst app on the market it's all scams,1
2200,I have never seen a selling app that does forced ads until now. The money grab is sad and unnecessary (no a response about needing it to fund the app rather than line the ceo's pockets wont change my mind). Use market place on Facebook and save yourself time of your life being wasted by merge game adds when you're just trying to find a used couch.,1
2201,I absolutely love this app.,5
2202,it went just fine. üòÅüëçüí≤üí≤üí≤,4

2204,Has full screen popup ads that you can't back out of,1
2205,Mf'n AWSOME!!,5
2206,"The app is okay. Selling is slow and lots of low offers come in even if your items are discounted. My problem is with their online support. I sold a few items online and never got paid. They say my funds went to some account, which isn't mine, and there isn't anything I can do about it and neither can they. Save yourself time and money. Go to eBay where there is support.",1
2207,"it's awesome gives more options to people that utallize properly,lol",5
2208,I've met a lot of really nice people and sold items and bought items through advertising on Offer Up.,5

Tried to bu a lawnmower and received no confirmation number or email. After paying $70 bucks for what we thought was going to be a lawnmower, I was told that the $70 paid was for a ""chance"" to win a lawnmower. The company cleverly called itself Orevstock and the number did not work. Buyer beware!!!",1
2211,Only had time to look at it once,1
2212,It's exactly what you think it is.,5
2213,why tf does this app have ads,1
2214,1 1 T ...._. 1.. . .,4

2222,I accidentally pressed the ship button without trying and whwn I tried to deny or undo I was not helped,1
2223,"How do you see the people you start to follow in this app? Anyone knows, did it change",5
2224,I feel like u guys take more than what you advertise?,3
2225,"This app sucks,if you don't pay for using it the seller won't receive your text, lame.",1
2226,I've been using this app for years. But I've been gone for a little bit but I am right back. And this app is better than ever.,5
2227,Very unhappy with offerUp always having problems logging in and verifying. Then for no reason I get locked out saying I was in violation... But doesn't explain how. Can't ever seem to be able to keep my password. They always want me to reset it and verifying but won't let me verify my damn phone number. I don't recommend it to anyone I know. I sold one thing and then boom can't access it anymore.,1
2228,Awesome,5
2229,The app constantly freeze and stops working.,4
2230,Filter is not definitely,4
2231,You need to make is so you can filter out the dealerships and scamers,1
2232,"so much better before premium option, now you pay money to have higher precedence, otherwise seems like you post an ad and it gets hidden. they should do a mandatory renew email or text after like every 30-60 days. some ads on it for years!",2
2233,Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,5
2234,this app is the app! honestly if you're going to sell something OfferUp is one of the best places to put your items for sale.,5
2235,You can't even browse without getting full screen unskippable video ads. Notification system is abused to promote stuff instead of real messages. The app just feels like a greedy mess. I will use Craigslist from now on.,1
2236,"I am selling of behalf of my business. I post pictures of the item and the correct price, yet my items keep getting taken down. They even deleted my account and I had to appeal it to get it reactivated. Then they did it again and made me use Tru Verify to put my posts back. Got another email that my items are removed again for ""manipulating"" prices for search results. If the video games are $3 each then I'm gonna put $3. This app has me really annoyed that they do this with no reason... üêïüí©",1
2237,Update: yet again they have made their app worse. Way to go!!! Letgo was 100000% better! The people that made this cannot even make an app that loads messages. Lol!!!! Pure bots now. Idiots. They ALLOW bots to spam ads. It's all you see now. Look at all the 1 star reviews.,1
2238,App kicks me out every 15 sec,1
2239,love it,5
2240,"great app for selling stuff you bo linger need and a great app for buying something you need, very easy to use",5
2241,This app is full of scams in the car and truck even trailer section. So much spam fake scam post that I gave up using it. Craigslist has more real post,1
2242,Too many ads. Filters don't work... Also why do I have to click on an item before I can see the price??,1
2243,Too many ads now.,1
2244,helps me make extra money as well as find things I may need to get but on a deal,5
2245,"When understanding how to sell things, this app is very easy to use. This app basically helps us sell things for free. That's insane",5
2246,awsum,5
2247,Back in the day like about 5-6 years ago it was good with no ads. Now this app has gone drastically down for me because there's just way too many ads.,1
2248,I dislike how long the payments take we wait for so long for the package to get to the customer then we have to wait 5 more days until we get the payment. I could've just sold stuff on Ebay or put it on Facebook to get paid quickly.,1
2249,Excellent way to get your for sell items seen by others.,5
2250,as far as the app and platform function this is a great app however alot if not most of the people who use it are flakes and do nothing but waste your time.,4
2251,"so far, so good",4
2252,"Application is forcing me to sign up for ID verification in the middle of a sale. My account has 50+ 5Star reviews, and today all of a sudden they disable my ability to send messages, and force me to join TruYou. TruYou is a service that uses Onfido, which has been hacked and leaked user IDs and personal information in the past. I have no idea why a local selling app is using this rubbish service. This app is full of scammed, don't waste your time. Support is also useless.",1
2253,"Too many businesses listing their stuff. Definitely, get rid of ""TEMU""!! and my rating goes up to five stars!.",2
2254,great buy's,5
2255,Last few times I used this app it was 90% stores/dealers spamming their gear with fake prices(say one price on the listing them in the description says that's how much it is money down.) Now the app won't even load (even before the last update). Freezes on the offer up screen.,1
2256,amazing.,5
2257,Great! I bought a washer and dryer set yesterday. I love it. Thanks,5
2258,"They'll take down your post for advertising what you're selling, which is crazy to me, seeing as though this is an app for advertising? They try to trick you with what they pull up and THEY are constantly advertising pricing for increased activity on your post, it's all a scam.",1
2259,"Amazing has came in clutch when short on cash a few times. I love this app everything I see I'm like ""UCAN SELL THAT ON OFFERUP"" next thin yu no I'm a hoarder not a broke hoarder just... A hoarder hahaha. It is slow when loadin and also they should allow U to sell almost anything ESPECIALLY puppies or kittens.

2266,üëç,5
2267,"Good app. Easy and fast to post. The thing this app lacks is a ""Pending Pickup"" checkbox for a post, to let people know that someone else has beaten them to the deal. Then if the app developer wants to truly be sadistic, a queue for the first fifteen responders. "" You are number twelve in line."" ""You are now move up to number eight in line."" ""You have now been bumped up to number two in line."" ""Sorry the item has been claimed by a person ahead of you in line.""",4

2274,"There are a ton of scammers on this app... However, there is a 2-day buyer protection if you have it shipped so at least there's that. My main issue, however, is the usage of full screen ads.

I am okay with banners or advertisements that are mixed into the search results but I do not tolerate a full screen ad... Especially when the app charges you for additional features.",2

2287,Used to love this ap. It doesn't stay in my area keeps showing all over USA,1
2288,"Seriously, this app has had one of the worst downfalls I have seen in quite some time. From sellers who have listings with no intent to actually sell anything to items that say shipping but have no means to ship. It's been a struggle to even find anything to actually buy and to get contact from anyone if you're not a premium member(which is really ridiculous to have a subscription for this app). Hopefully, this app will be revamped for the buyers because it's been a waste of time for me.",1
2289,I love the offer up website for posting your items for sale. I'm old fashion about some things and I'm soooo glad they don't do auctions. I get so confused on that. I just don't like it a bit. That is another reason I chose OfferUp. It's so simple. and I like simple.,5
2290,App keeps closing on its own for some reason it's really irritating especially when your looking to buy,1
2291,Can't even get it to load anymore.,3
2292,Love it!,4
2293,To much questions to join in?,1
2294,Gd app,4
2295,Helps me find everything I need at a great price,5
2296,I was hoping it would be used and not a store posting their offerings. Lame.,3
2297,"Ad within ten seconds of opening. What a BS way to start a search, no wonder nobody uses it anymore. Just depressing. Uninstall.",1
2298,great job,5
2299,Pop up ads are terrible,1
2300,great app only problem is it's slow sometimes and after a while of looking it kicks me out other than that it's good,4
2301,my experience have been great so far.,4
2302,The constant interruptions by ads should not interfere w offer up deals !,3
2303,very slow. a lot of unnecessary features. plus this app makes your phone slow if you allow it access to the pictures. craiglist is better,1
2304,Good üëç,5
2305,Obtrusive ads. I'll be taking all my business to Craigslist where I'm not forced to watch ads.,1
2306,"Biggest gripe is that it doesn't show price when browsing, arguably the most important piece of information. The only way to see the price is to click through and find it in the detailed description. A bit slow on a new flagship phone.",2
2307,"Old listing that are not active sales, stay too long. Waste time waiting on responses from dead listings.",1
2308,"It was great. I had, like, 34 ratings with 5 stars. Then, one day, they locked and prohibited my account, saying I violated the guidelines of the offer app. I asked why if I was only purchasing like I normally do, and they said nothing. They said it is their right to lock any account and new accounts are not allowed. I recommend that you do not use this app. They are being irrational with their users and it is not a trusted app anymore because you cannot trust them.",1
2309,"Used to be much better. No way to search by latest items, or colsest to you. Time the item was listed has been removed. Algorithm keeps throwing at you what it thinks you want to see. Full screen popups. Large ads placed among items for sale. Getting done with this app.",2
2310,ads and poor set up,1
2311,Love it,5
2312,"Pretty pissed off you're now forcing 15 and 30 second ads and constantly interrupting my search for items... I'll start using other sites that don't..it's now running so slow, it's taking forever to post ads with all your stupid ads everywhere..and why do allow tons of ads that are for profit retail biz to advertise in the ""free section""? And allow ""best offer""? That's not free...90%of the ads in the free section aren't free! There's nothing to talk about with customer care.. What a joke ! SSDD!",1
2313,I think posts are blocked if you don't pay to promote. I never get replies when I inquire about items. I think messages are filtered. This app is pointless.,1
2314,"Someone got into my phone and posted someone, and I got a ban. I tried explaining the problem to get unban, but they wouldn't unban me, and I had messages with people to buy stuff.",1
2315,Can I just look before downloading the app?,2
2316,this is the best you can faun evriting and eniting,5
2317,amazing deals,5
2318,Its not logging me in,5
2319,not able to cancel,1
2320,always has something for me at good prices.,5
2321,"it works but like many apps it can be made better, the filter for car shopping is not great",3
2322,Why doesn't the date for listings show anymore?,3
2323,To many adds,1
2324,can't use with VPN. bye Felicia.,1
2325,searching for some items hoping I get response,4
2326,"It just got worse. You now have to pay a subscription to sell. Uninstalled. I started out with Letgo. Letgo was much better. On Offerup I get mostly spam messages from out of state buyers that want you to ship a $5 item. Some kind of scam I'm sure. Sold many items on letgo, but almost nothing on offerup, just constantly getting messages that just seem to be bots or scammers. Wish I could get letgo back. Guess it's time to look for something better.",1
2327,Terrible . Only scam artists from india responded . Impossinle to cancel or stop charges from offer up . Be very careful .,1
2328,Not enough choices,4
2329,A....YOU KNOW I'M THINKING THE SAME WAY YOU ARE. FIND IT....GET IT...GOT IT!! ü§ù,4
2330,I was black listed for no apparent reason this app is not a good place to sell your goods !!,1
2331,Used to be great app now full of scams and advertising.,1
2332,"it takes a minute to get use to,but it's worth the wait",5
2333,This app has gone Downhill and it's sad to see.You cannot use this app without worrying about being scammed. I've been on here as a seller and also as a buyer. And I've had a horrible experience with both. When I was a seller I kept getting multiple fake messages of people pretending that they wanted to buy the item and then afterwards asking for my bank information and using other advanced scams to get my information. When I was on here as a buyer I would buy the items and never get them.,1
2334,very good.,5
2335,too many lowballers. 90%,2
2336,"OfferUp has unfortunately gone down hill incredibly quickly. It was my go to buy/sell/trade app for years and now it's suddenly terrible. 1. There are now ads anytime you message someone. 2. It constantly touts premium as the better service instead of the standard. 3. The new community guidelines are INSANE!!! No indication that your message to someone ""violates community guidelines"" or an explanation of what you said. As an active user, use anything else now.",1
2337,"I don't Use anymore.There's so much ads, And also so slow.",1
2338,no one gets messages even though says delivered. sent messages to people I know to make sure. customer service isn't helping,1
2339,Forces people to upload personal ID? Hell no,1
2340,Awesome app,5
2341,"Sold items on the app but the money has never actually made it to my bank account. It just sits in the app as ""deposit pending"".",1
2342,"Terrible app. Buffers and lags every time I log in. Do everyone a favor, burn it and trash it.",1
2343,"Thu20240509 @OfferUp #OfferUp Gracias üôè! Mahalo mil üôèüèΩ!

2346,I wish there was a way to retrieve deleted messages. I accidentally deleted some valuable leads.,5
2347,The insane amount of ads ruins the whole experience. Can't filter products by date or distance. Your search results are littered with 3rd party ads and commercial business trying to sell you items at full price.,1
2348,"Listed 2 items for sale. One got flagged for being pornographic and then I was also TOLD that I was a vendor selling my products. Emailed back and explained my product was brand new in a sealed box, I am in fact not a vendor and wasn't sure how it was pornographic. They continued with different reasons, so I just deleted my account. No sense in argueing if they won't actually look at the screenshot or read the description.",1
2349,ditch the pop up ads,3
2350,not getting buyers this time,3
2351,love it!,5
2352,"about to give up on this app , was charged $20 to advertise one item that got three extra views no messages nothing",1
2353,Good would like to find a dinning room set,4
2354,super deals,5
2355,too many adds,1
2356,"Ineffective and ad-laden. I ran identical listings on offerup, Craigslist. Craigslist has trounced this app/service and with less annoying baggage.",2
2357,amazinƒù,5
2358,I really enjoyed letgo. It had a great interface that made browsing easy. Swiping between ads and seeing the price and a couple photos. Having to back out of each item to go to the next just to get a price. It also defaults to local+shipping. If I wanted to ship something I would be on ebay. This was supposed to be a craigslist alternative but here we are. Updated:2024 this app still shows shipping even when selecting local only. I only want to see local,1
2359,kicked me out for no reason has bugs.,1
2360,"They show ""inbox"" notification bubbles when really it's just an ad ""more chairs for you!"". If you put a notification that I've received a message it should be because I've received a message.",1
2361,üòÉ,5
2362,"Ok app but there's so many bots or sketchy businesses making hundreds of posts with keywords in the post descriptions making the app useless in many cases. For example, look for appliances in Austin, TX. It's been like this for more than a year and I've made many reports. The same businesses continue and OfferUp hasn't done anything about it. Also, required phone verification. I don't have a phone, had to borrow a friend's phone",2
2363,"too many shady business, most of the stuff fake or not working properly",1
2364,Works great,5
2365,too long time to respond,2
2366,"Watch out, the adds they run are indeed fraud. Fake websites to fish for your credit card.",1
2367,They have Been charging me 21 dollars for the past 5 months,1
2368,Think I'd like the app except I can't sell anything since it will not accept my id. The back of my drivers license will not be.,1
2369,"The number of small business persons is ruining this app. I've used it for years now & sold/bought a lot, and have enjoyed it thoroughly. However, any more, looking for an item at a somewhat deal is insane. Small business owners post products at or above MSRP, oftentimes under multiple accounts. If I wanted to pay MSRP, I'd have bought it on the manufacturers website??? The onl way I've found to filter this is to select only used items, even then. And spam accounts are everywhere. Fix this plz",2
2370,The dirtiest scoundrel jerks that DONT EVEN HAVE A CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REACH OUT TO IN ANY FORM! STAY AWAY JUST A BIG GARBAGE CAN THAT WILL STEAL UR MONEY THEN YOU HAVE ANSOLUTELY NOONE TO HELP YOU!AA! STAY AWAY!,1
2371,"used to be my favorite but now there are ads, when you go to cars by owner they are all used dealerships and prices are outrageous, but my last three cars were all bought through this app! oh yeah the first page no longer shows a price on cars, you have to click it to see, damn I'm downgrading this app",2
2372,it's just wonderful,5
2373,Was charged for promotion items and didn't know I signed up. They took money from my account without me knowing.,1
2374,They close my account!!! I asked for a review and didn't give any reason for that accion!!üò°,1
2375,"Too many basic features and tasks are mobile only. You cannot create a listing nor add photos or edit listings on a web browser. As a result, selling is a huge pain. Very low to non-existent response rates in my area relative to other platforms with the same listings.",2
2376,"Wow. This app is great. Works well, great idea, and you never know what you will find.",5
2377,"Even if I select ""local only"" it's flooded with items that are shipped only. Also has advertisement videos it forces you to watch. Back to marketplace for me.",1
2378,"Not able to share additional photos with potential buyers within the app. They don't recommend communicating outside of the app, but sharing additional photos is pretty fundamental in buying and selling. Also do not recommend using this app if you plan to ship your goods. They charge ridiculous fees from buyer AND seller. Works well for local transactions.",3
2379,It's pretty good I just can't seem to find out how to enable notifications,5
2380,it's easy to use compared to most apps similar to it also very fair with their costs to sellers. So far it is alot easier to work with then Ebay and not as crazy strict or suspending people for not knowing the rules as I had a friend who didn't know u can't let someone contact u without going through Ebay and got ki ked off without even a warning and payment took forever but she said offer up is much quicker to pay seller which I appreciate.,5
2381,I got set up by 10 kids snd gun point and stole all my jordans and belts10,5
2382,love this easy to use app,5
2383,hate the ads.,1
2384,"I'm just rechecking it out, will update",3
2385,Its easy to buy and sell your items and their protected shipping is just amazing as well.,5
2386,"Update: The developer pushed it to another department that has nothing to do with add in the app. An actual fix to this problem is to remove the adds all together. Adds cover most content, and there's way too many inappropriate adds poping up.",1
2387,Offerup is lame if you sell something and accidentally hit the promote button or sign up for trial period for $5 they'll just hit you with a random $20 charge later and not refund you if you tell them you never authorized some $20 charge. Penny pinchers and just desperate for your money,1
2388,Why can't I buy or sell on offer up iv done nothing wrong.,5
2389,always a pleasure,5
2390,Good,1
2391,lots of good deals at reasonable prices,4
2392,I love OfferUp easy app to navigate you can start selling immediately!!,5
2393,remove the old post's,2
2394,Now had annoying video ads that pop up when you accidentally scroll on something.,1
2395,just Awesome,5
2396,Each update just increases the amount of ads and they're getting to be very annoying. Full videos now. Default search ALWAYS includes shipping items. Unable to set as local only. App just getting worse over time.,1
2397,"This app before a lot of car I can see , now only a little because of need pay for sell a car",3
2398,easist and best place to find what youneed and make a good deal,5
2399,Dam app always freezing and closing out,3
2400,‚ù§Ô∏èCool App‚ù§Ô∏è,5
2401,good app I kinda like it,5
2402,Advertising takes the joy out of using this app. it's irrelevant and last to long. this went from my go to e-commerce app to last resort because of the advertising.,1
2403,Very radical. Sold a lot of stuff here!!,5
2404,lags alot,3
2405,most of the time it's a good place to get what you need,4
2406,No alert sound on notifications I have them aloud,4
2407,Too many ads. annoying!,1
2408,it's the best way to find what you are looking for at the best price,5
2409,Was amazing Now TRASH TRIED TO BUY MULITI ITEMS. NO RESPONSE BECAUSE OFFERUP WANTS MONEY. I OFFERED FULL PRICE FOR ALL ITEMS. ALL ITEMS HAVE SOLD WEEKS LATER. I WILL SEND MESSAGES TO SELLERS LETTING THE. KNOW HOW THEY GOT F ED,1
2410,There is always something new. It's really hard to choose somedays.,5
2411,have found alot of useful stuff and very easy to use,5

2413,easy to advertise and to sell.,5
2414,Awesome!,5
2415,You people are out of your mind your charging people to post stuff on here with all the scams well you might as well just delete your app,1
2416,This app used to be good before they allowed big dealerships to upload 5000 cars. Greed ruined the app.,1
2417,good üòä,5
2418,"Great opportunity to be able to sell all your things... The only thing I hope they improve is having all functions of platform available when using a ""desktop"" Thanks!",5
2419,Literally half of the people don't even respond or don't know how to price items. Now there's a premium option to chat with these bums too...very beautiful,2
2420,It's good but the ads have become intrusive and distracting diverting your attention from what you were originally looking for.,1
2421,it's good could be improved with more fictionalized functionality.,4
2422,Ridiculous!... I keep GETTING MY PROFILE BANNED FOR THE SILLIEST REASONS! all I did last time was post my mobile haircut services and the next day my profile is gone... I'm going on my 3rd profile now! Atleast give me some kinda warning before just ending all my years of building up my feedback rating and everything! This is crazy! I gotta keep starting over from scratch!,1
2423,Always the best,5
2424,yall not giving me what I ask for,1
2425,so far so good üëç,5
2426,people not responding to their post if they items are available or not,1
2427,"I can't buy anything from everyone or anyone cause all of a sudden they forget how to type, and I message like 100s of ppl and not 1, not 1 single answer. Like, what the problem with people do they think I'm mrbeast and want me to offer them 10000$ minimum for old trash broken piano that saids ""good"" or even ""Excellent"" condition for like fixed your server like 99% of people here probably download offerup and put it for sell then delete and never used there phone or think of looking at the app",1
2428,"Even tho notifications are all turned on, i never get notified for new messages so Im always late on responding or missing out on a message completely. Please fix",1
2429,I love this app. However lately I am not getting any notifications and I'm missing out on a lot of sales. I have done a troubleshoot and it's still not working. So now I guess I'll have to check it all the time. What a pain.,4
2430,I like having the ability to see things and buy things from individuals.,5
2431,so far this app suck,1
2432,"Way too many ads, and full screen ads. Makes me give up on using it all together. Removed the age of postings, so no idea if something has been listed for months or hours... Notifications can't be customized, so it's either ads and alerts and messages or nothing. So I choose nothing, and have to enable notifications as needed. Dumb, profit only driven decisions.",2
2433,It's really easy to use you find stuff as well as selling stuff I recommend this app. Thank you and God bless everyone üëäüòé,5
2434,"So many ads the phone gets hot. Don't call out scammers, apparently that gets you shadow banned and OfferUp takes a while to get back to you. Account was banned after doing this, so much for having a safe marketplace. Also have never gotten responses from support, just like the reply to this review, it's not reviewed, still have problems and the response is ""your account is active"". Regular customer service doesn't get back to you but the team who replied to my review did.",1
2435,I've sent an email,1
2436,its has more adds than stuff for sale,1
2437,"Bait and switch garbage!!! After you install and post an ad, it requires to database my ID and facial scan. Basically all your personal info. Not disclosed up front or no one would use this",1
2438,A lot of people scamming and sending fake links. Also nobody really buys anything on this anymore post rarely get seen unless you buy and they fake the views,2

2444,Awesome sauce!,5
2445,"easy,quick,fast",5
2446,Not even your soul could be sold on this app,1
2447,love the items on there... I try to give the people the most for their money when I post.... at prices and items worth grabbing... after all it is not brand new in a store...I am simply trying to get something back rather than throwing it away at Goodwill...,5
2448,always check for everything here before everywhere else.,5

2456,all selling and buys I made where quick and the product was as described.,5
2457,Will not load since last update.,1
2458,All the poop up adds are now out of control and so long. You have to constantly deselect the out area/ship items. The alerts are the same way.,2
2459,"Great app to sell stuff. Easy to navigate and setup. Only downside are potential buyers. Don't be surprised if you get a lot of flakes or get downright ghosted by someone who say they're definitely buying and never come through. Still, highly recommend.",4

2465,I have been using this app before there was a merger between the two. (Offer open and let go). The app has become a joke of what it once was. Populated by full screen ads and and buggy as hell. I can no longer recommend.,1
2466,You want me to pay to post certain items for sale? I'm good.,1
2467,Great app .i have never encountered a problem and I have done alot of transactions on both sides ..only thing is those adds could go if I have any problem would be that.lol,4
2468,There ripping people off because I had canceled the subscription through the app and Google play store. I even deleted the account associated with the app and they are still charging me.,1

2476,great app to buy and sale,5
2477,"Be aware of this app. They are cheat. They gave me 3 day free promote plus trial and charged on day 1 itself. When i asked them, they said no refund, period. I will be filing dispute and also complaint to the appropriate offices.",1
2478,Really too early to tell but I've posted numerous needful items at fair prices on here and haven't gotten one message. I also got an email from offer up telling me that I was receiving a $30 virtual gift card but when I clicked the link it said the link didn't exist?,2
2479,Their location manager is smokin crack,1
2480,Awesome!,5
2481,"OfferUp boasts a great platform, but the user experience is marred by an onslaught of scam messages. Every inquiry seems to come from a scammer asking for personal information or offering theirs. Additionally, OfferUp's push for paid listing boosts feels futile when the buyer pool seems overrun by scammers.",1
2482,"Works mostly ok. The algorithms are clunky though. My most annoying gripe is the fact that I can't post part numbers sometimes because it thinks they're cell phone numbers and censores them, even if they look nothing like phone numbers. How the hell are people supposed to sell parts on a selling platform if half the time the algorithm screws it up? Unacceptable imo.",3
2483,"Worse app, customer service is üí©. I hope to see this app drain to the toilet. Don't bother asking contact costumer service for just to repeat and spam my inbox about my account being deactivated for only posting a firestick. Useless",1

2485,a great source of treasures,5

2487,Wonderful place to buy and sell things online.,4
2488,Best app for buying and selling got my F150 truck running strong 4ys later üí™,5
2489,This app is one of the worst I've ever downloaded. Posted 3 items with pictures and very detailed descriptions. Verified my email and phone number just like they asked. By the same time next day all 3 posts had been deleted by the company with no reason as to why. Tried to reach out to customer service to find out why all of my posts had been deleted and got no response whatsoever. I would give this app NEGATIVE 5 STARS if I was allowed to do so. If you value your time don't waste it on OfferUp.,1
2490,üõë‚ö†Ô∏èüö´Trash! scam app. Nothing but BOTS looking to steal your information,1
2491,the app crashes occasionally,1
2492,I would not recommend !!!! I received 2 out of 4 broken bowls and did not receive one item that I paid a ridiculous amount on shipping. One broken bowl was not even a complete bowl! With pieces of a broken bowl missing it definitely was not postal issues.Seller just wants to argue over a partial refund . Beware of this app!,1

2513,"I have used OfferUp since day 1, selling and buying with ease BUT recently, either no one is selling anything anymore or the settings when you want to search locally within 10 miles is not working. Its very disappointing they had to add all these ads and other features that were not needed.",1

2518,Ever since they joined letgo the app is hot garbage. Used to be a serious flipper but this app and the people trying to buy from you make me wanna sit in a bathtub with a toaster plugged in.,1
2519,No access with VPN,1
2520,too many ads,3

2523,I use to love this app before they sold their souls to the Almighty corporate gods now unless you pay for the upgraded version you are not going to sell anything and even then now you have to compete with ebay amaZon walmart etc,1
2524,"All but useless! Filters don't work. Put in a parameters like ""nearby"" and/or within 30 miles brings up items many items hundreds and thousands of miles away!! Even listings that say local pickup only. Listings are not removed if sold. Also seeing many scams where items are shown at a great price, yet very suspect. Especially if you attempt to get additional information. NO way to contact the OfferUp staff for issues.",1

2527,The addition of ads that take up the whole screen and waste time has made this app beyond tolerating. The ads presented as listings were bad enough. I'm over it.,1
2528,"Overcharge payment processing fees if paying through the app, throttle messages for free-level members, limit number of posts then offer to allow more of paid for... All on TOP of already getting advertising income.",3

Update May 2024: I haven't used OfferUp in a year, but after upgrading to an S20 from an S7, the app definitely runs better and smoother, so not sure if the slowness issue has been fixed in the app or by getting a phone that can handle it better.",4
2536,"May 2024 update- now there's random full screen ads. Removing the app now, since I can block the ads if I just use the website. The app is very dumbed down and otherwise extremely annoying to use, top examples: 1. Search modifiers don't work 2. Resets to local+shipping with every new search, rather than saving your settings 3. Ads look too much like other listings, frequently click on them and end up going to an external link",1
2537,"The App. Is ridiculous, for example if im in a conversation regarding a sale and I'm the last to respond, it should not show up on the messages tag as a new message , but every damn time it does. So I open app, get all happy cuz Im thinking i got a response from one of the numerous flakes on here and there's nothing. No new reply, nada. Most people that use the app are lowballers, flakes and liars. I despise this app and the clowns that abuse it. If you aren't going to buy, then don't bother!!",1

I opened a support request and have heard nothing back. How are you suppose to sell anything when the scripts are not coded properly and remove listings for no valid reason? I just want to list some furniture I have to sell. Can someone from support please help?",2

This app is good but be prepared to waste some time accidentally clicking on a ad or a pop up ad comes up.",1
2543,Sell easy,4
2544,"Hasn't been very useful since they merged with LetGo. Filters don't stick, I can't add a credit card for non-local buys, and they constantly spam with results from ""saved"" searches, despite not having any. Add that to the rampant scam posts, and I'm just done with this app. Update: I have previously worked with support without resolution. I'm not interested in wasting more time with that.",2
2545,Un-installed because of ads. I used to promote it quite a bit at work (moving & storage industry). Started off with the hidden ads disguised as things for sale. Then videos... no thanks.,2
2546,The most horrible app ever I wish letgo was still around this app sucks big time they proclaimed you violated there policy when you advertise your product or business by doing any type of repair work but yet they let you sell paint or drywall materials or house hold items or their app they don't cover victims of scam unlike ebay or Amazon a real marketing place to promote business or sell your items but yet they want you pay to put your items in front of customers this sham garbage !,1

2561,my seller was excellent he was accurate and no lies,5
2562,Dude this app sucks! It used to be cool until they bought out Letgo. I do a lot of sales on this app too! They made full page ads mandatory which I hate and they bought letgo which was great but completely dissolved it. Lost half my customers at that time. I met the guy who created this app years ago in San Diego and he was cool. I am so disappointed at how they have changed everything for the worse. If there was another app even remotely as many users I would leave in a heartbeat.,2
2563,"Most of the time, in my experience, potential buyers are playing with the sellers by asking questions and pretending interest, then never responding back. It's very frustrating. We are listing items to sell, not playing a perverse game, as some of the potential buyers seem to be.",2

The recent time I listed items and few hours after I paid for the subscription I was denied access to my own account on some untrue unrelated and in No violotion of any terms.So I wish they would minimum reimburs me and stop billing me for the subscription I didn't get to use or can use due to such poor decisions of the app.,1

2737,"I'm loving the shipping option, highly recommend it.",5
2738,Garbage,1
2739,50% chance it's already sold. 75% chance they wont/can't respond. Lots of flakes and some flake while OTW and deactivate their account as to not get a bad review. Still use the service because it's good when it's updated.,3
2740,Perfection,5
2741,the notification fails to to tell me if a message is sent but everything else is ok,2
2742,Is good experience.,4
2743,I like Offerup cause it's easy to use.,5
2744,now your offer's are throttled unless you pay,1
2745,very user-friendly and a great tool to use when you need it earn some extra money or just get rid of some treasures,5
2746,Never had a bad experience,5
2747,"Almost daily annoying notifications and only one option so I either see important messages about items and spam daily, or nothing at all.",2
2748,Great app. Although it is very slow. Thought it was the phone.,3
2749,"I've a perfect 5-star (buyer) rating with countless successful transactions over many years. *I assume* a single false report based on a buyer misunderstanding - probably related to the HORRIBLE Lagging message system -and POOF account deleted! OfferUp refuses to even cite whatever the alleged violation is. (NONE). This company is going the same as sh** shows like Etsy. Down the drain. Alsdo, the app itself needs A LOT of work - like the option to hide listings a user no longer wants to see.",1
2750,"I'm unable to see only local items. Even when I filter for local only items within a 30 mile radius, it shows me items that are 300+ miles away. I also get garbage notifications about related items or suggested items that I have no interest in. There is no way to disable these types of notifications. So I've disabled notifications for the app but that makes it more difficult to know when I get messages. I don't know what else to do. Someone please tell me about a different app to use.",1

2752,great job,5
2753,shadi,1
2754,"Rampant low ball offers and ads being served as notifications, notification system that's predatory to only serve ads enable it for messages and they start trying to sell you items on your system tray. Selling an 800 dollar item for 400 in perfect condition with boxes OBO considering 300-360 range as okay for offers but then you get offers asking for free or for 90 dollars. I've never had this issue on reverb or eBay. This platform needs serious work and moderation.",1
2755,You are ruining the app with too many ads.,1
2756,I sold quite an inventory n guess what was diddly right,4
2757,I like the app but the adds are more annoying and more frequent then they used to be.,3
2758,"‚óè If you post a pet for adoption etc.. They're real quick to take it down but they could've created tabs for rehoming, lost or found pets, adoption, or temporary pet care taker. ‚óè Businesses will overload the app. With Ads under ""Free"" section making it difficult to really search free items. They should be real quick to remove these ""Free"" fake biz Ads. Here's an opportunity to make $$ & offer Package fees and duration of the Ad expiration date. It provides better experience for app users.",2
2759,I'm not sure I like offerups non privacy rules.,3
2760,ITS GREAT!!!!,5
2761,Great way to buy and sell merch.,5

2763,"Legit App. Great buying & selling experience unlike FB Marketplace, or Craig's List that's full of scammers!!",5
2764,highly recommend,5
2765,They ban you from the app with no explanation. I made an account and I was trying to make a purchase and got banned for nothing and they didn't give me an explanation. They basically said they can ban you anytime they want without reason.,1
2766,stopped working I can't send offers anymore,1
2767,Awesome Yes Sir.,5
2768,"Update 2: The app seems to have fixed the bugs for the most part, but there are definitely still some issues with app performance and opening links and redirecting to the affiliated listing on the app. For the most part, Offerup is just average overall.",3
2769,"I'm really unhappy with this app, and ever since they combined with letgo about 2 years ago, I've noticed a reduction in service, an increase of operating costs on the buyer and seller. But specifically I had 2 items I sold and had to ship them. The post office told me they couldn't use the shipping labels, so I just paid the shipping cost on both, 18$. And I never got paid. So I am out 25 + 45 +18 {88$). I reached out to both buyers, and offer up. They tried to sell me a buyer protection.",1
2770,"The only thing I don't like and has never changed is that you have to change the distance and the local options every single time you open the app. Leave it set the way I have it, and I can change it if myself if I need to. I always have to change it from shipping to local, and the distance from 30 miles to maximum.",1
2771,"the website is much easier to use than the app, and it's absolutely disgusting that they hide ads in the middle of real listings without suitable markings just to trick you into clicking on them. I secretly think that's why they make the tiles so tiny on the app so one can't obviously tell it's fake so you click on it to see what the listing is but haha it's an ad so they made 10¬¢ off you",2

2783,"Update: my account was banned after writing this review. Customer service refuses to help or give information, making the help suggestion from the developer useless. Every item I have posted for a month disappears and contacting customer service just results in a ton of work for me, no change or help with the situation, and eventually I get locked out for the month for ""posting"" so many items. They stated this is a known bug. The app is completely unusable.",1
2784,Recommended item notifications show as inbox message. no way to turn these off.,2
2785,easy to use.,4
2786,99% of the ads are misleading. they advertise low price then in the add say it's just first paymant. total scam the app does nothing to stop such scam ads. they responded asking to email them. I already did before posting the review. of course no one reply back. Google should reconsider removing this app from the store,1
2787,sold my items quickly !,4
2788,"Not intuitive as to how to edit my add. Appears you have to start entirely over. Also, not sure how to set up to receive notifications. Also pop-ups interfere when I am inputting information",1
2789,OK,5
2790,"Super sad that you have to pay now to list your items. Will not be using this app anymore to post items. Will only be buying. It would be nice if you could rate a person before you make the purchase as there are many people that you will be in contact with to buy something and then they sell the item when you had an agreement to pick it up. Also, I don't like how they changed where you can see how many days ago an item was listed. Other than that I have really enjoyed OfferUp.",2
2791,great for selling your extra stuff.,5

2794,Awful app. Ads instead of listings. Deletes your listings. Doesn't allow for verification.,1
2795,Would be great if buyers reviews would show on sellers profile... with comment section to avoid sketchy shady sellers... Please offer up not cool getting ripped off . *Needs to delete old post,3
2796,i love it,5
2797,"Posted an item for sale and it got deleted. Reposted the item 3 times and it got deleted all 3 times due to ""advertisement"" per offerup",1
2798,Great help to my small business. Just got to be careful with who you are dealing with and never send the money op front. Go check out the items first in person and then decide whether or not you want to buy or sell the item,5
2799,I like offerup but people need to stop posting stuff that's not free under the free stuff people get annoyed with that,4
2800,"Can't even enter the app since the last update. I've done everything I could think of to get it to start, but it just stays on a loading screen.",1
2801,This app is an amazing market place. Love it,5
2802,i can't send messages,1
2803,It's actually a good app when you're looking for something very cheap you can find a good running car for very cheap,5
2804,"There is more advertising now. Also, it seems like my posts for listing's get buried just so that they can push their promotions to boost your items for sale.",1
2805,"For 8 yrs and different cities, I have used OfferUp. I have always found items I need at great prices. I have sold many items last minute as the moving truck was full. Those still sold at fair prices to both of us within 1 hour. This is my go-to app anytime I need toys, furniture, decor & stuff I did not know I needed. For me, everyone has been nice, honestly and friendly. I love the new buy it now feature. I have bought and sold every way Offer up allows, all have been flawless. 5+stars",5

2818,Although I had my location and miles set.When I would search for something it would send me to a whole another state.There was no real way to Purchase anything for one thing.I never saw a price.Second there were no options to buy or even message the seller. Honestly for Me.It was just another source of frus dration trying to purchase.,1
2819,I purchased an item 5 days ago and it still hasn't shipped out so I emailed offerup 3 days ago and I still haven't got a response! I will not be purchasing anything with ahipping using this app ever again.,1

2824,Used to be great. Now it's genuinely a horrible app. Crashes Everytime I use it. I've deleted and reinstalled it. My phone is completely updated. The app won't even let me report anything without completely crashing. It's just depressing. Can't even search for a car to get to work. So much for not having to take the bus,1

2840,"There's now a 30 minute timer before your items will be posted, otherwise you have to pay. This was not disclosed before posting. This is an issue when you're only available to post and sell certain hours. It's critical for making a sale for those immediate buyers who are available when a listing is made. I'm disgusted.",1
2841,"You might get lucky selling something, or you might get scammed by a bunch of bots that send identical messages to everyone. Something like ""wanna trade for a motorcycle?"" Then you get the morons at OfferUp with a combined IQ of 23. I wouldn't be surprised if you told me they had prehensile tails and were all birthed from two great grandparents. You know the Whitaker's from SWU? Imagine them after drinking. That's the team at OfferUp.",1

Altho now this app is so buggy and time delayed when it comes to touch option that of coarse it's not even frigging worth all the hype I was making about being kicked off for no reason! I really wish they would stop worrying about controlling every damn person aspect of there lives and use all that damn money to better society instead! All that money this is it?!",1
2845,"quick, easy purchase made. Seller shipped item on the same day! upon receipt, item proved to be exactly as described.",5

Only when an email came in for ""transaction declined""&""add another or update your payment please"" was I FINALLY able to cancel it. I searched this very spot on Google play store the day AFTER I signed up for the free trial for answers as to how to cancel just so THIS EXACT thing WOULDNT HAPPEN!! The Offerup app people need to get it together",1
2849,"Buyers here are the WORST. Full of low ballers and flakes. I definitely don't recommend this site. Also, HORRIBLE that there is no customer service 800 number, not even an Contact US Email.

2850,best app ever,5

I have receipts that show products were delivered. very scammy feel about this company.",1
2862,great site,5
2863,"So, I deleted my account a couple years ago and only made 3 listings before deleting it. I redownloaded it yesterday to see if the bots and scams had been weeded out so I could actually use it just to find out I had been banned from the app. They claimed I broke their listing policy rules multiple times after been given supposed warnings.

I messaged them to resolved this, they were incredibly rude and refused to refund.

Incredibly disappointed because I used to love their app.",1
2865,yeah,5
2866,They need to be sued they ban your account for anything literally for no reason. You can report someone or if some one steals from you they will ban your account not the other person its crazy they are very bitter and they are very evil people..

The app shorts out(shuts down), because the add system I'm sure. They make you pay a monthly fee to get rid of the problem but let's be real. I'd rather use Craigslist, Facebook, or any other platform. There are way too many issues with this app now. Rework it, do something different. I used to promote this app and prefer it.",1

2905,Offer Up is a good source for items you need but might not be able to afford at the store. You set your search criteria and when you find your item it could be a neighbor down the street or someone close by. Your getting a good deal and helping them at the same time.,4

They need much more help with removing the fakes. 50% of the items are ""will give away to whoever does this and sends to -insert fake phone number-"" Can't even enjoy the shopping because you have to root through it all to find anything legitimate or that makes sense. And besides that, people really overestimate the worth of their items. They try to sell at MSRP for used things. It's so rare to find a fair and actually sane deal. Not worth downloading.",2

2917,Used to be a good app. The shipping ability was a good addition. Until you try to get paid. Should change the name to Offer Up Used Cars. Can't filter out the overpriced car dealers spamming the whole app to death. Want to buy a used 1996 Toyota with a salvage title for 10000 dollars? No? I don't either. Make an ability to filter the commercial sellers out. Make it so settings work. Not shopping nationwide for firewood or cars and trucks.,1

Further, the area where on OFFER IP on Google Play where one might cancel, only directs back to Google Play to cancel. So disappointed that I have no recourse. Especially since Offer Up says there is nothings it's customer service reps can do to help or reverse subscriptioncharges once they're made. Seems like a scam.",1

It's safer to buy from someone with no history at all then a scammer. Edit 07/20/23: Customer support did not help recover my missing messages. Edit 04/23/2024: Still randomly losing messages.,1
2935,good app,4
2936,No one responds to there listing and some of the listing are so old was put on there when offerup started. Listing should be taken off if not updated.If you tag them nothing happens.,2
2937,I usually don't write reviews. But pls make your app faster. It's super slow and sucks. People will stop using offerup and switch completely to FB marketplace or ebay for used stuff,1
2938,I'd put 5 stars but just too many people posting 10x the same thing,4
2939,Ok,4
2940,"Offerup =yelp, fake website that forces u to download the app to use! unable to msg sellers w/o verifying & NO verify link on the website/ what I'm using, so I can't use the site! Support are bots that don't read msgs! App missing vital features like post dates, so 3yr old listings show up, also no price on thumbnails, stuff an amateur could program in secs. No selllers are verified tho & scammers reported R still listed. Too many ads. App takes up too much storage & a battery killer",1
2941,Service Fee is 13% on shipping orders. I had no idea they were going to take that much just for giving me a shipping label to print. I could've done it myself and saved $50 on my last sale. Don't ship an order more expensive than like $75. Just love it when I get a surprise like this.,1
2942,Really a place to find great deals and is especially good for larger items which are too difficult for selling on eBay due to shipping impossibilities.,5
2943,This app really has random ads now? Peace,1
2944,Ugh the ads make unusable,1
2945,awesome app.,5
2946,great buys when looking for items.,5
2947,Lots of. Nice things to look at.,5
2948,Great App to sell items others may want ir need...,5
2949,Awesome!¬°!!!!!! Awesome ¬°!!!,5
2950,OfferUp promotion plus service is a scam. Paying $20 a month for only a handful of added views each day is not worth the money. You're better off archiving and reposting your ad each day for free. It's a complete scam.,1
2951,slow response,4
2952,waste of time. all the sellers are a scam,1
2953,very good üëçüëçüòäüòä,5
2954,excelente ¬°!!!!!! me encant√≥ ¬°!!!!!! perfecto!!! ... n. nnnnnnnnn.,5
2955,No complaints it does what it does,5
2956,"Product has been sold, shipped, and received buy the buyer! 5 days and I still haven't received payment. Not very impressed",2
2957,Great prices app,5
2958,What a horrible app. Let go was way better. I set the settings on local pickup and it shows me everything but local. And it only shows pictures. You have to click on the picture to see price and location. I'd give it 0 stars if I could but It's not an option.,1
2959,it's just good,4
2960,"This app has gone downhill. Sooo many scammers, you can't distinguish local from a specific zip code, have to constantly refresh or Input needs of location. Just not a good app anymore",2
2961,"Not bad, slow responses. Maybe need a better way to alert sellers about buyers waiting. Good place to find things for pretty good prices.",5
2962,"Negative 5 stars. So desperate for attention they send a million useless notifications you can't turn off. Slowest app ever, especially when you are selling. The more items you post, the slower it gets. Very long lag with message notifications. Extremely frustrating to use, almost unusable. Total trash. Then they want to try to charge you to promote items and take 12.9% of sold items that get shipped plus buyer pays too much for shipping, it's not worth shipping anything. Total piece of junk.",1
2963,I LOVE it so far!!!,5
2964,I love this app,5
2965,"Slow app, not flexible and nothing possible to do on your browser. This app sucks",1
2966,wanted a little sooner,4
2967,Very reliable.,5
2968,"Dang tick tock blows up in my face all the time and I have to go to local or ship every time. I mean every time I get on it.. Aggravating..I don't do shipping..they should know that by now.Then they tell you to contact them via another email address off the site after they have read your complaint! Seams they just love to aggravate users ..And yes bunch of old post and rude sellers fuss you out ,won't work with you to meet half way if they answer you at all ...... Don't recommend it..",1
2969,They deleted my postings because my ID is expired. Like I'm selling gold or diamonds. If you experience the same go to Facebook Marketplace instead of this problematic app.,1
2970,This app blows not worth your time trying to buy or sell anything no one is responsive,1
2971,"If I could rate this a zero star I would, how they gonna disable my account for trying to sell contact lens, when alot of other ppl are selling them as well, yet they still have there accounts üòí",1
2972,Great app ...,5
2973,one of the best selling/trading app platform on the market. I haven't seen a better one yet.,5
2974,"Totally not customer oriented. Even the customer support trying their best to not support you. Their rules are voided by themselves on automatic level ! Don't believe their purchase platform, along with their shipping policy. Totally a garbage service and wasting of time.",1
2975,Why aren't dates showing for when things were posted? I have no idea if it was just posted or from months or years ago. Have to login on my laptop to see this info. Really should fix that.,2
2976,"VPN protects me from hackers and anybody adding anything trying to piggyback on me to trace me backwards or forwards. Got no idea what security you got. The only way I can use your program is to shut my VPN down. I paid for it. And eBay guarantees your $ back if ripped off. Give a rest, it sucks!!!",1
2977,easy to use,5
2978,Awesome !!!,5
2979,I've had a great experience with this app and find interesting things. Keep buying and selling everything is a find.,4
2980,Doesn't work,1
2981,Who doesnt like stuff for a low price?! Who doesnt like makeing money for things they dont need?!,5
2982,"Long time user here. The app is very good and well put and I always recommend it to anyone. You can search and sort by price, distance, and categories easily. Listing is also easy. 4 stars bc of the ""see more/see less"" function of the item description, you only see the first 3 lines. I think it should be deleted and just display the entire description like in Craigslist. Many times I've met with people just to waste time and have awkward moments bc they didn't read the entire description.",4
2983,K yeah I need to looking for cars and trucks and my stuff,5
2984,We love it.,5
2985,I have money in my account and want to cash it out. Won't let me. I updated my card and everytime I press cash out nothing happens,1
2986,"Great product, but I only work through VPN's. Companies need to realize that people using VPN's are normal everyday people protecting their devices and privacy. I'll continue to rather use Facebook marketplace as a result. Pity, I quite liked this.",1
2987,very easy to post anything to sell. and it's free! I would recommend it to my family and friends. Robert Brown,5
2988,I shouldn't have to upgrade to get my items looked at. Also I can't get 8nto my inbox to see my messages.,1
2989,Easy to use app for sellers and buyers. Communication between sellers and buyers is very prompt and reliable. Happy with my results.,5
2990,AI (or some not very smart employee) Disabled the account.,1
2991,"The inability to clear notification messages without having to click on each one individually is tedious for anyone that has setup several searches, especially because offer up throws their own in their that you didn't ask for and cannot turn off. This really spam, and spam that has no opt-out. Additionally, they make you click 3 times to get to message, and then 2 more to delete it.",2
2992,"If you're worried about customer service or scammers, go else where. They Make it so difficult to get in contact with them, And when you finally reach their customer service support form, It's glitched when you try to submit it. I made an offer on a deactivated account by accident, And instead of canceling the offer They charge my card and are now holding it until the deactivated account somehow gets notified that I bought it and they need to ship it, Or wait six days before I get my money back",1
2993,Great APP!,5
2994,"offer up is awesome, I just wish they had a more accurate search system.",4
2995,great app,5
2996,Every time I upload a picture of an item I want to sell it disappears,2
2997,"Offerup is not helping me. I just asked for help in being approved on TruYou, and I received the email saying that a user reported me and my account is at risk of being removed. This is definitely rude. I rated one star because I know I have my rights.",1
2998,Your ads make me leave the app. By choice.,3
2999,"Disappointment that one can not open an account UNLESS you provide a phone number! Email should be sufficient and phone OPTIONAL! Sure, I understand the reasoning behind it. However, I do not have a phone, nor do I want a phone that receives continuous annoying texts...but WAIT, I installed a phone app and bam....NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Requires a""real"" number? Ummmmm WHAT?! ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW!!?? not everyone HAS TO HAVE A PHONE to be accepted! Forced toUsinga different selling/buying app.",2
3000,so far 3 weeks have gotten very little of response have a very good item and a very good price should see more response,1
3001,Issue #1 Do not agree to their shiping option!!! Unless you want to upload your ID and SS card. Issue #2 When full screen ads come up I just close and leave OfferUp! I dont mind all the ads while you browse but absolutely hate the pop up full screen ads that completely ruined this app for me.,1
3002,awesome,5
3003,No body answer u when you try buy shoes,1
3004,Very good app!!,5
3005,great for everything if u wanna save money.,5
3006,Great,5
3007,not a bad site. I have purchased many items. I will continue for now to view items. its worth taking a look at,5
3008,I really enjoy this app,5
3009,some good & some shady peeps but I have been able to deal with mostly good people.,5
3010,ü•∏,5
3011,Garbage app. Freezes and takes multiple attempts to upload pictures. Then they charge a fee without telling you for listing certain items like a dining table and chairs and they automatically remove your listing unless you pay.,1
3012,lots of people that flake or not serious about buying.,2
3013,people don't answer back.,1
3014,Never had a problem,4
3015,"Efficient, quick, and thorough! üòä",5
3016,"works well, people get back to you & no gimmicks so far . I'm placing my first ad today & see how that goes.",4
3017,lot's of items in every thought.,5
3018,this app. is user friendly for the everyday kind of guy. no BS... no problems,5
3019,"Removing the ""posted date"" is now frustrating. That was a great tool to use to determine whether it was worth contacting the seller about the item. Anything over a year, the seller will not respond. Just made it more frustrating for buyers replying to old adds, please force sellers to remove adds after they are sold. It is about the "" is it still available?"" drama we have to deal with, with the sellers. There are still loads of adds that i know from previous views that are older than a year.",2
3020,This app has a lot if items that I'm interested in.,5
3021,It's not clear why some things get removed because of an additional fee that is supposed to get paid but never asked for or explained. The app pushes you to promote things for more money but is not obvious when something is not posted.,2
3022,They are terrible about refunding subscription fees when you don't even use the service. Don't forget to cancel on time or you lose your money. Terrible customer service but a convenient app for selling random items.,1
3023,I like it so far,5
3024,It is hard to purchase items or get in contact with the seller,2
3025,People are resale stolen good on this site and I tell them they get rid of my account saying I did something wrong and I didn't at all !,1
3026,"Less shipping scam attempts than from facebook marketace.I have experienced a consistent failure of offer up to actually post my items in public view, so even though it says they are posted . I strongly urge searching your specific items from a web browser every so often to see if offerup is being legitimate. It's already bad enough that 1/2 of the time spent is entertaining trolls and seriously impatient low-ball offers always, self search and never click anything in the offerup emails.",2
3027,Bad experience as a new user. Would definitely not pay for the premium if I'm trying to buy something and getting no response back from 2 sellers I have messaged about a vehicle. Always have to update searches and although I have distance set it shows me vehicles in other states that I can't buy because not shipped so very frustrating I can't see more local sales when I filter distance,1
3028,"Great way to sell stuff you don't have any use for, either new or used. Some times you have to wait a while for the right person to want something you posted. But it's worth the wait.",5
3029,"Have to pay. The only option is to start free trial with a credit card attached otherwise, it won't post. Used to be a good app. Sorry uninstalling this. Facebook market is free.",1
3030,nice to see local deals,5
3031,It's nice to be able to do business in a flash online and everyones happy cause they can get what they want at the touch of there phones and computers yeahhhhhhh righttttty,5
3032,Lots of bots and ads. Not enough legit traffic,1
3033,I've made a post and it won't stay up. Just gets deleted within 5 minutes of me posting. Nothing bad or illegal or anything. Not breaking any sort of rules or guidelines. Waste of time.,1
3034,great,5
3035,GR8 prices! Easy to purchase and super easy to list! THE BEST PART IS ITS ALL FREE!,5
3036,it don't let me message people,1
3037,Offer up is horrible. No response ever from customer service if they have any,1
3038,app is getting slower and crappier each use,2
3039,very lil replies etc,2
3040,For some reason it seems like there's more hackers and scammers on here than anything. I can not sell anything on here like before and honestly I see the same things over and over so I'm not sure if the app isn't working correctly or updating so something is going on and I'm ready to be done with it and remove it from my l life if they don't do something soon. Honestly if I could rate it a negative number it would be -10. I'm done with this as it's another garbage app that is worthless. Sad/true,1
3041,noice,5
3042,his is a fun app,5
3043,"Used to be an awesome place to buy and sell cars but now you can only find ads for used car lots. If I wanted to go to a used car lot then I'd go to one, not open a resale app",2
3044,I really like OfferUp,5
3045,the absolute best!!!,4
3046,Awesome website,5
3047,"yet another crapp that gets too big for its britches and forgets that it only exists because of its users. works fine until they decide to terminate your account ""without warning, explanation or education"" and steal your money refund buyers for stuff that already shipped. Sellers beware.",1
3048,"bad return policy, not for beginners.",2
3049,"Sometimes difficult to navigate because of hundreds of ads from California. Attempts to steer to a local forum has been unsuccessful. Billing is somewhat confusing, and not explained in enough detail to make the right choices. Better off without the Hassel. Richard, Marianna, Florida..",2
3050,it can be less crowded and more organized but still a good trading place.,4
3051,First time,4
3052,"I'm someone that doesn't write reviews unless they are needed and honest. This app is trash. Read bad reviews. It's true. No idea how it has 4.4. Paid for sure. It does not show you the dates of the listings. So you'll have no idea how old they are or if the ppl are even active anymore. Waste of time. Also, customer service is worse! I tried asking about a card error issue and how to track offers. They responded with how to report seller. They don't know how to read or how to communicate.",1
3053,"I have sent numerous messages to purchase cars but, I have never gotten any answers back from anyone that I've messaged. I've asked to see the vehicle, that I am ready to purchase it and no answers at all. why doesn't anyone answer messages? do they even go through to the sellers?",1
3054,I have really good experiences with this app. Truly recommend,5
3055,fabulous,5
3056,great app if you're selling things they move on this app,5
3057,My listings are not showing up,1
3058,too many ads,1
3059,"App is nearly perfect, but giving me a full page ad nearly after every post I view is enough to warrant just one star, less if possible.",1
3060,can't load pics,1
3061,App used to be good now ruined by ads cant even list anything offering services anymore as they try and fill in the job demand need and now offer job posting. totally ruining the original strength use of the app,1

3064,"This was such a great app when I sold so much stuff. Now they keep bombarding me with ads and asking me for money. Honey I don't have money that's why I am selling my stuff, I need money to survive. I can't buy your premium plan, if I could I won't be selling my stuff. Please change the management and make it nicer like it was . I feel like I am wasting my time when I post stuff. Craigslist and Marketplace is better than you guys. Why are you doing this?",1
3065,"Great app local used goods. Great prices, and safe. Update. After using longer. Very annoying that. Local selection doesn't save. App is always showing stuff from other state. Big waste of time when users want to only buy local. Please change this option. Or set the mail ones at bottom",3
3066,"Bought a stolen item by mistake and found out after and OfferUp didnt care. I reported it to them and told them who the seller was. They told me me cool story, and the seller is still active. There goes $3000. And I'm sure OfferUp will reply with their auto reply ""we are always looking to improve.. Blah blah.."" I tried multiple times to contact them. They don't care.",1
3067,"Just came from trying to pawn my shoe ,But realized there was offerup, Buy ,sell.",5
3068,Could use a little improving but not a bad app. A little annoying when you click to see what's free and every post is a business advertising or an item is marked as $0 but the description says they are looking to sell,3
3069,Great,5
3070,"Horrible app that places a pay wall in order to post anything, tried posting my car to sell, and it said posted but the listing did not appear anywhere. The app then tried to charge me for remaking a post that was never posted. Customer service was unable to help me and decided to ignore me after their troubleshooting did not work.",1
3071,It's very helpful,5
3072,always have something unique and Rare On there... on top of that even the Free Stuff is awesome...,5

3080,this app went downhill quick when they bought out letgo. letgo was far superior as far as the ability to navigate the site and being user-friendly. I only sporadically get alerts when I have messages even though I have the alerts turned on and now there's commercials constantly unless I want to pay for the app?! I still use it occasionally but you're far better off to advertise and buy items on Marketplace or even craigslist! at least you don't have to get advertising!,1
3081,Poor protection for customers.,1
3082,great love shoping here easy,5
3083,App is very slow,3
3084,"App works OK, except they do not delete abandoned listing's. I see listing's unsold that are years old. Cannot tell is the user is active. A lot of the sellers are fake. Ignore messages, and leave offers unanswered so the offer expires. Been on the app for two a week or so, put 22 messages out, only 3 responses. Put out 8 offers and not a single response. And 5 buys left to expire. No one on the platform is willing to ship anything. Why have them put a shipping option and allow them yo deny ship",1
3085,new to the app not sure why I can't sell any of my Swords that I collect but it's cool I did run into a scam. Trying to sell my router. But it was obvious.,5
3086,easy simple app to buy and sell on. low fees.,5
3087,Decent app. It erases the information a lot and the verify your identity thing DOES NOT WORK and actually hinders sales. so a solid Okay not good not great.,3
3088,great,5
3089,tired of adds and they need a way to refresh listings.,3
3090,"Had offerup on my phone for several years, now the icon isn't on my screen and I didn't uninstall.",1

3094,"lots of ads that are made annoying to close, and notification system is broken. Only get a notification about a message half the time, get notifications about new items even though that setting is turned off, and I have to turn off my VPN to use the app at all.",1
3095,"Great product, fast delivery!",5
3096,l have used Offer Up for years of selling and buying with great results. Thank you for making this possible. It is a great way to connect 1000's in need of buying and selling items.,5
3097,PLEASE ADD A PERSONAL BIO FEATURE. I am open to trading and it would be cool if I could announce that. Other than that the app works well enough and makes it easy to save items you like in personal lists.,4
3098,Great platform to help one another!,5
3099,"tearable all you can do is post your items and wait, sucks to have to pay to promote items.",1
3100,This app has gone so downhill lags to many ads slows phone down tremendously,1
3101,"The selling part is fine, but the job hunting part is horrific. Just about all of them are links to other job hunting sites and scams. No quality control what do ever.",3
3102,Not getting notifications,3
3103,To slow,5
3104,It sucks when someone else has been using ur account without ur permission,2
3105,fast results amazing thank you,5
3106,"This is the most ridiculous app ever, it won't let you verify your credit card so you can't buy anything, and when you try to add a different credit card it just says you've reached your credit card limit and you can't add another card, and it doesn't accept any of the numerous other methods of payment like PayPal, Google play, Amazon pay.... So in the off chance you find something worth buying don't count on being able to pay for it.",1
3107,The Best way to sell nice used items...My experience has been that between 50 & 70 % of the folks that say there coming- actually come prepared... delivery helps...50 to 75% of asking price is what to expect...beats E-bay anytime...LOL,5
3108,thank you everything worker out great,5
3109,Great Great,5
3110,two many stipulations on what you can put on here now and now advertisements everytime you turn around,2
3111,"This app has become literal garbage. I've had items removed, and then seen the same exact items being sold by others. The ""free"" section has more people SELLING items they don't wanna put a price on, than actual free items. Support doesn't remove those items or sellers. Scammers are running rampant without any consequences. Really wish LetGo was still around and didn't sell out to this joke of a company, creating a monopoly instead of competition.",1
3112,I can't stand that it doesn't show the prices on the main search screen you have to dig into each one each item ridiculous,2
3113,"In the past the automated system ""banned me by mistake"" for a year for literally nothing. Today I had an offer not go through as it was being reviewed, followed by a message telling me not to make another offer until review was done in 32 hours. During that period, the item in question was sold to someone else as the seller obviously doesn't want to wait 32 hours to sell to me. This happens frequently.",1
3114,"I can't put my ad ,and when i did nobody saw it. that was 3 months ago ,now I can put it again",1

3118,"The application's usability and functionality have significantly declined over the years.

3121,"This app has gone from bad to worse. (1)There's no longer any way to tell how long something has been listed. Inactive users post things and never delete them. OfferUp does NOTHING to clean this up. (2) People post duplicate ads and never respond to messages. OfferUp does NOTHING to fix this when it gets reported. (3) Search alerts are A JOKE.

3152,"I am now selling all items elsewhere. The no refunds on subscriptions is exactly why I did this. Took a 3 day trial for boost or whatever. They fail to emphasize that you have to cancel the subscription through the Play Store instead of through their OfferUp app. Sounds like a hook or more like some bs. I tried and tried to cancel but was unable through app as stated. They pretty much gave me a middle finger and told me no refunds, we are sticklers. I get it. I don't get your misleading info",1

3157,"They will eventually delete your account. My account got removed after 8 years on the app without any warning or explanation of what I did wrong or if I broke any rules. Once you establish your store and build your reputation, they might suddenly delete it. The support email will just ignore you and not reply. Even after I offered to pay for premium membership.

3163,"OfferUp has been alright recently, until the last update I installed. Now it force-closes every time I scroll. Previously: After a lot of issues with posting and messaging other users, I contacted support and they quickly fixed the issues I was having. So for that, the review goes from 2 to 5 stars. I really enjoy the app and have met a couple dozen users, I would guess. Everyone has been above-board and very nice, no complaints about any sales or purchases, and the app works very well.",5

Thanks so much for responding!",5
3167,I apply filter for local pickup only. Why is your app showing me delivery options from 1000 miles away.,2
3168,The app is just so slow to load each thing. Also it's irritating to have the notifications show up in the message icon making you think someone has sent a message about an item and it's just another damn notification,2

3186,THIS APP OFFERS ZERO PROTECTION FOR SELLERS. IN SHORT THEY SUPPORT THEFT. ALL SOMEONE HAS TO DO IS LIE AND SAY THAT YOU DIDNT SEND THE ITEM OR ITS NOT WHAT YOU DISCRIBED AND BOOM NOT ONLY DO THEY GET THEIR MONEY BACK THEY GET TO KEEP YOUR ITEM(S).

3188,awesome app,5
3189,"I didn't get any value out of this app. I've listed items in the past, spent time taking great photos, setting a competitive price - and got no sales. Not even one inquiry or proposed price negotiation. So this app is a poor use of time to sell stuff",1

3197,used to be a great app by private sellers. now it's just pawn shops and dealerships spamming. same thing happened to car trader and Craigslist. they need to fix the spam. they need to have a section that filters private sellers from businesses,1

I never got messages when it said I did and the item is still there I can do nothing it's like if you don't buy Offer ups service they hold your add hostage like ransom ware. Don't download!",1

3204,I'm new and only do local but posting is so easy and i sold my first .item. It was easy and so far I'm still alive. lol,4
3205,This app is bad. Just signed up and listed two items. Immediately got a scam message and right after the scam message my account said that the items that I had listed was sold and this was not true. I tried to correct it on my account and the app won't let you correct it. I immediately closed my account. I will never use or recommend this app to anyone. I wish I could give this app zero stars.,1

3219,Delay postings. Pay money now! Seems like nobody was paying for premium so now they started to delay postings from posting for at least 30 minutes. It won't post publicly right after unless you pay them money. First stupid pop up ads and now delaying posts.,2
3220,"Update: I for some reason gave this shitstain of an app another chance and listed my first ever listing there. I got nothing but low-ballers, trolls, and scammers.

3229,"The app can be very slow and has way too many ads which makes it difficult for it to be user friendly at times. Additionally, they are always trying to upsell you on their services to make your listings appear at the top of the searches but I ask the developers to concentrate on making the app run more smoothly please before upselling.

3230,Excellent,5
3231,delate answer,4
3232,"Why is it necessary to have your location settings on in order to use the app? You put in the address and there you go, address to where you can sell or buy your items. I'm tired of these companies trying to access your information. Mind your business and let us do ours. It's simple.",2

3259,Offer Up allows dozens of scam advertisers on the site as representing Home Depot and other large company's. They have cheap prices. Offer Up takes their money and the scam company takes ours. Offer Up does not give any recourse to these scams.,1

3284,"Over priced junk, rude sellers that believe the items they sell are worth to what a store sells, many scams or stolen items are sold for a quick turnaround. Rare to find honest sellers. Normally it's brand new/never used, you drive to them waste time n gas n find out it's been used for the last year.

3299,its a good app that helps in many ways,5
3300,It used to be a great app that we use all the time but not anymore. Absolutely no one has responded to ANY of my messages about any item I've inquired about for months now. Not a single response. I'm beginning to think my messages aren't being delivered or the app is broken. I used to buy items using this app many times a month. I can't believe that literally dozens of users are all choosing not to respond at the same time for no reason. That would be absurd. I have a good rating on the app too.,1
3301,very good one,5
3302,great place to find what you want for a reasonable price.,5
3303,is it available should be removed ! it's irritating,4
3304,The new pop ups ads are annoying. Not even 2 clicks to buy and bam another pop up ad. I wonder if that discourages buyers.,3
3305,"Wow. You ask me to comply with identity verification. I try to comply and instead of helping to work it out you ban my account. Now that's really community, isn't it. Nice job OfferUp. For the record, the one sale i did make on your platform(music equipment), the buyer gave me a 5 star review, and he came to my house (which is not recommended) to try out the item, where we proceeded to talk about the local music scene for 30 minutes. Looks like I did a better job @ community than you did. TheEnd",1

3314,I challenge anyone to actually get a response from offerup support. I don't think they exist. First two items I bought were never shipped. No response from the sellers only automated responses from offerup. Both sellers have 5 stat reviews. There is no real way to get any help from support that I could see. It may be fine for local purchases.,2

3323,"It's brand new to me, I haven't had time to make a judgement.",3
3324,"I like the deals I am able to find on OfferUp. I do not like having to update my search parameters every single time I am searching, not having to constantly type in zip code, set the search range, and specify local only. I do not like the flood of misleading ads allowed on the site. It is a big waste of time and energy having results with multiple ads that do not meet the search parameters. Bulk posts designed to draw your attention then upon review. It is just another general marketing ploy",4

3326,I like this shop because there's great deals,5
3327,"Good app usually, but the share button doesn't work on Android so I have to just send screenshots to friends instead of direct links. Also it takes a few seconds too long to clear notifications. It is good for what it does though, I haven't found better apps and I've looked around. The car section is also poor because you can't easily filter out dealers who pretend to be individuals and reporting them has no effect that I've seen.",3

How about you ""clean house"" by automatically deleting adds after 14 days unless renewed by the poster.

3348,0 Stars. At first was good then became üí©.,1
3349,Great app,5
3350,Works nicely and gets responses from people,5
3351,love the app,5
3352,"Paid to post a car, and listing was not posted for over 12 hours after I paid to have it posted. Car sold before Offer up even posted it. So they just stole my fee and no response from Offer Up",1
3353,good app to sell,5
3354,It's a pretty good app only it can be a little hard in order to actually get a item to which you want to purchase.,3
3355,"OfferUp is really intuitive to set up your account, as well as posting your items. I am very happy with it. The item suggestions that are emailed/displayed when the app is first opened are helpful as well.",5
3356,I found an offer up to be very easy to Buy and sell and everyone i have met has been decent thank you!,5
3357,It's a perfect set up for buyer and seller except all the old ads that linger. I notice if I have people flake in a pick up my ad gets old and nobody looks at it cause it blends in with the garbage ads. If a message was sent to seller asking if still for sale after a month it would fix all those. The app would grow huge!,4
3358,good,5
3359,wish more people used it,4
3360,"Editing my response, and if I could put 0, I would. The quality of the ad is dropping, Besides the overwhelming ads i already mentioned, the ""premium"" persons messages always sit on top on the inbox, even if the convo is done. Also, the timestamp the ad was posted was removed. Now you don't know if you are messaging a 5 year posted ad. I spend more time messaging empty accounts, not knowing who's active.",1
3361,Great,5
3362,can't add or edit listings from desktop. big hassle having to upload desktop photos to phone. also my account was disabled due to offerup system error and it took a month to get it back. had over a 1000 listings and when offerup system disabled my account and removed over 800 of my listings. could not get them back. so now I have to resist them. probably won't waste my time.,1
3363,"They show you pics of amazing stuff you can get for free, but nothing is free. You shouldn't do business with a company that is so comfortable lying to potential customers.",1
3364,this app provides an amazing way for an individual such as myself to start a business I'm so grateful to whomever created it,5
3365,This app would get zero star if there was one.,1
3366,Welcome to the hood,1
3367,seller don't respond. buyers don't show.,2
3368,"No support readily available by administrators. Buy it Now's don't work, but they take your card info. No one to hold sellers accountable or manage your issues can be reached - this site is a recipe for easy fraud and I do not trust it as it is not properly supported. I also now wonder about the security here...",1
3369,Overwhelming number of out of date ads make it almost useless.,1
3370,I work the night shift. Had scheduled appointment and fail asleep on couch. Texted Maxwell and he was very understanding. Will definitely due business with him again Thank you.,5
3371,sales are easily sold,5
3372,Convenient and easy to use. Great deals,5
3373,This is the worst site to buy on. I messaged over a hundred people and one or 2 responded with in a week. What a joke,1
3374,people not messaging back. or shipping things that are bought.,1
3375,Yes I get charged automatically each month but do not feel they explainwell how to suspend while not in use! Need help,2
3376,very nice person,5
3377,Great Finds!!!,5
3378,everything went smooth and everyone walked away happy and got what they wanted I call that a good offer up,5
3379,"Bought and Sold with great success I have recommended it to my own Mother. Like anywhere there are scams negotiate on the app is all. Here in Albuquerque, NM. The Community is great. The sellers who offer to ship work hard. I've had stuff shipped to me from all over the country and been pleased. Found rare Items and unbelievably good deals. You need to try it. I love it. Very Pragmatic place to find something unique or a good deal on pre-owned. It's fun. ‚úåÔ∏è ¬ÆÔ∏èüå¥",5
3380,Scolds you too early about shipping. The app scolded me for not shipping even though the due date had not passed. Needs to wait for the date to expire before scolding. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth about shipping and makes me want to turn it off for future listings.,1
3381,never had a problem,5
3382,Great .,5
3383,Didn't Auth $21.71 and won't refund,1
3384,To expensive,1
3385,Everything,5
3386,Share button doesn't work on my Android device.,2
3387,when it was called letgo five stars really ten stars miss letgo but OfferUp is low quality probably running on programs no humans are employed there just 1970s AI hate when a good quality gets bought out by low to no quality I don't post much these days but I used to dread it u know way I'm sayin,1
3388,"better than others, only missing remove items for sale ( instead of archive)",4
3389,This app used to be good it really deserves zero Stars it's been on my phone for a while it constantly asked for update they constantly asking me to verify my number I verified it won't let me go through it won't let me post,1
3390,"Too many false ""Alert"" notifications. Keyword search needs Improvement - No Boolean search Refining. As for those crying bout postings' age , as the saying goes "" If it's up it's still available"" The new postings are up front to browse & keyword results can be rearranged by ""Most Recent""!",4
3391,"Restored my faith in making purchases online. Especially when the item was used. No B.S. from Kenny. Arrived sooner than I thought. packaging was excellent also. In today's day and age, rampant scams. Thanks,Ken, and Offer up.......M. Boland",5
3392,offer up is a good app to buy old huffy bicycles and original fixie bicycles with original fixie rims and tires.,5
3393,"Worst place to shop only if your desperate & a sucker, 90% of item are stolen & used resold as new by con-artists, crackheads & idiots with ridiculous price. Not regular people. Only price these sellers can compare to is what's on their receipts when they first purchased it, nothing on here should be trusted as brand new, no market for ""barely used""..USED is USED. Don't be conned, there is no offer ""too low"" for things people are trying to get rid off or fencing. Your money your say.",2
3394,Constantly updating me about new items that are actually not. Nor do they fit the category in searching. I've bought of it before sometimes it goes smoothly. But. Lack of product and tie off constantly typing what I'm looking for. Shopping online may always be a little sketchy but craigslist is still better.,1
3395,"Too many ads. Some ads don't let you close them and have to close the app itself and open it back up. Ads for clicking on an item, ads for opening up your messages, ads for trying to go back to your search results, ads, ads, ads, ads ü§¶",1
3396,Either people are unresponsive or you have to pay for quicker responses. app gets a 3 :(,3
3397,buen sitio de conpral y vender lo recomiendo good site to buy and sell I recommend it,5
3398,Very slow after they introduced ads,3
3399,Love this thing. Go check out the Free Section time to time. I used the Fast Seller thing once a long time ago but don't remember if it was good or not. Don't be dumb when meeting up with peeps.,5
3400,Received in time. works greay.,5
3401,That was easy.,5
3402,"Sometimes, I don't get notifications, so I have to remember to check just to make sure I'm not disregarding anybody. Also, I don't know how people can change their id/name, which is kinda ""weird"" if you are a woman selling something to a male. Lastly, it'd be great to be able to add an extra note for those who buy or sell items and are serious, on time, and good people, rather than choose the little options given. I think it is best a heartfelt comment ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
3403,You can buy good stuff on this site,5
3404,Worked good,5
3405,to many commercials can't go back to let go,1
3406,Annoying ads. Locks you into a screen after every search query. They hide ads in the query as well. Might as well just use Craigslist or FB marketplace.,1
3407,"It's so annoying to not see prices in listings. Having to tap each listing individually just to see that it's priced stupid expensive is a real waste of time. Plus the ads! The search results are already littered with ads, but now it's showing unskippable video ads while you're browsing? You've got to be kidding me.",1
3408,this is way better than Craigslist,5
3409,"Great site,useually find what I'm looking for,keep up the good work!",5
3410,Unable to download onto computer.,1
3411,ads,1
3412,does no good. and you charge my card after cancel.,1
3413,"After adds, its gettin worse,",1
3414,Stupid app,1
3415,OFFERUP Inc are thieves. Had me ship a phone to someone and then they canceled the order so I didn't get paid seller got to keep my phone and I get screwed because the OfferUp are goddamn MONSTERS. DO NOT TRUST THESE SCUMBAG THIEVES!!! CAVEAT EMPTOR!,1
3416,Love this app but wish It would load faster and show prices on main screen and be able to post multiple without having to exit,3
3417,Most of the seller's on this app have very nice stuff there selling.,5
3418,ads now,3
3419,"Worthless. Can't list items on my PC, only on app... then app won't work on wifi.. I granted all permissions to app ect... frustrating",1
3420,works when it wants to. I miss the old offer up I mean let go,1
3421,found a shampoo device close by,5
3422,these guys were great!!,5
3423,"Worst experience as a seller, not only is the app filled with scammers and ads, but when u do get a sale, good luck getting a shipping label, not emailed even after it says so, can't really manage orders properly as its missing fundamental features. On top of that, support is nowhere to be found. And, they have audacity to charge 13% fees üò§",1
3424,Praying worldwide,5
3425,"The app works well but all of a sudden, every time you turn around , there's either a pop up or they're trying to get you to spend more money for seller upgrades.",3
3426,great app I use it all of the time.,5
3427,works for me,4
3428,Good experience seeing and buying in offer up,5
3429,I keep getting gift card offered to me for using app and it's a scam,2
3430,"This app used to be great. It's awful now. I can honestly say, it's cost me money. They complicated a perfectly good operation. When I asked for help, I got the the simplest easiest quick fix. Needless to say, it did not solve the problem and to this day they are unable to fix it and coat my name. Thanks for nothing y'all. Zero stars.",1
3431,Ads on top of ads. We need a replacement for this app.,1
3432,good,5
3433,make sure what's being advertised is actually what the seller claims it to be,5
3434,All Good %üíØ%,5
3435,Haptic feedback? While scrolling? Why?,3
3436,Lool,5
3437,excelent,5
3438,App opened on its own with a count down claiming it finished downloading üò±,1
3439,They seem to have a lot of stuff but the thing is I have tried to buy 2 things from too different people and neither respond so my orders got cancelled. Don't know if this is normal but it sure is frustrating. Makes me think it's not legit.,1
3440,so much variety for what your seeking for.üôÇ,5
3441,price is not visible so WASTE OF TIME SEARCHING LISTINGS OUT OF PRICE RANGE,1
3442,love this app it really makes me some money lolüòÅüëç‚ù§Ô∏è,5
3443,"sporadic, unreliable",2
3444,very helpful for me when I can afford to shop for something I like or need.,5
3445,there are a lot of people who say they will ship but won't...and more that place items for sale but never respond to inquiries but the few I've had the pleasure of doing business with have been awesome,4
3446,Crashes constantly,1
3447,never followed thru,1
3448,Love Offer up,5
3449,great place to shop for things!!!!,5
3450,Great app,5
3451,"Awful! Shop elsewhere and don't waste your time. The sellers don't see any of your offers or messages unless you pay a subscription fee to the app. Even then the app doesn't have an effective algorithm that weeds out inactive postings or sellers. I sent out what felt like hundreds of offers, and only received ONE completed purchase. Use Mercari or Poshmark. those are far more reliable, and without any pesky subscription fees.",1
3452,"Love this site, easy to use and always great items",5
3453,to many scams people don't respond when you make offers I am using marketplace more and more now. I sell stuff fast on marketplace. never sells on this platform,1
3454,great app fast some people does not reply .. and on JOBS there are too many scammers,4
3455,Phenomenal,5
3456,I've been trying to cancel my subscription before the date because I was not happy with that help and it wouldn't never let me cancel my subscription,1
3457,Need your help,5
3458,Nice,5
3459,Sometimes I get to many ads and sometimes berly any and also hate that lots of posts don't say when the post was posted.,3
3460,love it,5
3461,Convenient and helpful when selling items,5
3462,"Pop-up ads are annoying. Removed 'when posted', that sucks. It's OK....could be better.",3
3463,Stop showing me random meaningless listing alerts I don't have any setting to stop,2
3464,Good job,4
3465,"Very below avg selling app,. This app might actually have more scammers on it than actual buyers and sellers lol",1
3466,App responds sooooo slow. Almost unusable. App developers do not understand optimization.,1
3467,its been the best app to sell your stuff so far!,5
3468,I like the neat interface but the response times from seller's need to speed up because men don't like to shop.,4
3469,"I am very dissatisfied! This app is a waste of time and money....when I tried to cancel my account....they continued to bill me!!....I feel that I no longer have a choice, I just have to suck it up and deal with it!!....I feel that I am wasting my money, with absolutely no results!!....I would NEVER refer this app to anyone!!!....I am on a fixed income, and do NOT have money to just throw away!!!",2
3470,"This app can't get any worse......... verification never works.... all I can do Is look at product. Every single time I try to use the app, I have to jump through verification hoops, rescan an ID, add it to my account to get to send a message to see if product is available...... just for the app to tell me have to rescan...... burn the app of fix it -1 star if I could",1
3471,love the app it connects the world but also disappointed for closing my account because of spekers I purchased on offerup then posted for sale offerup says those are fake spekers not aloud to sale on offerup app but why close my account when their messages clearly showing who n when I purchased the item offerup could of done the right thing instead of closing my account they should have closed the app of the person who sold me an item not allowed for sale in the first place,5
3472,I can't view messages that where sent to me,1
3473,honesty and security is what makes offerUp,5
3474,Good,5
3475,"Twice OFFERUP has advertised a ""free single item promotion"". Both times it has me select a payment type, I select the form of payment with good faith the company WILL NOT CHARGE ME. BOTH INSTANCES, THERE IS A CHARGE ON MY ACCOUNT FOR $21.71! I do not understand why you are robbing people in this manner! I am a single mother of a 4 year old little girl who is a type 1 diabetic! I can't afford your mistakes and have now recied a $30 overdraft fee! BECAUSE I PAID BILLS AND HAD NO $! HOW DARE YOU!",1
3476,good money,5

3479,Account got removed for literally no reason,1
3480,people are cheap,1
3481,Not much selection in Huntsville Texas,3
3482,WARNING do not use this service. it's a rip off and a joke and you will thank me later for this advice. I guarantee it.,1

3484,Good,5
3485,love this app works for me,5
3486,was great before ads. use website instead.,1
3487,Not really that great. And full of scammers.,3
3488,Decent app. More and more Ads every time.,3
3489,"I left 1 star. They replied to offer ""assistance"". I was then provided with the worst customer service experience I've ever seen, by a long shot. I engaged in a 2 week long email thread, the heartless agent just ignored everything I said and kept just rattling off policy. So the seller has 146 dollars, I have nothing. I was refused to speak with someone over the phone, in fact he ignored the request altogether. Avoid@all costs. I gave them an honest chance to help. Worst ever, by a long shot.",1
3490,"The app will not let me post. It says that I used my posts for the month, but I haven't posted in years. It said I could wait until the 1st of the following month but when the 1st comes, it says to wait until the 1st of the next month *I have emailed twice before and never received help, but I will try again ** Once again an automated response that has nothing to do with the problem.***Someone finally tried to help but couldn't. Was told it's an ongoing problem and one day they might fix it lol",1
3491,To slow,1
3492,it would be a good app if every time I try posting an item up it gives me a error message saying that my photos didn't upload and to try again and I do until it suddenly vanishes without posting the item I wanted to post! also the app is so slow and buggy please fix!,2
3493,Littered with adds. Not willing to sift through real posts and ads.,1
3494,it's a good app I recommend it you can find basically everything you want just search and you will find,5
3495,no one ever replies to listings on here,1

BUYER Traffic WAY DOWN. Reported Premium self activation-got unacc. reply. They better FIX it/issue refunds. NOT emailing social care-same 8 ball. Charges w/o consent=FRAUD. Doubt it's only me.",1

3502,"can only upload via your phone, you can not list on your laptop/PC",1
3503,"Sellers are really lazy at shipping, and there is a lack of repercussions if they canceled the order. You have a lot of people who will hold you money for 7 days just for offer up to auto cancel due to never shipping. Some sellers will hold on to the item and use this method if the shipping cost is too high based on where you live. ive even offered to pay shipping, and it still gets canceled. Feels more like a money lending service.. however, offerup does a good job at returning your money. +ads",2

I used their ""Help Center"" and it's frustrating. I submitted my issue and all I got was, sorry no refunds. Lol seriously. There was no conversation at all. You guys don't offer alternatives huh. Then again, as far as I know, it may have been an automated response. Disgusting.",1

3513,Offer up...Will send u $30 free gift to use on the app! But when u go to the website...It's says Sorry this page doesn't exist!? That's about half a dozen times they sent me 1...And I have never been able to use 1? That's kind of Weird why they would do that? Well u guys owe me $180 for all the past fake free $30 things nobody can use!!?? That's why I am giving them 1 star!!,1
3514,awsome,5
3515,Very good!! Except one incident. She sold the item at the last minute to someone else. she texted me in morning to double check if I was going over and she would give me address. I responded but no address. She psyched me up and tricked me! Ugh! I really wanted the daybed!!,5
3516,Has ads that cannot be bypassed. This should not be allowed.,1
3517,I've used it for 1 day.......,3
3518,good deals and good way to get rid of the extra stuff in your home,5
3519,is a good app,4
3520,"Poor search result filtering and visibility, out of state listings are always pushed on you, annoying false notifications which are actually just ads to check the app. You can't see the price before clicking a product or easily sort the results. Old listings can't be filtered or excluded so some results have been sitting for years and are a waste of energy",3
3521,it's good but slow process time,4
3522,Won't allow me to use the app because of a VPN? Guess I won't be using your service. I won't turn off a VPN just so I can give you access to my phone. Uninstalled.,1
3523,communication sucks. scams everywhere.,1
3524,Loved this app before the last update. Where are my saves?,4
3525,was better before trying to sell they upgrade,1
3526,I do enjoy the app but seeing how this is about rating it here goes the problems: 1)way to many advertisements 2)slow or long buffering ( at times) 3)a strange URL appears in the middle of my text with a redirect when messaging potential buyers or sellers 4)the cost of placing an ad for certain products like vehicles.,3
3527,Total scam app now. Customer support enables criminal activity and plays dumb about doing anything about it. They encourage scammer activity with the way the system protects sellers who pay their premium. This company is currently being reported by multiple people to BBB for their practices.,1
3528,Solid Company has been doing it for a while now!,5
3529,I do not like new items/advertisments.,2
3530,"Complete garbage Malfunctioning poor performing Slow reacting Complete junk app consume massive memory and is slow as molasses. Worse yet the virtually non-existent customer service is arrogant and probably retarded, they offer no solutions that fix all of the problems with this garbage app",1
3531,Terrible no option to cancel sales,1
3532,I'll never use it again. More updates than any other app I've ever used. Posted a damaged motorcycle in the vehicle - motorcycle section. Deleted my posting even tho it was correct. Go to repost and they want a $5 fee for posting more than one motorcycle a month. Trash so many better options. I'd give it less than 1 star if I could,1
3533,"Every since unwanted ads are now part of this app, it has gone to waste.",1
3534,I love this app I helped family and friends find cars all the time,5

3536,No one ever responds on this app I've messaged probably 35 people about a Nintendo switch they have listed no one even reads it unless you pay for their premier nonsense. If you don't have a Facebook for market place the only usable app is eBay to buy pre-owned products will report this daily to Google until removed from playstore.,1

3569,Was a good app until all the ads. Will be deleting this app.,1
3570,"I love it, as long as people answer my inquiries and take down their ads when items are sold",5
3571,I'm done. Been using it for a few years. Buuuut.... there are ads now. No thank you.,1
3572,"although I haven't had any sales ,I've had conversations about the sales The app is very easy to use, very simple.",5
3573,lots of stolen merchandise being sold.,2
3574,i Love its fun and easy üòÅ,5
3575,"The ads are killing me, LARRY!!!!",3
3576,I have to pay to post something. I'm good.,1
3577,Because I like to buy an OfferUp,5
3578,"useless, useless, useless...",1
3579,easy to use the app just be care full of who you buy because ppl will sell you broken things. I've been using the app for 5 plus years and it's only happened twice,5
3580,my offer up not working months and I have contacted offer up multiple times and you have not done anything at all to fix the problem,1
3581,It's pretty cool...,4
3582,it's a great app I've used it for a couple years now would appreciate it if it was quicker,5
3583,They removed my listing for a set of motorcycle pipes ! Prohibited item ???,1
3584,GREAT,5
3585,I've had it with this app. Now we have to watch ads. No thanks. Uninstalled.,1
3586,This app has gone downhill. Too many ads. App is laggy. Shouldn't have to see an ad just so I can send a message.,4
3587,"I made a purchase on offer On March 4th, it was supposed to be delivered to my door March 9th. It is now March 15th a week late. And I still don't have the item that I purchased and they will not give me my money. Back i'm about to say ship the So called item back But I can't ship back.What I'd never received.Is there somebody that can help me",1
3588,Great place to list...,5
3589,way too many ads,1
3590,I like this app,3
3591,"I have a problem and dont know how to fix it . Now that I'm old ,my heads not right . Ive lost my phone I tore up my place looking for it and missed placed my Chime card.. my rent is past due over 2 weeks . I'm worried I'm going to get evecited , I cant Fig ure out how to install it on my replacement phone . Please help....",3
3592,should offer escrow for scammer deals.,3
3593,great place to sell and buy,5
3594,Doesn't work Not a single reply after 20+ questions. Offer up seems like a scam,1
3595,So literally one message for an item I had listed that they claimed wasn't them. Now trying to cancel the 3 day trial and there's no way I can locate the info. If my account is charged I will contact my bank with a screenshot of this message which IS B4 the trial period ended.,1
3596,Good platform for post your products very effective,5
3597,Very easy and fast way too sell you're stuff. But refund transaction kinda scared me but I did get my money back. The pending transaction will completely disappear on your statement but you will get your money after 5 days,4
3598,Great place to buy and sell!!!,5
3599,"I like selling here, but the customer service is nowhere near how it should be. I used to work in CS and still provide great service with my sales, so you should probably ad me. Anyways, I was about to start paying to promote and ship my items (added my bank acct) then they immediately shut my items off. I wasn't informed, I just figured it out and had to email 7x in order to get a few restored. Any prob could be ok with great CS, but now I'm scared to pay. I have 100% 5‚≠êand sold over 245items.",2
3600,Very good app. Works for me thanks for the heads up .,5
3601,I love using Offer Up to buy and sell and the free section .. I have gotten great deals,5
3602,they hide your postings unless you pay,1
3603,"For some reason, its not working. I downloaded it yesterday and opened it to find an error message. I hit the refresh button several times and didn't work. Someone get this thing fixed NOW!!!!",1
3604,Much better than FB. Reaches more potential buyers.,5
3605,nice stuff,5
3606,"actually great if you like corporate made cr apps. crapps aren't like normal apps they aren't designed for the user's benefit but the generalized and censored design even if a better version could unlock more human potential. they are fine with keeping u in place, less competition. enjoy this great cr app because it will enjoy you and your personal data. like magic, tada.",5
3607,Great app!,5
3608,Squirrly app.,2
3609,It's a better version than market place.,5
3610,"This app is useless for selling items. You get so many fraudsters and/or scammers asking for your phone number with words like ""num"" or using ""#"" because they're trying to steal your information",2
3611,I buy and sell stuff that I come across,3
3612,Great App!,5
3613,It's sucks,1
3614,Excellent,5
3615,"Good deals from reasonable people, and some Wildly Entertaining offer ups",5
3616,garbage,1
3617,Love it,5
3618,"The app made me pay a single item promotion. When I never actually tried to do so. And I was trying to get in contact with the customer support and I can't Figure out how to get A. Refund and it was through google play as wel. The subscription was made to Google Play. I never even signed up for the e. Single item promotion. In fact, I had canceled my item I was selling.",1
3619,"OfferUp has been an awesome platform for myself for years.It's really nice to be able to make money while you're repurposing items. Never forget the saying, ' what is one person's junk is another person's treasure"" ! I am blessed as well as you are if you're reading this review! Never lose sight of your blessings and I wish ""you"" a blessed day!!",5
3620,just the kind of tags,5
3621,"TruYu refuses to work, support link 404's. Awesome",1
3622,I used this app so many times but I ended up deleting it. Ads and processes became too invasive,1
3623,best place to find those amazing hard to find deals,5
3624,bieeen,5
3625,awful app and support is also truly no help,1
3626,cool that you can sell unwanted items without the hassle,5
3627,easy and convenient site that allows you to sell from your own home,5
3628,Thanks for unskippable pop up ads I'm so glad this replaced craigslist,1
3629,Can't pay with PayPal,1
3630,"Your setup makes looking for items easy, for me.",5
3631,people are hacking offer up and taking your items off and some people never show up,1
3632,Terrible customer service. Sold and shipped items and never got paid. My account also got deactivated when trying to add my bank information. I have contacted OfferUp and the customer support service just copies and paste the same information without telling me specifically why they deactivated my account.,1
3633,Charge me NOTHING,1
3634,Let go was better,1
3635,Horrible customer service. If you are getting attacked on this app by people that refuse to pay. Are people want stuff for free. And people that would like to trade. Can you tell them to stop bugging you. And eventually you have enough and you answer them back they will block your account and delete everything you posted. They will not send you any warning. This app become to be a total waste of time. Automatic system keep removing posting because it's don't understand what written inside.,1
3636,Best Site Ever to Sell Stuff ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
3637,"Very good, nice",5
3638,NON RESPONSIVE.,1
3639,great website,5
3640,seems really delayed for my stuff to be posted,3
3641,"offerup is now very unsafe, and so many scams",1
3642,Never able to find within my search range. Too many big business. Nothing to read nor able to type in the help section. I miss Letgo!!!! And the jobs are basically all links to job placement sites. Not good for much,2
3643,Lots of Scammers.,1
3644,"I love OfferUp, is fast, wide range and easy to use it.",5
3645,I'll give 5 stars since I've been a loyal user making lots of profit through this awesome app. There is just one major thing that I'd want offerup to add and that is the feature to cancel shipments and offers instead of having to wait days for it to automatically expire. That is by far the only thing I'd love for you guys to fix other than that this is the best place to form a selling business!,5
3646,Great app! Thanks üòÅ,5
3647,"Keeps loading on a phone I don't have, and never have had.",1
3648,It's horrid. Almost like not as many people use it. It's basically all adds and stuff that ships. If you take off the shipping option there's almost nothing to show. This app is just like craigslist was just as it started to go down hill. Update. Don't bother selling. You'll get almost no views. This app isn't the same at all and is officially useless. I think they want you to pay to bump your listing and when you don't you get no views. Ppl now listening their items for 0 JUST to get views.,1
3649,amazing lots of good people and very easy to use,5
3650,you have to pay to post??,1
3651,It's ok lots of dumb people like all seller sites. People ask if something is still available..you say yes and you never hear back. Likewise people trying to scam you or get something for nothing. I've sold 100$ item for 10$ and still had someone ask me to deliver it. Next!!,4
3652,awes,5
3653,Horrible,1
3654,It's all just ADs anymore... was Sooo much better when it was just letgo,1
3655,Good,5
3656,"Thats a BS comment, theyre are NOT ""here to help."". DO NOT USE THIS APP!! BEWARE!! The app is filled with scams and counterfeit goods. Their customer service is a joke. They're rude, and the only way to communicate with them is via email, which they don't respond. AVOID THIS APP!! Offerup customer service don't even respond with some BS that you'll help, no you won't! Its just a cover to make it seem like they care. Guess what? They don't care and will side with the scammer every time. RUN AWAY.",1
3657,TRASH APP! IT WAS FREE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE TO PAY TO POST OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ITEMS!,1
3658,love this application,5
3659,when I try to add an address the app freezes. tried it in multiple phones but only works on iphone,1
3660,Adds are really annoying,1
3661,"Overall the app is worthwhile but there's one MAJOR flaw (and one smaller flaw).... Navigating this app is unreasonably slow. Everything takes forever to load and if you try to create a post, you better have a strong Internet connection because it's required for photos to upload otherwise it will fail to create it. I've wasted time on multiple occasions because of this. Response to Developer: Appreciate reaching out but it's nothing on my end. It's just how the app is optimized.",3
3662,Offerup sucks. Got scammed with my 1st purchase. Luckily got a refund. Also I get people that are scams or want to waste my time. I never sell anything on it. Won't ever try and use it again.,1
3663,Owsome I sold my equipment really fast,5
3664,After being with them for 7 years I cannot belive they just mess with me like that don't download this app fukkng scam,1
3665,love the killer deals!,5
3666,very nice,5
3667,"annoying pop-up ads make you close the app because you cannot close them. This app went downhill since it's launch. There's ads within the search results that take you to other sites, so I don't see a reason for pop-ups that lock up on your screen.",1
3668,too many ads though,4
3669,if its my idea to add my cell let me,2
3670,This is the 3rd time I've had to reload this.,5
3671,a great way to sell your extra stuff,5
3672,"I would so gladly give this app zero stars if I could. I'm really shocked that such a large company participates in the level of scamming that they do. The app is literally programmed to scam you. It lies about exceeding post limits, rule violations, and who knows what else. Then, customer service will also repeatedly lie in response. Different reps will also provide different lies, and all of this is generally in an effort to squeeze a few dollars out of sellers for a ""free"" service. TRASH!",1
3673,Can't cancel premium subscription,1
3674,"Offerup is a bunch of. a crooks, they'll take your money, and they won't give you a refund.",1
3675,"The ads get very limited visibility, and they ask you to try the boost feature for 3 days then charge you on the 2nd day and refuse to refund, and the boost does nothing too, I posted the same ad on Facebook marketplace and it got 5x more views and was sold in the 3rd day.",1
3676,"too many adds, its not practical like in the beginning",1
3677,too much advertising and spam,1
3678,Remove the pop-up ads you money grabbers. You already have plenty of ads,1
3679,"It's a good app if you are looking for a car o tools. However, I don't like that they offer for the three days free trial, but it's no free, they charge you for the month after your three free days even if you have canceled one day before it ends.",4
3680,love it. very safe to use,5
3681,I love it very good site I usually find what I'm looking for,5
3682,I think the app is on point any maneuvers very well for whatever you are looking for a quick fast in a hurry so you can make your offer,5
3683,Removed account without any reason,1
3684,Want to cancel subscription this minute because I don't want to be charged for a service that I don't even want to use This app is garbage and won't let me out of the free trial period before it bills me 0.,1
3685,Love it,5
3686,"Very aggravating to go to the free items,and almost everything I seen said, not free' make offer. So free stuff isn't even a catagory anymore, and I think they are being deceitful",2
3687,great site has everything I need great way to make sales and buy anything I am looking for,5
3688,great app,5
3689,great place to do business,5
3690,Seller was very friendly. Nice guy. Easy process.,5
3691,Easy navigation on the site,5
3692,scamers exist,1
3693,"For the simpler things and local I hope offer up remains at the level of simplicity they are on vs eBay and other all are good if we make the right decision being, basic safety and when a scam looks like a scam well start your homework or pass . All are rare here. Yet I safely had 2 of the ""too good deals"" and sometimes the reason would just shock ya. kind hearts paying something forward and that is all. Simple, options how you want to but or sell and that has worked .jobs added was nice .",5
3694,The site keeps the money.,1
3695,"Horrible App, very slow poot design, users are flakes, waste of time,",1
3696,I do very well as far as sales with this app. I chose to no longer use there shipping feature. #1- they charge a large percentage. #2 -three items I sent out I was never paid for nor did I get my merchandise back and when I contacted them they basically ignored me. I was banned from using offer up for defending myself against an inappropriate gentleman. At least I think that's what the problem is because I can never get a reason about what I did wrong.,1
3697,Won't open with VPN. how do you trust an app that wants to see your IP address?,2
3698,The Best Site for Selling & Buying!!,5
3699,I haven't bought anything yet but I'm loving the prices and nice items in this app.,5
3700,"The best app to sell and buy items. Sold so many things over the years, from the biggest like vehicles to the smallest, like a video game. People will buy anything at the right price. Trust me, it's worth it.",5
3701,Too many adds. One every minute. It should change the name to offeradds. Time to look for a new app.,1
3702,Absolute best site to shop new or used!!!!!,5
3703,"OfferUp decided to shut down my old account I had since 2016. I tried selling a parts car (that was legal, not stolen, just had no way of getting the title) that they tried telling me was breaking their rules, even though I hadn't broken any of their rules they decided it was in there best interest to shut down my account. I never had anything bad or negative mark on my account, was a trusted person for anything I purchased had excellent remarks from anyone that dealt with.OfferUp= P.O.S.",2
3704,Bueno,5
3705,A.B.,5
3706,the best app around,5
3707,Pour customer service with a complete lack of any kind of real time help when not if but when you have a problem. The only reason to download this app is that there websiteis for some ungodly reason not able to complete a transaction instead telling you to use the app. While the app has issues that can't be resolved quickly,1
3708,"It is a great tool to keep the community working together and helping one another with every type of item for sale, or trade, at good prices. One man's trash is another's treasure",5
3709,I cannot get my bubble notifications on. And sometimes I don't my sounds notifications. Don't know what to do. I've turned them all off and on again.,4
3710,SUPER SLOW to load- too many ads now. used to be much better. Needs LOTS of work.,1
3711,honest and very trust worthy,4
3712,annoying ads too the app asks too many questions the price should be listed on the pictures,1
3713,"OfferUp is AWFUL! It has gone downhill ever since merging with letgo. I post maybe one item for sale every 2 months and they continuously remove my listing telling me I'm avoiding fees when I am in fact well within the monthly free listing limit per category. Obviously their support people are not well trained, either that or they've got some serious bugs in their system. I am giving up on OfferUp and going with a much better online at Marketplace!",1
3714,always a great app to sell and buy items,5
3715,"Slow to take off fake accounts. In my area, there are a lot of fake accounts, who use pictures of ladies, that recycle the same picture and description of a mattress they are trying to sell. Due to offer up algorith, once you click on one of these post, your feed will be full of a bunch of the same post from different accounts, which ruins the shopping experience because you feed becomes full of these fake posts",2
3716,"I would rate it a lot higher if the people who said they would show up, actually showed up",3
3717,Great app,5
3718,my items don't get any views,1
3719,I hope I am getting my messages as soon as they come in OfferUp! Thank You!,5
3720,I've noticed sometimes people will sell you something where you don't notice somethings wrong with it right away and they mark it sold to someone else so you can't rate them.,3
3721,"Bad, bad site they tdo not respect a sellers preferences. They will mislead a person. Watch out they are after your info. From your DMV onfo to the last four of your SS number. The app is a mess and your site is so hard to get to where you post. Their categories a sixth grader could have done better.",1
3722,site is very helpful.,5
3723,Just the app need to turn some of my things into cash,5
3724,I would get a good price,5
3725,OfferUp usually has good sellers and buyers very good experience except for the ads that are starting lately,4
3726,"I created an account, then verified my phone number, email, FB, etc. Then, nobody was responding to any of my messages, and my listings weren't getting any views. I contacted support and they only gave me an email saying I was banned without any reason! OfferUp is a JOKE. Please do yourself a favor and use Facebook Marketplace.",1
3727,site is great. I have to say it is hard to get buyer and seller connected.,5
3728,"Easy to buy and sell anything. Trustworthy platform, users are friendly, respond in a timely manner payments are processed easily. No complaints. I use OfferUp whenever I have items to sell.",5
3729,It's not like how it used to be. It's not the app it's the people. Way overpriced items.,1
3730,good offers,5
3731,Nice we websites,4
3732,1. I expect after blocking a seller not to see him under search again. Yet they always pop selling something again. 2. Where's the list of people who I'm following? 2. I don't need the phone to vibrate when I touch an ad to slide up.,2
3733,love it,5
3734,Good app,5
3735,I would love to see more people selling items!,4
3736,10 out 10,5
3737,Too many pop up adds,1
3738,Sellers don't respond..WASTE of time & Too many ads.,1
3739,Does what it says,3
3740,Buggy dumpster fire and yet they keep asking for money for multiple BASIC features offered elsewhere for free.,3
3741,Bought some Contacts from a young lady. She actually kindly even delivered!!! And contacts were as she said brand-new I usually order online. This was cheaper and faster! I will put her name up ASAP.,5
3742,OfferUp doesn't care. I was ripped off AND the person I met up with was A MAN USING A WOMAN PROFILE. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT INCIDENTS!,1
3743,Good deals,5
3744,need to put more on it.,4
3745,great person stand by his words and on time,5
3746,good things I find here at OfferUp good quality thanks.,5
3747,Amazing experience! Thank you! üëçüèº,5
3748,no one monitors the site. constantly have ppl posting offers instead of free in the free section and now after looking at 5 things you get an ad! I've tried reaching out but nvr got a response.,1
3749,you can ge,5
3750,I saw good things here. Thanks,5
3751,These ads are killing me,1
3752,This app would be great if people actually used it and responded to messages.,3
3753,Love it,5
3754,it works,5
3755,Great way to make money.,5
3756,they need to fix the search system doesn't work for ishh,1
3757,Scam artists... Someone at your scam company needs to let me know how to remove my cash app card from this site,1
3758,No option to block other users listings so I literally just have to deal with people having 10 items and posting those same 10 items 10 to 100 times each or quite possibly more and all you see is these people's reposted items the same thing hundreds of times what's going on with that I can block him and then he can't see my listings but I can't block his listings so I can actually clean up what I see it is the equivalent of being spammed kinda makes the app useless,1
3759,Would be better if the new items were separate from the privately sold items,5
3760,Pain,1
3761,they ads is completely dumb also pay to send a message first if everyone had premium then wouldn't it be a regular message if they all pay to be first so no one would truly be first it's a scam at this point,1
3762,when selling items. it dont give many veiws.,1
3763,Bought a car,5
3764,it works like it should,5
3765,"absolutely wonderful, I just can't stay off of it I find great stuff daily.",5
3766,great place to sale your extra items,5
3767,üö¨,1
3768,subscription TRAP,1
3769,not enough show unless you pay,1
3770,"It's not terrible, but it sure lacks modernization. You can't see prices unless you click on the pic. Can't save search filter settings.",3
3771,awesome,5
3772,Awesome app. Probably the best thing that happened besides Craigslist lol,5
3773,having problems with my listings and messaging,2
3774,There are many different applications that are available for this app,4
3775,"Use to like it Now you have ads, i understand. I have to make money, but when your ads start coming as a frustration, they run the course, and there no way to close them. They have to close the app just to open it again to use it days are numbered... befire i uninstall",1
3776,When i open offer up it's very slow Inbox opening very slow,1
3777,people don't respond or delete their post if it's not available and leave you in wonder for weeks. kind of a shifty app...,3
3778,I was with LETGO for years and I was getting hits all the time on my products but since OFFER UP took over it's been nothing but disappointment after disappointment every time I post products you have to pay to get it notice I don't even see my product in rotation after I post it I'm being nice giving you 1 star I sell more product without this app. Problems even when message a seller about the product no response or the response takes days or weeks before you get a response.....0,1
3779,phishing hole for scammers.,3
3780,This app is mediocre at best! Too many ads too many vehicles posted from a year ago people don't reply back when you are inquiring on buying an item.,2
3781,great app to find good deals only bad thing is the people don't answer you alot of the times.,5
3782,Was good long-time ago,1
3783,"as a buyer I'm very frustrated as 95+% of the people I msg that I want to buy their product or get some info on, They Don't even answer me! All I ask is that the give me a Yes or No, or how much is a product or a service but... Not even an answer! Can someone help me or is this program just that Wack? thank you.",1
3784,All good Good,5
3785,Offer up has the worst way of cancelling thy're free trial. They make it impossible. I been trying for 2 days. I give up and am going to be forced to pay the 19.99. I just dont like to ship anything its to much hassle for me. I just dont like to ship anything THATS THE ONLY REASON i dont join BUT RECENTLY I WAS POST and when it came to how do i want to sell it didnt give me the option i always choose. Locally. I pushed premium. No other option,5
3786,Easy to use. Seems like a lot of people see my posts.,5
3787,Very helpful,5
3788,"OfferUp just deleted and removed my account after 8 years of being a solid 5 Star Seller (not a 4.8 or a 4.9). They stated that I violated the Community Guidelines. Not sure how I violated anything, as I only sold great products and items, and I provided all my buyers with an excellent OfferUp experience. Unfair how they just remove you, and then that's it. 8 years and 5 Stars is evidence that I was a great member of the community. Thanks, OfferUp. üòî",1
3789,Great,5
3790,Garbage app,1
3791,Great website,5
3792,I wish it could be logged into via computer and not just my smartphone,3
3793,too many scammers and car dealerships,1
3794,Be careful alot of horney miserable creeps on this app like super weird ppl ü§£,1
3795,Unsatisfied with service.,1
3796,the app too slow,1
3797,great app!!,5
3798,Transaction was safe and smoothly,5
3799,Figured i would tey it out and made a pur hase and now yhe seller nor customer support will not respond. Most likely thos app is just another platform for scam artist to con money out of people.,1

3801,"It's not bad, but there is a serious problem with lack of diversity in your feed. It pretty much just shows you items relating to the last three items you viewed. Which means you will never encounter oddities that you did know you needed. Killing the whole scrolling to waste some money on something aspect. It also means other people aren't seeing yoir posts unless they are specifically after what your posting. I'd like to see more randomized instead of stuff far away.",3
3802,Not showing anything recent. Ever since the new update it just shows me stuff that relates to my browsing history. Almost all items have been posted up to a week ago. Nothing recent. *Update. 2 years later it is not fixed. Ads are rampant now and you cant how long a post has been up for. Deleting this app once and for all,1

Many of the ads were posted anywhere from 1 year, and up to 6 years ago. Offerup recently took the dates off of older ads. So, they didn't solve the problem. Same tired old ads, people wasting their time, getting their hopes up that they might get that deal. Obviously, OfferUp only cares about advertising clicks.",1
3805,From three to one. Practically useless. Ads are invasive and prices are not visible for most of the search results. It's a waste of time. Uninstalled.,1

3816,Letgo was better in every way. I used to get interested buyers every so often but once I moved everything to this stupid app I've had nothing. Also letgo's layout was 1000% better. Update: It is even worse than I thought. I never get notifications if I get a message . But it'll give me a notification to buy something all the time.,1
3817,Been with Offer Up for some time now. Great experience and best app out there to sell your goods in your community.,5
3818,"I love it, great deals!!!!",5

3827,"The app is good however it's frustrating when you're looking for something and it's been posted years ago, not sure if you have any control of removing things that are old but would be nice if there was a sort option for newly posted.

3846,"My account was bocked for violation, but I did nothing. Tried to get an answer and without any result.",1
3847,I have ALWAYS said and have sent emails to them about putting time limits on the listings. letting things stay up for ex: 7 years just causes clutter that people looking have to sift through of so many things that arent even available anymore. if people want to keep the items up they should have to renew the listing after a certain amount of time or it comes off. I think they would get more people back to them if they did this. The other would be more information about the listing when scrolling,1

3859,OfferUp it's not letting me post anything. When I contacted support they keep sending canned responses saying they have a limit number of free listings. I never posted more than 10-15 items a month. Limit is 200.,1

3862,"Hate the ads. I used to like offerup but anymore it just seems to be the place where everyone thinks their watches, coins, and Pokemon cards are all worth hundreds and hundreds of dollars without needed any type of certification.

3888,Use to like this but there are way too many ads Pop up non stop and after you guys bought a company out and changed it to offerup the app has been dead for years I have try to contact people buying stuff but they never replied to your messages and if I try to sell my stuff to make some money no one buys my items as the app is dead no one has used this app after you bought a company out and changed it to offerup so everyone that is sale there stuff is either in eBay or Craigslist or flea market.,2

3902,Loved it,5
3903,"UPDATE. Unknown rules pop up that remove your post unless you pay. Used to be good. It is now one of the slowest apps for using. I have been using it for years until they become pure commercial money makers. If you don't pay, you get the most trashy app for selling and buying.",1
3904,Not near as good as it once was.,2
3905,love offer up,5

3947,"Ok app to sell stuff that's if you can sell it. Between the scammers, no shows and the super low ball offers people try to offer that app it self is ok. 5,10,15 less is ok in my eye's but when yours selling something for 50 and they want it for 20 common people and then you don't show up that's adding more insult. Offer up needs to do more for the now shows no reposting after the no shows. Because of that no show the next person in line loses interest as well for making them wait.",3
3948,people who sell cars are not real people they always want to email you,2

3987,"Great app for finding and selling stuff, but do NOT use them for shipping. It gets really convoluted with their specific timeframe policy where you HAVE to verify/reject/refund/etc. the content you're selling/purchasing within a 2-day period. It is used to protect the buyer/seller, but it is messy when you have to go through them to resolve a shipping issue when there is one. I wish their customer service was faster as well.",3
3988,"Ads and spam/scams are terrible, lots of items that get listed for shipping that nobody responds to offers on. Can be decent sometimes for specific items but often FB marketplace or ebay are more reliable and better prices.

4029,"Can't say I dislike anything about this except maybe that it's missing the ability to call the person on the spot if you wanna get the item immediately. Otherwise, I'm good. I use it practically every single day!",5
4030,"Verification process won't work, can't use the app, can't make a sale, can't get lunch today, no response to my support ticket. I hope the worst for these people, whoever or whatever is getting in the way of my food money today, karma can be so cruel. Eat the rich.",1
4031,Easy but no sales,3
4032,Possibly the worst experience I've had with an app ever. You require all these steps to be able to post just for the final one not to even work bc you use the worst system I've ever seen.,1
4033,Excellent place to find what you need at a good price. Always had good experience.,5
4034,"way to many adds now. and the ""free"" section isn't free anymore. full of people just selling their stuff or wanting offers.",2
4035,Great,5
4036,too many scams,2
4037,Excellent app with solid leads,5
4038,"PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS APP! YOU WILL GET SCAMMED AND OFFERUP WILL PUNISH YOU, NOT THE SCAMMER! I've used it since 2018, I thought I could trust the platform. Apparently not. I made the mistake of trusting their TruYou & Phone/Text verification systems to believe that a seller I was buying from was legit (even had 5 stars). Well next thing you know, he's ran off with my $400 and I'm trying to contact OfferUp for help. Yet, the first reply from support was them banning ME! LEARN FROM ME, USE FB!",1
4039,"You guys accepting to do ads makes the experience using the app very annoying. I would also like to have my preferences set so I don't have to keep changing it to ""Local"" every time I'm looking for certain items.",1
4040,Getting to many ads and gimmicks,4
4041,"Can't delete the app from computer, must download app to even start the process",1
4042,easy to use locally optional friendly users,5
4043,I've never had 1 issue. Sold many items,5
4044,Great,5
4045,I send message and noone response,1
4046,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS SITE IS A PAY TO SELL APP,1
4047,been using offer up for over 5 years now.,5
4048,Moving things for years,3
4049,They somehow are trying to charge me for some b.s. subscription I never ask for.,1
4050,"Terrible service, they refuse to activate my account claiming that my cell phone is actually a landline? I am not permitted to contact a seller or purchase an item that is for sale without an activated account.",1
4051,cook app to sale anything really quick,5
4052,"I am shocked that in Phoenix, Offer Up customers are unbelievably dirt-cheap bottom bargainers who haggle to buy 5 chairs & 2 folding tables for $20 when it clearly said $100. The time-wasted and weight-lifting in going bk and forth to storage has been awful.",2
4053,ads ruined OfferUp,1
4054,AWESOME,5
4055,Works incredibly well. Just watch out for scammers.,5
4056,This app sucks. Not because of the app itself but the people. Buying a shipping item here is damn near impossible. People! That's the problem.,1
4057,"I like that there is a reputation system unlike Craigslist, it helps weed out the flakes and lowballers a little. Prices are not displayed on search result thumbnails like Craigslist has, however. You have to go into each item individually to see the price. A lot of ads in search results, often not even relevant. Search results require a lot of sorting. I bought something from a seller who shipped the item and I have no way of rating them! No way to just block someone you have to report them too",1
4058,I found my stolen filth wheel trailer nearly died trying to recover it the cronues at face book that advertised it Facebook and authorities did nothing just like when it was stolen sometimes people do things for self gain di not care who they make waiste in but thank you iffer up,5
4059,Good,5
4060,"Simple, cost effective and functional.",5
4061,App doesn't work! Gave you your card to start a free trial and it won't let me retrieve my messages!!! Never had this issue in the past.,1
4062,It lags way too much and freezes,3
4063,Great app,5
4064,I don't like all the ads from other apps an offers. It gets in the way while searching,2
4065,Awesome,5
4066,not a single response with offer up. Facebook marketplace place 67 responses in 1 week and sold it didn't cost me a dime. I wasted time and money on your site.,1
4067,"Was good, then Ad-pocalyspe. Unskippable ads really ruin the experience of just trying to see what's available real quick. Plus more ads are shown in the results than actual items for sale, and they deguise them well enough that you will accidently click on them. Not paying for premium. Uninstalling now.",1
4068,Great app to sales and buys,5
4069,"Too laggy every time I use it, it crashes and causes my phone to freak put",1
4070,"Won't allow you to post / list using their desktop site, you MUST install their app. Forcing you to use their app is a great tactic SMH. I reluctantly installed and paid a listing fee, only received 2 inquiries. I used Facebook Marketplace for free and got 30 + responses. If you're thinking of using OfferUp.... Don't.",1
4071,this is the best app for selling or buying top of the line,5
4072,With every new update comes more frustration,2
4073,Bs app. Everyone spam post on it. You see the same 5 post a day,1
4074,"Since the update, the app makes it harder to move items from the archive to repost. I'm forced to re-enter every item. A banner comes up to select the item to repost, but the banner will not go away when you push okay.",3
4075,found someone selling my items. reported the person and the listings. contacted the support team as i was advised and explained everything. a few days later and the posts are still up. joke of a marketplace. it be a shame if someone were to purchased any of items and get scammed I'm not sure you'd even hear back from these people,1
4076,"I don't understand, how the hell you saying I have a balance of I don't know what, then you charge my card with no consent, do I was ok , I have some things need to sell , but after you charged me not even 4 days you cancelled my stuff cause I had a balance . the hell with you guy",1
4077,Cool,5
4078,Good,5
4079,"2 many fake adds, and buy this on the free page!!!",1
4080,"Got scammed on a used car I bought on this app,, alot of scamming do not buy vehicles on this app ,, lost out on 8500 for a salvaged car they didn't tell me about !!",1
4081,Love it,5
4082,Excellent application to help one buy and sell new and used goods. Also good source to check product price value.,5
4083,"listings too old sellers rarely respond, need moderators to remove old or inactive listings.",1
4084,I like it because most of what I look for pops up when I'm searching for it that's great that's what I like about it spread the knowledge,5
4085,Too much dealers now.,2
4086,"lost many sales due to the algorithm that judged my phone unworthy because "" too many users of this #"" bs....I'm the only user of this #!!!",2
4087,great app,5
4088,"no one responds, not to offers, not to questions, not to buying",1
4089,"when you're looking up an individual item it seems that you can scroll forever but there's no bookmark, I'm not interested in scrolling through items that I'm looking for for 45 minutes and then simply have to start over",3
4090,So far so good I sold a item so I know it works!!,5
4091,Couldn't sell a thing and immensely frustrating to try to cancel the subscription which has caused me to spend $60 for absolutely nothing. Just go to Craigslist... Update.. still getting charged! How do you unsubscribe from this rip-off!?!?,1
4092,Good,5
4093,Great place to buy anything,5
4094,Before it was a great app to buy and sell now it sucks its not the same you can't search for the things you need because is not capable even to search for classic cars it can't search more than 2 cars,2
4095,They let random users ban your account because you didn't sell them a item for the price they wanted. Then you message offer up what did I do wrong and they tell you well we have a right to Ban you for no reason if we want to. Automated message,1
4096,you have to send them an image of your official government id just to message someone. a gross violation of privacy and a potential phishing scam,1
4097,I started a premium plus free trial and it left me no option to cancel when I look at my subscriptions on Google play I have none. But I'm still being charged the 8.50$. Don't sign up for the free trial it's a scam you cannot cancel,1
4098,"I've had nothing but bad experiences with this app. Whether it's the people I've met trying to scam me (and the app taking their side) or now they charge you to post, I'm just done with this app.",1
4099,love this to sell stuff but not happy you can't boost your stuff without paying anymore,3
4100,Fine,1
4101,Ads and sometimes delays on messages Was a great app b4 update,1
4102,horrible horrible customer service. I have been a seller and buyer on offer up for years. a few months ago I noticed none of my posts got views and I wrote and asked them why and they didn't reply just deleted my account and wrote I violated. I post clothes and household items. no reply from them at all!! do not use this app,1
4103,"I haven't put anything bad on your site, and I don't know what your talking about, call me when you can",1
4104,When you search for something why not put the prices on the thumbnails.. stupid that I have to click on the item to be able to see the price. Waste of time,1
4105,it really let's you get rid of anything at any time if it's near and dear to ur heart u know it's worth as will the nextcsavy person that is like usvall just trying to get an honest deal completely 100 % worth the extra time to cut costs . love this app grateful I use it.,5
4106,"Always finding random stuff I dont need but want, good job lol",5
4107,We have to pay to post now?!?!?! Thats not cool offerup!! 1 star no stars if possible,1
4108,Everytime I try to verify account it kicks me off code page.,1
4109,"As an app for contacting buyers and sellers, there is no reason offerup should be sending me push notifications for anything other than messages from buyers and sellers. Not cool",1
4110,Good stuff,5
4111,Awesome app great things unique items and rare antiques valuables an cheap low price,5
4112,"I find that 75% of the buyers here are serious, unlike some apps.",5
4113,App is slow,1
4114,Photos will NOT upload. I've even tried just using one picture. & I have excellent service and have tried both my mobile network and wifi. What!?!?,1
4115,"I signed up for a 3 day free trial and they immediately billed me $21. I asked why they billed me and they said that I needed to cancel within 3 days and I actually canceled in 2 days, but asked them why they billed me immediately. I no longer received support responses.",1
4116,So many Temu ads.,1
4117,people seem to never respond or have really poor communication I feel like this app is a scam,1
4118,offer up it my first time using it so far üëå üëç,5
4119,Excellent,5
4120,"definitely a resourceful app, be weary of buying used car parts (transmission) especially by some loser in hemet... always buy a transmission from a transmission shop with a warranty... besides that great app!!!",5
4121,You will get low ballers. Just ignore them.,4
4122,"I'm starting to feel that this app might be racist. they seem to pick and choose who can put adds and who may not. they always take me down, but I find many of the same type of add as mine, but they take mine down. I don't think it's fair",1
4123,"I wish I knew about this app years ago, I absolutely love the simple to use setup, and no matter what you are looking for, offerup has everything!!",5
4124,Great experience with site and customers,5
4125,"I placed a free ad for a car , it never published. there was no way to contact customer service in this regards",1

4132,Awesome thanks,4
4133,offer up is awsome,4
4134,"I dig it, makes it easy for me to sell my unwanted things",4
4135,Have to pay. I thought it was free. And it doesn't inform you until you get an account. I didn't see it so very disappointing. Wish it would had informed me before I put made my ads. How frustrating!,1
4136,full of ads that go off app. wont show you prices. garbage,1
4137,Leave me alone you guys stealing money even when I cancel my subscription and delete my account you still do it anyway,1

4143,"Went to post something local after not using the app for awhile, and now the app is not free to post items for sellers. If you want to sell local, you have to pay to post items now.. To Facebook Marketplace I go!",1
4144,Slowest app ever. And it's been like this for years.,1
4145,"I don't like it, repeating the same items.",3
4146,"Less than 3 minutes from install i uninstalled due to the full screen ads. There are ads for the items you search for that are the highest amazon prices so you think you are getting a good deal(2 door freezer, amazon ad for $24,000 when they are around 1800-2400 new typically. )",1
4147,Offer up is a great place to find almost everything you might be looking for. I Love it.,5
4148,"I find the ad's very annoying, but I suppose they need some kind of income to support the infrastructure.",4
4149,better updates,4
4150,"Not what it used to be. None of my listings get a single view and no seller responds to any of my messages. Must be some sort of bug, uninstalling",1
4151,good app,5

4156,Offer up is the best he he he,5
4157,"App is crazy laggy, ads everywhere, missing important options like being able to send a picture through a chat with a potential buyer/seller. Beyond all, customer service is terrible, won't respond for weeks and will close your account without notice.",1
4158,the app freezes and takes a decent amount of time loading . .. I personally feel like it could work a lot smoother than it currently does,4
4159,Too many ADS = Zero ‚≠ê,1
4160,"They allow labels that get package to you but sometimes you have to pay a lot more because sellers lie and are able to somehow send packages without paying shipping. Offer up wouldn't reimburse but said oh well, not our problem.",1

4163,This app is awful. Does anyone know of another app where they can sell things?,1
4164,I've had no problems with no phone I've had beautiful app,5
4165,"This app is terrible. You can't sell any airsoft or airsoft related equipment on this app. If you're looking to sell a product, I'd recommend avoiding offer up and go with eBay if you don't want to get scammed and actually sell an item with out loosing to much money to the scam of an app. I will not reach out to you you can use my account info to reach out to me",1
4166,great job,5
4167,Horrible to use! Use to use all the time now all you get is pop up ads that you either go to the link or you force quit the app and then have to start all over uninstalling now!!!,1

4186,Didn't make much on this app low ballers,2

4188,Great platform to buy and sell from.,5
4189,GET RID OF THE ID VERIFICATION . YOU ARENT ANYONE TO ASK/KEEP A COPY OF SENSTIVE INFORMATION Update: messaged them & told them I won't be sending my information as they have every other identity verification checked off. Their customer support just stopped replying and therefore can't use my account anymore. Definitely fishy why they're so desperate for my gov issued ID with all these cyber attacks going on & hacks,1
4190,Fun app; I'm always coming back to browse and shop. Recommended for the variety of things for sale at an affordable price. Using for about a year and no bad experiences!,5
4191,Great place for hard to find parts and good prices,5
4192,"I used to post ads on offer up, multiple ads daily. I used to sell many items, then all of a sudden I get zero views on any and all products I post now. I have no idea what happened or why it's happening, but OfferUp is now allowing me to post items however, they are not listing them. I cannot even find my own listing using keywords that I know I posted. I can even try to look up any item that I posted by the exact name and description that I posted it with and no listing is ever found anymore.",1
4193,Always a pleasure,5
4194,Why can I not see prices,3
4195,I uses to live it no with all the ads and they don't even get me messages asking fmif available at least 50 request and no one gets my message in a way they force you to get the monthly scam,1
4196,"This was the best, local selling app that existed. Now it's riddled with ads and is a terrible experience to use. I had over 200 5 starts on this app, but it is now unstable. If I want BS paid ads, I will use eBay. Fix this actual aids you call ads and I might come back.",1

4212,Did it again,5
4213,"The app is soo damn abused. When looking for free items, make it possible for people to flag these zero amount items and THEN says it cost money in the description. Make a button to flag these deceptive posting. They are annoying as hell. I wish the mobile app would lost the price as an overlay on top of the images. Also, there isn't a way to delete postings.

I got a free 7 day trial ...and the messages would not be there or I was contacted from California and my post was in Wisconsin and they told me thar it appeared local over there and right when i wanted to cancel my subscription. I could nor for the life of me find where to cancel. I was then charged 19.99 so one person from California coukd contact me about my 2500 car in wisconsin. Make THAT MAKE SENSE,1

4248,Great Way 2 Do Business.,5
4249,"It has its good and bad. They stay on top of some rules and let others slide like people posting items for sale in the free section is very annoying but they don't do anything about it, so theres more items for sale than free in the free section. The app has been freezing up and closing every 5-10 mins lately. It's also very annoying how they feel you need to be reminded ""how dangerous everyone is"" every time you exchange info with locals.",2
4250,"I used to buy and sell with this app, but they stopped allowing shipping to and from Arkansas, so I quit using it. Before then, I actually bought (and had shipped!) my wedding dress from Texas... my nextdoor state. I don't know what happened, but it's not worth using now.",1

So now you've got something else to worry about on this app: Officially sanctioned violence. Previous: OfferUp has become the go-to place for scammers. Their car listings are absolutely chock-full of cashiers check scams, deceptive ads and bait-and-switch scams. You're better off on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.",1
4266,"Letgo was much better. Too many ads, too many notifications. I'm just done.",1
4267,hate having to pay to get my items promoted. other than that it's great.,4

4269,good,5
4270,never seem to be ablento actually sell anything. ive posted many things and they just sit for weeks,1
4271,"I sent an email asking for assistance with regards to my lists and favorites being removed without explanation or reason. Instead of helping me or asking to be of assistance, Offerup closed my account without reason. I lost all 30 of my feedback ratings and support hasn't been supportive. What makes this worse is the fact that Letgo merged with this app and now it has a monopoly almost in this space. This sucks. Support if you see this, can someone fix this? I already have sent multiple emails",1
4272,AB,5
4273,Terrible app. Rude and unprofessional developers. They block your account with no warning or reason and block any future accounts you create. There should be a law against this. I will look into this with my lawyers and see if we can bring a class action lawsuit against this company. I urge others to do the same. Uninstall this trash app. There are others better.,1
4274,too restrictive even though people are posting food and what is in the restrictive list,1
4275,This app is a scam Don't install,1
4276,It's cool,4
4277,"I was randomly signed into someone else's account and had access to all of their information including payment and contact info. Fortunately for them, I'm not a thief or scammer. I reached out to support and got robot responses. I wouldn't put payment info into this app until this is addressed by the company.",1
4278,Download not working,1
4279,This is not a good app sometimes specially for a seller that constantly tries to sell stuff on this platform,1
4280,Honestly this platform has been declining for a couple of years they do not promote your items as well as before you pay for their boost you barley get any extra views I'm sad to say someone needs to buy out the current owner and re do the whole platform service is trash now,2
4281,"You will never get any answers, ever. ""Can I pick this up locally?"" ""Is this sold already?"" No answers, ever. This was a good app at one time, unfortunately, now it is worthless. I've made multiple offers on things at full price only to see someone else get them anyway. This is because while it says that if you make a full price offer it will be accepted immediately, it's not true. You have to have a ""PREMIUM account"" for that. DO NOT trust this app, nor anyone on it, it's absolutely WORTHLESS.",1
4282,People try to rob you. The people running the app are scary invasive to you and your profile page. I'm erasing this and trying mercari app,1
4283,too many commercials,2
4284,"This app has fallen off immensely. Prior to Offerup buying out ""Letgo"", Offerup constantly changed UI, and had special offers constantly due to competition. Ever since its buyout, this app has not updated their clunky UI once, and now has a bunch of ads. and you can see it in the decline of users. This app became a sad inside joke among people that sell on the side. RIP offerup. You'll be missed.",2
4285,"It runs very slow! The pages take forever to load. I sell and my page of listings sometimes never loads. I can't delete listings, only archive. There are way too many ads and there are posts that are as old as 6 years!! I gave it 2 stars instead of a 1 because their sellers fees aren't too bad. I stay with it on the off chance I might sell something.",2
4286,Very pleasant .thank you,5
4287,Liked offer up since the day I came across the app and I checked it out immediately and was like ***k YES...‚ò∫Ô∏èü§£,4

4289,"the free section on offer up is littered with ads, and paid items. i will not give money to an app that works so poorly and does not have support. 2 stars because i actually find good on offer up",2
4290,Havent been able to post anything in months. I lost alot of business beacuse of this. Dont use this app if you're a dedicated seller. Ohh and the ads contain explicit pictures that on more than one occasion I've had to report.,1
4291,They took my add off without my consent I had a buyer that disappeared now I don't k now if he can reach me.,1
4292,Needs to be optimized. It gets laggy most times Update: way smoother now. Overall one the best marketplaces on the internet,5
4293,If I could give this zero stars I would. App is full of people trying to get your information,1
4294,I love how determined they are to make this safe and friendly for ever yone and they r on top of things,5

4297,Great,5
4298,Great platform to sale local or Nation wide,5
4299,I've always had good experiences when I use OfferUp I sold the vehicle on there one time and it was pretty easy and it was safe,5
4300,Your ads are intrusive now way to many. The notifications showing up i. Messages is really annoying so i think I may have sold something but no its a notification saying new items from people you follow. Why not just show the red dot and not send it to messages cause its not a message. Your app is slowly sucking worse the before. It used to be good but not now. Fix the notifications and messaging. Monitor whats being sold in the categories. To many items in free that arent free.,1
4301,love it,5
4302,I've always had a decent to great experience using this app when I have bought things from people and posting items to sell is made real easy- Matthew Arena,5

4308,wonderful,5

Where the hell are they? *No app competition has driven the app quality down and me to using Craigslist.",1
4310,"offerup messaging system and the website overall is very laggy, and there are good percentage of scammers here. offerup needs to do a better job screening out the scammers and provide safer platform for buyers.",2

4312,Great app to buy stuff cheap,5
4313,Buena,5
4314,Not effective.,1
4315,"This app used to be decent. Now it's ads galore and showing me items for sale halfway across the country. I have local pickup only selected so I'm not interested in items for sale in Kansas. Let go was a better app, Offer up should have been done away with instead.",2
4316,"I've tried using this ap several times in the last 5 years, AND THE SAME ISSUES HAVE NEVER BEEN FIXED. It takes forever to upload photos from your gallery. It only works if you take pictures from their ap. TOO MANY ADS. YOU GET NO TRACTION UNLESS YOU GET THEIR PREMIUM PKG.",1
4317,grate interface activities,4
4318,It's ridiculous that they allow all these dealerships to put fake prices for their vehicles and there's no actual way of blocking the accounts to prevent the falsely advertised listing. Also unlisted items need to be manually taken off of. There's no way to remove dealer posts from the search. 1 star feels generous for how horrible this app has become. Now they got rid of most recent when some postings are over 5 years old. Don't waste your time,1
4319,awesome service,5
4320,Cant get it to open it says sorry something went wrong try back later thats why 1 star get it fixed and ill give it a 5 star thank u,1

4323,ads make no sense,1
4324,"Meh..its alright. the ads are taking over, unless you pay(of course). It sucks that they dont do more to discourage small time mom n pop type of businesses from using it for free advertising ie. Tire shops, discount furniture stores etc. I feel like people visit this site to find something different or maybe save some money, if i wanted to shop at a tire shop or discount furniture shop i would go there and do so.",2
4325,great way to sell,5
4326,posted 5 items in last two years can't find them anywhere even when I narrow my search to 10 miles from home. b.s,1

4342,"There's people here selling thats 1 or 2 years old posted, should be atleast 1 month old then gotta repost to sell, i hate i always gotta change the miles, i wish it would stay st my choice instead of always choosing the miles, also it's harder to sell items since now you gotta pay too, supposedly sell faster",2
4343,Good,5
4344,"Never bought or sold anything, yet my account gets disabled for violating community guidelines?? Idk why that would get me disabled, but I'm not using this app again. I also don't recommend it for all the ads and search filter. Everything ready to be shipped usually shows up first!!!",1

4347,"I was able to find, communicate about, purchase, and track an item all through a web browser, but when I try to accept the delivery and rate the seller, ""feature unavailable, please use our app to access this feature"".

4348,nice,5
4349,I love this app iwishi would sell more yet I sure I will soon,5
4350,"I think that we should have the option of not only rating buyers and sellers, but also rating people who express interest in items and then never show up or never contact you after making plans and waiting for them all day long.

4351,"I'm finding myself using it less and less because of people ""abusing"" the FREE section to wrongfully categorize items they're trying to sell for MONEY (NOT FREE) to get more views from people looking for FREE items. There's good people out there sharing their kindness with those in need of certain things that they have but no longer need. However, the free section of the app is one ""hmu for prices"" after another in the description of the""$0"" priced item. I'm near uninstalling the app.",2
4352,loveit,5
4353,I think this web good for all garden farmer.,5
4354,"App is okay. It will take close to 5 mins per item to post regardless. I just add pictures and quickly pick the categories, I even use the description that is cut and pasted from cross listing. The waiting for the listing to upload then closing out all the extras, Ugh! I wonder why I only list about 1/2 as much stuff here, then God forbid if you want to resist something, they don't have that option AT ALL SMH! Then opening messages is a whole nother story.",3
4355,Muy Buena...,3

Users were reported but now Im the one that cant message anyone.",1

4376,Offer up serves a great purpose.,5
4377,Its called OfferUp but you block a user from making offers?? Marketplace will always be better.,1
4378,The app did not post my listing and was very unclear as to whether I was subscribed to the premium version. I was surprised with a $20 charge and no option to refund. Do not recommend. Look at Mercari instead.,1
4379,"you can find some great deals on offer up, and it's beneficial to both parties",5
4380,"They used to want an email verification to have an account which makes sense since every place wants the same thing but now they ask for your number too. Which again, not too bad but eh. And once you have done that, they'll want you to verify that you are you by sending your ID, which makes absolutely no sense other than the fact that they want your information which is not right. Why do they need to know where we live and our personal information for an app about selling items? Makes no sense.",1
4381,this is a good app.,5
4382,There's a lot of scams and they don't remove stuff that's been on the site for months,3
4383,"I probably would be rating this app 5 stars, if I could actually use it. My Truyou has been denied multiple times for no reason. I have been charged not only for Offerup Premium, but for items that have been sold. The seller tried contacting me trying to work another deal out, but I am unable to respond. I cannot believe they will charge me for premium service, and then proceed to not allow me to use any service they offer whatsoever. Customer service is useless. Dont contact them for any reason",1

4392,I'd rate noOffers no stars if I could. This app is a scam. Don't bother with these people all they want is for you to upgrade your listing so it can be more visible among all the spam ads. What a pathetic joke. Really anyone wanting to sell here would be better off with hand written flyers on the cork board at the corner store. I had one free posting for a vehicle and they took it down because they want to up sell. Your support team is lame to they can't keep the spammer off their own deployment,1

4468,"Used to be a great app, now everything I see is 1000 miles away, or a sponsored ad.",1
4469,!!!This offerup app owners are so woke that they won't even allow you to post pellet guns!!! I really don't know who's still using this worthless app!!!!,1
4470,Awesome app!,5
4471,*be aware buying on OfferUp I got scammed for $450 buying Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra in the box and was a fake Samsung device OfferUp is using ads. full screen to push purchase the app without the ads sooner or later I will delete itüòë No cover for your lose be aware we have to use cash app endless your money will be gone. Be safe out there and stay away from scammer make sure your checking whatever you're buying.,1
4472,"now with ads, lame. can't even tell the difference between the ads and the offers. and offer up charges 13% plus transaction fees for shipped items. AND they don't have enough shipping options.",2
4473,Local search and pick up only filters don't work. Who is trying to buy a used lawn mower and have it shipped across the country?,1
4474,I made over $250k my first year using this app,5
4475,"Almost unusable now that they started pushing their $7.99 premium service. Uninstalled Edit: is emailing you going to get rid of the ads? I swear generic auto replies like that just scream ""we'll offer you something privately to change your review"" to me. No thanks, done with this trash app.",1
4476,"Horrible app. I have reported obvious scammers and nothing comes of it. People who violate your terms, i.e. wanting to use 3rd party programs for cash transfer, and you guys do nothing about it. I'm done",1
4477,too many ads and links to commercial sites. was great then big tech got ahold of it.,2
4478,"I just downloaded this and I put up a listing, but then I went like searching for cars for $1,000 within 25 miles but the app keeps switching it to 80 miles, finally got the app to accept Ewing New Jersey as my location, my question is why am I being shown things all the way in Florida and Maryland I'm just wondering like there is no way I'm going to travel that far to pick up some car or anything like why am I being shown stuff that's super far away and why won't the app show me items closer",3
4479,"You gotta love a quick sale with local buyers, I've turned over merchandise in as little as one hour after posting. Love this app.",5
4480,Ads in notification bar can't differentiate between someone contacting you. Prices are not in listings. Pop-up ads don't let you hit the back button to get out of them. Tons of scammers on this platform. (Edit: this is open criticism of your app not a technical problem your customer support link is worthless if the app sucks. Fix it),1
4481,Excellent!!! Easy to understand & communicate! Variety of Safe & Honest Sellers!,5
4482,"Ads. Also can't filter out national results even if you select 30 mile distance and no shipping. I don't care about items in Florida if I'm in Wisconsin! I was looking for a beer fridge, but not paying to ship it across the country!!",2
4483,every time I (9 items) have tried to buy something they cancele the sale either by offer up or the seller. I'm done with offerup. Note-- while I was writing these remarks they just canceled the last item I was buying 2 weeks ago. I'm done!!!,1
4484,It looks like the im going to Uninstalled delete for 2nd time still the same can't make this app to work now they asking for a ID is not enough with email and phone number,1
4485,They keep banning me no matter what my account isn't working and they sent me an email because I cussed at someone who scammed me. From my knowledge he still has his account fully operational. Funny how stuff works nowadays.,1
4486,No good,1
4487,it's a great resource,5
4488,It's a nice site to buy and sell.,4
4489,app doesn't work I cannot get the ads into the system what I want to sell,1
4490,Easy to use great results!,5
4491,Have unskippable ads. Hidden prices until you click thru. Very hostile user environment,1
4492,this app was just a waste of time setting up. if you don't pay for premium it's useless. the only messages I received were from hackers and scammers instantly after I posted my items twice. doesn't feel safe,1
4493,"This app is a complete joke ! You are being charged to post . $1.00 a post and let me tell you it adds up if you have plenty of items you need to get rid of . OUT OF nowhere, they disactived my Offerup account & their lame reason was "" breaking community guidelines,"" and they lie about allowing ME to appeal to this decision made by them that's a lie . No, actual PERSON reaches out to resolve this it's just automated responses. It's such a shame ( letgo app) is gone . HORRIBLE!!!!!",1
4494,Terrible app. Tons of scammers & ads plus you cant even see when a listing was created. Feel like this has been getting worse over the years. Entire app is just badly designed and never updated or improved upon in any way,1
4495,"So most apps, if it turns out you're breaking a rule, will warn you first. Not this one. I guess I was breaking a because they just banned me without any warning or recourse.",1
4496,"I really enjoy shopping for stuff I need or just browse around but the only problem I have & I'm sure a ton of other customers noticed that you guys have adds that if you look when it was posted it'll be ( 2 yrs ago ) , a whole bunch of adds still up but no merchandise , you guys gotta manage that better to make this site a good experience",5
4497,Not good every time I try to download something I couldn't do it,1
4498,Offer Up is one of the easiest ways to buy & sell things!,4
4499,Delete items again and again and too many scammers and they keep deleting my items and still alot of scammers and bots on here try out the mercari app it sells fast and they don't delete you posts or have bots,1
4500,"Not what it used to be and the way they go about making people pay for ""premium services"" made me delete the app...",1
4501,good,5
4502,my favorite reseller app,5
4503,Support is horrible I was locked out of my account after I got a new phone.,1
4504,"It might have been useful at some point but now it's just scam city. I even got scammed out of $20 for premium because of how much they shove the free trial in your face. Even with premium I couldnt sell a brand new roomba at half the original price, no one is on here unless they're scamming or shipping. Just use Craigslist or next door, lesson learned... Edit: just wanted to follow up. I reached out to support and they said there is nothing they could do. Thanks for wasting more of my time üëç",1
4505,Best app for sale and buy!!!,5
4506,"Great site, I've really benefited in the past while using the site. I'm looking forward to good things to come in the future.",5
4507,Will send your random 'premium' notification ads without an obvious way to disable them. Ads as notifications to sell you stuff are unforgivable.,1
4508,photos üì∏ makes things quick,5
4509,Awesome,5
4510,"This is getting worse, now i have to pay to sell something,",1
4511,"EVERYONE on this app is a cheap-skate and they expect things for damn near free. Without fail, everytime I make a listing I severely depreciate the value of an item in order to sell it quicker; however, I get repeated 90% off low balls non-stop. People need to wake up and join reality. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT, DON'T BUY IT. Economics 101.",1
4512,not many options. cannot see prices unless you open. notifications are not correct. searches don't have enough filters,1
4513,"you should hire people to screen posts people put on here, some obvious scams !!!!",3
4514,i like it,5
4515,the tic took app. sucks remove or or I will cancell,2
4516,"app is good, its the people that suck. time wasters, no shows, low ballers. But the app has no way to penalize or rate the rift raft on offers, only after the sale.",3
4517,Horrible platform for shipping locally is the way to go there's no need to hold my money 4 days after the sale and they accepted it I'll still sell but local only wow and they take a fee then why aren't you helping just says your helping lol pay me not a week worse then eBay,1
4518,This app used to be great! Now they have sold this app out to a bunch of adds. Really üí©üí©üí© app now,1
4519,Good,5
4520,Gud,3
4521,It's great I find good things out there,5
4522,It's All üòä,5
4523,"Some people never sell anything and never respond ever please investigate. probably why i'm broke also. One guvnever even showed up and I even gave directions even though he ""lived close"" the after the directors said ""it's too far""-BRANDY MICOLE ""ICE"" LINDSEY",1
4524,"It's not a bad app. The ads are barable, unlike some other apps. However for the past week or 2 it hasn't been working.",4
4525,no hits on selling my items,1
4526,Great deals.,5
4527,"Trash app period, never use it again.",1
4528,Don't like the app. Have to search for the items I am selling. no selling landing page.,3
4529,easy to use.,5
4530,Is offer up and goof application selling my old USB C lg tv üì∫ and buy the new Andriod 11 Os T3485 su-85Su-100 kv-2 kv-1s tvs pls.,5
4531,"Tried to post knuckle belt buckles, but they kept taking it down. This app sucks, must be ran by communist. And FULL OF ADS! This app sucks.",1
4532,Its good for what it's worth I like it If you have something good it will Sell.,5
4533,I mf lovez thiz app,5
4534,Should be Able 2 add pictures to messages,2
4535,Full page ads you can't skip are too much. Save yourself the headache and go to their website instead.,1
4536,To much advertise,1
4537,Broken app. None of my listings show up. Even if I log out and search.,1
4538,Terrible app. The local filter still shows items all over the country. Waste of time,1
4539,This app has a 1 star on trustpiot OUT OF THOUSANDS OF REVIEWS THERE is no LIVE help they hold YOUR money for WEEKS they will not Display prices on search results how's this not a thing it's stupid literally 90%of listing are FAKE you'll see something g posted 5 min ago message them no reply then the item will say its a sold just to be reposted 2 days later and most of the ratting for this app are fake just look up reviews at the bbb or trust pilot,1
4540,What's the point of blocking someone if it doesn't block them?,3
4541,cheap,5
4542,Awesome app for buying and selling items,5
4543,All there is now is used car lots,2
4544,App is trash nothing but car dealer listing,1
4545,Love it,5
4546,Very Nice App Recommend.,5
4547,They provide zero support when you have been ripped off by sellers. they don't respond to messages and they allow scammers to keep scamming on their platform.,1
4548,Irenehorace,5
4549,I have one item on this app for less than a week it hasn't sold yet. Be careful and don't take payment off site of OfferUp this is the 1st item I've ever tried to sell on OfferUp.,2
4550,"i give it 4 stars even though sometimes the app does freeze up & sometimes what u post up doesn't show up half of the time, I would say just needs a Lil work done so that's why I give it 4stars",4
4551,Update- Fixed the sharing and save list issues but now it freezes up if i try and change my locationüòè Can't share items anymore or create new save lists,1
4552,I really enjoy this app. Well thought out from what I need use of it for.,5
4553,Why is that I can't find any items I want in local?,1
4554,"You do NOTHING to ensure the truth of the ads on your app. People are being scammed every day, and you don't care at all. I have reported DOZENS of ads, and you do nothing about them. If I could give you less than a 1, I would.",1
4555,"The app is one of the worst apps in regards to customer support. I have used this app for 7+ years and they have banned my account and failed to tell me why. I adhere to all the rules, but they can ban you for any reason they want and they don't have to disclaim/provide reasoning for the offense. Very ridiculous",1
4556,Too many ads,3
4557,"my... the ads, spam, and scams. nail in the coffin? Android 10 isn't supported. you're a marketplace app, not a game",1
4558,No on there even replies back. I've tried multiple times with people on there. All people do is post and not reply. Worse then Craigslist.,1
4559,the app is good but to many low ballers,3
4560,good app to sell stuff. mostly positive feedback just one incident involving a man trying to pick up my wife. other then that great lol üòÇ,5
4561,Ads,1
4562,"Used to be a good app, now it's trash! They constantly send spam notifications to you. If you turn the notifications off, then you can't message notifications anymore. They got adds to interrupt your browsing when looking for stuff. Plus, dont plan on selling anything inless you pay to get it boosted..",1
4563,"app is actually ok when it comes time to buy local stuff for the low low but selling stuff man all the scammers have left Facebook and are here in offer up. "" DON'T GET SCAMMED. "" üíØ",3
4564,Exceptu,4
4565,"My advise is to stay away from this platform. The platform is prompt to have you send an item to the buyer. The platform does not care if you get paid for items you sell. I am still waiting to get paid and nothing yet,,",1
4566,people are too shady even when stuff is used,1
4567,Easy to use. Thank you.,5
4568,great place to sell or buy low-cost items.,5
4569,Unless app can't even give away good free tuff!,1
4570,This app is terrible and a scam!!!!!! Over 12% fees for selling an item and then when I did sell an item just before my payment cleares my bank then my account gets banned. Don't fall for their scams!!!!!!!!,1
4571,Can't do it on my phone will see where things,5
4572,I love it it's easy to use,5
4573,I downloaded the app. Opened it and the first think that pops up is an add that makes it look like you need to put in a credit card to use the app which is a scam to steal you money. Within 2 minutes of opening this app I was the victim of credit card fraud from an ad THEY ALLOWED AND PROFITED FROM.,1
4574,is hard to make contact with the sellers,2
4575,"Terrible . More ads than sales . All fake people sending checks. Never ever sell on here . Bring back let go and let go of offer up . Useless app. Every other app I can sell the same items , I been on offer up for 6 years now . Take some advice do FB marketplace or even the OG Craigslist",1
4576,I most definitely love this app it just came handy when I'm getting rid of things that I just don't need any more or things that I would like to restore and bless another family as well have fun with this one you can't go wrong,5
4577,Terrible product. Was much better when it first came out. Greedy service that refused to issue a refund even after I canceled the service I never used. Stay away and do not download.,1
4578,I give this app 0 stars ü§© I'm obligated to give at least one! Come on! I got kicked off the app For posting sales. I did not make any sales. And the app accepted my business offer. So it should be valid. I feel that are interfering with my sales. And the rules go against the qualifications. They should be helping promote rite. So they know from the beginning. My complaint is of a fair sale. If the client pay the price and get the display product how is there a violation?,1
4579,"good app, better if the app reinstalled more sales faster, updated listings quicker, that's all",4
4580,"I'm confused, when you put in what you're searching for instead of showing requested product you sometimes everything but that item. Also when asked to put in radios the system never keeps /store the info causing you to have to repeat over and over again, it makes no sense. It should hold info until the person changes it",3
4581,"It's very slow, it lacks about 7 seconds.. sometimes it doesn't even work",1
4582,Paid for two ads over 24 hours ago after verifying email and phone number. None of my ads are up. The money definitely left my back account though. No word from customer support either.,1
4583,doesnt let me message anyone,1
4584,Always find good deals and decent ppl buying and selling. Good community.,5
4585,best website to buy great used items. hardly ever have to pay full price like new at the store,5
4586,üÜïüëç,4
4587,Blah,3
4588,safe and this site reaches so many buyers,5
4589,OfferUp needs to make it so you can refresh your postings,3
4590,Scammers. Full of scammers do yourself a favor and avoid it,1
4591,People are very nice 94% of the interactions!,5
4592,"exceptional secure money transaction awesome service, good products to me a good store to buy products,,,,,,,,thank you offerup",5
4593,"Glitchy, Cannot uninstall completely, Doesn't reinstall properly. 12/13/2020: The new version is very slow, has smaller pics, cannot rotate pics, has No Archive of Buying items, AND has deleted all of the items STORED and the BUYING TAB. Things just keep getting worse, slower, and missing. It also needs more options for shipping larger packages. I get less and less inquiries with the new version.",1
4594,Mostly scams & bots,1
4595,Unsubscribing from marketing emails takes you to a dead page. Shady. App is rife with ads that are intrusive. Garbage.,1
4596,simple to use and upfront honest.,4
4597,I have noticed I'm not getting any response from any of the people selling items. I send a few text to see but not even one response is like they not getting my text.,1
4598,love it!,5
4599,It's changed sucks now,1
4600,this app. works well.,5
4601,I cannot view the listing info or price. It is just images. Not sure what happened to this app but it is broken for me on android z fold 4.,1
4602,"When someone states I want to buy a product; but when given options to do it ; 95%, at least do not follow up ,& reply. Not one sale on offer up in almost 1/2 yr., where I sold numerous merchandise outside of OU. SO CALLED BUYERS must state how they want to buy it; mail; delivery or pickup.",1
4603,great app great place to find whatever you need for the right price.,4
4604,great place to shop!!!!,5
4605,There's always something there that you can always find something that you want if you're looking for something off of this place to find,5
4606,üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,5
4607,Best app for finding a good deal near by,5
4608,I can't sell nothing when I join them,3
4609,descriptions do not always match,3
4610,Ride. On,4
4611,I use it 100% and happy with it.,5
4612,Been trying to sell a car and will try this one,5
4613,Bug on my fold 4 where It wont scroll down to see the item description only allows me to click on pics and that's it,1
4614,Good morning,4
4615,"The app has its moments where it wants to work and then not so much, randomly will take one of my listings off with no true explanation as to why. I have been using this app for about 5 1/2 years on and off now, spot on ratings, I'm able to ship, able to reach different kinds of people.",3
4616,"3 day free trial, for promote plus, but you have to cancel it 24 hours before your free trial expires. So not 3 day free trail but rather a 48-hour free trial. This is unethical at best and deceptive at worst. Bookmark this review because I am going to get a class action lawsuit rolling. Andrew Martin",1
4617,awesome application to sell and now even look for jobs and free items..too üòé cool...I love this site,5
4618,"It's really annoying, and the app has gone downhill since they started adding advertisements to it!!!",1
4619,Doesn't work with vpn. Uninstall,1
4620,Meh,3
4621,"Need mass delete function on saved items. Have to delete one by one, then screen scrolls back to the top after each deletion. I've been deleting things for over an hour now. Ridiculous when this isn't a hard thing to fix.",3
4622,Ads ruin this app. üëéüèª,1
4623,like the Ap to find good things xüíØ,5
4624,"Been using this app forever.. overall 4/5 stars until now..! ?#%& I had an update &... now when I swipe 'up' on the bottom of the photo to open the posting to see the pricing & description it wont swipe/open the ad portion!! So can't see anything but photos!! So whats the point?! No price, no info? WT..? Please advise asap.. ( &, put the premium up grade banner somewhere else so annoying!)",2
4625,Can't post knives...not even fixed blade's? Come on people get with the program. Some of us are trying to start a business.,2
4626,Nothing but spam and spam posting in my area. All I see are the same garbage paint ppl clutter feed. I report. NOTHING happens.,1
4627,awesome app,5
4628,"I love having an app that has items for sale and free in my local area. There are many listings that are years to several years old cluttering up the search results. I am spending a lot of time emailing sellers, asking if their item has been sold, and nothing but crickets. There has yo be a way to clean up old listing or automatically remove them if they are unsold. Other than this one annoyance, I have met the nicest people and made some great deals.",3
4629,"I think it's a very good an easy to use app ,,",5
4630,Please delete,1
4631,"horrible,",1
4632,Decent app for selling locally especially vehicles. I'm not a fan of the shipping and long distance sales but it's decent for people who do it on a regular basis.,4
4633,This app does something weird where if you open your other running apps it becomes invisible and you have to force close it to see it again. It's been like this for at least a year. I use a pixel 6 which is a pretty standard phone. App devs need to fix the app to be more professional,1
4634,Please bring back the date when it was posted because when a buyer sees an √≠tem they want to know how recent the item was posted meaning that if an √≠tem was posted more than a year ago its like a caution for buyers,4
4635,Okey,5
4636,Almost every post on here is over 30 days old. Stop leaving posts up for months.,1
4637,"So many fraudulent scam posts on this app. Beware of the scams. OfferUp has a 2-day ""guarantee"" but doesn't honor it. They require you to try to get a response from the scam seller first and allows the seller two days to respond. That requirement alone contradicts their ""guarantee"" for purchasing. Beware.",1
4638,I really do enjoy the app. It's been really helpful. Thank you offer up,5
4639,"It keeps only sending me info on items I've looked at....even after I purchased them. I 'd like to see ALL the items in my area when they are posted. Also, it's difficult to remove an item or seller from watched/followed list.",3
4640,"though I follow the guidelines to post a sell, my postings keep getting removed for no reason.. and they won't even say what's the exact reason to correct it! very frustrating",1
4641,Please add the ability to filter by Car ownership type? Is it being sold by dealer or owner etc,3
4642,I can't even find my own ad. üëé,1
4643,love this app! so convenient and easy to use. Literally the best place to buy and sell stuff quickly!,5
4644,Messaged over 10 different people and sent offers and not a single one of them responded what's the point of this app if you can't even buy anything,1
4645,Degeneracy is on the ballot,4
4646,Even if this app worked perfectly it's a waste. Nobody uses it now that there is a charge for vehicles. It was the best marketplace before they shot themselves in the foot the same way Craigslist did. All that's left is FB market now.,1
4647,adds are a pain just to search now and the sellers are flakes,1
4648,Ok,5
4649,There are a lot of scammers,3
4650,I like offer up and everything except I don't get my notifications when someone is interested in something I have posted . I always have to check my mess.,5
4651,Good,5
4652,Boycott and important messages we once not able to be sent and not arrive from my wife's phone. With my i cloud with malious malware.,1
4653,Horrible ads app,1
4654,"the ap isn't bad but the ones posting are. I contacted 12 people who posted a vehicle I was looking for and got TWO responses . One of the 2 responses, after waiting 4 days after my inquiry,was that the vehicle had been sold YET it was still posted. Because of this, I have little use for an AP that have postings that give no responses or doesn't care to remove sold items. It's a waste of my time.",3
4655,"I had someone that I met to sell cards to a month and half ago. He ended up stealing from me and I reported to offer up and even filed a police report. OfferUp didn't help, not even act against the buyer in any way. I requested a full investigation. I was told by another that the person who bought from me had done something similar to him.",1
4656,I like using the app but some features could be more user friendly. It would be nicer if I didn't have to do so many clicks to get to my saved search notifications. It is also annoying that there's a message asking to turn on notifications that blocks the top of my notifications list and it won't go away unless I turn them on which I do not want to do.,4
4657,Very good app,5
4658,"Emailed them numerous times with no response AT ALL. One months ago, one weeks ago and tried again today, but I'm sure it'll be the same. I am unable to log in to my account",1
4659,Update!! I was contacted by Offer Up immediately after my post. The explanation was a block or removal on their part due to a violater or scammer. I actually feel much better knowing we are look out for and protected. Thank you Gale with Offer Up for your dedication. I've used Offer Up since 2016 and I have always had good experience and success selling my items.,5
4660,this app is perfect,5
4661,Can't see title or price when scrolling. This is way too annoying having to tap on everything that looks remotely interesting just to see a title and price. Can't even use the app for more than a few minutes at a time without getting annoyed and leaving.,2
4662,Mila is so friendly. I like the item that I bought from her.,5
4663,I'm satisfied with OfferUp... Although in the beginning I was not real happy with the I'd verification. I'm on now and I've been selling alot of stuff so it's good for me. I'll give them 5 Happy Stars...Thanks OfferUp!,5
4664,After update now I'm getting two search results when I was getting hundreds before and I can't get it to work right now so it's completely useless to me. this is unbelievable!!!!,1
4665,I don't like commercials,4
4666,hate the new adds,1
4667,I always adjust distance every opening the app.,4
4668,"Good experience to buy/sell, but watch out for scammers, the site is full of them! Moreso when it comes to people wanting to buy your stuff. Be VERY careful! Don't let the buyer rush you. An immediate full price inquiry following your post is a danger sign. Validate your buyer.",5
4669,good,5
4670,"Altogether, it's not too bad of an app, pretty user-friendly. Be smart with your purchases, and you might find a great deal.",5
4671,great people,5
4672,"Used for years. When I moved, my location changed, but not on postings. No response from customer service.",3
4673,sellers are normally responsive and safe business,5
4674,all good and on time,5
4675,What happened to the cash register notification?,5
4676,"Response to the devs: Your response can't help, your platform can't help these people who are not willing to sell. Get some better communication from the sellers. There is no reason to use the platform. People post with no intention to sell. People communicate, post new items, and sell them elsewhere. People are so flakey and ghost you all the time. You will waste your time here looking at things that NO ONE has ANY intension of selling. Good luck purchasing anything on here.",1
4677,Excellent job,5
4678,"If the listing date is removed, the post is YEARS old! Another tactic to scam and deceive users. Also, SCAMMER STORES! 90% of listings are duplicate scammer stores (like cell phone, camera, etc ""0 down, finance, blah blah). Riddled with spam. Cannot post on computers only tiny phones! Update: now JOBS!? üôÑüôÑ Endless spam app. 1 decent private seller, then 50 spam stores, listings, and junk, 3 year old posts fillers. Now they REMOVED LISTING DATES! That is the final straw, hope this app dies.",1
4679,people are usually pretty friendly and you find great deals,5
4680,Been selling and buying for 4 years. Love it.,5
4681,This app is very slow and frustrating,2
4682,"Horrible.. closed my account for zero reasons after 4 years and when trying to contact someone.. you get no response from anyone.. They refuse to give me a valid reason and won't even let me see my past purchases and sales for tax reasons.. They have been making money off of me for over 4 years and now won't even respond..wow.. avoid this app, look elsewhere !! Update... contacted you like you requested.. and again got NO ANSWER!! NO REASON.. NO EXPLANATION!!! what a waste of time, thanks!",1
4683,Ads popping up whole screen in the middle of looking at items shame. Uninstalling because of that,1
4684,"Ads and notifications too intrusive by default. I dialed down the notifications but the full screen ads for the same thing I have to hit close on is annoying. I cannot simply hit the back button, I have to hit the close button. Makes it very slow to navigate and look through items. No prices listed on default view means you have to open each item to see price.",1
4685,"exactly as described, easy transaction",5
4686,Be careful scammers are everywhere,4
4687,Delusional sellers and scammers asking way over retail price you might as well go buy it brand new at this rate it's ridiculous . Honestly the only time I would actually pay is when they remove all the delusional sellers and spam bots cause they're a lot of them.,1
4688,they won't reply to my questions of why I can't sell on offerup. Can't call or nothing. I used to buy and sell a lot of items with them. Their flat out ignoring me.,1
4689,Good,5
4690,these beez knees when it comes to selling yo sh**,5
4691,Buena pero tiene muchas limitantes vivo en New York cuando busco algo me salen resultados sin precios tengo que entrar uno por uno para ver el precio lo cual es p√©rdida de tiempo y segundo salen resultados muy lejos muchas veces me salen en los √°ngeles y pues yo le pongo que me filtre lo m√°s cercano pero parece que no funciona en lo dem√°s esta bien,2
4692,love this üòÄ,5
4693,Does not suit me now.,2
4694,excelente!!!,5
4695,Great,1
4696,This app is garbage now. Everytime i list my table for sale the mods delete the listing. I put the measurements and a current picture of the table. It is a straight forward sale. They will more than likely delete your listing due to their new terms. I do not have time for this. This is way too much hassle to sell a table. Uninstalling.,1
4697,"I had to lower my score again. Used it today, got nothing done. It's just awfully slow. I have tried to be patient but it really makes me angry. It's maddening how slow the response time is in the app. And they don't do anything to improve it. I hate using it so much now that I won't. I don't have the time to waste. I'm going to use it 2 more days, then I'm done. So far all they've done is give an email address to speak with a counselor about my feelings. Fix your app. Been asking Four years.",1
4698,okay app. does the job,4
4699,nice,5
4700,app freezes,3
4701,Hard to use.,2
4702,thanks I just hope I can sell these items quick enough to get some energy drinks.,5
4703,"Frustrated: 1) Plz differentiate between Notifications on Messages received from a specific Person & general Notifications bout items I might like constantly! 2) I'm glad not to repost items every week like Crgslst, but plz send email to people whose items are still listed 6mo or at least at 1 year to say update item or system will auto delete or auto archive in 30 days time bcuz those sane people tend not to respond to Inquiries about their items so lame 4 search result to show 2yr old items!",2
4704,great app,5
4705,This is a great way to sell merchandise. I posted 2 items and each one I had sold in 1 day.,5
4706,Same problem picture frosts some tome to much.,1
4707,Great prices and lowest items are good quality.,5
4708,This has b'n a helpful app 4 selling n buying,5
4709,Great Experience,5
4710,Ads are intrusive and annoying. Terrible platform and business model,1
4711,"I love me some OfferUp , it's the bomb",5
4712,It's very easy to use and it sells cars real fast. I highly recommend it,5
4713,I have sold a few items on OfferUp and all of my experiences have been fantastic. They also go out of their way to look out for your safety and that's a good thing. Thank you OfferUp!!!,5
4714,TOTAL GARBAGE - Only shows pictures of items and you have to click and open each one to get price or details. Terrible interface. Uninstalled immediately. Installed one year later and still the same nightmare. How does this app have any users? It's literally useless!,1
4715,"This app is a scam, the developers intentionally make it so that there is no way to cancel subscription after trial. Unless this is a known bug, it appears to be an unethical and malicious practice to compel prospective customers to purchase their services.",1
4716,"garbage. so much clutter on the app and filters and sorting do not help. I'm shopping for a car and I get more parts, advertisements, and ""HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CAR? STOLEN!"" postings than I ever have seen cars for sale. I have literally seen better setups on the hellscape that is Facebook Marketplace. honestly, you're better off finding stuff for sale on Tinder!",1
4717,sellers don't communicate with buyers. worthless app,1
4718,Very bad app makes it impossible to unsubscribe,1
4719,4 only because it freezes on me often,4
4720,"OfferUp is full of people uninterested in paying a fair price, and I'm sick of trying to sell on this app. I don't recommend ever using it unless you're willing to practically give stuff away. I've had over 100 sales as an eBay seller, and previously hadn't encounter this level of greed. On OfferUp, you can offer a price reduced far beyond the removal of shipping costs, and have no activity. I'm having to shave off well over half the value of an item to get any attention. Only good for $10 items",2
4721,Loved this app but it's pretty annoying now with the overwhelming amount of ads so I literally opened a burner Facebook account to use Facebook marketplace instead.,1
4722,Esta may Buena,5
4723,good app,4
4724,Doesn't always send messages in a timely manner.,4
4725,they are alright they need work,4
4726,great app but people often don't respond and items are left on even when sold,3
4727,They allow confirmed-stollen property to be sold on their platform. And unskippable full screen ads.,1
4728,you guys are the worst company ever people want to make money but you guys always do stuff to prevent them from making the money that they have to. just because you guys have your money it doesn't mean you guys get to disrupt people's ability to make money. I can't wait till the day comes when you guys get shut down by the government or you guys go out of business and you guys lose all the money and you and your families are all broke! you guys shut my account down for no reason shame on you!,1
4729,"New update, same old buggy app",1
4730,Ads mixed in search results. Ads send via notication. Video ads interrupting browsing.,1
4731,"Horrible customer service, can't get any help, nobody to call. Wont answer chat. Don't ship with offer up.",1
4732,Why why why do the listing results in the app still not display prices in 2024? This has been requested by users for years as you can see in the ratings. Who wants to see a wall of images where you have to click through every single post to see the price?! And the stupid app refreshes and takes you to the top of the search results whenever you navigate away from it so you can't even answer a text message or do anything else on your device without losing your place in the results feed. Miserable.,2
4733,I was looking for a vehicle to purchase and I never got a respond unless u pay the app. I'm not the person selling on offerup . Everywhere else I had no issues,1
4734,"Perfect transaction and item arrived in excellent condition, thank you!",5
4735,"0 out of 5 stars is my actual rating they restricted my account due to their violation of ""community standards"" for posting a legal therapeutic medicine called CBD oil. The product is not a controlled substance or an illegal drug. They have a 0 tolerance policy and don't issue any warnings or even a suspension due to a violation of their community standards. I have been using OfferUp as a secondary source of income which no longer exists because of their ignorance on the CBD oil issue.",1
4736,"This app ahs been amazing. only issue I have had is linking payments to boost, but other than that it has been awesome.",5
4737,The App is Great but I don't Get Any of My Notifications...and it's not only me...it's been like this for over a year...does anyone else have the same issue?...because it definitely need to be addressed.,4
4738,"Constant automated replys from offerup and does not help. Nothing changes. I put in my area. I get 4000 miles away,I just want my state. The app will not allow you to do so. I'm sure there are more than 9 items in my state. Please no more automated responses. Please no more email. Please no more. I have to block your email,it won't stop. I don't get a human reply. I've talked with others,they get the same response. I like letgo. It worked.",1
4739,"This app is not free to post. I created a brand new account and it told me I was ""out of posts"" until February. I hadn't ever posted but I tried again today (2/1/24) and got the same message. Their support is not helpful. It's not expensive to post but it still seems like a scam. I'll find another platform.",1

4750,"Free section filled with spam, drugs, guns, murders for hire. They don't care. Free was fun, now it's just junk. As long as those ad serves are made, they don't care.",1
4751,If I could I would give this app zero Stars I mailed my stuff a week ago tomorrow and I've yet to get paid and it says that the buyer has 2 days to inspect it yet this buyer can hold my stuff and then after its released it could take up the 5 days to get paid oh hell no this is the last time I will ever use this app it's Garbage I'd rather cuddle with dog üí©,1

4754,The cage was in really good condition and as described.,5
4755,it's great!,5
4756,Not letting me post anything for sale. Everything is within the requirements and it takes it down. I tried to update a post and it took it down after being up for a few days. 0 stars. Update: reached out to email and they proceeded to delete my account. -1 stars,1
4757,easy to use. people are generally quick to respond,4
4758,Very use full,5
4759,"After an hour of posting listings through the app, and having nine items listed for sale, with more to add, the app decided to Archive everything, then refuses to permit me to release them from the archive so that they are listed. This means that I was only partially through all of the items I wanted to list for sale, and now have to start all over again, with the concern that it will just do the same thing again",1
4760,Great App!,4
4761,"Great pleace to shop for second-hand items, communication with b99uyer and seller via txt within the app. I wished they had a payment option as well and offered insurance when we triying to purchace items that need to be shiped.",4
4762,Too many intrusive ads. It'd be better if the prices we're shown outright,1
4763,Good,4
4764,"This was a great app, and then ads started appearing. Wasn't a problem at first, but now there's pop-up ads galore on top of all the ads. Truly ridiculous.",3
4765,"This app has so many ads that it is impossible to use. Do not waste your time. Awful, awful, awful!",1
4766,it has a lot more to look at,4
4767,I got some sick shoes from a really nice gentleman and his attitude when I met him made the trip all worth it!!,5
4768,Love OfferUp!!!‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
4769,"Offer up started as a peer to peer selling and buying platform. Now you have dealers and stores off all sorts flooding your searches, you know because you go to Offerup to buy from a dealer. The originall idea behind it is lost to profit. And there is the problem of people messaging you for no otther reason than to waste time. Now if you share a link for someone to see a listing, it forces you to get their app. Knocking one more star from the original 3 stars",2
4770,"so many ads, it's not what it used to be. It's better to use the Facebook marketplace, at least they don't have full screen pop-up ads.",1
4771,"all listing gone, could have been great,but app failed. Glad didn't trust its hype.",1
4772,I do not want this app I canceled it is you. Charged me anyway. I want a refund!,1
4773,"The idea is incredible, but don't think that people sell cheap here, it's more expensive than buying at the mall and everything is old and used no matter how much they say new, you know it's not!!!",2
4774,"As described, great packaging. Seller highly recommended.",5
4775,"I've been selling on here for over a year, it's decent for local sales. Couple issues I have. The App itself is extremely slow!! They've removed general items from my listings with not much information on why. Simple items like an inexpensive handbag or a large framed print I had. A collectable Coca-Cola knife. Update: the print was added back to my listings :) they reached out with an email address. I'm updating to 4 stars. It needs work but good for local sales especially.",4
4776,"Don't use their shipping service to ship n get paid, sold air compressor the guy got it and accepted it on his side yet they're still holding my money, it's been more than a week now, no way to contact anyone smh",1

4778,By Far one of the Best apps around You Can sell and Buy a Range of Variety of items and Even Theyre new Jobs Function on the App. Although Minor Problems presist on the App such as Posting Issues and Messaging Speed. Besides The Minor Bugs this App Is The Best Around To get Rid Of Some of your Old Treasured Things If your Tryna Make Space!,4

4783,App is easy enough to understand. Posted several items. Went to check my posts list and kept showing blank. Did this with several different items. Tried several times...still unsuccessful. I believe it is because I refuse to use their promotion services....they are a bit pushy about that.,1
4784,I cannot even post anything for sale without it taking down my post as soon as it goes up.,2
4785,Wonderful App For Selling Things!!,5
4786,it's good app. get little slow response...,4
4787,"installed the app. posted a furniture piece twice. listings got deleted without a warning. to the creator of the app: if you don't want users to post, just hide ""post"" option. what's the purpose of irritating people like that?",1
4788,"great app, needs some work, mainly with the conversations. After listing and get views on items it shows that there are conversations and go to look at messages there's nothing, Also when i put my general location it switches to a different one, please fix for higher rating",3

4790,this app keeps going down hill,1
4791,"In response to you, I did contact you and no one responds. Can't even use the app because the scan to verify card doesn't work. This is so frustrating. Customer care refuses to respond or do anything. Save your time and go to Mercari or Poshmark.",1

There's no option to get some sort of list view with actual details. Just a worthless wall of images. Also no way to block dumb people, of which there are lots of on this app. It's too easy to make posts, so you have to deal with the dumbest people in existence.",1
4807,Full of scammers,2
4808,Needs a function to block/hide Sellers. There's one in my area that post constantly for their store.,2
4809,you can find almost anything you need. great program.,5
4810,"Your money will be trapped! Do not use this app! I was using it as a seller just fine for a while, but then the last few updates broke the auto deposit feature. I have not received my money from a recent sale. It also will not allow me to immediately cash out. The ' cash out ' button is non responsive. Other people online have had this problem and it's not been fixed. You will be robbed. Be warned. The app is broken!!",1

So if you're in need of getting rid of your things for a little money, OfferUp is the app to go to. üëçüëç",4

I contacted customer support and was told just to give them information and when asking about my refund due to it being a issue on their end. I was ignored.,1
4816,"too many funny people in this app, they post free items then when you request info or address they surprise you with a price . majority of the free items on this app is people just selling stuff. make sure you read descriptions before hitting the message button or else they'll get offended.",1
4817,keeps annoying me with notifications for stuff I'm not even interested in and is not a saved search,1
4818,my posts don't get any views. and it seems that my texts never go thru coz they never reply back,1

This is fraud and I will make sure to do what I can to stop this from happening to people because it's in every way wrong! I never posted this review! This revision I'm making to say that I never reviewed or said the first two sentences. I did not leave that. The app posted that in my name. Not my post not my words not my consent. Not cool.,1

Needs ways to filter messages/sellers & additional in saved items. As a client buying gets frustrating/confusing because needs more ways to sort the items saved, messages/sellers.

4872,Updated my old 5 star review. This app used to be great. Now its full of ads and cant even filter out what near you for pick up. Just pushing over priced junk for shipping. Sad. Its so out of touch with the other options for buying and selling now days. I used this app alot in the past. Its just another garbage app im deleting now.,2

Not only am I not getting a service I am overpaying for listings keep getting removed even though I post the markings and physical proof my items are authentic. It's constant issues with them.

They charge you 12% service fee, for what exactly (huge rip off). Which comes out of your sales. I wouldn't do business here. Save yourself the hassle.",1
4888,Great rescue for buyers,5
4889,okay,5
4890,They need to make a new offer up because this offer up really sucks they take away your account for nuginng and take you off offer up and when u text offer up they don't even respond,1
4891,App keeps freezing and kicking me out of app it doesn't load just terrible I remember years ago when app actually worked fine,1
4892,"Can't login to account. Tried resetting password multiple times. Uninstalled & reinstalled. Cleared cache. Tried thru app & regular desktop nothing. My account was sent a message about unusual activity, so now I can't get any help. Offerup has really gone downhill, since acquiring letgo. Letgo was the worst app, now offerup is terrible too. I recommend shopping facebook marketplace, it's much better. Here is an update folks, 1/26!24 I wasn't able to log in, so support suspended my account. WOW!",1
4893,Keep removing my post,1
4894,Excellent very good option,5
4895,lots of great stuff and lots of great peoplez!üåàü¶ã,4
4896,This app is not worth most people are horrible they don't respond you back if they don't buy it you just playing games with you,2
4897,This used to be a good app but now it limits the areas you can go and see and buy from as well as only sell from no more all the USA states coverage but now it's sitt by city and tht sux...Good bye...,1
4898,Time wasted üòµ,1
4899,great website,5
4900,ads too much,1
4901,"They say they will send a reminder before your trial ends, but they don't. If you ask for a refund citing that reason they won't issue you one",1
4902,Live,5
4903,"No one replies to posts, and if they do, they only send like 2 messages and then never respond again. I was supposed to meet up with someone and they never showed up or communicated what was going on. Offerup want you to pay to get faster responses which is a big red flag in my opinion.",1
4904,I don't like offer up I will never go on it again I posted something on there and u tuck it off when I see alot of people post knifes on it and they get to keep there post not right,1
4905,Wonderful,5
4906,"App was already plagued by ads, now we get full-screen unskippable ones? It's over for OfferUp.",1
4907,This app used to be good now I would give this app a solid zero because they force you to update then you forced me to take a picture of my identification which is unacceptable I've had this app on my phone for a while I stopped using it for a little bit and now you're forcing me to join something and show my identification I don't appreciate this then y'all make us do an update and an update just makes everything worse I am not able to sell I hope they come up with a better app,1
4908,hasn't been successful lately,1
4909,Super slow. Why wont they fix this issue ?,1
4910,awesome,5
4911,"I posted an item I didn't think I'd be able to get rid of, it sold in less than 48 hours.",5
4912,Most of the products people sell on here used are more expensive than if you bought it brand new. Makes no sense,1
4913,"I love it! I can always find good deals on clothes, furniture, and baby toys!",5
4914,Love it,4
4915,App was awesome for along time now it's terrible . Not happy with it anymore everyone I see say the same thing about this app . It sucks so many ads the search is terrible now when you start with a good app in the beginning it's always good then they go changing it thinking they are making it better but it not. This app is terriable now Not even worth using it anymore .,1
4916,very helpful,5
4917,"Awful, to cancel my prime subscription, I did everything possible. From my Google store, I click on my profile and click subscription, but your icon is not there to choose. You have been charging my account eventhough I have no advertising with you for many years I called and contacted you many times, but no help",1
4918,I got banned for no reason supposedly someone reported me because i didn't lowered the price and now im banned from any account. They blocked my IP address. So i can't use it no more. Also you get many ads and if you dont subscribe you will most likely not be able to get your messages across.,1
4919,The app is trash more scammers than actual products. You can't ship items over 20 lbs but will not tell you until you're wrapped in a scam with James or Carol. Still allow scammers to use the app even after being reported. Save yourself the hassle and meet in person if you're using this app.,1
4920,I have been with OfferUp for the past 8 years I left and now I am I hope it is still as good as it used to be,4
4921,some people don't respond to simple questions,3
4922,perfect ü•∞,5
4923,it's a wonderful app,5
4924,"Truly magnificent, help me out in a pinch unfortunately I was not able to close the deal but that was not this apps fault. Simply the size of the dimensions that I couldn't end up closing the deal and that was within 2 hours of me posting by the way......",5
4925,great way to sell something quickly.,5
4926,Great app had 2 phones sold both now trying to sell another.,5
4927,some thing are good some things suck so be careful what you buy,5
4928,This app is AWESOME & oh so helpful! Such a convenience! JUST LOVE IT! GO OFFER-üíúUP!,5
4929,"Pet log , day 2. I'm about to lose it y'all, I'm I'll update tomorrow.",5
4930,Used to be good. To much spam/ads as of the last month,1
4931,Flooded with stores spamming sales. Facebook marketplace is better now.,1
4932,So slow ever since they merged with Letgo,1
4933,"It doesn't allow to put listing, and it doesn't give any reason.",3
4934,Great way to reclaim a lil cash on used items or better!,5
4935,I got a very beautiful dresser for free thank you,5
4936,I don't recommend slow bs,1
4937,bed,1
4938,Excellent and I will be able to get a great deal.,5
4939,"App just keepings shutting down on the phone (android), no issues on website , haven't really had issues on iOS",3
4940,Uploading pics to post was not a go. Not impressed.,3
4941,"Love, it!!! Convenient and easy to use.",5
4942,It's all that and still going strong,5
4943,too many scammers,4
4944,"Finally found someone who actually still had the product. Searched the days, no answers, then oh sorry sold",4
4945,After last update the screen is halved. Odd but true. Messages are still jumping around. Wow! Bad bad bad,3
4946,very cool and easy app to use the only thing I wish was different is the items that it doesn't give you a shipping option on. I wish it would let the buyer choose for themselves on what they don't want to purchase.,5
4947,"decent selling app, sure ain't no letgo though...",3
4948,so far everything's been good and I recommended two other people,5
4949,No prices without clicking on each individual ad makes this platform about useless.,1
4950,I seem to find things I need or want on this site and the sellers have so far been very nice. I'll keep using it!,5
4951,Offerup is ran by bots and there is zero moderation whatsoever. I got banned after sending exactly one message asking if an item was available and then buying that item. This app is notorious for that kind of thing. Scammers are not banned and are rampant. Their customer service is non-existent. Offerup is one of the worst e-commerce platforms you can use. Stay far away from this steaming pile.,1
4952,easy to sell items,4
4953,"Watching my grass grow is more exciting than shopping or selling on this app. They try to sell special things to help sell your stuff ""twice"" as fast. Here's an idea - make this part of the standard platform and maybe you might retain some of your already thin customer base. Get more exposure on ebay for less than this. Garbage",1
4954,very good app,5
4955,Great place to buy and sell....,5
4956,sucks,1
4957,Perf app to buy and sell stuff,5
4958,just all around outstanding,5
4959,Some ads suck,4
4960,It's great again. Not many scammy ads,4
4961,"I had a decent experience for a few years but for some reason I got my account deleted suddenly, it was an account that had more than 120 5 star reviews, i had sold and shipped items for years, i did not receive any strike or violation warning, and when I tried to contact customer support they just said, paraphrasing, ""we reserve the right not to tell you"". I tried to create a new account and also got erased. I guess I'll go to ebay or facebook marketplace. EDIT: I sent an email but no response",1
4962,"Peppered with constant annoying ads. This app used to be ""half"" decent. But like with everything, these developers are getting so greedy with monetization they've rendered the base function of their application useless. Used to get at least a few views occasionally, not even one on multiple items in over a few weeks in a very populated area. Constant repeating spam posts from fake accounts. It's only as good as the people using it and people aren't too good these days.",2
4963,very nice very cool,5
4964,This app is useless. Full of fake accounts and no one ever responds to messages. High rated sellers don't even ship out purchases...,1
4965,"It won't allow me to look at items for sale locally, even when I choose local it's still puts in all the states far away out of my 30 mi range. I'll go back to Facebook marketplace.",1
4966,Fast and easy,5
4967,"It always offers things far away from home, even I input 20 miles from home....very sad.",2
4968,"So stupid ads ads ads are everywhere non stop eveing listing is from other website,,Too much scammers not a save place to be in , I have reported more 200 scammer and no reaction , it's getting more bad , so watch out getting in this app it's like getting in swamp .",1
4969,Not what it used to be. Facebook marketplace is hard to compete with.,2
4970,To many rules trobes,1
4971,I been able to buy & sale very conveniently and have even made few friends along the way it's been all good,5
4972,"The search sucks. None of the preferences stay, you have to redo them each time you use the app. Shipping results still are included in the results when they aren't supposed to. None of the accounts are verified in any way so you get 4 times the amount of messages just wasting your time than you do actual buyers. Letgo was SO much better than this garbage.",1
4973,Now have to watch ads or pay üëé,1
4974,Got a lot of inquiries from it,4
4975,"Miss the old offer up. This one just sucks, no one even uses this anymore. Deleted my account for whatever reason that didn't even tell me. They took out a busines that would make other people shop with offer up. Just stick with Facebook marketplace.",1
4976,"Used to be good but now just a shadow of its former self. Your only allowed to post 1 item per catergory for free. What üí©, anyone know of a better app",1
4977,ü§¨ü§¨,1
4978,READY TOOCHECK IT OUT,5
4979,Great app and very user friendly,5
4980,"This app is the worst. I look at items, set my destination to 10 miles, and I get sales from across the country. Also, the listings are always old and never available. Facebook for me",1
4981,"Hello is this Offer ""Down"" Well I updated the app 1/21/23 and I'm really enjoying the logo and that's all that happened. It's not opening the page. Just a green logo circling and I am like a moth looking into the light but no ‚ö° zap. üò≠",1
4982,Love it ‚ù§Ô∏èü§©,5
4983,"This app was great during the pandemic, then it turned into a complete train wreck. 90% of the replies to any listing is a bot that's never going to buy your item. The other 10% are real people that are just out to troll you. I've be strung out for multiple days trying to give something away for FREE and was met with all kinds of excuses including their car won't start and got stolen.",1
4984,"This app is annoying now. It was good before but now it's extremely slow which makes it difficult to use. If I click once, it takes more than a minute for this app to respond. Free advice; take some ads of to take the load off the app or else you'll lose all the business. People don't have patience nowadays to wait a minute or to make another move. This is 2024; the 5g era. If they feel their time is wasted here, they'll go elsewhere. Also, the app doesn't receive complaints.",1
4985,"If I am looking for a TV stand, Offer Up should not throw in other items when I specifically entered TV stand on the search bar. Offer Up should remove items that are there longer than a month.",3
4986,Perfect,5
4987,They ruined the app with this new concept of premium. It literally has rendered unusable unless I pay. With a number of free options out there that perform as well.,1
4988,Best app for buying and selling locally,5
4989,Pretty cool. It's the people listing the items that make it break how your experience turns out. Can't go blaming this cool and convenient app üëç,5
4990,Money,1
4991,my experience with the seller was great. easy quick transaction,5
4992,You can even give something away for free without scanning your license in for the company to store. Way too invasive of a process just to get started with the app.,1
4993,"I can't get the money for items I sold with nationwide shipping option. The system is not allowing me to add a debit card for withdrawals, and the bank account I set up months ago is not being credited. I NEED MY MONEY URGENTLY!",1
4994,"I have had OfferUp for years now I have tried but never sold anything, but I have bought several times. I see I have messages I wish I could get them forwarded.",3
4995,I have loved Offer Up since I started buying in 2016. I have always had great purchases from people. I check how long they have been selling and their ratings. Couldn't be happier. Thank you for always keeping people Safe too! Thank you,5
4996,Needs a update too damn slow,2
4997,Worthless app.,1
4998,real great,5
4999,Too many ads are not removed.,2
5000,I pay 250 DLLs to him and don't give me the refrigerator and don't answer my calls,1
5001,How do I cancel offerup,1
5002,good app,5
5003,üíØ,5
5004,"It would be better If we could see the prices on the thumbnails in our search results. It wastes a lot of time. Also it is very frustrating as a seller to be prompted of a security threat when I give or ask for a phone number. As a seller, I get stood up much more often if I do not have a contact phone number when meeting the buyer, and it makes them suspect me of being a threat. I advertise on 3 platforms and my sales are divided among Facebook (60%) Craigslist (20%) and OfferUp (20%)",3
5005,"One of the worst things is canceling an order. I have been waiting on an order to be canceled automatically. The seller and I were trying to figure out how to cancel, but we found nothing useful. It says to wait for 3 days for it to be automatically canceled. IT HAS BEEN 5 DAYS. This is insane. It's like they try to make you jump through hoops to cancel because they don't want you to cancel. It shouldn't be this complicated. It's the worst app when it comes to buying from farther places.",1
5006,"I have just started using this app today. But found it manageabull waiting to see true results to give it a fair rating. So far, so good",3
5007,"It was excellent but now I have to pay to sell , I have so many troubles too",1
5008,Good experience,5
5009,"I love offer up, for both buying and selling!!",5
5010,"Stupidest app out there. Slow, 50% ads, and even if you pay for promote plus you don't get anyone messaging to buy what you're selling.",1
5011,Good,5
5012,it doesn't show your post for days after you pay. sucks,3
5013,"Uses you be good when offerup and letgo were separate apps, now it's bad and tedious to use",1
5014,I love this app!,5
5015,too many flakey people.,1
5016,I've never had any problems using this app. It's a great way to shop.,5
5017,what ever you need.. this is the place.. you can even throw offers for your convenience..,5
5018,Find ing toys is good.,5
5019,"Hard to sell items if you aren't spending money for a ""boost"" I recommend just using the Facebook market",2

5027,"if you get your account blocked for any reason, you can't get it back ever...no matter what even if you get hacked.. no customer service or help. otherwise it's a good app. UPDATE...STILL NO LUCK. THEY SEND AUTOMATED MESSAGES ONLY.. MY ACCOUNT WAS HACKED AND THEY STILL DONT HELP.",1
5028,It's so easy to sign up.,5
5029,App was pretty good until the new update that forces notifications by placing a button over the top inbox items. I get that the app needs to make money but to force a user to turn on a feature that is optional is pretty sleazy.,1
5030,This app is a scam. How do you guys let us post as many posters you want and now you guys are trying to charge us to post more. This is straight fraud. I will be suing OfferUp,1
5031,"UPDated: I don't think I get many views unless I make a financial investment. also people drop off the face of the Earth after giving an offer which is a bummer... UPDATE: THIS IS WHAT i WROTE TO OFFER UP. WE WILL SEE; Hello, Offer Up. Someone responded to this rating and said to send an email to this address. I feel it is 100% futile and 199% waste of time to do so. You will tell me exactly what I wrote, ""spend some money with us and your listings will be seen"" THEY responded as expected.",2
5032,Can't message anybody,1
5033,Good site beware of scammers,4
5034,I like OfferUp it's a good online thrift shop,5
5035,I love this app,4
5036,"Horrible! Had 5 star ratings, I never had any issues with offerup customers. Then, all of a sudden, my account got taken down for baby items? Really? Tons of ppl selling bby stuff same items as mine contacted support knew that would be a joke & was. They even stated you can't make a new account once the other account is removed. Lmao, trust me, I was not going to bother wasting time making another one. There are so many other sites & apps ur loss, not mine.",1
5037,"Grat communication, fast respopses and item is in great condition!",5
5038,love it,5
5039,Solid,5
5040,No longer using this app I don't login I don't buy or sell and it's saying I'm being banned because of violations. I've created other accounts I'm not sure if I'm getting hacked. But no one is able to help. OfferUp is not the same . I'm not reaching out to customer service support again because it's all automated system with no real help.,1
5041,offer up is the go to app to sell stuff,5
5042,Offerup has gone from bad to worse. First they remove the ability to send custom meet-up location and now half of the time I don't get notifications when buyer contacted me.,1
5043,nice,5
5044,"This app is dead. Been using it since 2016. It's loaded down with scammers, including the developers. Word of warning to people using this app. Do not pay for promote plus it is a scam.

5049,"love the cup, thank u",5
5050,"I like the app. one thing I don't like is getting contacted by buyers that get the price they ask, you give them the address, never show up, & never hear from them after. There's nothing that discourages that behavior in the app yet.",4
5051,to slow notification of responses and junk adds keep popping up when I try searching its a pain to get it off.,2
5052,Have bought and sold and it great.,5
5053,so helpfull,5

You'll have your account for a while, build a good rating & then POOF, your account with all your listings & the work you put into it will suddenly get disabled & removed with no reason. All your listings gone! This happened to me while I was waiting for an item I paid for to get shipped to my address. They'll respond to this saying they're here to help, but they NEVER help. *EMAILING THEM 4 HELP IS FUTILE. Search ""banned on Offerup"". HORRIBLE COMPANY w/no costumer support!!",1
5057,"Letgo was great. OfferUp, not so much.. 1- Selling can be frustrating. They need to remove the auto "" is this available,"" etc. options. I get a ton of those. If you're interested, contact me. 2- Buying is no picnic! I see items listed 6 years ago. They need to stay up to date on active listings",3
5058,Love it,5
5059,Trash app. No desktop service in 2024? Garbage.,1
5060,Great app!,5
5061,It has been my experience that App's like this will end up costing more than you will earn; that is why the grace period is so short.,1
5062,"Too many products, you will not sale anything on this site.",1
5063,Best Free App Online for Buy and Sell!,5
5064,"there are too many restrictions, that Facebook doesn't...I prefer to promote on Facebook",1
5065,This app is full of too many scammer bots that just waste your time trying to mine data? Idk what their aim is but ffs it's just abysmal. I wouldnt ever recommend anyone use this app for anything. I'm regretting giving them any of my info just to sign up for it and will be sending a request to delete my personal information and all data. There's no safeguards and bots are rampant. What a freaking sham. And shame this is. It could've been great but they choose to allow mediocre shiesters to run,1
5066,a great site to buy and sell items. I recommend it.,5
5067,I like it.easy to use,5
5068,Excellent site for buying and selling,5
5069,Apparently the app was built by idiots. Continually get related search notifications even though I delete all that,1
5070,OfferUp is a joke platform. Letgo was way better. Wish they never merged.,1
5071,I wouldn't recommend shipping your items. They are scammers. Won't reimburse your money. We didn't use their shipping label due to the incorrect weight of item and didn't tell us till we paid out of pocket for the item to be shipped ( after customer already paid offer up in advance). Deleting the app.,1
5072,OfferUp was a little bit complicated with ID verification it has become a lot better and easy to use,5
5073,and I think offer up needs to make it mandatory for people to put a picture of their face on there profile people on 90% of them will make offers and won't follow through or they will say let's me at a location and they won't be there just to mess with you,2
5074,Best application is so awesome I can't believe how easy it is to find something sometimes things are on the tip of her nose and we don't even realize it,5
5075,Good,5
5076,"Tons of scams, payment method is terrible. Enter credit card and then asks for a scan of it that never takes. Cannot even use the app if I wanted to. Thumbs down",2
5077,good app and good people,5
5078,Can't open link without app,1
5079,it's great. easy to use,5
5080,"Will not remember settings. Every time I open the app I have to reset it to local only. The whole point of the app is buying locally, why do you morons keep showing me things in Texas and worse yet why can't I permanently change the setting so you stop showing it to me.",1
5081,Easy to navigate and trust,5
5082,Why cant i subscribe to promote plus?,5
5083,Good pagina Good experience.,5
5084,it's super slow and it's very annoying,1
5085,When searching for a car you should be able to distinguish between dealers and personal sales and separate them. Every time I place app in background it closes and I have to re-open.,3
5086,very good that enables me to get good stuff and cheap,5
5087,"I'm really grateful to be apart of OfferUp thank you good people god bless everyone my this new year being better things HEALTH, JOB'S,",5

5095,"App works good never had any problems, but it's big problem to sell something. I have this app 4 or 5 years and sold maybe 2 or 3 items. It's not like Craigslist you can renew your post and it goes on top of the list so people can see it. At offerup you have to pay for this. The only reason I keep this app because it's freeüëéüëé. Just to add that nothing has changed since my last review on offerupüëéüëéüëé. But I'm still selling my stuff on Craigslist‚ò∫Ô∏è so that good.",1

5098,Nice,5
5099,About i.possible to cancel subscription,1
5100,"Update: this awful app is now spamming me with a notification to upgrade to premium every ten minutes. The app is still extremely slow and unresponsive, and no recent update has addressed this problem. Just checking messages or notifications is an endeavor. To make matters worse, they are allowing sellers to spam listings now, so your feed is full of repeat posts by sellers spamming keywords. No matter how many reports you send, they don't address the problem. It's worse than Craigslist.",1
5101,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! DEFINITELY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Tried a premium trial for 3 days and in that time not one person clicked on my listing, same as before premium...

5102,"WORST SHOPPING APP EVER! Tell it you want local pickup options, get nothing but far-flung shipped items. I just searched for an item between $1-$100, I got equipment all the way up to $13,000. Pages and pages of Etsy ads... Look, if I wanted to shop Etsy, I'd go to their website, but for you to put all their üí© in as if it's local listings is infuriating.",1
5103,Very user friendly. A great way to shop and sell no longer needed items.,5
5104,"I luv the app, I'm already trying Premium, I'm still getting push notifications to ""Try Premium"" It's pissing me off that these these notifications are this persistent. I'm probably missing stuff now that I turned off all notifications. No, I won't send emails on this screw up!",2
5105,"I am getting constant spam notifications about their paid service several times a day. Today alone, I received about 8 about a free 3 day trial and no way of turning it off. I am deleting the app because I don't want to be constantly spammed for a service I don't want without the option of option out. Use to be good, not its trash with all the constant ads and paid service spams shoved down your throat.",1
5106,Going in a disappointing direction. The ads that hold me hostage until their countdown timer is done are really aggravating. Does that prompt anyone to want to buy?? Tonight I received several notifications to try their premium service. Like every half hour I got another notification. This app is nearly ruined if they continue in this direction. I had many successful years with offer up until they were bought out.,3
5107,Great deals.,5
5108,good stuff.,5
5109,"this idea has turned into a great market. This reminds me of a swap meet, only You're not walking up and down aisles in the sun.",5
5110,"This update only serves even more ads, nice if you're into abusing your eyeballs. Inline ads taking up more screen than items for sale. Full screen frikkin un-closable ads that covers the entire app requiring force-closing offerup. Avoid this steaming pile of ""improvements"" and use the webpage instead.",1
5111,I paid for an extra slot to be able to post one extra item and no matter what I did including calling customer service reset the app reinstall login logout nothing worked and then I called customer service to help resolve the issue and they never got back to me I even asked for a refund and they'll refund.,2
5112,Completely bs that I can't sell my vaping equipment here on your site,1
5113,Good apo,4
5114,"Scams EVERYWHERE. Definitely engaged in making a profit. You get one free add, and then be ready to PAY UP. Your ad will be buried way in the back, yet ads from over a YEAR AGO are front and center. Verification system is stuck in an endless loop and everyone wants to communicate outside the app. Just a step above Craigslist and falling fast. Put an ad in the newspaper, you'll be glad you did. ****EDIT*** Tried again - EVEN worse than before. Landing page looks like a 2nd graders scrapbook",1
5115,Regardless of what you select it still shows you stuff like miles away and does not put emphasis on things that are actually within 5 mi or the miles you set so it's like if you're looking for things in the neighborhood forget about it maybe my app just isn't working don't really care it just beats the whole point of looking in your neighborhood if you can't look in your neighborhood,1
5116,"Worst app ever!!! I purchased the 12 month promote Plus and paid $100 for it and then two days later they canceled my account and they wouldn't give me back my money I've been trying to reach them for a while but they don't respond to my emails. Definitely don't recommend this app to anyone. The support team is terrible. Offer up please give me back my money and just deactivate our accounts when we can't post,buy, or sell",1
5117,"great presentation of the condition of the item. prompt, and polite.",5
5118,"This is a great app, one of the best I believe üòÉüëçüèª",5
5119,"Today I received a hit for cat food and after downloading app offer up refuses to open my account unless I give it more assess to other contacts in my Google account. Let me say here that this is the four text I've received on offer up in two years. I questioned the ethics behind it's operation after noticing;"" boost your sales !"" If boosting my sells comes with a fee you can direct what I see and refuse to let me see and I deleted offer up.",1
5120,"Well I guess that it works makes it a good app.... I have sold what I put on here, Is sometimes it takes a while but i've sold",5
5121,great place great prices,5
5122,"(Update) 1/16/24. I had to ship to texas. Package was there in 2 days. Why did it take so long for me to get paid? Also, this app CONTINUES to be slower and more buggy than every other selling app/site that I use. What are they getting paid for?? Why can't they just fix it already? It's been this way for the last 2+years. STOP ADDING STUFF AND FIX WHAT IS BROKEN!! Was reading reviews just now. Apparently, socialcare@offerup is doing nothing to to fix the problems with the app.",2
5123,"Terrible, always saying a post violates guidelines. Like how is a blender and a cordless drill a violation, it wasn't multiple post just one. They remove your post and ban your account for the silliest reasons. Staff needs to review the handbook on violations. Also they need to revise phone number account. Phone numbers get reissued. If someone prior to you had your number and was banned your outta luck they won't take your new number. They need to find a way to accept your new number.",1
5124,Austin was very kind and very knowledgeable regarding the Switch lite. He was very willing to help me after he sold the unit to me. He texted me back several times to make sure i was satisfied with my purchase. Thank you Austin.,5
5125,"The app doesn't work well, and they don't have customer service. I sold an item twice and received a random error that I canceled the transaction and funded the money, which I never did. I emailed customer service over 2 days ago. No response, no sale. They just emailed me a ""gift,"" and the link led to nowhere..another error message",1
5126,after a while you will need to register for a true identity account :(,1
5127,Slow api,3
5128,"Horrible. I used to use this app a lot. It mustve been sold to a different company or something. Im trying to sell an item. Every time i hit ""post"" it gets immediately taken down. I think they just want you to pay them or something. Never using this app again.",1
5129,Just completely disappointed. Don't take accountability for locking a person out of their account without any explanation or reason.,1
5130,"A terribly flawed app. Disables your account for no reason, has various issues with login and every other feature. Very disappointing. Stay away until they put more effort to fix this lousy app.",3
5131,great app,5
5132,Show me boots for work,5
5133,system not good enough to force Sellers from removing after sold,2
5134,Offer-up is a great place to sell you're used or new goods.ive sold a few and bought a few,5
5135,they don't tell you they are going to charge you,1
5136,"Offer Up does not motivate their sellers to remove items that are no longer available. Wasted a lot of my time. Items posted for more than 6 weeks should be dropped. With today`s technology, it is not impossible. And seller should repost if they really want to sell.",3
5137,Can you make it so that the app can work in landscape mode,4
5138,Won't allow me to log in now that I'm out of the country..,1
5139,It's a good app idk what there talking about but this app sells good stuff and they are pretty good and cheap,5
5140,Very nice love the App and the vehicle so many reasonable cars,5
5141,"It would seem that unless you pay more to promote the items you want to sell, then you don't get a lot of responses. I've had more luck on Facebook Marketplace than on OfferUp.",2
5142,"This used to be a good app, but with the ads, the app looks cheap, and it feels unbearable to go through listings.",1
5143,"You can't use it unless you consent for your face scan, phone number, and all personal information to be stored, sold, and used. No thank you.",1
5144,Last sale excellent results. I recommend it.,5
5145,"At least less rigamorole & less ""gotchas""(hidden costs)than ebay,but similar in that once you post they nag you to upgrade so people will see your ad.So,another example of the""bait & switch""where you're baited to sell free,but once your foot is in the door you find your item shelved until paying the shakedown(upgrade).I'd bet they hire firms to concoct positive reviews from minions to camouflage their marketing scams.It sucks.Put a sign in your yard.Truly free & more people will see it.",2
5146,Waste of space in my phone üëé have several items listed and everything is brand new never used and seriously cheap however not one item even has been viewed lol offer up is a joke and waste of time and energy how does everything I list on mercari sell within 2 days of listing? If you are wanting to actually sell your items this is not the app unless you have time too spare,1
5147,great deals on just about everything,5
5148,I signed up for this and now my bank account gets charged for some audio book thing? I'll never use this app again and have uninstalled it,1
5149,"App is really really slow for anything you want to do, good app to buy and sell stuff",2
5150,Good app. Sold Many items here .,5
5151,Beyond awful. Installed to buy one thing specifically and purchased something from a very sweet person. Account was disabled the next day regardless of verifying my phone number and email. Got a notification my deal was canceled because of this. Had a friend install the app to try and they got banned too. Do not install.,1
5152,"Nearly useless built in messaging with unreliable notifications. So many inquiries immediately replied to have not been ""seen"" because of poor message handling and notifying. In their (supposed) effort to keep users ""safe"" (translated: forced in app) they shorten even Google maps links. Pair that with a glaring warning that ""the sender may be trying to steal your account"" and it can easily scare off a new use who may be nervous about meeting a stranger even in a public retail setting.",1
5153,I've never used I'm going to try it out and see how it is I will be back to let you know how it is. Later,2
5154,Like it or love it n that is all,5
5155,Doesn't work for Android users. I messaged 10+ people with many sales and ratings and 0 messages were viewed. My wife messaged the same sellers AFTER me and got responses from ALL of them. Deleting this app.,1
5156,Very Professional nice site.,4
5157,App is laggy,1
5158,Good,5
5159,"The app is fine, people sometimes contact you as if interested & then they disappear completely. I guess that's just the buying & selling game. Good app for getting items out to the public.",4
5160,OfferUp doesn't currently support shipping to Arkansas. So until they do this app isn't of much use to me.,1
5161,Quick response very responsible,5
5162,OfferUp has you know great local deals and stuff it's just I found that some of the ads that I've you know stuff that I posted I don't get any response for like months at a time and then when I do you know it's only been by like sheer luck that I even still have the item I posted and I've been able to sell it but like six months it's so it's so weird also if you're into like just local trading and buying and selling and stuff I would check out the five miles app app.,4
5163,"Honestly, it is one of the most awful apps one can use if you ever plan to buy something via shipping. High percentage cut that offerup takes, scammers, etc. Plus, the mobile app doesn't show the prices on the thumbnails like the web version, so its annoying to navigate. Just do local location pickups only. I encountered way too many scammers to even bother with shipping now.",2
5164,Very good condition. better than expected. seller even had manuals for the mower.,5
5165,Junk APP!!!! RAN BY people from India they are 25 years behind civilization so they won't be able to understand any of your issues nor do they understand ENGLISH. The app is junk!! No support!! And you won't sell anything!!,1
5166,sucks,1
5167,Awesome!!!!,5
5168,This spp sucks and I didn't even make a profile on here but it's cool cause I have a good lawyer and I Am going to make sure you guys go to jail for stealing my car and the house is not a good place to go to bed so I don't want to go to school with you guys and she said that she wanted me to bring her to the house with me and I was able to get her to the house and then she called the cops and said that she wanted me to stay there and she doesn't want them around any more and they won't leave,1
5169,Mediocre looking for cars doesn't allow you filter out dealers from owners,3
5170,Don't take the free trial bait!!! This is the hardest company to cancel premium with!!! They charged me for 2 months of premium after I cancelled!!,1
5171,It won't let me respond to the person interested in my item. Keeps saying something went wrong.,1
5172,Hate this app. Beware of charges,1
5173,didn't get one offer,2
5174,it's not very popular site on selling items,1
5175,Great job üëçüëå,5
5176,Scamers and thiefs. I have been using this app for my business (work) to sell appliances. It was great. This year all the sudden they started limiting the listing number and then the types. After that they started charging for listings. Last month I started purchasing extra listings and less then a week after my big purchase they just deleted my about without any notification or explanation. And I found out that they have been doing this to other businesses as well. They cast me big $$$$ lost,1
5177,"This app won't be around much longer, if you can think for yourself just use Craigslist",5
5178,Full of scam. It's un safe and full of ads! I'm gonna wait for a new app the take it's place! 2024,1
5179,Insanely buggy on Android (Pixel),1
5180,offer up,5
5181,love it,5
5182,Not my,5
5183,good and sometimes u lose out on good items,5
5184,They are extremely lazy and don't help you at all. They take no fault for their own stupidity or anything on their app at all. You can't update or change your address and refuse to help you. They lost my items of over $200 and did absolutely nothing for their own fault I lost money because of their lazy moronic app,1
5185,It may be free but I get sent too many adds for other people's stuff.,3
5186,I like it they have good thing,5
5187,Great app to sell your unused items.,5
5188,Useless! It is more like a thrift store full of free cellphone ads. Was looking furniture cheap and found 2 couches and 500 ads for cellphones.,1
5189,"I love offer up I've used this app for about 6 years now, helped me get a lot for my house hold and my kids, brand new stuff for lower prices.",4
5190,"I use this app every single day. I have earned anywhere from $5 to $5,000 in a day. I totally love this platform..!!",5
5191,no one sends any messages it's dead,1
5192,Very Much Helpful And Dependeble,5
5193,"Don't know whatever happens to this app but I was there since day one ,and never see this app this catastrophic,slow glitchy,it seems like ur guys putting to much in the app, the first owner never aloud that ,and the app runs perfect,I guess greed is the cause,if you make money in advertising that should be more than enough ,now when u sale urself to the government,that's you fall down ,they can't make u do anything ,they can treat but if u get a lawyer they can't touch. Nowlookatthis shittyapp?",1
5194,Thx Jes√∫s....Water heater works great üëçüèª,5
5195,ME ENCANTO VENDI MUY RAPIDO MIS COSAS LOGICO EN UN BUEN PRESIO COMODO PARA EL COMPRADOR,5
5196,Ads? Why mess up an app like that? Now every single app that used to be free of ads wants to go with the premium so we don't have spd ads,1
5197,Super slow. A snail is faster. No customer service,1
5198,confusion about paying to get faster results,4
5199,Notifications are very poor.,3
5200,"Offer up just deleted my entire account!!! I had 3 in tracking still. And 3 other orders processing!!! Violating guidelines?! No, the seller who took my money without shipping refused to send product for the price They stated. Offer up just took my money, and defended the seller whom also stole from me. And I'm in the wrong here? Discriminated And wrongfully had my account deleted, WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BEFOREHAND!!! Knowing, i had placed numerous orders, and in the process of making others.",1
5201,"extremely slow response for anything you click on, has been like this for years. doesn't save search parameters and shows you things outside your parameters anyway. jumpscare adverts. lots of duplicate posts and scams, reporting a post doesn't do anything",1
5202,The site is SLOW. It takes forever for all my posts to load. Sometimes they don't load. The chat support is a bot that is of no help. I cannot delete any of my selling posts! I have to archive them on their site so they will be there forever. No other selling site I know of won't let you delete your own posts! This site really is a joke. There is no way to list things from a Windows device or do a search (there's no search box). And one of my searches brought up an 8 year old item.,1
5203,Why would responses be faster if you buy the subscription? Do you withhold responses for a certain amount of time? It's already full of adds. How much revenue do you need. Way to make this app shadier,3
5204,wonderful to deal with,5
5205,it's bad the app can't ship anything I'm trying to buy and there is a lot of scams on this app,1
5206,Great concept but painfully slow interface. Takes many seconds after pressing anything to get to that page. Often all messages dissappear and have to force stop the app and restart to get messages back. Either incredibly poor app development or their backend is slow af. Either way fix it so I can enjoy your app. Using marketplace for now.,1
5207,can be better,2
5208,"Unable to open OfferUp after yesterday afteroon. I was able to communicate until a little before 7pm. What is wrong with OfferUp App? I've tried Uninstalling and Re-installing, something is not working right?",1
5209,Not worth it anymore ! Deleted !,1
5210,Love shopping on here,5
5211,"I had 10 messages within an hour of posting my first item, all of them were scam bots with no purchases and no items sold who were asking for my phone number. Stay off this app!",1
5212,Great concept but Stop sending me push notifications!!! I've turned everything off except messages and this app continues to hound me with notifications. So annoying! I'm just gng to move to FB and NextDoor instead,2
5213,Nice,5
5214,payment issues make this a joke.,1
5215,good old offerup,5
5216,good,5
5217,I can scroll for hours looking at everything and I'm hooked.,5
5218,"Removes posts every time I post something. Rather, annoying. Now, I get message notifications but can't even access the messages cause now, all of a sudden , none of my posts are loading. Waste of time. 0 if I could. UPDATE 01/12/24: Now my account got removed. I haven't even posted anything or have any interactions, but my account was removed. LAME APP!",1
5219,I like,5
5220,"Bunch of bs ads, stupid how you have to pay to post cars now. Didn't realize they that money thirsty. Deleted.",1
5221,"Dam Offerup now y'all too with the dam ads. Man on my phone offerup has always been slow takes forever to look at messages, to change items I have posted or to respond to someone. Now y'all too with the ads I used to kinda enjoy it only cause of how slow it is that was the only complaint i had until recently. Ads are annoying I really hope they don't get worse than say my audiomack app the ads on their are on another level with ads. Hopefully Offerup doesn't go through the same thing",2
5222,"I do not like having a bunch of notifications. Only want to know if I get a message from a buyer. Doesn't matter if you unchecked everything in settings, offer up still sends you sales and bs push notifications. There was an ad that popped up when i was searching. To many better options to deal with this. Its time to delete.",1
5223,I look it up other people are posting paintball guns I tried to post paintball guns and they flagged me and say I can't do it so I don't understand why other people can but they're flagging me and they won't reply back or give me a reason why That's why I'm giving a one star I didn't already I try to report the problem and you guys haven't responded,1
5224,"very good,will recomend this app",5
5225,great site easy to operate.,5
5226,Easy to figure out and very reliable,5
5227,I like the QR codes they send out it helps a lot. Really nice app!,5
5228,I've came up on a lot of great stuff and I've got some things I need to get started with my career goals and plenty more.,4
5229,intrusive pop-up ads on a selling app? Really? they get in the way of trying to get stuff done. Are you not making enough in transaction fees?,1
5230,awesome and it's safe,5
5231,This app used to awesome but they now force ads every time go to look at a item making the experience super slow.. I'm deleting this worthless app.,1
5232,it's not good because people always try to get it for dirt cheap and they ask for your phone # and then they don't show up to buy,2
5233,Does not the picturs,1
5234,Won't allow me to login and keeps telling me I violated guidelines. I haven't used this app since it switched from letgo. Even when it was letgo I follow all guidelines so unless my account was hacked there is no call for this.,1
5235,"JUNK! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! Everything was working fine, now I can't upload ANYTHING. There's no point in keeping this app when it won't even let me post any items. I am uninstalling as it's COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. Tech support provide ZERO solutions. just told me ""yeah, lots of people are telling us it doesn't work"". Well that's great but I see other people posting new items, no problem. I'm done wasting my time uploading the same item 20 times for it to just disappear. I am beyond frustrated.",1
5236,love it,4
5237,gr9 so far. I'm new so this is a educational experience fore. but tyvm 4 asking.,5
5238,"Update this app! I really wish offer up, would have some where we could, every so many days, bump the post to the front. I swear my items don't seem to be getting seen. most of my sales are coming from the MERCARI app. I see my items are being seen as the views go up every so many days I check them on the mercari. Offer up makes you go through a process just to change your priced items. It's like I have to do that just to get one item bumped. I have too many items to go one by one and do this.",2
5239,too many ads,3
5240,"Got ripped off by a 3rd party app that offer up has ON THEIR APP..... Costs me a lot money($around $259), Time and not to mention ruined my Christmas ,new years and my birthday coming up in a few days!!!

5241,Great place to sell,5
5242,i love offer up,5
5243,No experience yet. Just looks like a good app.,4
5244,"Yes it is lagging updates on everything. Just like all the feedback they're talking the same stuff I'm saying. I open my acct. around 4-5years ago, I never sold nothing but still getting emails asking about items 4-5yrs ago I posted. That's sad .",1
5245,too many commercials,2
5246,I love this app,5
5247,Pretty much forced into getting a subscription and now cannot even get to the way to cancel it.,1
5248,"whatever a person is looking for, most likely they'll find it here and more",5
5249,Offerup owes me $8 from a Woodburner that sold two months ago. They refuse to update my cellphone# so that I can authentic myself. When I tried to update my cellphone. I received an error message telling me the system thinks my phone# invalid without even testing it first. Hillsborough County has changed the area codes from 813 to 656 and people that change their phone# will likely receive the new area code. I have deleted my account and uninstalled the app from my electronic device.,1
5250,"Dislike the ads but hey...... it would get a 5 star if it had a tab on the bottom for saved items instead of having to go to your account, come on OfferUp get with the time",3
5251,If I could give negative Stars I would. They have deleted my account for the second time for no reason and they can never give me a reason. Worst app ever! Do not download it. It is trash,1
5252,muy buena compra y excelente trato thanks jorge üôèüèº üëçüèº,5
5253,One can no longer see when the items you're looking at were posted by the seller. They've removed this feature for both iOS and Android devices and it makes no sense whatsoever but causes a big inconvenience.,1
5254,"Lego was a much better site ,things used to sell really fast on lego ,but from it transformed to offerup you guys slow it down because now you have to pay before your stuff gets highlighted are really put up to view,I have to be taking my stuff from offerup and sell other places which goes much faster",2
5255,It's horrible do not download there's just scammers and rude people everywhere And I got banned for absolutely no reason there a bunch of ads and glitches to many bugs this app is just sad,1
5256,So far this has been a piece of cake I like the security of it.,5
5257,quick response and answered any questions fast,5
5258,great way to sell and buy things,5
5259,OfferUp you might want to ask Google why I am uninstalling and why I will not be working with your company.,1
5260,Can't use it with a VPN.,1
5261,"Good spot to find some clothes and maybe consoles for a cheaper price, just make sure to read every description on your items before you buy",5
5262,Good marketplace exposure.,4
5263,Offer Up is a good place to shop...,5
5264,Good,4
5265,sucks more car companies and flea market style stuff. most posts are very old and no longer responding or for sale,1
5266,Disorganized,2
5267,"Hello, there's a problem with the app, before you could save items on a list to see what you like, and maybe purchase later, now the list is gone, now I don't have the items that I saved anymore, it was called favorites, and now there missing and there's no button to press to retrieve them, why would you do this....??",1
5268,Cant even look at your messages without ads in the way and what's the point of a buy now button if it doesn't actually mean you get to buy the item,1
5269,So many ads on here now. You really need an ad lock of some kind to use this app. the app asking me to promote things every 5 minutes and turn on notifications is super annoying.,2
5270,"So, as someone mentioned , yeah, its running slower than it ever has, but , id be willing to still use, if it werent for the fact that i want to change my identity on the app, and in order for that to succeed, i need to remove all my current followers. Instead i can only block them? so they can make another account and still get on my page? This needs to be addressed, there are people following me that i KNOW are not good people, if they look at my items , theyll see where i live now,",1
5271,"Five years ago the offer up app was amazing and now it sucks, I don't get response back like I used to. People block my page for no reason, I can't post medicines or drugs because I get block easily and five years I could post whatever I want and now I can't. Why. ?",1
5272,Couldn't see the comments on the item I was selling it sent me a email but when I went to the item there was no comment,2

5274,I have the same problem as many others have stated. It's extremely slow and freezes up to where I have to exit the app and try again. I've tried undownloading and downloaded it again to see if that helps but unfortunately the same problem as before.,1
5275,"I turn to this app for just about anything I'm searching to buy or even to get for free. It also is a big help if I'm looking for price ranges on items that I may be selling.

5279,Very dependable app,5
5280,Terrible app bugs. Slow and laggy. however the platform does offer a great and convenient way to sell stuff. They need to hire some good techs and fix their bugs so the app can run smoothly. bc its insane how bad it is.,2
5281,great,5
5282,Slow appp i press something and it takes 3-4 seconds for anything to change in the screen and messages i get say they been delivered at a time and show in my in box hr or 2 later.,1

5286,I enjoy selling items on offer up. It's one of the best ways to make money or spend money . I thoroughly enjoy this app.,4
5287,"Check their BBB profile. They have an F and for valid reasons. Over 1k buyers and sellers scammed, myself included. Online shopping is not safe anymore and I highly recommend not using this app or any apps affiliated with OfferUp.",1
5288,Wouldn't waste my time. They charge you to post. You get one free one let's say in the tools section. If you wanna list something else you have to pay for it to be listed. Most people are on there to make money no one wants to pay to list their items that's what eBay is for,1
5289,"As always, difficult to distinguish the spam and others with wrong intentions. Makes it difficult to trust anyone.",3
5290,How the heck do you cancel subscription? I followed the instructions and they do not coincide. I do not want this subscription,1
5291,I was very disappointed in this app I had it for 4 or 5 days and my stuff wasn't saling at all. When it should have. No matter what prices people chose. But I guess beggers can't be picky with things cause even those with alot of money won't bother.,1
5292,Very easy to learn. Great way to reduce waste into the enviroment.,5
5293,"Terrible experience with this application! Keeps suspending my acount without any proof of supposed ""posting violations"". I've paid for every premium service they offer, and still.. No true answer, as to why, my account was deleted. Save your time and money!",1
5294,Lot of good deals,5
5295,Ok I love using this app but it takes a while 2 minutes to load and then throws me out over n over. It is super slow can't even reply messages. My notifications don't even come in. Please fix the issue. It's like this on every phone!,2
5296,Zero stars. It's a scam company.when you try to buy something you get no responses. 25 times. They expect you to buy the service now or it won't work,1
5297,Hella buggy and slow. Not optimized at all,1
5298,great way to make money and sell your stuff,5
5299,"This app, socks. For reals. Ever since the merger with them and let go. I have had any sales.let alone any item views.. none, mattress of fact i had items posted from about 8 months ago, when I sign back in afterba break from it the most views one post had, was 2.. this frustrates me because I used to make good from this app but Let Go was the better one of the two. Notice how every other complaint gets responded to and mine hasn't, they dumbfounded this app to not work, it's on purpose",1
5300,Offers Up is the best way to liquidate your excess belongings and putting extra cash in your pocket,5
5301,Sellers never reply to offers or any messages with questions sent to them. They took my money and never sent my item that was paid for. I will never use this site again.,1
5302,Great,5
5303,"I love the offer feature , so simple and avoid the awkwardness of Facebook marketplace",4
5304,"It says you can cancel your promotion at any time, but I couldn't find out where to cancel it at So, I'm just going to delete the app !",1
5305,Nice to sale,5
5306,A lot of scammers,2
5307,Great app!,5
5308,great place to sell stuff. easy money people are generous,5
5309,"I like the app but I gave you 3 stars because you removed on it, how long that items have been on the app. It makes it more difficult to buy things.",3
5310,"Apparently, they will ban you from messaging sellers if someone gets offended by your realistic offer and reports it as offensive....someone had something listed for many times the market price, I offered market price, now I am banned from messaging sellers....",1
5311,App is just getting worse after merging with let go! So many ads! The load times are so slow! Constantly crashes!,1
5312,"Get y9ur,,, ,,¬¢$",5

5314,Excelent app for the consumer,5
5315,wasn't very nice and didn't let me explore the item,1
5316,good app,5

5319,It's quite alright,4
5320,"Another horrible app to ""Letgo"" of!",1
5321,Unskippable video ads? Really?,1
5322,Love this app,5
5323,"This app does not monitor the items being sold on their platform. If I was you I would just buy from places like postmark so you have some sort of safety from someone selling something fake, broken or stolen. On top of that they advertise for temu. This is an app which somehow was able to sell fake bars of silver which are absolute replica duplicates and have no marking to show its a copy of a currency. So I was under the impression what I was buying was legit, and it cost me hundreds of dollars",1
5324,OfferUp randomly shadow bans users for unknown reasons and doesn't notify users they've been banned. You'll notice you've been banned when no one responds to your messages or purchase requests. There's no way to fix it as support is non-existent. After years of use I've been forced to give up and just use Facebook marketplace.,1
5325,I Love Offer Up,5
5326,"They are incompetent they banned me for ""language"" but yet I've seen people say worse than me and yet they don't get banned hypocrisy these people ban people for no reason they deserve to be shut down or change there policies",1
5327,it's ight. lol,5
5328,like it have a lot of things cheap,5
5329,its a safe and quick way to sell your unwanted stuff.,5
5330,They should make an update of the items being sold where you could video record the item for sell.,4
5331,nobody shops on this app,2

5333,Very good,5
5334,Selling experience..Blah!. Had LetGo sold almost every item or gave away for free was great until OfferUp took over.,1
5335,I love this app,5
5336,"sick of businesses putting their listings here. I only want to see deals from households not businesses but those get drowned out by business listings and ""sponsored"" ads so you cant find the real deals.",2
5337,easy purchase,5
5338,ads are way old,1
5339,"This app and its policies for refunds are ridiculous, meaning there are no refunds for in-app purchases. I used the free trial and forgot to cancel before they charged me, so that was my fault. I probably would have kept it, had any of my items sold using the promote plus feature. But upon inquiring about a refund, I was told they don't issue any. Facebook marketplace is a better platform. Offer up has a lot of scammers looking for personal info.",1
5340,Very useful.,5
5341,This app is really helpful for buying and selling what you need or need to get rid of.,5
5342,Good,5
5343,"It just shut my phone off after i installed it, tried turning back on, after so many trys. Says my phones 0% but plug it n it's at 60%. Waste of time.",1
5344,I don't like this new updated app! What happened to being able to see how many people have looked at my items for sale? Where's my archived items? Seems like you're making it harder for sellers to sell their items unless they pay a premium! This is not the Offerup I used to love!!! Grrrr.,1
5345,Scammers,4
5346,Pop up ads is a complete turn off in using an app. üëé,1
5347,The app wants me to scan my card. It won't scan my card. Can't make a purchase.,1
5348,Good,5
5349,great app been using it for few years,5
5350,"1. Spam link ads are posted in feeds. These are false companies and are only attempting to harvest financial information. 2. Postings no longer show date posted. Now I get "" is it still available""responses, and I too want to ask cause I don't know if the posting is 2 days or 2 years old.",1
5351,"easy to use, alerts every time someone is interested in something you've listed. also shows comparison in pricing to help you sell your items.",5

5362,they never delete old ads . I hate that,2
5363,Video ads became infuriating. Uninstalled.,2
5364,poor customer support. stupid rules banning people from the app and vague terms. Just use marketplace its way better and has more of what your looking,1
5365,I sell everything with ease thanks to offer up and it's affiliates,5
5366,"""Hi, is this still available?"" Terrible app, it was better off when it was Letgo. People will literally waste your time on here, better find another app to sell on if you want to actually sell. You could have something listed for $100 and somehow you'll get offers for $8. . . Make it make sense. OfferDown sounds more accurate.",1
5367,"Edit: annnd they've added intrusive ads in-between searches... Just when you would think this app couldn't get lamer - As worthless as craigslist. Impossible to shop for furniture because duplicate posting bots OfferUp refuses to deal with. And even though you're able to see whose inquiring or selling, they're still going to be flakey and non committal. The only good thing about this app you can block bad buyers and sellers from contacting you.",1
5368,"Buggy app now with spammy ads, and unreliable notifications",3
5369,good app,5
5370,easy,5
5371,Deleting due to ads not allowing me to exit out and takes over entire screen.. I have to literally exit the app and quit it to have it go away... sad,1

5373,"TruYou doesn't even verify my I.D. anymore where I had no issues before so its unusable , back to Ebay",1
5374,"Was great before the ads. Now it ads without consent. Also new promote feature allows the app to ignore your parameters so youll get items nowhere near you suggested for no apparent reason other than theyre paid to harass. You guys are going in the wrong direction. Ask permission before playing ads, you dont get to change my parameters. Fix your garbage app",1
5375,"Had too come back too update and wow this app has came down hill like since when did you guys have pop-up ads on your app? These years have been trash with this app and another reason is there is now pawn shops posting there products everywhere when they should not be allowed too! Should only be private people , a business should not be able too take control like that offer up you need too step up and make a change this [was] my favorite selling and buying app but now it's destroyed bybusiness's",1

5377,slow app. ads is dumb.,1
5378,"I LOVE Offerup the only complaint I have ot when people either don't respond, respond days, weeks and even months later. Also, when people keep you waiting and NEVER show up. Or, they ask you to hold something m, even though someone else wants it's and then THEY don't show up or even give you the common curtousey to let you know they changed they're mind. Of you want to sell or buy, STAY ON TOP OF IT. It's not fair to the rest of us.",3
5379,"professional, knowledgeable, prompt",5

5396,it damn sure gets the job done.,4
5397,ADS????,1
5398,/ Ya pib,5
5399,App blocks you from making emergency calls. Once their ads pop up you have to search for the little tiny almost hidden x to remove the ad from your screen to make an emergency phone call.,1
5400,"Lot of scammers/bots, not a place we can actually sell stuff, I think not much user traffic",1
5401,Super fast customer service. Very professional and courteous.,5

5403,"good app ,great way to make a lil extra cash$$. :):):)7",5
5404,It worx like a charm!,5
5405,offer up illegally took down my vehicle add just so I have to pay $5 for my next vehicle listing. if any lawyer sees this please have some sort of audit arranged with this server,1
5406,"People want more for their used items than store-bought new. This app has turned from a place to buy good used items at a good price, into a waste of time.",2
5407,the notification is not alerting me. I get no push notifications,2
5408,"unfriendly to sellers by making ad posting difficult. Too much emphasis on making ad revenue. Voluntarily user authentication results in high number of scammers. Used to be better, I almost never use it anymore",3
5409,"Horrible user experience. Can't see prices in search. When you sort prices from low to high, the results are filled with spammers setting their price to $0. The order also isn't right. It shows me $250 price before $200... It's a headache to browse.",1
5410,I think the App needs a little work but a genius idea. I guess its not the app developers fault that most people on here post things for sale with no details at all much less the critical details that identify what model or series or whatever they are trying to sell. Thats the only thing that gives this app a lower rating is the people who use it mainly. I feel like some of the contacts i get pertaining to something im selling are fake buyers who are paid to keep your interest at peak 4 the App,3
5411,I have still yet to meet up with anyone and buy anything off the site. But people do respond back pretty quick and there's a lot of things in my area to browse.,3
5412,You keep sending me notices about things I was looking for ..but I wasn't don't have anything to do with what I searched.,1

5424,"I have had my OfferUp account for over 3 years at this point I think, and I have had no issues with any scams as well as I was happily surprised to find that it is quick to set up your account, and get items posted with several categories to give the buyer a realistic idea of what exactly they're looking into. My first sale was a new, never used front bumper for a car I ended up junking. I posted the bumper up being to get some of the money I sent on it back as well as hopefully help someone. üëç",4
5425,Won't let me post a garage sale. Tried 4 times. Oh I see many others post it but for me is not allowed? Next app. As for retrieving stolen items from a buyer it's not possible. They will not help you. Instead I'm blocked from selling a simple item like a COIN. This app will NOT give you information of who was it that comes over your home and steal your items. Even though the person came from OfferUp app! How is this garbage app be 4.4 when is 90% negative reviews?,1
5426,Love it,5

5431,"I have used offer up since it first came out and always suggested making a paid or subscription version because it used to be great for locals to sell stuff and make extra cash. Now it is full of businesses fees and ads. I will be removing my listings soon and I will stop using the app. I never thought this app would become worse to sell on than ebay. Now officially my least favorite app to sell on. Congratulations. R2R: Help with what? Stop the ads, remove businesses, and lower fees to 10%.",1
5432,great app to find deals. the modern Sunday paper classified ads with technology to ask questions of the seller and set appointments to see their goods.,5
5433,"Scammers on the app and OfferUp seems to not care. There are no repercussions for these people either. Unable to review scammers or horrible buyers/sellers without a ""purchase"" so multiple people get scammed by the same person. Had to report a scammer then all of sudden I got multiple emails about how I am selling ""prohibited items"" and if they see more they will block my account. One was for an item I never even sold on Offerup. It was sold to a friend. Smh. Worthless app and company.",1
5434,great app I got rid of most of my stuff here so is pretty useful,5

5436,good,5
5437,excelente,5
5438,taken over by dealerships and ads,1
5439,OfferUp used to be great. Now it's just full of scammers and intrusive ads. It's no surprise people are switching to FB Marketplace,1
5440,"You can't sell anything on there you get hundreds of views but no one will buy, you even have people tell you they are interested and then never text back LETGO was way better by itself you can sell anything on that app and people will buy within 2 weeks",1

5442,Freezes and there's a lag when it doesn't freeze. Not my phone because all other apps work perfectly fine,2

5448,Keeps closing cant even scroll down jus closes ive tryed reinstall clear catch everything no luck can u help please... Dont you people at offer up care anymore about yer app???,1
5449,Greate Expensive,5
5450,"No price shown when you browse. Lots of hidden ad that isn't clearly label so you click on it only to find that it was overpriced at another marketplace like Etsy. So you wasted a lot of time browsing. It is as if they don't care about user satisfaction and only want to collect information on what you like to buy and make money off the hidden ads. Clearly, they can do better. You might as well use their website on a desktop to browse items to save time",1

I could post something and usually within a day to a few weeks I would have had.

5461,Awesome,5

I see plenty of items in there and when you ask about somethings, they tell you and a day later that they sold the item so long ago, and make it that you can add more items in one feed instead of making a new one and last but not least, if your trying to promote your business, why put so many of the same ad.

5484,Love it here,5
5485,They list ads with normal listings of people trying to sell their items. These ads are not from verified sources like most peoples listings and they will not help you in any way when you purchase from ads they allow to be listed. I had nearly $100 stolen and they offer no assistance and it seems they purposefully include them to confuse buyers into thinking that purchase falls under their protection plan when it didn't. I've asked for assistance and they offer ABSOLUTELY NONE. 2nd time reviewed.,1
5486,"UPDATE 12/31/23: (kind of) nothing has changed with OU. still tons of stale ads and sellers not responding. Sellers should have to relist items after 90days. Was great, now is terrible. I stopped using Let Go a while ago because of all the dead ads and no response from sellers. Offer up was great because sellers would actually respond. Now since LG&OU merged OU is now having the same issues. Tons of ads that have been up for 6-12 mths. OU needs to start requiring sellers to repost ads every 90",1

The developers are more preoccupied with trying to convince people to raise the rating than remove retail stores from falsely advertising their full priced items as 1 dollar or free.

5503,The number of ads in this app are ridiculous. I hate clicking on a stupid add by accident and getting redirected to something I'm not even interested in. And the amount of spammers is a pain. 2023 and it is now worst with lame ads.,1
5504,This app is so terrible that I finally just uninstalled it.,1
5505,Great,5
5506,everything is great except people not showing up!,5
5507,"Their new release requires us to look at merchandise way out of our local geography, rather than use our presets of ""within X miles"". This makes the app a hassle and less useful to me because this type of merchandise requires personal inspection, rather than ""trust me"" based on a photo or two. Bad judgement by the developer in my view.",3
5508,"It takes time to sell items, but it's better than Market Place. No bots here.",4
5509,This app use to be good until they want to charge you for everything find another app.,1
5510,OMG please fix the app stop responding to the poor reviews and fix it. This is unusable at this point. Waste of phone space and time. Used to be my go to. Ugh.,1
5511,App lacks so many options and isn't buyer friendly.,2
5512,Epson very good there's no problem with this app at all,5
5513,The app is cool but it is to slow like I wish it had sum speed that would be nice ngl üò™üò™,3
5514,üíïüëçüèæüíØ,5
5515,Poor local resellers if not thieves wanting to get your Address. Offerup is not like it use to. Offers to many criminals invite. Sad to see this.,1

5518,So good always find what you want,5
5519,very cordial and honest.,5
5520,keeps freezing and crashing. to many ads,1
5521,"Super fun, find deals & sell stuff. Swap meet/Yard sale app",5
5522,Do not use this app. The sellers will lye to you and do a meetup and never show up. You'll expect OfferUp to help they do not care about you. I thought Facebook market was worst but in fact it is better!,1
5523,responsive and honest,5
5524,This app has become a headache! Takes forever to navigate and I don't get notifications when buyers are trying to contact me.,1
5525,This app sucks find a other place to sell your items. They canceled my account for supposedly selling illegal items but yet other people sell them and yet I had 4 pending transactions who knows if I'll even get paid my money.,1
5526,love it,5
5527,"Fun to place items for sale. But the merge has been disappointing. Lots of scammers inquiring.. Plus, competing with mayor stores is now not cool. Going Down the hill.. sad.. plus limited postings, sad.. and now they added commercials..",2
5528,Great!!,4
5529,"drawers are broken. when i asked if they work, Anthony told me they did.",1
5530,Horrible that you have a commercial/ad while using the app. So frustrating!,1
5531,"I am trying to log in to sell items, but seems like I need a bachalors degee to figure out how",1
5532,Ads in between searches? What the heck? Why? This app barely works as is. God forbid you try to add some filters to your search and it not working and then now ads?,2
5533,good,5
5534,people who sell things never respond so ots kinda useless if you cant get people to answer,1
5535,great,5
5536,I got scammedand and robbed. I reported the guy and OfferUp did nothing about it. This guy is still offering the item he scammed me with and robbing people and OfferUp allows it,1
5537,"This app sucks compared to the Letgo app. Terrible local seller support. Intrusive ads deceptively hidden amongst the actual items for sale. Horribly inaccurate search engine. UPDATE: OfferUp has come up with a new way to scam their viewers. The sponsored, paid-for ads no longer have the word ""sponsored"" displayed on the ad. Now it only has a teeny tiny arrow in the bottom right corner. The commercial ads now look EXACTLY the same as the actual sellers! BUYERS BEWARE!!!",1
5538,"GOOD Marketplace & getting great deals is commonplace! Buying & Selling is simple & effective! SOOooo... most of the battle won! Impressive! But the app $ERIOUSLy needs a MIRACLE-FILLED oVER-HAUL, ok? The UI is HORRIBLY slow & hard to navigate. WHY? Forced back to Thumbnail View everytime we change items? Next/Previous buttons pLEASe! Price ON Thumbnail NOW! - DON'T TALK-BACK! Speed issue KILLED a possible 5üåü Review. Fix it & DOMINATE! I BEG for a brighter green logo... Madness ensues.",4
5539,"This app stole my money. Do not sell through the app. I sold an item on April 2021 and I'm still unable to deposit my money to my account. I'm reporting this to the BBB and you all should do the same. It's 35 dollars, it may not be a lot for you but it is for me.",1
5540,I love it,5
5541,it's and easier way to buy what you need with precautions of course,5
5542,"MY ACCOUNT GOT BANNED JUST BECAUSE OFFER UP MFKRS WERE IN THEIR PERIOD, FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER, MY ACCOUNT, GONE,",1
5543,For a black couch I need a black couch use that couch can you show me,3
5544,This company shadow bans without warning. Your messages will all go unanswered and your items for sale will have zero views. There is no way to fix it. Support does not help. They will act as if nothing is wrong on their end when they know full well that your account is shadow banned.,1
5545,"App is trash, if you don't pay fee they won't post your add on the algorithm. I'll go back to Craigslist.",1
5546,not enough furniture,2
5547,The fact that they added forcing you to watch ads to ho back to the search results is crazy annoying. That change alone makes the app a 1 star experience.,1
5548,excelente,5
5549,good job,5
5550,"RE: I see no changes whatsoever. Even 2yrs later Algorithm here is awful! Intended for searching vs browsing. Does not sort/filter chronologically. Does not list ALL postings. Postings get buried quickly and merchandise QUICKLY goes unsold and forgotten about because of this, especially in urban areas. Because of algorithm, not everything pops up & often the same unwanted merchandise repeats. Old stale ads only displayed nearest you. Click on an item and that item becomes your primary algorithm",1
5551,"This app is full of scammers, wasting too much time, can't safely buy anything. OfferUp should seriously do something about it.",1
5552,My favorite local buying/selling app,5
5553,SICK,5
5554,For all the good there's twice as much bad. I've been ripped of several times and it's like whoever is in charge either condones it or gets a kick back because the issues growing and reporting scams doesn't work either.,2
5555,it's the best .,5
5556,good place to sell stuff and buy stuff plus have met some pretty Kool people on here,5
5557,Never trust offerup they take all your personal information and sale it to 3rd party Delete it from your phone üëéüëé,1
5558,very good app to sale and buy used stuff.,5
5559,Most post don't respond and when you make a report nothing happens it's just ignore a waste of time full of ads that get harder to skip even when your spending your hard earned money I'm sticking with Craigslist,1
5560,"I used to use offer up and sale alot of things, they changed it and add advertising and a monthly charge it's to slow for me, I need quick contacts I only buy off the app and rarely don't fix what's not broken..",1
5561,exelente,5
5562,Way too many ads for this kind of app.,1
5563,No one answers the customer service chat. Easy to get scammed,1
5564,"The ads are getting out of control, very repetitive, and completely irrelevant.",2
5565,Too many adds. App could use actual improvements but instead they just inserted adds for tik tok. Just use facebook marketplace instead. Very sad.,1
5566,most of the time I find what I'm looking for at a great price. üëç,5
5567,They want let me log in.it says I have to many accounts in this phone number .so frustrating and to top it off you can't talk to anyone to get some help,1
5568,"Charging people to use a classified app ad free is lame. App is slow, and why you can't see the prices of each ad is just dumb. Finally, it would be great if they would delete zombie ads that have been posted for over a year. I used to really enjoy this app when it first came out, now it is unsalvageable. RIP OfferUp...",1
5569,haven't sold anything but will see how it goes from here,5
5570,Great app,5
5571,"I think this ap sucks, constantly sending me safety-tip messages instead of sending any messages I write over 6 words.",1
5572,the 1 star Is because I was removed from offerup.for BS post.its been over 2years now I log in but when I send a message to someone asking if something is available they don't receive my messages. tested this theory out on a friend who has offerup sent him message and he never received it.also I can go through the whole process of taking pictures and writing a good description of what I'm trying to sell and then I post it and it does not post.you can not even dispute your removal from the site,1
5573,"Poorly designed app, now with fullscreen advertisement.",1
5574,it has a good parts and challenges overall I've made money where I wouldn't have before,1
5575,I enjoy Offerup way more then craigslist,5
5576,"Six years I have only good things to say about the app, I have had great success with it .from bikes to trading cards love it",5
5577,"Need to keep up with the scammers, too many criminals and fraud advertised here. I do like how the successful transactions go. Very easy",2
5578,They wouldnt let me buy anything because i had multiple accounts under one phone number and didnt notify me about anything. I lost multiple thing i was interested in beacause they didnt notify me,2
5579,no one awnsers,1
5580,awful,1
5581,They scammed me I bought a Xbox off someone and after I bought it he sold it to someone else and I been waiting days for my refund Im never ordering off of here again,1

5584,Easy to use!,5
5585,Love it,5
5586,Offerup is garbage watch out they are charging me $20.00 for apple music which I don't even have any apple devices! Watch out what you sign up they are very sneaky ready all the small print!!!,1
5587,Terrible! Asked you to contact me and you did nothing.,4
5588,slow slow slow and shuts down lags freezes,1
5589,There are so many spam and scammers. It's not worth your time.,1
5590,Would not let me ubsuscribe from emails,1
5591,Awesome app,5
5592,ITS OK. The search engine is horrendous as it doesn't save your search settings. I've messaged a few people and have gotten zero responses. Items aren't update I believe. Not really worth the time and hassle of trying to navigate this app.,1
5593,"unrelated products show up in specific searches, very annoying.",3
5594,"Used to be the best market place app. Long time user (from June 2016), but after the company bought let it go and started to be self focused rather that user focus the app is stupid slow and the pop up adds are extremely annoying. Reminds me of the early 2000s when you had to install pop up ad blockers. It's so bad I've switch to 90% use on Facebook marketplace. I get 10 to 1 hits on Facebook on my items over Offerup. Shame it went downhill.",1
5595,Looking for a car too many car dealerships on the app. Just trying to rip people off,1
5596,photos not really shared unless you buy the next level up,1
5597,Alot of just spammers. It's okay here and there but u will get alot that will message u and even when u message right away they will never answer back. They charge for everything after ur free post and even when u cancel they will remove ur post credits and not refund u such a scam.,2
5598,Super useful. Greatest thing ever.,5
5599,good customer service,5
5600,They think I'm rich,1
5601,Google Blazer good place to shop shop,5
5602,whether I'm selling or buying... Offer Up gets it done,5
5603,Randomly shadow bans me for no reason constantly even on new devices with new accounts . Makes no sense . Besides that the app is so freaking slow it's basically unuseable . Trash it and restart from scratch and you guys would have a 5 star app and be killing the game .,1
5604,"Excellent app for buying and selling! Organized, easy to peruse and search. Good communication methods. I kinda like that they warn you not to share phone numbers with people you don't know! I don't like them sending me emails about stuff they recommend. Gotta figure out how to opt out. Hey would be nice if they always put the price on each ad so you don't have to waste time clicking on it, trying to find out. Also nice if the filters would remember my settings. Been using it for years! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
5605,"Now, you have a ""Save search"" thing in the bottom corner that won't go away! I don't want to save a search, every, single, time! If I do, I'll save it! This and the ads constantly now, are really sealing the coffin on this app.",1
5606,Four stars only because my post where I tried selling my grandma got flagged as inappropriate. She was wearing clothes in most of her pictures. Totally biased moderaters on that app.,4
5607,"They enrolled me in a subscription after I asked them to cancel my free trial. They billed me and are hiding behind Google Play, both refusing to refund me. Feels like a scam.",1
5608,very friendly and very reasonable,5
5609,I've been using the app for quite some time now. I have not had any problems. I buy and sell things. I have no complaints.,5
5610,"Actually, this site is good other than the fees they charge. Kinda lame I have to pay taxes on stuff and then OfferUp taxes again. This goes with many sites. Creating a huge markup on items that should be affordable to purchase. Leaving no room for pocket change. Shame on you all.",4
5611,Posted my car and offer up took my posting off the platform for no reason,1
5612,"Sad the app cares more about ads and selling you top spot than people selling personal items like site used to be about. No no alerts ,is it available only, no mesgs no respect no real users now all scamm new accounts sad üò¢ not sure why i have mesgs with no alerts ..people buy other items before i get mesg at all looking without notice. But ads allways pop up. Unreal ..no alerts 10 mesg 2 days old great üëç",1
5613,easy,5
5614,Good app,4
5615,Worst app ever. It won't let me cancel a subscription after the free trial when the upgrade didn't even work!,1
5616,Trash. A shame LetGo turned into this.,1
5617,Good,5
5618,"Good buy and sell app, but now it has popup ads which are driving me away. I did not mind in the bottom, but now it is a full screen, and I have to find that x to remove it",3
5619,Worst selling site ever. They only promote people selling Jordans and will take your promotions money and deny you a promotion. Absolutely the worst place to sell,1
5620,"This app has gone way down hill. It's FULL of scammers and fake accounts. They want to sell and ""ship"" it to you and input a fake tracking number that says it was delivered the same or next day. They do this on most platforms but here 8/10 posts are them. When reported this company does nothing. Listings are not shown when you list them. No way to delete items. No verification system. People selling overpriced literal garbage and junk. Use the other apps!",1
5621,if i could give this negative star I would because of their upgrade i can no longer use this on my laptop. you suck offer up,1
5622,Good,5
5623,Good,5
5624,Finding great deals is what I enjoy!!,5
5625,"Wow, OfferUp went and put ads in their already horrible app, making it more useless than it was. There are all kinds of scams everywhere throughout this app! You have to make sure you're not dealing with some POS scammer when trying to buy/sell on here, which is hard to do because they're EVERYWHERE!!! On top of OfferUp NOT doing a damn thing about the obvious scams they allow, you now have to tolerate un-skipable ads they force on you while browsing through the posts. OfferUp is GARBAGE!!!",1
5626,great app to find local cheap tools for work etc,5
5627,love it,5
5628,Love it,5
5629,"Used to be okay, but absolutely unusable currently. It's the slowest app I've ever seen on a phone since apps existed.",1
5630,"OfferUp is an app that allows users to buy things. Sadly, many of the products sold in here are fake. I have reported many scammers on the app and they did nothing about it. OfferUp benefits from the scammers paying them to make their fake products show up",1

5632,On time and very nice.,5
5633,sold several items on Offer Up. Good market place,3
5634,so simple to post an item,5
5635,Ebdnutiy,1
5636,Many advertising,3
5637,Great app and easy to use!,5
5638,"I have no clue how this app got so popular. Why are ads not removed after a period of time? I've even reported those ads and they're still up months later. And how do you list an item for sale, then never respond to people??",1
5639,Love the Idea of an online marketplace to sell stuff. It is a frustrating way to sell stuff when people either don't read your ad or lowball you with some insulting offer besides that I love offer up. Now that I've learned to be patient and not sell an item until I get what im asking for it I've been very happy with offer up. The App can be weird sometimes. I'm not the most tech-savvy person so I'm not 100% sure if it's offered up or me or my internet connection or all the above,3
5640,LET'S GIT ER DONE,5
5641,good service and the product was great..,5
5642,"Sold my phone number to everyone on the planet! 50 spam calls a day starting 5 min. After loading app. And nothing on there but trash for sale. You would be better off lookin for stuff at the DUMP! DO NOT LOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT NONE STOP SPAM CALLS!,,,, 0 STARS",1
5643,ads not a good idea,1
5644,"Literally the worst marketplace app of them all. OfferUp used to be a respectable app to sell on, but over the last few years, this app has become a wretched hive of scum and villainy the likes of which the galaxy has never seen before! Every message you get is from Indian scammers asking for your phone number, email, address, etc. People (likely more bots) message you saying they'd like to buy something just to ghost you. They probably run this app out of a scam call center.",1
5645,"Great, everything on this application and prices are reasonable.",5
5646,i love it,5
5647,my account hasn't work for years,1
5648,Good app,5

5655,very good but I need access to the account,5
5656,never get the hits paid 14 dollars for what and then u want a 20 promo. very unlikely. after what this app put me through on many occasions.,1
5657,Extremely clumsy and slow,1
5658,No matter what I do with the settings for searching items. The app keeps showing items from several different states. Even after seeing the range and for local pick ups only. Please fix this issue.,1
5659,is blocking my customers.. not able to view and reply. I think offer up is putting pressure on me to buy premium.. not fair..,1
5660,I'm so freaking pissed I can belive this happend I took the 3 days for free but still to do that I pay $7.99 you guys took the money and delete my items I never had anybody reach at me explaining why sucks and not only that had the guts to send me a email telling me I won a 30 dollars card I check the address and that doesn't exist... kuddos keep up ripping people,1

5673,wonderfull,5
5674,I like offerUp,5
5675,Satisfactory with me!,5

5678,Your app is super slow,1
5679,good deals all the time.,5
5680,nothing but scammers on here,1
5681,like ebay and all the rest it's not the apps fault it's the sellers that will get you I never buy from any seller less than 99 % positive feedback,4
5682,Great site for the needy and underprivileged such as myself to get needful items the will increase quality of life for them and their families. GOD given and GOD inspired I do believe! GOD BLESS ALL WHOMAKE THIS POSSIBLE.,5
5683,I think offer up is great you sell fast and meet people with the same interest as me but now with the new system they have won't let me throw to sell anything anymore don't know what I'm doing wrong,5
5684,Letting businesses spam post,1
5685,"slowest app, period.",1

5691,"Decent app easy to use, I'm unsatisfied that I lucked out on $130 + $14.99 shipping because offer up isn't easy to help you file your claim for reimbursement after a seller never shipped my product. My little brother doesn't have that gift for Christmas. Not a big deal really, super disappointing. Money is tight like everyone else. I'm sharing my opinion on my experience because I don't want others to get disappointed if they're order got canceled like mine... past this. Offer up is a decent app",3

5696,"Update: Slowest interface on any device. Have to wait minimum of 3 seconds for each navigational command given (clicking on something) The delay is in every aspect of the app. What we are offering up is our TIME & I do not appreciate that, or the fact that the people using the system also waste people's time by not following through. Fake accounts are aplenty, spammers consistent, & the edit process has too many steps. Also, notifications do not come in unless the app is open & running. DNR.",1
5697,"Not bad, only as good as the people you meet here.",5
5698,It worked once before.,5
5699,"The service is great but the sellers? Don't trust ANY of them! Too many scammers and thieves. But the app is great and they do guarantee the deals. I only complained about 1 because it was for a lot of money. And they happily refunded my money. The other deals were nickle & dime deals not worth the trouble. Just be VERY aware, there are a lot of bad people who use this site!",5
5700,It is very good,5
5701,sucks,1
5702,Easy for scammers and offerup won't pull their listings so be careful!,1

5710,"Keeps showing me the same stuff. I've tried to purchase two items. Neither seller will respond. If I look at one bicycle, the app wants to just show me bicycles.",3
5711,just another app using clickbait. whatever,1
5712,No responses EVER! TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!,1
5713,Okay,5
5714,frigging ads have ruined this app!,2
5715,App sucks. Constantly dealing with the most unreliable people imaginable. I would suggest donating your stuff and saving your time and money. Response to OfferUp: I have sent several emails and reported many sellers and have never heard back. Not even once!,1
5716,It was a great place. But alright.,3
5717,App is not running correctly takes a lot of time to open,1
5718,prices for used items are more than the new prices,1
5719,grate stuff.good pricesd,5
5720,I Love Offer Up,5
5721,I'm now finding its a good idea to run a check of my 'Wishlist' items through a search on Offer Up first. I've found some great bargains and deals. And have been able to execute rather smoothly in exchange with sellers on purchases so far!,5
5722,"I love it, just even browsing and window shopping is fun, can't wait to start getting rid of junk and get extra cash",5
5723,Great,5
5724,great way to sell old stuff!,5

5729,This app is trash. Do not download it do not use it buyer beware! I tried to sell a truck on it and signed up because it will not allow you to sell cars without signing up and this thing charged me for months before it would finally stop. These people are straight up criminals.,1
5730,"Update: app is even worse....ad comes up full screen and freezes the program. Also, no way to set default to local only i constantly have to click the button to keep it on local. Stupid design.",1
5731,offer up is basically the same as Marketplace which is attached to Facebook: you can use filters to see items tailored to you. i like that. i consider offer up superior to messager because depending on your device you may have to log in. I don't like that,5
5732,"Purchased Microphone Stand..when got home, tried to put mic through it, I saw the clasp to hold the Microphone was brokenüò§",1

5734,Still a big L for this shi feature. Still get the email before I ever get your message notifications. - When people message me to buy my items I never get the notifications. But you want to annoy me with what other people are selling and I always get those. And why put the messages and the notifications together and get peoples hopes up that may have some money on the way? Hate this app.,1
5735,"Scammers plague this app. Too many too good to be true, stolen, or users asking to pay them through cashapp/venmo/zelle and then never sending the item. Best part? The scammers can rate your account so if you confront them they'll bring your own trustworthyness rating down.",1
5736,good platform,5
5737,good way to sell things,5
5738,Good üëç,5
5739,"The amount of scammers on this platform is ridiculous. Tried to make 5 purchases with their purchase protection and every seller refused to ship through it. These sellers should all be verified before they are allowed to post with purchase protection, I reported these sellers and their accounts are still active a week later. Uninstalled, cannot trust buying anything through this app.",1
5740,it's great,4
5741,awesome service I use it offen,5
5742,easy to navigate and so far honest people,5
5743,"Does anyone even exist on this app?? I've been using it for the past 4 months and haven't gotten a single response back from anyone I've messaged. All I get is ""Seen"" everytime I send a message. How can someone post something for sale and NOT WANT TO SELL IT??? i dont understand. The design is also annoying, its weird to navigate. And I hate the ads that just thrown in the middle of the listings.",2
5744,This app sucks. You can purchase something and have it shipped because they want you to scan your card and that thing doesn't even work,1
5745,It tells you to scan your card and when you try to scan your card it doesn't work. It's a headache,1
5746,"Use it however you want, but watch out with getting the premium subscription for ""$8/mo"". I tried to buy it to sell a car, but the app froze out and didn't give me the premium. Surprise surprise it's been charging me the $8/mo PLUS $21/mo in fees or something. Good luck using chat support too. Best to just email them, and their team on emails is good ngl. Their system software is just low quality also ngl",1
5747,"I hate all mfers who price things for one dollar,who never intended to sale for that price",4
5748,trash,1
5749,"It's one of my few bad reviews. I got kicked, and I don't know why. I followed their rules. If I didn't, I'd love to know why, but I didn't really sell anything for a profit through them anyway, just massive losses. There are better apps, and I feel as though after getting banned, they are untrustworthy. I wouldn't trust this company. Use ebay.",2
5750,"Used to be decent. Now to many ads, messages are sometimes slow in sending and receiving.",1
5751,App is horrible I had a great seller rating selling all my garage and house hold items and was banned for posting an item they did agree on? Unjust!,1
5752,aight,5
5753,great opportunities,5
5754,"Great idea.... awful in reality. First off you MUST give them a card number. No insulating yourself with PayPal or venma etc. Nope. You must give them a card. The site is clunky and won't auto fill any information, address included. To sign up, you create credentials. Then verify them. Them get the app. Then retype your credentials. Then verify. By the time I was half way thru this process I lost interest in the product.",1
5755,its slow and it sucks,1
5756,goog app,5
5757,"Seller deactivated her account after purchase So close to Christmas after I asked multiple times if it was gonna come before Christmas, she assured me that it would and I have nothing to worry about. I check to see if she shipped it yet only to find out she deactivated her account. I would think that offer up would've let me know about the situation, it's the least they could've did. Then to right the wrong they could've offered a gift card or free shipping or something but no, customer service",1
5758,"my only issue with this app is how slow it is, other than that it's all good",4
5759,"DONT USE THIS APP unless you are ok with it spying on you. I have reason to believe this app is reading my private text messages and using my mic to listen and personalize results. Certain things pop up in my homepage Ive never searched on the app. Items I have discussed with people in private messages, aloud with my phone beside me or searched on other sites that suddenly become relevant results on this app. Customer support is an A.I. bot that is NOT HELPFUL!",1
5760,Great,5
5761,lots of viewer's,5
5762,too many ads and notifications about searches I did not want to be notified about,2
5763,awesome items,5
5764,Been trying to install the app for about an hour won't let me on I was tired of it I don't care anymore I've been trying to get on it for an hour or more doing everything else we're getting on the app itself put in all the information t text me and let me know what's going on and I already have account already have and it wasn't there when I went back on the phone so then I got to reinstalled and I've been fooling around with it for a long time ago and it doesn't let me know how to get back,5
5765,fair,5
5766,Ytkyo I got i,1
5767,this app made me thousands of money in another account,5
5768,"Have you realized why your subscription rate was dropped a lot? When I tried to subscribe, it shows me a different email login. I suspect this app steals information from my phone otherwise it shouldn't know my another email.",1
5769,"I paid $19.99 for a single item promotion, then offed up suspended my account. I would not use offer up ever again. they are thieves as far as im concerned. when i tried to find out why they would not explain, and still kept my money. they are not my source for doing internet sales. I would rather put things on Craigslist. At least they are not two-faced hypocrites that know their platform is for buying and selling, not to regulate by stealing from people that use it for what it was meant for.",1
5770,App doesn't allow you to delete sold or deactivated listings. You can only archive them. Why can't you delete them?? Also app does a terrible job of notifying you through push notifications that you've received a message from a potential buyer causing you to reply late and potentially miss a sale. Still no update. Wish I could give it 0 stars. Mercari is 1000 times better.,1
5771,Continuously digging for more permissions and personal information.,1
5772,This was a good way to sell products. Whenever I first found the app years ago. But now it is not easy and gives you people that are not in your area. So it is not a very good app. To use these days.,2
5773,"Almost was a good app,until they failed themselves and tinkered with a system that was quiet easy to use. Now it,s all screwy...hard to open,which leads to misconception to the seller as well as the buyer...their rating was 8.7....now about üò´5.2....with loss of professionalism....too bad !they could have been somebody ,they could have been a CONTENDER !",5
5774,These people don't respond too much when I asked for a item I get an answer within 2 to 3 weeks and it's sold already I think it's a automated set up,2
5775,App is really bad and full of ads,1
5776,bunch of scammers. bad service from the app management. many ads. just a horrible app,1
5777,great,5
5778,"Most annoying app on the market.. will randomly send notifications, for stuff i looked for weeks ago.. so many notifications, i disabled notifications.. apparently so does everyone, message someone about an item.. and never hear back (says they haven't even seen the message/ offer).. pointless! better off on Craigslist.",1
5779,"Posted bedroom set for sale, doesn't show up in listings.",1
5780,"Complete trash. They don't care about people wasting your time. Instead they say: ""If you...still don't get an answer, we're sorry, but we don't contact users to ask them to reply to offers or requests for information."" They could have thousands of inactive users that you message and they don't care...as long as you keep seeing and clicking on their sh!++y deceptive revenue making ads. I highly recommend buying elsewhere...Ebay, Amazon, Temu, Wish...anything would be better.",1
5781,Ok why isn't there not a delete feature on the app. I have to out make sold for some item I decided to keep? It annoying. And if the app thinks I make more then 600 dollars at the end of the year. I have to pay taxes on item I donated or kept. Fix this please.,3
5782,Well I hope it's as good as trying something let's see if I sell anything,5
5783,"Can't cancel subscription, horribly deceptive!",1
5784,This app is good in terms of selling. Otherwise it's the slowest app I've ever seen the most basic tasks take forever it's so annoying it drives me insane makes no sense,2
5785,You guys allow to many scammers I lost money and the same scammer have like 150 pages more than other sales apps,2
5786,Thank you offer up and to the people I am sorry for what's I didz. Oops ok m actually sorry tho,5
5787,"Used to be great. Now I get pop up video ads when I try to exit the app and all the items for sale are broken up by ""premium"" accounts and more ads. Deleted when they sold out.",2
5788,"There are so many opportunities to buy local, it's unfortunate that pricing is not as negotiable as it could be. The items I have purchased have been in excellent condition and the sellers have been easy to work with on meetings.",5
5789,Nothing ever sells on this site.,2
5790,Used to be one of the best apps back when there was no ads. Now there even trying to charge you to post something that is crazy this will probably be the last time I use this app it's horrible now,1
5791,I'm very happy with it.,5
5792,"Terrible app to use, slow, sluggish and poor ui. Too much ads as well. I find it impossible to post my listings, pictures always seem to confuse the app.",2
5793,Very good,5
5794,makes drama come true when u r able to help connect others with a rare item which would have taken a long time and energy to find,5
5795,I wish it was easier to get to my watched items. It's too many steps in the current app update to easily see the items I wish to possibly buy,3

5802,Haven't had a bad experience yet,5
5803,"Do yourself a favor and don't rely on greedy companies like this to buy or sell, there are others with better customer service. This app is FULL of ads basically forcing you to pay for a service that doesn't increase experience whatsoever, I paid 20 dollars to ""boost"" my listing, it hardly boosted anything I got like 5 more views per month for that service and when I went to cancel the service they make it near impossible, and when asked for a refund they decline. They can't afford to refund 20",1
5804,love the fast response,5
5805,"I just canceled subscription, but it's not canceled because it's good for year and application isn't showing I have it. Signed up for year and it won't show in app. Have sent email to offer up and no one answers.",1
5806,"No one has bought anything, and I've posted great stuff; brand new or very lightly used. no one is buying anything",1
5807,Tight,5
5808,This app no one is responding or buying my items ! December 2023 this app is still dysfunctional !! No one looks at Offer Up so no one buys my items !! And i tried to delete or relist and your app is a royal screw up ! Nothing responds ! And you do not read what i actualy typed !,1
5809,It seems like a dead app with literally zero activity,1
5810,Thank you Florio !! Florio was able to confirm item was still available. He was flexible with scheduling a time for me to pick-up the item. The item was as explained in the sale add posted. Florio is honest & friendly. He was helpful to accommodate my days busy schedule. He held the item for me and even negotiated a great price for me.,5
5811,Very nice app to sell items that you don't need no more,5
5812,"i feel that when i post, i don't have a lot of views",4
5813,Never had such a bad time in trying to search for items I've been looking for.,4

5815,love it!,5
5816,Keeps removing my posts even though I dont have any of the same listings,1
5817,The stole my Playstation and offer dint do anything for reimbursement,1
5818,"This app controls your listings in a way that urges the seller to pay for the service. Otherwise, nobody will see your listing",1
5819,"This app is okay at best. It's nothing like craigslist where you can easily find and search for regular people selling their items. craigslist has a feature to weed out the retail people which offer up seems to be loaded with. I wish OfferUp would offer a search engine that can weed out new retail stores and car dealers. lots of people kicking tires on this site so it's hard to sell an item and take somebody serious. I miss ""Let Go app"" as it worked much better with their search engine",2
5820,"It's fine but they added full screen ads which are awful. Also, ""blocking"" a user doesn't hide that user's posts from your search alerts. If that user pays to promote then you will be forced to look at their posts.",1
5821,"great people working in there, they went over the limit to help me, my tier blew up and they went to pick up my bad tier,they went back to their shop,installed a new tier and they went back to put the tier back on my truck all of this for free and I went to their shop to change the rest of the tiers in my truck, this is what you can call great service",5
5822,"Not a great app what the heck happened? It used to be a great app some years ago. Iv been useing forever. It's slow it lags it really sucks (SORRY) BUT ITS THE TRUTH.

Today is the 18th. I didn't get the package nor did the package get shipped. On top of it I sent multiple messages to the seller and got no response in return. I'm soo pissed üò° and will never use this app again. I recommend for others not to trust this app and purchase ANYTHING AT ALL.",1
5826,She was very flexible with pickup time and even held the item for me an extra 2 days.,5

5829,slow and laggy and doesnt save settings,1

5834,Awesome thanks,5
5835,"App sucks. Messaging constantly says 1 new, looked online seeing its a problem for years. Almost no buyers, many sellers. Heavy pressure to buy premium for no reason. In app ads in lists. No bio option. Big, big downgrade from Letgo. Terrible location options, constantly resets with opening of app. Used about a month, sold nothing. Sold nearly everything on CL instead in half time. App permissions overly invasive, i.e. mic use, last website viewed etc. Glitch with camera and media permissions.",1
5836,awesome üòé,5
5837,"Buyers are horrible! they are clueless on negotiating, disrespectful with communications, slow to respond, uncourteous to reply back if they don't wanna buy, want your address right away, leave ya hanging & are a bunch of ""JACKASSES""!",1

5839,No comments,5
5840,Great safety alerts I didn't think of. Awesome App for shipping options included. Thanks.,5
5841,Used to be simple and awesome back when it comes as just letgo. Now forget about it. Full screen ads and having to pay just to get early dealsüôÑ uninstalled and using fb marketplace,1
5842,stuff on offerup can be months old...,3
5843,"Terrible app, was better when it was just letgo, I've posted a listing and it has 0 views for the fact the app doesnt want to make it viewable, i had a buddy try searching my listing word for word, nothing came up, nothing will sell on this app and the lags and ads are terrible, should've let letgo do their own thing",1

I hate it.... only thing I hate more is FB marketplace. Update 12/23 - this app is useless. It takes so dang long to refresh listing. Is there not an easier way to repost items without absolutely doing event again? Oh except the title.... that's helpful. I hate this dang app. It seems to have completely died.",1
5846,great way to sell,5
5847,"getting worse everyday. now there is ads everywhere, full screen pop up ads, paid memberships, sponsored items, delivery only items after specifically selecting local only. this app is a garbage fire that has almost fully burned.",1

5850,I love Offer Up I'm glad The creators made a Great App To buy and sale,5
5851,to many adds now and the old version was more striaght forward. I'll just uninstall,1
5852,sucks,1
5853,Offeruo is a shady company!1 They take your payments even though you've shipped the items and deactivates your account based on their random bogus policies. They should be reported to the Better Business Bureau!,1

5858,great app actually my favorite app to use but they need to fix the lagging probably hands down slowest app ever created,1

You guys still have not emailed me back and I've emailed you three times with the transaction number now! different times now! What is up with you guys? That's around $80 I'm waiting for now!,1

5875,App is so Terrible. Unable to upload photos to post. Tried 6 different postings and still unable to upload photos. Tried 20 times each to upload and nothing.Then I have postings removed for no reason and they use the policy nonsense as a cover up. I never post anything that is against their policies. Hypocrites this app sucks. Have disabled my account and am done for good.,1

5877,"good for buying and selling without resorting to the evil of facebook, but be prepared for super annoying new message"" push notifications you can't turn off that are just stupid ads or ""new thing you might be interested in"". also having to sift past the paid ads to get to actual posts is really annoying. check the posting dates, because there is zero moderation of dead posts from years ago.",2
5878,"From ok, to bad, to worse, to terrible, to worthless. Now you have to pay to see new listings. Now, people who can afford to pay get to save more money than those who can't afford to pay.

5933,I used OfferUp before yrs ago but my first day back I did everything it said to do and when it's almost finished then it starts uploading pictures it get to 3 out of 5 then says sorry didn't load try again. I do it again it does it again I do it again it say 5 out 8 then says pics don't load try again so I did then I'm like to myself I'm not doing this stupid stuff again I don't have the doggone patience the hell with this ! So I uninstalled the app . I rate this 1 star,1
5934,"I had an account for about 2 years, had 80+ 5-star reviews, and without warning, my entire account and page were deleted. I have given OfferUp so much money in sales, I'm definitely NOT risking a random account deletion again",1
5935,"Used to be a good app but now it's just terrible. Listings that would have sold before, now getting removed. Nice job.",1
5936,no responses,2
5937,I love this app. THANKS!,5
5938,i had to uninstall it. OfferUp is slowly killing themselves with all these ads.,1
5939,great app just wish I could sell something's on it,5
5940,"great experience, no complaints.",5
5941,"easy way to communicate with buyers and sellers, the rating of users makes it more trust worthy to make up your transaction decision",5
5942,"It's an okay app to buy and sell because it's highly popular. Unlike other buy and sell apps this one does not allow service ads. But don't worry they won't catch you and they don't seem to care much because there are some that been up there for over a year! Just don't try to to promote your ad with payment because they'll see it's a service ad and and remove it. Through my experience, try to get a refund, you have to go to Google to get your money back!",1
5943,Very good app üëç,5
5944,"OfferUp was always a great site/app for buying and selling items. However, with their update, they have become greedy and overrun the app with ads. They only way to stop the ads is by paying a heafty $7.99/monthly subscription! How obsurd. I will stop using the app, and go back to ebay and fb marketplace. Way to lose a lot of users by becoming another greedy company!",1
5945,"great to sell items, easy and efficiently!!!",4
5946,I can't wait to delete this from my phone it sucks,1
5947,When entering a specific item to search for you may get 20 out of 30 or other items not related to what you originally were looking for distracting and time-consuming I don't like this at all reluctant to use,2
5948,encuentras todo lo que necesitas a buen precio,5
5949,It's a joke....I can't post anything on this appüí© and ask you to pay for posting second items???!!!!!,1
5950,"Easy, safe, and convenient.",5
5951,awesome,5
5952,I've had nothing but good experiences with offer up and people I've sold to and bought from.,5
5953,"new updates have extremely intrusive full screen ads that you can't escape from, have to restart app constantly and redo searches",1
5954,My offer up not working,2
5955,great app,5
5956,Great,5
5957,Good place to find deals.,5
5958,I want to represent OfferUp and letgo buy and sell to all my friends and family this is the best website to be able to sell items and receive items thank you for helping us families out with everything I would like to tell everyone across the world about you all OfferUp,5
5959,"Too many intrusive ads. Pop up ads, in-page ads, promoted ads. I'd happily pay $2 for an ad-free browsing experience, but I'm not given that option. No faster way to turn me away from a service.",1
5960,loafs super slow...not my phone it's the app!,2
5961,it is a horrible experience using this app compared to a year ago. they have shoehorned in so many ads and irrelevant results it's literally irritating to even open,1
5962,"Lots of products, seller replies a bit slow.",4
5963,Good,5
5964,best ever,5
5965,Too many ads on the free version. And bad management of sellers as a lot of the listings are not available anymore or mispriced.,2
5966,"Garbage application with a garbage user base. Makes you reselect pictures when reposting for no reason. Makes browsing photos to put on a post painful for no reason. Makes reposting itself painful for no reason. Constantly tries to upsell you on post promotion and shipping. Bad optimization. And worst of all, this app killed LetGo via a merger. Bottom line: this app is a nightmare for serious users such as myself. I have been using it for years and it has singlehandedly driven me insane.",1
5967,Keeps changing my location so nobody knows my item's are in there area ü§¨,1
5968,Great site to sell!,5
5969,"Looking for something to buy, click to see the product then I click back to go see more, boom video ad pops up! Ruined my will to ever use this app ever again! I'm better off using Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.",1
5970,This App is Great it's Quick and easy to understand easy to post easy to communicate with sellers and buyers. No bank account needed,5
5971,Overall pretty good. Liked it better when they had clear categories to browse.,4
5972,this is the slowest performing app I've ever used. even on different phones it's so excruciatingly slow. I hate it.,2
5973,I love it and it's free üÜì and new beginnings of my personal life hobbies to choose to connect with the people that are doing... stepping out on faithful promises of the Lord Jesus Christ holy unchanging Hands of increase...,5
5974,Great for buying or selling.,5
5975,The intrusive full screen pop up adds you cant clear for a long period of time really make me want to quit using this spp.,3
5976,I'm l .,4
5977,I never searched for any other suggestions you guys give me and you suggest the most uninteresting that I would never use you should pay,1
5978,Was great just getting back on,4
5979,very friendly app,5
5980,great app to find things you're looking for and something better,5
5981,app doesn't let me sale my items and they close accounts unjustified and when requested for review there is no answer,1
5982,Do not download this at all OfferUp is full of nothing but a bunch of scam artists trying to rip you off. I repeat do not ever buy anything off this POS platform,1
5983,Buyers are wishy washy,3
5984,wish prices were shown without having to click on item,3
5985,"Cant offer up labor, but you can post a job opening, Super lame",1
5986,You guys went and trashed a good site with adds that pop up now.....what are you guys thinking...the adds on the page I understand but now every time I go to contact someone it asked me to download tic tok or some other dumb app thanks for ruining a good thing,1
5987,good place to shopping at,5
5988,This was my favorite app to use to buy and sell used items. Now it has become so saturated with ads that it is unusable. Pay $8 a month to get what you used to have for free? As if other free alternatives don't exist? Good luck,1
5989,"Poorly designed app, and (very) tedious to navigate. It's generally better to use the website (in desktop mode) for browsing items. Search 'functionality', in both the website and app, doesn't work properly, and items that match your search criteria may not show up in the results. (Also, there should at least be the ability to select 'favorite' categories - which are then easily selectable with a single press from the app home screen.) It's a bit baffling to see these issues years later.",1
5990,great app content but not very good app itself due to it shutting off at random times while I'm scrolling through items...,3
5991,It's not posting my items I never see them post .so I don't think it's a good app I'm disappointed on this app,1
5992,slow,3
5993,Okay,3
5994,Good stuff,5
5995,Staying 1 star until they stop forcing adds. I'll delete this app so quick if you force whole-screen adds,1
5996,Great,5
5997,"Like Facebook marketplace, less than 1% actually buy anything, and prices are a steal. Can't turn a profit on it, so don't waste your time. They should make potential buyers actually take the time to type you a real message instead of making it easy for people to sit there and click a million times ""is it available "" then they ghost you 99.99% of the time. That will do away with all the lazy window shoppers. Such a HUGE waste of time!!!!",2
5998,you can always find what u need,5

6004,I've had a great experience buying and selling and I'm a fan.,5
6005,Slow I can't sell.,1
6006,the scooter sold quickly,5
6007,Everyone posts their items as free just for more traffic to the posts.,2
6008,Slow. Slow. Slow! Not only that but the people on this app are worse than FB marketplace... And you're restricted from posting certain things for sale. You know it sucks when you see things that were posted for sale YEARS ago.,2
6009,Cant recieve messeges this sucks iveouldnt recommended it at all,1
6010,I've found so much at this site for the little home we bought. which hadn't been upgraded since it was built 50 years ago. We've found much of what we needed or just plain could use--from those who had no need from it any longer and have met a lot of wonderful folks in doing so.,5
6011,"Used to be ok about 4 years ago. Now its only businesses that advertise. And to add insult to injury, now you have to watch ads, so that you can view ads.",1
6012,OfferUp always has an annoying pop up that asked me if I want to pay to promote my listing no I don't it also somehow thinks that I need LED headlights and gives me notices when they become available and I cannot clear this it is annoying I don't want pop-up headlights I don't want those notices and I don't want you to ask me if I want to promote my listing across the country and having to cross out those screens every single time is a nuisance,1
6013,great deals you can always make an offer,5
6014,"Had a broken item shipped to me and offerup didn't give me a choice to report it broken. They charged my bank and now I'm just out $175 and a broken item. I've used this app for years and it's just been going down hill. So if you buy something you better hope it works or you're out of luck according to offerup. Update: so I've tried using this app again and the ads promote these CLEARLY scam sites. Like ""$99 (enter $900 graphics card)!!!"" What the hell offer up?",1
6015,All the sudden my items are getting zero views. I've emailed to find out what's wrong and no one has responded. Looking for another app to sell my items.,1
6016,you let scammers scam on here,1
6017,"I'm so disappointed in this app. Back when it was let go and free, it was good, but now they just steal your money. I stopped using and paying for this app. Somehow, they were still able to pull the money off my card even tho I had already unsubscribed to paying monthly. I never was able to sell my sons baby things on the app and I sold everything else where. No need to pay since I haven't used it in months. Yet I'm charged $30 I'm a single mother being robbed. I contacted them. They don't care!",1
6018,Good app,4
6019,"Send your personal info to another company in a different 5 eyes country ... no. This isn't even an issue of ""they could be hacked some day"" this means they will share your info across the water to federal spy programs.",1

6035,Nothing but good reviews from my end,4
6036,"There is no order, it's too crowded.",4
6037,not useful anymore,1
6038,"When this application started I tried it and since then I had no problem, but it has grown and comes with shipping, for me it was 5 stars it seems unfair that it now has announcements, that should be for new ones and buying by shipping is not safe They sold me something that I didn't ask for and the seller found a way not to return my money by deactivating his account and the offer up service never returned my call or message, lately the application is a bit slow but everything else is fine",3
6039,A fun way to brouse and shop,5
6040,My experience was awesome,5
6041,great app... fast responses from sellers N safe environment,5

6044,I don't think it's the but internet being slow I believe if the internet was fixed running properly in the air would be a lot better so I got to say it's the internet itself mom please with the app,3
6045,trying to work with it,2
6046,bot spam sucks,3
6047,lame response times no one responds to any ads I think it's a bunch of fake fake fake adds to make them look like they have users,1
6048,Loaded with ads from busimess',1
6049,"Adds are out of control, commercial sellers are everywhere. This app is useless unless you wanna give away furniture to the folks south of the border.",1

6069,easy to use. it helps keep the scammers at bay. I've been using this app for about a year and I have no complaints,5
6070,Never sell anything on this app. It's been 14 days since I sold something shipped a xbox. 11 days since it's been delivered and still waiting to get paid. Customer service is garbage. No wonder this was a bust years ago. It's not seller friendly. Good luck! I will be contacting the better business bureau!,1
6071,They have no problem listing advertisements with their real listings of things people are selling. There's no warnings or anything to clarify this and then they do absolutely nothing when you get ripped off for almost $100. Thanks for helping scammers OfferUp.,1

6093,offer up kindness and all of your wishes come true. SWAK,5
6094,spend way too much time answering stupid questions from people or scammers who have no intention of actually purchasing anything. It's just a waste of time.,1
6095,"OfferUp customer service is worthless. I recently sold something and shipped it. The buyer changed their mind and they used the 2day buyer protection. Well that was 3 weeks ago and the ""buyer"" still has my item, i havent been paid. I have ZERO UPDATES. Havent recieved a tracking number. No updates. Nothing. And customer service is doing absolutely nothing to help me get my item back. I believe the buyer is planning on keeping my item and not paying.",1
6096,"They delete items up for sale for no good reason at all. There's absolutely 0 reason for them to say a red dot can't be sold on their site. I didn't need to sell it on offerup but I figured I'd try just to see what they were like... Just stick with eBay I know I'm going to. These people are anti American, that's the only reason I can come up with to keep people from selling something as innocuous as a red dot that can be used on any number of things like crossbows and airsoft üñï",1
6097,Great medium for both Seller & Buyer.,5
6098,convenient for the lifestyle I live,5

6103,User friendly. Nice people,5
6104,"Terrible moderation practices. Half the stuff on this site is a scam. Beware anything that needs shipped, especially big items.

I asked to tell me which item and what the hell are they saying, I would like to dispute and discuss this incorrect information. To end up having the bot repeat and not explain what I did or whatever. NO customer service or ANY type of employee to discuss an issues!",1
6109,"Great notifying me of questions about, my things to sell",5
6110,"Listings no longer show when it was put up for sale. This is the biggest issue worse than seeing intrusive ads. There are now intrusive ads that I CANNOT back out of! Whenever ads pop up, the back button doesn't work and I have to exit the app.",1
6111,"ads everywhere. even ones you can't even see that will be loud if you have your phone up. they got greedy and have a pay to ""win"" style system where you see things 30 minutes faster than others. overall, the site has changed and gets worse by the day.",1

6120,this was a purchase of a lifetime everything so good and the container is in great shape with no flaws I highly recommend from my experience,5
6121,I'm enjoying my selling experience! thanks offer up.,5
6122,"App doesn't post listing, paid, no support, useless will be getting bank to reverse the charge.",1
6123,Removes reported listings without actual review. They say there is a review. That can't be true because you wouldn't have removed a fruit tree listing for being a food item. Especially when it says the item is not yet fruiting... 1 star for wasting my time. You are ignorant!,1
6124,excellent!,5
6125,"Was just all rounding great interaction, I was very pleased and was just a pleasure to do business with. I would love to do it again",5
6126,"Pleas fix seach engine!! I updated the app and when I search for any item's its showing stuff from far away. I have the setting correct and even hit the ""pick up only"" and still get items from other states and far locations. Please fix. This is the best buying and selling app but shouldn't have this problem.",5
6127,"App is now overrun w/ excessive ads...Most sellers don't respond to questions of a posted item. The app redirects you automatically from your inbox to home with more ads from ad revenue than posted items from users of this app. Additionally, OfferUp always tries to get you to upgrade for ""quicker/instant messaging"" and paying to ""promote your item(s). The app is merely A WASTE OF TIME. Mostly fraudulent or sketchy responses when you do get a response for an item. I will be deleting OfferUp",1
6128,This used to be a decent app but now they want you to pay to list things. There are way too many flaky people on this app to justify paying to list anything because they don't hold them accountable for not showing up or ghosting in messages.,2
6129,love it,5
6130,"Very Bad Experience with Offer Up Paid for a monthly subscription (Promote Plus) and when I went to check why my item wasn't selling fast and if my item I was selling was being Promoted!

The only reason I even include the app on my phone is to be able to communicate with potential buyers sellers... To actually be useful, they will need to revamp the search results formatting...

6135,Waste of time list anyting if you ever get a call it'll be a scammer or someone that wants to offer you $10 for your hundred dollar item . Not to mention the Molasses slow app that lets you list maybe two things in an entire day. But then again it's your time use it anyway you want. Oh yeah and it doesn't show all of the ads that you search for I know people that advertise and always have advertised but they don't show up when I search for the products good luck,1

6158,great way to sell items easy to use,5
6159,Lots of people get shadow banned (meaning messages are sent but never read) and if they reach out to support they just ban the account. They just did it to my friend after like 3 days. She didn't even buy anything yet or list anything for sale so there was nothing to ban her for.,1

6165,-0 customer service -The app designers can't figure out basic stuff for years. -Easy to get scammed on. -Much better options out there - I had this moron coming at me trolling and I got banned for telling him off. Clueless administration/modding.,1
6166,good nice job,5
6167,love it!!!,5
6168,No se vende na,1
6169,"Prices are NOT shown so you always have to click on the listing first to see how much it is; so much time wasted when you're trying to shop. You always have to approve/deny joining their stupid subscription when you list an item like augh again so much TIME WASTED!!! Plus messaging part hardly works properly, keeps saying I have 4 messages but I don't see anything. There's no way to delete listings. This app definitely needs a lot of improvements.",1
6170,fun to find lots of things,4
6171,great,5
6172,items never sell or even hey views,1
6173,wonderful app..a gift,5
6174,I've been using this App since 2018. I love it!. Thank You for your services... excelent Job.,5
6175,Great,5
6176,A little cluttered,3
6177,Uses way too much storage and is not worth even trying,2
6178,No complaints. Working good üëç,4
6179,Perfect,5
6180,Not usable just so many ads. Takes the joy out of looking for stuff,1
6181,"have made a lot of extra money on here,not to mention some very wonderful people to,,and still have nice working relationships with many of them!",5
6182,has become horrendous with adds and the filtering options when searching for cars are just as bad,2
6183,I've tried many times to buy stuff but the offers always expire. Sellers fault not OfferUp though.,1
6184,Seems to work OK at time but I have had more than a few instances where I could not receive feedback from others nor leave feedback for them. Frustrating PLUS no customer service phone line available in order to remedy any such issues.,4
6185,"Horrible app, people just tell you to meet up and never show up, but when you report it doesnt do anything, not a safe or secure place to sell or buy, this app just wastes time, DO NOT BUY",1
6186,says my phone number is being used with too many accounts. Would love to use the app but can't.,1
6187,Recently been logged out and can't get back in had another account for years did everything according to the guidelines and rules this is BS 1 star and that's pushing it,1
6188,"Dee is an amazing seller! Her items are of high quality. Good communication ad prompt delivery! Thanks, Dee! So nice to meet you!",5
6189,I love it,5
6190,This is the worst app ever. I just downloaded the app and it doesn't let me send messages to sellers. What's the point of this app? Offer up should be removed.,1
6191,Unusable when you choose photos for your post. Tha loading is so slow that it slows down your phone significantly. (My phone is UFS 4.0),1
6192,"I used to love this app. It was straight to the point, no paid promotion type content, and everyone was treated equally. Now, they push their 'premium' accounts heavily, the app is bloated, listings from five years ago are still coming up in the search results, and they will ban accounts for no reason, without giving any reason. I will actively be trying to get another marketplace type app more popular, because offerup needs competition to improve.",1
6193,so far it's great,5
6194,Muy bueno,5
6195,"This app is terrible. It's filled with scammers, pawn stores,and garbage Amazon Walmart ads in between. When you finally use it, it honestly tells you your messaging is THROTTLED unless your using premium, so it actively interferes when you actually try do anything. There's absolutely no reason to use this. It's complete trash. In before some garbage copy pasta customer service response, don't @ me.",1
6196,Prices are idiotic,1
6197,"""Purchase Complete"" yet seller can just ignore. Why the hell would anyone use this app? App states that Buy Now option will automatically be accepted, provides a Shipping method, but then the seller can still reject the Buy Now and treat it like an ""offer""",1
6198,great app,5
6199,nobody sends the items they are selling...this place is the worst. you do get your money back,1
6200,sooo good,5
6201,you know what I have sold things on a professional level for a great number of yrs now and there is only one app that I trust to move my merchandise and that is OfferUp.thank you for keeping it free God bless you all.,5
6202,Can't wait until I can find something I want,5
6203,app slows down to much.,3
6204,Locked me out of messages because it says my phone is associated with other accounts when it's not. Help desk is not responsive. Supposed to meet someone and can't contact them to tell them the situation.,1
6205,The app was better when it was only let go I sold a lot of things then now with this app I can't sell nothing it's a bunch of spoiled people on this app that try and low ball you also when they say that they want to buy the item they never respond back after that. This app sucks,1
6206,Nice people & easy to communicate...,5
6207,"Hate all the ads! You think someone is trying to contact you, and you log in to find it's only an ad on something you looked at. Now, there are also women with their tongues out wanting you to contact them. it's a shame. I used to really like it.",2
6208,Won't let anybody browse or anything without trying to make us buy right away I got tired of it and deleted you,2
6209,Found my Bluetooth speaker on there for way cheaper than the stores thank you offer up,5
6210,same old offer up no communication . I have or had a post for a car. After a day or two didn't look right. it was a 2011 BMW 535ix 90k miles I got 11 looks and I was 8 of them. I was trying to see if the thing was working. Never got a answer or even a phone call. Canceled it finally after a week or two. With less than 20 views. Fast forward 4 maybe 5 months and I get Blackballed and they won't even tell me why. So,1
6211,Helpful,5
6212,"I'm done with this app. When first started using it, things where straight forward. You scrolled through looking for something you wanted, you clicked on the item, messaged the seller and set up a deal. It has now gotten ridiculously un user friendly. For starters, there are now full screen adds that play as you are trying to scroll through items, you now have to pay a fee to get ""early access"" to items posted. Why deal with this when I can use CL or market place without all the bs?",1
6213,"Why ads? Honestly, offer up it's getting bad by the day.",1
6214,the people were awesome üëç,5
6215,Great quality for a reasonable price can't beat it üëç.,5
6216,SLOW.SLOWER.SLOWEST.,1
6217,"I do like the app very much, but I contacted this app because I'm not allowed after many yrs of using the app, confirm that it is my account. I confirmed it yrs ago and now I'm not allowed to message anyone. I only buy used kid toys, so it is not on my account. I am a buyer, not a seller. I think their support team should be able to help me.",2
6218,have never had a problem with shady people. yet. lol.,4
6219,easy to post. great app,5
6220,Offer Up #1! üòéüëçüèº,5
6221,Love it!!,5
6222,They was ere riteon,5
6223,Great place to sell things that you don't need anymore! One's man's trash is another man's treasure!,5
6224,Ok,4
6225,Slow to respond@,1
6226,Very good üëç,5
6227,No one responds to messages. App is a complete waste of time.,1
6228,thank God for this offer up. helps me get rid of things that I don't need here at the house.,5
6229,Great,5
6230,great app!,5
6231,love it,5
6232,Seems like everything posted is months old and no one's on it anymore,2
6233,good üëç,5
6234,watch out for scammers,1
6235,Worst customer service in existence!!! If you get a response they ignore your request & just auto reply a script. They push shipping & hide local results to try to force you to buy shipped items. Now they make you watch ads just to scroll through search results? I'm done with this trash app!!!!,1
6236,"amazing, functional, reliable.",5
6237,you never know what somebody might be wanting some post it all,5
6238,"The fastest way to sell, and purchase what you need.",5
6239,"Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow application! Every little function on the application takes forever. And The app malfunction , don't get alerts on time.",2
6240,"Unfathomably terrible UX. Any search only shows a thumbnail picture with no price information or short description. You have to click into each and every listing to see any information. Not to mention the pictures are all different sizes?? Who looked at this and thought ""yup, that's what the people want."" Unreal.",1
6241,Good,5
6242,I'd need my phone number removed from account on this app please.,1
6243,"They want money now. I messaged 30 people and nobody responded,all while the app was begging me for $7.99 a month plus a ""3-day free trial"" So basically my messages weren't delivered because I didn't pay $7.99 Avoid this app. Either buy new or use Craigslist",1
6244,New version sucks,2
6245,"Great app, it helped me in finding whatever I needed",5
6246,With all the pops and ads the app runs very slow now.,1
6247,love is bes offerup,5
6248,great,5
6249,Good,5
6250,Such a quick turnaround from Nick! Nick helped my husband unload in the dark & rain/. We appreciate his help. Quality product as described. Thank you.,4
6251,Very nice love to sell my products and making some money.,5
6252,Twice false flagged my post of my used TV as an ad and violating community guidelines with no dispute process. I'll just find a site that actually wants me to sell my stuff.,3
6253,alternative to eBay,5
6254,Literally the slowest app to sell stuff on. It takes MINUTES to upload or mark items as sold. Seriously considering deleting my acct and app.,1
6255,As I was signing up it said I needed a credit card number but that it would not charge me anything. As soon as I entered the information I received a text from my credit card saying a potentially fraudulent charge for $49.95 had been attempted and declined. I have to go through all of the hassle of changing my credit card becasue OfferUp lied and attempted fraud against me.,1
6256,there seems to be no accountability when you have issues with a seller or buyer. At least there's no follow-up with a real person via phone or email to let one know of the outcome of a complaint.,4
6257,"Ad wall, ad wall, ad wall",1
6258,Used these apps for years without a verified phone number contacted support saying can use the app anymore if I don't provide my phone number. I am not willing to share my phone number.,1
6259,fast simple effective absolutely love this app,5
6260,I like the app it's a good app for selling or buying your stuff safely,5
6261,"can find good deals, I've built a dumbell weight set for very cheap using this app.",5
6262,Update: 12/023. Still a complete nightmare of an app to try and use. 12/27/22Why do I even have this worthless app on my device anymore? Ever since I posted a review about the app being incredibly slow and glitchy. The developers must have blacklisted my posts cuz I never get a single person interested in anything I sell. Thanks OfferUp for making this decision easy for me. Uninstall. Oh your gift of those coupons that cater to very unique demographics is low class.,1
6263,I didn't know they charge monthly for the promotional and can't cancel easily!!,1
6264,"Most item list dates are old, a scam, from business's or just straight up ads. Ever since let go went away offerup has gone downhill. Easier to just use fb marketplace.",1
6265,This app disgust me keep charging my card from that free trials,1
6266,Ruined my conversation,2
6267,"I love the app, but you'd think the adds over a month old would be cleared so as not to be so ""busy"" when searching.",4
6268,super slow and notifications are late if ever at times,3
6269,"very poor UI, cant remember settings is so annoying",1
6270,"most of the time, I can't even ask a seller if an item is still available bc they want u to sign-up for a ""special program"". They r asking for way too much personal information & don't want to accept any liability if ur information is stolen or compromised. All this to ask a question! Use a different site is my suggestion!!",2
6271,"Optimize the app for Android user or don't let Android users use it. What's the point in having an app on your mobile device if said app doesn't work? I've used it on iPhone and it's great,if it could work half as good on android we would be happy.",1
6272,to many irrelevant notifications that make me delete the app,1
6273,Easy to use but now it's expensive to use,4
6274,"Notifications from potential buyers never works, but you will be bombarded by advertisements CONSTANTLY.",1
6275,"Offer up sucks! They say the real @#$% is fake and let all this fake merchandise be sold as real... Offer up, just stop trying to decipher. What's real or not because you guys have absolutely no clue",1
6276,Since you guys charge to post anything now. People just post on the free section and ruined the app,1
6277,"UPDATE DEC 1 2023: It's still garbage! Wow, whay crackpot team devoted/wasted their time to end up with such a poor moving app. It's pretty awful This app runs soo poorly soo often that in actually reviewing it!",1
6278,"Racist, scam, app won't contact me back about stolen cars either .",1
6279,Good üëç,5
6280,"Update: They did get better at filtering out scams, however, Now I'm getting an error, unable to determine location. It stays don't use VPN blah blah blah... Can't use the app. And I don't have VPN enabled.... Uninstalled, was decent while it lasted. Original: There are way too many scams on this. They need to find a way to reduce scammers on this app. Other than that it would be great.",2
6281,I use offer up all the time. it's a great tool to find whatever you need.,5
6282,it didn't used to have so many ads,1
6283,easy to operate,5
6284,"Great app, great prices!",5
6285,posted many items plenty of views but no bites way better experience on Facebook market place,1
6286,Usually it's good. But today after buying something I tried to give the seller a good rating but I keep getting an error.,4
6287,Good,5
6288,No wonder it's the number 2 grossing. They charge hundreds of dollars without your consent. Unethical thieves,1
6289,love this site great way to sell and buy +5 for sure,5
6290,*Update- OfferUp gave me $30 which expires today and link sends you to This Page Does Not Exist! Really OfferUp?! Still can't upload pics! I AM DELEATING APP NOW. Going to Craigslist. *very frustrating experience with the OfferUp app! got the app a couple weeks ago and have been trying to post things for sale on it. every spare minute for two weeks now! the app isn't uploading my pics. tried everything I can think of. checked all settings in camera etc!,1
6291,Great for business,5
6292,amazing sweet seller!!!,5
6293,Been making sales for years,5
6294,Responded very quickly with all emails. Friendly and speedy transaction.,5
6295,"The biggest trouble are the people on this app. It seems like it attracts the mentally unstable. Haha But yeah, the rating system makes no sense. I have a review for a purchase, but I never bought anything. Only have sold. I have a 75% reply rate when I replied to every message someone has sent. I get notifications for things I'm supposedly interested in, when I have notifications turned off in the settings. Buggy and very little traffic it seems on the app. You're better off on eBay or CL.",2
6296,"Non premium members close the app 30 minutes before premium members. Non premium members become disappointed 60% faster, too. The premium member option killed this application. It used to be great, now it's just trash",1
6297,I love Offer Up,5
6298,Forced video ads is where I draw the line. There's already a banner every few inches now an intrusive video ad on top is a bit excessive.,1
6299,easy awesome app I love it!,5
6300,very helpful keep up the good work,5
6301,Y'all really need to fix the notification problem. All notifications are allowed on my phone from offer up and I still don't get the damn notifications when someone messages me! It's so annoying. I have someone willing to meet or pickup and I don't even get there msg when they're otw or here! I have to constantly be checking the app to see if there here!! It's so annoying. Help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
6302,"it works ,.. n it's fast & friendly",5
6303,"Have only posted 2 items for sale, but both sold within week.",5
6304,"Easy to buy and sell pretty much whatever you have! As long as you follow their simple guidelines for selling and buying, the process is only as difficult or as easy as you make it! I like hoe you can post something and have it sold same day at times!",4
6305,excellent app,5
6306,not good,2
6307,Not happy any more! They deactivated my account,1
6308,Overall good app.. the area you live in will have a huge effect on everything. I have been able to let some items go for Garage Sale prices and it's better than throwing things away. I wish more people were active here but it's another tool for everyone to use. Give it a try and make a difference. I have no criticism of the app other than I wish more people were active here.,4
6309,"Can't sign in, no use for me",1
6310,Good,5
6311,Slow service no longer a favorite for selling item,2
6312,so glad I found this app't.. saves time..money..and the individuals are truly very friendly and helpful üòä thumbs üëç!,5
6313,the items are to high with no free delivery,1
6314,"they are sensoring every word over there services, and deciding which information gets sent and which information gets received...and PROHIBITING SALES FOR VERIFICATION OF PHONE NUMBER IF THAT NUMBER.IS ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER NUMBERS. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TRTING TO CLOSE A DEAL.",1
6315,"this app was great and now it wants to charge you to get views to sell your stuff. No thanks, I'm not paying for the privilege of selling my stuff that people are going to try to offer pennies on the dollar anyway. If I could give zero stars, I gladly would.",1
6316,I seem to get a lot of ppl wanting to buy my stuff but they live across the country. And they're usually scammers,3
6317,lot of flakey people unfortunately,4
6318,never works,1
6319,"Full of scammers cant sell a thing on this broken app ppl hit me up to buy and never show, one person even threatened to kill me and my family wouldn't use this app",1
6320,Great,4
6321,Giving you a one star because you allow malicious ads. I hope whoever decided to allow nonsense like that stubs their toe really hard and has a generally unpleasant week.,1
6322,"Used car dealers pose as private sellers. Advertisements disguised as sale items in random categories Can't zoom in on images?! But why? And how do they break basic function of OUR devices? Copy /paste what I want from my screen! Edit: I posted one thing and said I'd take ammo in trade anong other commodities worth more than dollars and they deleted the garden tool then sent me an email threatening to üòÇ ""delete my account"" and asking for money to go adfree. They bought letgo. Trash",1
6323,give me more customers lol,5
6324,"Hi, What happen to the notification sound? It doesn't ping on my phone anymore? I've missed a couple of sales üòî Also it runs really slow and to be honest most people like to get an answer respond fast. Update; Thank you for the reply. I will send an email. I appreciate your help.",4
6325,It's a good app and my only issue is the people listing items in the free category when the item isn't actually free. There should be a Trades/Or Best Offer category to keep users from having to click on item and having to read in description if item is free or not. Or maybe it's just me that find this annoying.,5
6326,Just started,5
6327,"Easy posting , Very easy , Great app ,",4
6328,Great and a lot of help.,5
6329,It works great,5
6330,Cars For sale,1
6331,Excellent Service!!!,5
6332,some flaws but it's alright,4
6333,the best app for sellers or buyers thank you offer up,5
6334,"Ads are too intrusive, really ruins the app experience",1
6335,"Absolutely terrible customer service. Don't do it, delete now!",1
6336,So now you have to pay to post something for sale??? Wow OFFER up Wowwww!!! Deleting this app now,1
6337,They are more serious about the sell,5
6338,"Too many ads. Terrible compared to the browser based experience. Hidden fees to list items, not disclosed until the last step of building a listing. Waste of time, don't bother with this garbage app. ü§Æ",1
6339,"I love the app,but wish people would update after the item is sold.",4
6340,"Everytime I go on this app it's different and I have to relearn how to use it, difficult to post multiple items, and change posts.",3
6341,"Great deals, good communication from app. Highly recommend Offer up.",5
6342,Pretty self explanatory,4
6343,Doesnt work,1
6344,my stuff is not being sold on OfferUp I'm not getting any hits on anything for some reason,1
6345,Good,5
6346,"As I said I will update the review following OfferUp response. They really don't care about plataform users and they will shoot everyone an automated response, don't waste your time with this app, and don't risk your life. An OfferUp user steal my belongings without any consequences. And be aware, if they don't hurt you police won't get your case, and if don't have a case with police, OfferUp won't do anything about it. They will do their best to wash their hands off.

6348,can't use my phone number I've had for 7 years can't advertise or message,1
6349,"Can't change my return address, can't cancel orders as seller.. I'm done with OfferUp. Overcomplicated and broken.",1
6350,Useful app.,4
6351,You have to now pay money to list to every item. Just ridiculous. Y'all are a money greedy company. This app just kept getting worse and worse over the years. I'm uninstalling. Just post your items to Facebook marketplace or Craigslist,1
6352,"too many bots, low ballers and flakes",1
6353,"Great to use for buying and selling,!",5
6354,"Great platform, but a lot of thieves search the site. It would be great if there was something to prevent, or weed out, the valid buyers from crooks.",4
6355,Was very slow to load. Lots of sponsored retail products.,2
6356,I wish you had prices on the pictures in a corner so I don't have too click on every single picture I'm interested when I'm searching for an item. It's very time consuming clicking on Every single picture just too see the asking price.,3
6357,Hate the new multimedia videos it's dissatisfied,1
6358,Great. I got a great deal on here today.,5
6359,Great,5
6360,"I'm sure this could be great in a metropolitan area, but I live in a desolate, but incredibly beautiful part of Wyoming.",2
6361,"No option for local pickup which you would think would have been easy since they pivoted from letgo. Ridiculous shipping restrictions. No weight over 20lbs and no side of the box over 18"". If the buyer or seller wants to pay to have the item shipped for what it will cost why not let them? Better categories for selling tools and equipment than most comparable apps have.",3
6362,works as it should. easy interface,5
6363,too slow,3
6364,The app ran smoothly in the past but beware the app is acting funny almost as if it is intentionally not sending notifications when you're actually trying to meet someone.,2
6365,it was better without all the ads and now wait times,3
6366,"I am shadow banned(could be this seller) for blocking a Seller who wasn't satified with an item they listed as on sale. They relisted the item, and asked me to buy the item again at a higher price, after I already bought the item on sale... Offerup needs to stop these scammers!!",2
6367,app crashed because my vpn unpaused mid-post,1
6368,The app is great. The sellers is where it gets difficult.,5
6369,great place to buy and sell items,5
6370,"Items that are listed over 2 weeks should require an update to be displayed. Also, sellers responding to buyers needs to be improved greatly.",1
6371,Great seller. Very professional and item was exactly as described... actually even better than expected. Joe went above and beyond to make the transaction go smoothly. Extremely pleased with everything about the purchase!,5
6372,Awsome!,5
6373,Easy to use,4
6374,Listings don't appear no more for no reason. Don't waste your time on this app,1
6375,half a star,1
6376,I really love this app!!!,5
6377,Offer up banned and then removed my account for harassment when I emailed them telling them that I was hacked and wasn't actually me they just removed my account,1
6378,Too many ads,4

6384,2019 review.. almost perfect! 2023 review: app has gotten SERIOUSLY slow and buggy!,5
6385,service is horrible,1
6386,Slow needs to be updated really slow,4
6387,Stupid update. You can not slide through items?? deleted the app.,1
6388,Slowest app on my phone. Very frustrating to use. Doesn't matter if it's on a newer Samsung phone or tablet. Do your job Offerup and update this app already. Update 11/26: now it won't let me cash out because it won't submit my info and keeps on saying action required every time I press the submit option. Stay away from this app if you value your time and money. I would rate 0 if it let me,1
6389,"The premium subscription it's a rip off no body reads or pay attention the offers , you can write 100 times and get no answers",1
6390,Great for honest people,5
6391,"Reporting bad sellers does nothing, there are WAY too many scams, bots and stores. You guys need a post or poster review team badly. The amount scammers has increased so much that I can't even use the app anymore. Go ahead and try looking for a car or a specific item without 40 scams popping up and and ads all over the place. Filters don't work either. You want pick up only? We'll here's 60 delivery posts that are scams.",1
6392,"This app is somewhat helpful. I hate the lack of details the sellers provide for what they're selling, lack of updating if the item is still for sale or not ,and don't respond. it would be better if there was a time limit for items posted for sale like Craigslist does. I've seen some things still be posted for sale as old as 3 years ago! is it any wonder why posters get annoyed when people asking ""Is this item still available? ""..",3
6393,New update not good! Limit 200 posts for month hard too sell now....,1
6394,So far just used app to look at what people are offering and prices being asked. I getting ready to start letting go of item I've accumulated over the years (I've figured out I can't take them where I'm going - the hole is only so deep). Plus someone else should get enjoyment out of them as I have. Very enjoyable app!,5

6398,Wasn't this bad cars and trucks were having trouble getting better for running as these prices are good to buying them for working through the Job and useful for services,3
6399,It's such a good idea but people being weird and app not optimized for a fold 3 samsung brings concerns... I can barely get a text out with my app crashing or freezing. After awhile it gets annoying especially when trying to text multiple customers. Anyway fix your app all I can say.,2
6400,"Many scammers in this app, and the administrators ignore the reports Update: Now more ads within the app. not recommended app",1
6401,It's good,2
6402,I decided to give this app another chance since there really aren't any local cash and carry apps. I see nothing has changed. Still nobody sees the stuff and nobody buys. Stuff just languishes in the nowhere land of this app for years.,2
6403,"It's a good app and easy to use other than the fact that your able to start a subscription when it pops up but i looked for it in the app it sent me to the playstore saying all my subscriptions will be there and it wasn't! It doesn't do it on the app and i couldn't figure out how to cancel it so i was getting charged, after talking to customer service they say i will still be charged because i didnt cancel it before even though it wasn't even being used. Cancellation should be on the app!!",3
6404,"It's easy to use very friendly, very straightforward. And I would recommend this app to anybody. Who wants to sell items or buy items on offerup",5
6405,"The ad make it almost impossible to look up what you're looking for. Was a decent app before all the banners, and forced videos.",1
6406,Easiest way to shop. Thank God for Offer up America!,5
6407,"100s of 5 * sales, followed all rules, recommended ppl, paid for premium.. & they permanently banned my account w/no warning? it says i violated the rules, but won't tell me which rule, or even which posting it was, they only say ""our decision is final."" I'm at a loss; I used this app a lot for extra income to do fun things with my 9y/o daughter, so it's literally decreased time I can spend w/her bc there's no app like it. marketplace isn't the same. you all should feel awful about yourselves.",1
6408,the best sold fast offer up.,5
6409,The best,5
6410,it's slow as heck and clunky to use.,3
6411,I like offer up most I sold,5
6412,very convenient,5
6413,I can't make contact with sellers and I post stuff but get 0 views,1
6414,Good app,5
6415,great place to find anything,5
6416,"I like shopping here, Just sometimes I don't get what I m looking for or people's don't answer my offer. Thank you for asking. Happy Holidays to everyone",5
6417,Offer Up just keeps getting better and better.,5
6418,"If you enjoy people who make excuses not to meet up, then this app is for you!",1
6419,The app takes forever to navigate. I can't stand it. Think I'll switch back to Craig's list!!!!,2
6420,Wished there was more control over stolen materials being sold,3
6421,Good,5
6422,"This app has turned into pure garbage.... laggier than a 90's modem connection, and FULL of ads, outdated listings, and bugs galore... impressively craptastic. .....aaaand queue the generic canned response from the developers",1
6423,I absolutely loved this app... Before the adpocolypse. Now every single time I click something there an ad. Everyone I've bought from has been fantastic though.,3
6424,the app is very slow. it lags between pages. it used to be pretty quick but when it went to the premium subscription model it slowed down. I like all other features though.,2
6425,This app use to amazing but now it is filled with ads and scammers,1
6426,Who doesn't love a bargain...I love this app,5
6427,"Even though the notifications within the app are turned on, I don't get chat message notifications. I can't sell something if I don't know someone has reached out. Very frustrating!",1
6428,Everything awesome,5
6429,Love it,5
6430,"not totally sure yet, but so far so good",3
6431,"It would be nice if you would advertise, just a little better, instead of us having to pay.",3
6432,"offerUp, is fantastic!!",5
6433,Slow as molasses!,1
6434,"App is slow and lags, gets worse the more items you list and takes forever to scroll through the list. Needs to be optimized for sellers who use it the most. Listed a car for sale with promote feature that costs $20 per month and have not gotten a single response.",3
6435,way better than Craig's list,5
6436,"Search is garbage. Does not show all the items with the keyword. Default sorting is Best Match, which is dumb. Should be Newest First. Otherwise, decent app.",3
6437,no one responds,1
6438,Offer up permits scammers to publish fake advertisements to rob hard working money from legit and unaware buyers.,1
6439,"Totally over run by car dealerships and false advertisements. Offer up needs to fix this... update 2 years later, still has not been fixed!",1
6440,Uodate for more aggressive advertising! Deleted!,1
6441,üòÉüëçü§ó,5
6442,one of the best apps on my phones,5
6443,Offer up is easy to use. Very good about checking out scam ad when alerted,2
6444,good app and sellers have been very reliable,5
6445,"I had a very high rating of many sales and purchases both in person and online. My wife was scammed on a wonderfold wagon which was resolved by our bank. Ever since the incident, I began reporting wonderfold wagons if it was being shipped. I discovered it was a repeat scammer. While offer up took down those posting and profiles eventually, another new one would pop up and I would repeat the process. The scammer reported me and offer up disabled my account. They have not reinstated my account.",1
6446,This app use to be good but now it's asking for a picture of my ID I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD PUT PROSONNEL INFORMATION,1
6447,great app!! great deals!!,5
6448,great site to sell your items,5
6449,The app has regressed through time adding too much advertising and corporate sellers,2
6450,love offerup,5
6451,Liked it better without the advertisement.,3
6452,making an offer should not be something pushed on the search page. The seller should have the ability to turn that off or on. I myself am getting really tired of ridiculously low ball offers that don't even make sense.,3
6453,On time all the time,5
6454,good,5
6455,froze my account for no reason. I have emailed them with no response. Then they unlocked it. still for no reason. I have contacted the company twice. They still haven't responded.,1
6456,very nice and quick to respond!,5
6457,:.. . . A AA2. Was,1
6458,An ok app if you're looking for lowball offers. Also just made it to where ads that you cant skip pop up often and you have to pay to delete. Already have ads throughout the feed this is unnecessary and a waste of time,2
6459,Best ever,5
6460,Awful just use Craigslist. You now get popup video ads that are ultra annoying.,1
6461,New app is terrible!,1
6462,This site really sucks dad stuff on there that's been listed for 10 years and it's still there people don't have I really wish you wouldn't have bought out let go they were a good site between OfferUp and let go let go is badass,1
6463,Works well to buy and sell in person. Selling is limited unless you pay for promotion.,4
6464,too much spam and tire-kickers,1
6465,so far so good,5
6466,Easy to use and find buyers,5
6467,Some decent stuff,4
6468,Ehh ...I think if you won't pay to promote..then selling is far and few .....,2
6469,ads never expire that's bad. and people rarely respond in a timely manner,3
6470,ads!.. makes me get off the app faster though.,1
6471,ILIKE TO BUY IN OFFER UP,5
6472,"OFFER UP WAS COOL YEARS AGO BUT POPULARITY IS WAY DOWN AND COMBINE WITH FOLKS NOT HAVING MONEY THERE LESS TO NO BUYERS TO WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE NO CALLERS , HOPEFULLY THIS TREND DOES NOT CONTINUE. NOT EVEN LOW BALLERS ARE EVEN INTERESTED. I SEE NO RESULTS LIKE I DID YEARS AGO.üòû",3
6473,"Easy app for me to use but sadly they start to notify me about things I never set notifications for. One day perhaps developers will wake up and realize that attraction is better than promotion and quit beating up the user. Would be 5 stars if they would leave us be after the fact. Even after toggling notifications off, it still shows up.",3
6474,"A little un- user friendly, so I don't use it much.",4
6475,11/23/2023 *UPDATE - This app IS STILL running extremely slow lately. Even after the updates. It's been over a year! Very disappointing,1
6476,Scam this whole app is a database for scammers and spam,1
6477,great place to sell items!,5
6478,I K K .m,2
6479,"Unbelievable app , I got Banned for No Reason , I followed all the Terms Of Services Policy",1
6480,I love this App,5
6481,Im never going to give you up.,1
6482,Great site to buy and sell on,5
6483,Find fast and easy ü´†‚ÄºÔ∏è,4
6484,I always get a notification icon above the app showing how many notifications but most of the time there are none it's very annoying. also I save an item I like and there is no way I can find those items again!,2
6485,"terrible experience usimg this app. ive been selling and buying on here for the past 6 years. today, while negotiating a price for a pinball machine, i messaged a buyer with a link to an industry pricing page. offerup immediately locked my account preventing me from sending ANY messages. i was negotiating another deal during this time and a person was driving 45min to meet me for an item but because they locked my account i cant communicate with this biyer now. deleting and ill never come back",1
6486,I use OfferUp nearly exclusively because I trust the ratings system that doesn't exist on other platforms. The ratings system helps me save time by focusing on quality buyers and sellers!,5
6487,The new update is terrible üòû,1
6488,All good stuff,5
6489,I use this app often. So far no issues,4
6490,"GREAT, except when you get scammers.",4
6491,The last update has made the app barely usable. Extremely slow.,2
6492,Too many ads.,3
6493,"Lagginess of the app, especially the slowness once you try and maneuver messages, ruins the whole experience for me. Therefore this app is un usable",1
6494,üëç,5
6495,Funny they take a cut of the sale and customer get item but seller got wait 3 to 5 days for payment to release,1
6496,"Used to be a great app when it was just let go, but now that it has combined with OfferUp the ability to sell has gone down tremendously. when it was let go I could typically sell my items within a few days but after being on here for over a week and not getting a single view seems to me that the app just isn't worth it anymore. I'll stick to Craigslist and Facebook marketplace to sell my items because even paying for parole on this app doesn't seem worth it either.",1
6497,The ease of looking for satisfies your shopping needs at reasonable prices in your area.,4
6498,Slow. Glitches. A hassle to use. Another app going backwards with every update.,4
6499,App is super slow to load and switch between menus. Search algorithm is awful and search filter options are basic and useless. Much prefer marketplace and only use this when I'm desperate.,2
6500,I'VE USED THIS APP FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE YEARS AND I HAVE SOLD ALMOST EVERYTHING I'VE LISTED AND MET SOME COOL PEOPLE. 5 STARS FROM ME,5
6501,Great,5
6502,"It's a bit difficult to get to what you're looking for at the beginning, but once you're there, this is a good app",3
6503,"Ads... I should give it 1 star... there never was ads on this app that block the whole screen, now I've gotta wait 5/10 and sometimes 20 seconds to even use the app. HORRIBLE!",2
6504,"It's an ok app. There are too many unskippable ads, and there are a handful of scammers on the site. Major metropolitan areas have listings that have prices at msrp for used items. Other platforms don't have this combination of issues. Outside of these issues, its an OK app / platform.",3
6505,Probably one of the better ones,5
6506,Verry good,5
6507,There's often some difficulty with items getting removed for non-existent reasons...they send you a list of some generic possible reasons---none of which are applicable. It sure would be helpful to get a problem resolved quickly. How about speaking to a real person? ü§î,3
6508,"Recently, prices were removed from the preview images when browsing products. This is done intentionally to force you to spend more time browsing in their app, making you more likely to click on ads (which of course still shows the prices on them). I will update my review and reinstall the app if this is addressed.",2
6509,Terrible app plagued with scammers old posts that never get deleted and it's rampant with ads,1
6510,I've been selling things on here for a while and most of the time it's been good on guy tried to scam me a lot of guys come playing games and when you correct them now you are the bad guy and that is the wasn't cooli but for the most part it's been good Have a Happy and Blessed Holiday and Always keep our hearts and minjua,5
6511,Very good,4
6512,App is unable to detect location even after granting location access and turned off vpn because you grabblers don't respect the user's security or privacy. I guess you can't afford actual developers and have to have diversity hires continue to trash a possible good app.,1
6513,Used to be good now full page ads trash,1
6514,It is great and helpfull,5
6515,Purposefully making it impossible to cancel my subscription. Extremely unethical.,1
6516,good way to buy tools,5
6517,Great,5
6518,I haven't sold anything on Offer up,2
6519,Excellent,5
6520,I go to try to find anything that is local and it just gives me everything that is too far away,1
6521,"Many things to buy, that's for sure!!!!",5
6522,I get more views on Facebook marketplace for free and I've been able sell more on Facebook. Makes me think offerup hides a lot of stuff.,3
6523,u are Doing a Good job.,5
6524,"too bloated now with ads. slow experience, haptic feedback with apps. hardly ever go on here anymore. aps force play now too after sending messages to other users...",1
6525,"It was a great honest trustworthy experience. I could have not gotten a better deal anywhere else!If you get a chance to deal with Ponce, do it, he is a great guy. Buy all your tools from him.",5
6526,todo caro,2
6527,"This app used to be way better. First was their decling customer service. Then came the annoying and interrupting ads. ""Zero"" cust. service = no voice communication, poor & lazy generic email replies, & no care to maintain user retention. Hey Offer-up, Craigslist & MarketPlace said to say thanks for the increased business",2
6528,Stupid,1
6529,Why does it keep playing some music in the background???,1
6530,Excellent Experience !! Great Collectible !! Thank You,5
6531,I've had a quite a few people look at it but I'm not sure how to communicate back with them and have them call me,5
6532,useful and convenient,5
6533,"Excellent, very good opportunity for popular items.",5
6534,Offered Up Is One Stop Shopping!,5
6535,"Would give zero stars if possible, postings get no views and no messages, there is no technical support or customer service, and they send you notifications for suggested items that have nothing to do with you and are 300+ miles away",1
6536,"If you want to play a game with shopping, then sure. Click a square, with no price or title or description, pick any one. Oops! You clicked an advertisement. Try again! Are those Jordans? A bit blurry let me see.. click. Aw man they're Crocs.. back to the main page. Level 2. You are now swimming in the sea of infinte Crocs. That is all you get to click now. You buy Crocs. Game over.",1
6537,Excellent!!,5
6538,üëç,5
6539,"i like the app, dislike the new forced ads used to persuade me to pay for the premium version",3
6540,Gucci,5
6541,good app.,4
6542,there's an overwhelming amount of items on here that were sold months if not years ago.,3
6543,"I did seen so called deals,but I have been a shut in.thank U.",3

6545,ileaning,1

6547,Awesome app üëå sweet deals all around!!,5
6548,offer up is not posting my items publicly,1
6549,Can't post anything.,1
6550,nice and clean..,5
6551,There's something wrong with My Opera. I can't text the the messengers for people that has car for sale. It doesn't work. I don't know why so would you contact me to the corporate office of opera please?,5
6552,OfferUp platform is very slow and sometimes not reliable in terms of functionality. Otherwise it is a good option for selling online except that after the first few days the items seem to get stale in regards to views.,2
6553,It's a good app to use to buy to sell,5
6554,Easy to post items and answer inquiries,5
6555,you screw it up to make money,2
6556,i see that work together make great thing,5
6557,It's great. Well-organized and always satisfied with my purchases,5
6558,"I used this app for 5 minutes before uninstalling it. This is such a ridiculously ugly app that's riddled with ads. There are more ads on your screen than there's actual, legitimate sellers and their posts. It's such a blatant push for you to fork over money to go ad free. No, thank you. Mercari is better and just... cleaner looking.",1
6559,perfect as described,5
6560,"Ive bought & sold thru OfferUp... So Far, So Good !!!",5
6561,sometimes some good finds,5

6565,"Loe the app, ,use it a lot, habe bougjt and sold many items. Within the last week, started getting some major flaws lately. Might be add driven or something,, after a min or two of shopping, music starts and won't stop. Even if phone is ""closed"" to sleep screen. Like how Pandora etc. Keeps playing music... so annoying, and if my volume is down, you don't realize, and it burns your battery. I un-installed and re-installed the app, still does it.",2
6566,fast and easy,5
6567,"Scummy rules, scummy moderation. They will terminate your account for no good reason and won't tell you what you need to change.",1
6568,love it.,5
6569,awesome site the only bad thing is that you have to re-set distance choose local or shipping every time search for a new item,3
6570,Idk how but I just boosted post for free. However I was charged 9.99 premium I don't even see a difference,5
6571,My app is stuck in Russian language... Even with a fresh install. I'm in the US. Can't read what to click on to switch to English.,1
6572,"if you have a lot of pics in your photos collection, this app is NOT for you (or me).",3

6574,Good deal,5
6575,No one ever replys,1
6576,I love it,5
6577,excellent,5
6578,Messaging notification system needs lots of improvement . we will see buyers or sellers message only when we open the app. I missed many deals due to this.,1
6579,Trash üóë,1
6580,Was banned without any prior notification of terms supposedly being violated. OfferUp provides no evidence of any violations and you get a script when you contact Support.,1
6581,Found what I was looking for the first time i used it!,4
6582,Most of the time the app works as should and enjoy it,3
6583,"Quick,easy.just follow directions 6 ques.respond.easy.",5

6585,"Good to buy and sale , thanks üëç",4
6586,great site to buy & sell,5
6587,BS that you only have 1 free car post per month. And the app is so laggy. OfferUp used to be the best before 2019,1
6588,Love it,5
6589,2023 November review. Android app is slow. There's a significant lag even on a 3GHz CPU based latest Google Pixel phone and Samsung Galaxy S22/ S23 phones. This also causes accidentally tapping on the wrong screen. Poor app performance. THIS REVIEW IS YOUR FEEDBACK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAGIC WILL HAPPEN IF I EMAILED YOU. FIX THE APP. Facebook Marketplace app is way better and it's free.,1

6601,"This app won't allow you to use it if you have a VPN. It says it's only for the USA, but my location is in the USA and my VPN is set to USA. It's really annoying and makes no sense.",2
6602,Nice,5
6603,I don't like the fact that you can't meet with people in person if you want or give your phone number but other than that good app,3
6604,Offeruo became too greedy and only cares much about money by add additional fees listing and so be more supportive and not greedy for this app! So I am using Facebook marketplace or Craigslist instead.,1
6605,When I opened my account in less than a week it was sold and after a few weeks it was no longer sold and there are many people who have items that have not been sold for years.,2
6606,"OfferUp circled the drain and plopped into a cesspool of Americanized Corporate Imperialism. It's a real ""give us your money, or else"" mentality. There are so many advertisements sucking the life out of your data, the app. hardly works. Not to mention the pop-up adds waiting around every corner that lag. Do turnips bleed? According to OfferUp's tactics, they do...",1
6607,"if you look at a shoe the app will show you listings for shoes if you view a video game the app will flood you with video game listings, if you look at a car all you will see is car listings. I want to see every listing and I want to see them from newest to oldest. don't mix in 3 month old posts with brand new day 1 posts. stop hiding stuff stop shoving your ads ever 5 to 10 listings makes me just not want to use the app and stop forcing posts with shipping in when I disable it in the filter",1

6622,oh man if you looking for something this is where to go.it got everything you looking for try. it for yourself,4
6623,offer up is pretty cool. I've been using it for a while and I have purchased a lot of items and a few cars. and also have sold items and cars both way it has been smooth.,5

6636,"I tried creating an account twice, but they got deleted dude to not meeing their usage standards. Neither time had anything posted so it must have been something in my profile that triggered the deletions. Instead of notifying me and warning, they just delete.

6640,"OfferUp has changed since I have used it over 5 years ago. OfferUp has become more of a commercial for unknown, unadvertised furniture companies instead of individuals. I'm slightly saddened!",3
6641,easy to use and great deals,5
6642,Great,4
6643,"The fact that you have disabled this app when the phone is on vpn is atrocious. I am a software engineer and fully aware you coded it intentionally. I am also religiously cautious of my security, and a vpn is a vital part of that process. I will not disable my protections to use your app. Do your homework and secure, and validate your users properly. Blocking vpn isn't the way and provides you very little protections while forcing us to completely disable ours!!!",1
6644,Very cool guy.,5
6645,Used to be a great app i used everyday an sold on a bunch. But so many glitches now an ads an so slow I don't even really use it anymore. Just use fb marketplace so much easier,1

6647,Absolutely full of scammers.,1
6648,"Honestly, offerup is so popular I have to keep it because I'm looking for cars. Sadly, even when I set specific filters for a car I still get cars that are FROM THE OTHER SIDE of the US. Ridiculous that I can't see my area even when I filtered it. (That is a glitch btw) sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, and no I'm not confusing it for the ""found outside ur search area"". It is so frustrating to use the app with those issues, can't find what i want without ads and stff I didn't ask for.",2
6649,great experience very kind women to deal with,5

6686,"Slow, very few offers and the app is basic",2
6687,I love this Offer Up thing. I get to post stuff I no longer need and sell them at NO cost at all! I jjst bought a Xbox Series X for only $300 bux! I can't say enough good things about it,5
6688,Worst app ever try to look at pickup trucks. And it gives me nothing but toys. Delete it after 5 minutes. And it tells me there's nothing in my area would you know better,1

6690,So far so good,5
6691,"I used to love this app and it used to work so much better - in fact I never had this problem until the last update which rendered it absolutely painfully slow to use, glitchy and practically unusable. It's really sad, because I didn't used to be like this and it was one of my go-to apps that I find myself using less and less since it became abruptly massively slower...",2

6696,Great app for my product to sell,5
6697,"This app requires the users to verify their identity, but only US identity documents are accepted, meaning personal not resident in the US are not eligible, but they don't disclose that requirement on the sign up. I discovered that the hard way, after downloading, installing the app on my phone and spending a lot of time and energy in posting listing, suddenly all my listing were removed and I was asked to provide identity documents, that is only the US identity documents. Bad user experience.",1

6710,I enjoy offer up alot,5
6711,Good,4
6712,"I like most everything except, I really dislike if you click on an image that is difficult to see and it's nothing you're interested in. After that it keeps showing you items associated with that. Now you're stuck with pages of stuff you don't want to see.",4
6713,Good app its better than Craigslist for sure,5
6714,This use to be a great app. Now I list a item and no views for weeks. I use to get 200 views in 10 minutes...whats going on ???????????.....?,5
6715,Good,5
6716,"Despite turning off notifications except for direct messages, I still get spammy push notifications for things I'm not interested in. I did a one-time search for dressers more than a year ago, and now I get weekly reminders to keep searching for dressers. It is more than irritating. Apparently, turning off notifications isn't enough to avoid their BS spam",2
6717,Very disappointed üòû,1
6718,I am giving offer up 1 stars. I would give it no stars but you have to mark a one. Because everything on here is fake. And people keep posting things under wrong categories. And I was asked For high prices. And no one responds to anything.,1

6764,It's grate,5
6765,"Market is too flooded to get your stuff seen. Lots of scammers and people wasting your time. Also, multiple times I have seen people selling children on here and even after you report it over and over the accounts aren't removed! Very disturbing!!",2

6791,"Buggy and never ending Notifications. I get recommended items even though I turned that off. Its a good idea for an app but the Ad's have piled up. I'm not sure if it's connected to eBay but if I search on eBay those items then start to appear on OfferUp or very identical. I don't like my data and search histories being linked to other apps. I also don't like the Spam Accounts that pile up. it happens I get it, but definitely gotta be aware of them. I rarely respond to new accountsanymore",2
6792,very nice app. I just couldn't even live without it!! it turned from a Lil side hussle to a dang near full time great paying job where iam my own boss!!,5

Within in minutes I I notified Offer Up of my problem and asked them to cancell the transaction. I received no communication from Offer Up on this transaction. I notified the seller of what had happened. I hope they didn't ship the item in question. I told the seller that if it was shipped I would return it. I will not look on Offer Up again.",1

I was given no explanation as to why it was automatically removed nor even told it was so. Terrible user experience. I deleted my account and uninstalled.",1
6798,"Awful forces you to download app to buy, I'm deleting and leaving this bad review bc of that.",1

6806,Awsome#,5
6807,"It looks like a good app for what I see. But I do have a question if anyone can answer is this a good site to sell a home in a 55 and over community? Or am I in the wrong place? I love any answers on please. Thank you, Stella",4

6809,Been having trouble communicating through app I'm not sure why but it makes me unhappy,3
6810,excellent,5
6811,The app keeps deleting my posts. And i have the premium version...,1
6812,"Very easy to use if you follow the rules. Example One person wanted me to send half of the money PayPal Western Union.

Please provide a verification method that doesn't require invasive technologies. All of my listings were archived with no explanation and won't unarchive, support was a canned email response that didn't apply, and I believe that facial verification is required before unarchiving.",1

6817,Love this,5
6818,Great site for great bargains,5
6819,FAB!!,5
6820,fake advertisement on this platform caused me to lose money. lesson learned.,2

6822,outstanding,5
6823,"Update: Developer reply to this review is 100% illegitimate. After update, app now tells me to turn off VPN. Original review: CANT USE A LEGITIMATE VPN! Developer reccomends clear cache and history.. this does NOTHING! Explain why YOUR app wants to track our IP address? Please explain why..... Asking me to contact support instead of answering here is shady. Please show us transparency.... here... Amazon, Ebay, etc... even my bank apps allow me to use a legit VPN. Developer, what is your logic??",1
6824,I get very frustrated with this app. There are a number of things that could be more thought out like finding out how much it cost to upgrade to premium plus without having to contact customer support. The monthly rate is given but not an annual rate. The notifications don't work all the time and sometimes people get upset with me for not getting back to them. Stop sending junk notifications about ads I've looked at. My ad gets buried and are hard to find because of their promotion plus ads.,1
6825,App is extremely laggy . Takes forever to post or message because it is so slow. Useful app just annoying. Seems to be getting even worse as far as how slow the app runs. Extremely hard to even want to use this app. Messages lag to the point it tries to delete conversations every time i touch one. Delayed input on almost everything. Seems that nothing will be fixed. Continues to get worse. Now my messages dont even show up. How pitiful really.,1
6826,I love love love love the app and also picking up cute items for an affordable price.,5
6827,"DO NOT pay for advertising this app will cancel your account for no reason and keep your advertising money, big businesses have multiple accounts flag you and the system erases your account and if you haven't even used your advertising money they won't give it back to you, how is it that big businesses can have multiple accounts and won't get erased and I had only one and wasn't even posting alot this app is a joke, edit: talking to customer service they just ignore you and do nothing",1
6828,great app,5
6829,This is for wasting my time. I've been trying to buy a sound bar for a couple weeks. I finally found the right one. And after putting in the offer. I find out offerup only supports shipping under 20lbs. And this item weighs 22lbs and seller didn't know that either. Poor selling system.,1
6830,I use to love this app. I'm changing it. It's all ads. All advertising time to find a new platform,1
6831,the best way to find good items and good prices,5
6832,I find it to be pretty easy for a guy like me. That's not computer smart,5
6833,customer service has problems helping fix cell phone and email issues.,2
6834,"Don't bother sorting by price. Offerup does not expire old items so the [thing] at [good price] is several years old and the seller's latest items is also years old. I retry the app every few months, always this one consistent problem. Giving one star because it won't let me give less. (Watch publisher respond ""oh sorry, please email us!"")",1
6835,Super,5
6836,Best app ever really Like it,5
6837,Eeehhh,3

6847,nice job! but your ad rates are high for decent coverage,4
6848,"CHARGED ME FOR A ""FREE TRIAL"" HELL NO. THIS APP IS A SCAM!!",1
6849,I like this app,5
6850,you ask for a copy of the id and a photo. it is dagerous to provide it,1
6851,nice place to sale anything,5
6852,Did the subscription. They finally charged me today..... They charged me 8.79 instead of the 7.99 that I agreed too. Watch your banking and make sure they are charging you what you agree too. Don't let these tards steal your money,1
6853,I don't know why but for some reason my messages are not being read and they were before like I could understand one or two from people not checking their inbox but all of them it just started happening because I have bought stuff,1
6854,"I have been posting on offerup for years and have over 800‚≠êÔ∏è. Every time I post my item is automatically removed. I have contacted offerup several times and they restore my listing, but the issue is not fixed! It's been a week now with no resolution!",1

6856,"I'm changing my review as stated: Much better now that most of the sellers/buyers are verified. I don't like that you can't contact anyone at OfferUp, except email. I'm grateful for a local site, I don't have room for anymore apps on my phone due to severe internal hrdwr/sftwr issues. Not dealing with scammers trying to convince me to print a check & deposit it in the ATM, monopolizing time, that could've been spent in an actual sale. I'm trying it again, so if it's better I'll change my review.",4
6857,App just randomly took down my listing without notifying me. No clue why.,1
6858,App sucks. Nothing but ads,1
6859,"Great app. when I do a search. I always get stuck for hours searching for random items that catch my eye. hit the save tab and more of those of those items appear. so I can compare different brands and prices. very addicting. Love it. James B, Los Angeles Ca",5
6860,so many scammers instantly contacting you and it's frustrating,3
6861,Viewers only looking not buying,3
6862,Is very fair they sell good things fair prices good for the community tell us that we could trust people selling and buying for cheap thing and more ....üòé,5
6863,"Love this app it has ALL U NEED to be exact, no matter what its is ur looking for, it's categories are always open an available to helping u with that perfect match, enjoy!!(:",4
6864,"I used this app and letgo a while back. Some things change for the worse in Tech. As an engineer (in commerce for over a decade) I haven't seen many apps take such a downhill spiral. The posting / buying part looks nice, but start clicking things on the wrong order and your app goes nuts. I updated the name to a listing and it deleted it (with all the details, serial, photos etc). There are about 99% bots, and customer service care 0. BEWARE",1
6865,just started using the app so far everything seems to work pretty well,5
6866,"this is one sorry app I have been looking at the ads and %90 of them were posted 3,4, or even as much as 6 years ago and no one that I messaged ever got back with me. Then the app keeps sending me emails saying that they give me a $30.00 dollar gift card just for advertising on there app but when I try to claim it it sends me to a page that it says doesn't exist and I've been getting like 3 a day now for the last week this app is a joke.",1
6867,Never let me down got two cars and PS4 and sold couple things too u looking for it they got it,5
6868,"Cant post anything cause everything I post violates their rules. Suspension can't post... car audio can't post... batteries can't post. It's a joke. Oh, and my rating is a negative star but I can't go that low. Such a stupid app where a distribution block for car audio violates whatever the HELL your dumba-s rule says.. you all should start using more manpower instead of letting computer algorithms run your app. Take more pride in your work and stop being lazy",1
6869,Easy to sell things!!,5
6870,This is a great platform to sell and buy I've used both and it's real convenient and straight forward. Two thumbs up.,5
6871,now they have ads on this thing interrupting the shopping experience.... making everything worse,2
6872,not user friendly.,1
6873,"I wish I could give them -5 star because i had an account for selling items, and i was doing well, but i sold a phone on someone. Which i bought from someone. He made a lost claim, and the phone got blacklisted. Buyer contact me, and i refunded his money back. Whatever we agreed on but still offer up blocked my account because he reported on my account. They dont even let me dispute the situation or something else. I dont think it's fear",1
6874,This is a good app only when serious people would use it. I listed about 4 items so far and sold one item. The one I did sell took a while as I had sort out the game players out there. Most I believe must have found it amusing to say they are interested only to drop out and suddenly become unavailable. Most people I've talked to say this is the app to use for better results. But so far I have not seen it. I've had better luck with Craig's list.,1
6875,"For the last few weeks im not able to search on other cities, which means i can not help my relatives in other state to look for stuff they want... i chose search by zip code and thr app freezes roght after i tap on the apply button, dont know why is that, tried reinstalling and didnt help. I guess is time to abandon ship...",2
6876,I absolutely don't even want to update anymore whatsoever every time I do there's more adds and more and more and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please let's us give 0 stars,1
6877,very great app I have already bought something from here and I love it,5
6878,Good place for a deal . But app loading slow for me .,4
6879,Post I made never appeared in my listings,1
6880,I paid $7 to boost my listing and now it says there's no listings so they stole from me,1
6881,"Sold my tv, easily and got the cash right away.",4
6882,app keeps freezing so I need to reset all the time.,2
6883,"It's hard to find anything good on here because half the stuff was posted 6+ months ago and never taken down. Obviouly no one ever responds to those posts and they clog up anything thatught actually be useful. Nextdoor, Craigslist, and Marketplace are all superior by far.",2
6884,I got shadow banned the first time.,1
6885,Best app ever,5
6886,it needs a milli second to catch up but it's really great.,4
6887,I like this app but I'm not sure how to do things privately.,5
6888,I can't stand what this company has become! Full of so many ads that get in the way! Full of old listings that should be deleted because either the item is sold and the poster forgot to take it down or they deleted the app and don't get messages. Craigslist for the win here. Where you have to renew your ad every 7 days to keep the list current. AND. They spam the pages with shipping items. Offer up is now a -10/10 for me.,1
6889,perfect person you would want to buy from,5
6890,"Fake emails about products that do not exist. Dangerous actually to have you randomly contacting people about things they didn't even post. Good way to rob people. Can't opt out of marketing emails, ND customer service page doesn't exist.",1
6891,Not very accurate search bar if I click pick up it should only show pickup kinda annoying,1
6892,App is trying to get me to buy stuff all across the US,1
6893,"seems I have many viewers on this site , and have sold more then half of my items on this site, thank you . Rbarnes -",5
6894,it's as addicting as any video game or drug. I always find myself looking through the items for amazing deals on tools.,5
6895,"it was way better before the ""updated"" it",2
6896,love it,5
6897,"It's used to be a good app, but not anymore. It has become slow, messages still show unread, notifications despite setting to not notification, way too many ads and commercial sellers, unable to filter by price, search location setting must be adjusted EVERY TIME you opened the app. I'm gonna have to Letgo....",2
6898,"I used this app for several months and had bought several items and already had 6 five star reviews, but then at a random time right when I was messaging a guy to pick up an item the app removes all my listings, removes the ability to message people, and basically blocked me from using their app until I became ""TruYou verified"" which REQUIRES me to send a PHOTO OF MY ID AND A PHOTO OF ME in order to get my account back. Support was absolutely useless, and there is no way I am sending my ID to OU",1
6899,to much old or sold stuff,2
6900,good app to sell anything!,5
6901,"I like the format and the option to peel through items close by . saves a lot of time eliminating the areas that aren't practical distances from my location. I like to know what's the most convenient option is and then work my way out , if that's even necessary.",5
6902,"Absolute dog water, I haven't been able to purchase anything because each time it wants me to scan my CC. I have tried 4 different CCs and just got a new Navy Fed card and still it won't go thro. I wish that feature got removed or you had a wallet to add funds too",1
6903,Would really like less scammers reaching out so hopefully they address that issue. Overall still a good app for reselling.,4
6904,"Ads, ads, ads, accidently click, your off and away. Craigslist uses ads sparingly! Does going premium suck less? Go premium and dont sell stuff 3x faster! My favorite part is the listings that are old... Not weeks, not months... But years! Like 5 years ago! Hello! Anyone reading these?",1
6905,"It is very simple to use, however, it is dangerous to give the buyer your phone number or address because of ID theft. How can you sell an item to someone, but cannot give them the address to pick it up or even look at it? This is the major problem.",3
6906,Terrible results I need to cancel now today November 10th 2023,2
6907,excellent good experience,5
6908,tight app. they do all the work 4 me,5
6909,You can find a very wide variety of things and at unbelievably great prices .Offer Up is definitely a must have app ..,4
6910,"my only problem is the customers who use this . alot of people done waisted my time agreeing to meet up but switch prices then blackmail me into selling it to them 4 they price or they leave me hanging if they not satisfied . always the last minute situation in the meet ups . please find a way so we keep these meet up legit, safe , and professional.",3
6911,there are to many promos,2
6912,super üëågood!.,5
6913,Feedback system is useless because everybody has 5 stars (buyers are as bad as craigslist and usually waste your time). Firm option should be enforced better as if you mark something firm you get just as many low balls all day. I don't like that toggle to stop them from selling your info is fake. It also sends you useless spam even if you uncheck all of the bull notifications.,1
6914,No good,5
6915,Good,5
6916,"Its a decent ap, usable if your phone has the memory.",4
6917,awesome Site,5
6918,"Best version so far , cars that J cat their converter, bikes that prove Adults would rather drive",5
6919,You can always find awesome deals!,5
6920,"There is to many ads , was good before they sold out.",2
6921,amazing,5
6922,too many recommendations not related to searches. clothes? really?,1
6923,"not as good as ""letgo"" which offer up consumed a couple years back but I guess it is better than Craigslist. my sales fell off probably 75% after ""letgo"" was let go.",3
6924,this is a good app.,5
6925,"Not a lot of activity on this app. I hardly sell anything on here, even things that have significant value. Facebook Marketplace unfortunately works way better.",1
6926,"Do NOT sign up for the free Premium trial. It is very difficult to cancel, the charge doesn't come up on Google Play subscriptions but your credit card does get charged *Update* On 11/01 OfferUp responded with an email. On 11/03 they understood the problem and the request to cancel Promote Plus was submitted. Please put that email for assistance on your website and app as you company does not give refunds and no way of cancelling before the 3 day trial ends. You basically got away with my money.",2
6927,"Just an update - the idea to make Offerup app only is killing it. FB marketplace is soooo much better. Example: sold an item, got an email to ""rate your experience"" but it doesn't resolve anywhere, not even on my phone/or the app. Can't rate people, so what's the point?",1
6928,"OfferUp prevents you from using their application with a VPN. They say it's due to only being able to use the application within the US. I am in the US, and my VPN is connecting via US servers. This feels like a dirty/cheap way to get customer data. I've deleted my account and will not be returning.",1
6929,"The update is annoying! Nobody wants your ads. If I share a link with someone, they are unable to open it unless they download your app. Not everyone wants your app on their phone! It was good before, I hate it now!!!!",1
6930,This is the best app to buy or sell your own products...,5
6931,when app 1st started was mostly real people selling stuff like yard sell & a few small Co. like pawn shops & similar style places. however now its mostly adds & false prices of $1 when the item really costs more. I have bought a few things on here but havent been able to sell anything because the notifications portion of the app never tells me when i get a msg from a buyer only tells me when it found more adds that are similar to recent searches. probably gonna delete app next forced autoupdate.,1
6932,A lot of items posted that are no longer available. Easier access to saved items would be nice,3
6933,Account disabled not allowed to make another one guess what I made another one posted 20 items mark them as sold p guess who I sold them to to me so I can write my own reviews to bring my new account with the same credentials as the last one PS I also posted the item that you violated me for and I sold it I win,1
6934,"easy to read and navigate (whe my tablet or phone are working properly, lol)",5
6935,"""is this available?"". Offer up, please let us block other users without ""reporting"" them. I just want to cut off the time wasting users on this app.",3
6936,"can't use with my VPN, so uninstalled. oh well. three stars because I hear mixed reviews.",3
6937,"Offerup just disappointed me. I had no issues up until today when I went to update a listing, it said my listing was removed. Removed because they now charge fees to post some things. But there was never any indication while editing the listing that said there would be a fee. Apparently limiting listing's, it's no longer free! Now there are ad popups, when there used to not be. Offerup has gotten greedy and now charges for listing's, charge to promote, charge to remove all the stupid ads.",1
6938,good item description,5
6939,"Miserable online experience, this used to be a decent app you could post your stuff and make money, then came the scammers after emails, and then ibstead of people posting stuff to sale they let the big box stores and sights take up 75% of the ad spots and pretty soon the little people were gone, now when u click on most ads it takes u to walmart, or ebay, or amazon, if i wanted to shop at those places do you think i would waste my time coming on offer up?, now the commercials,, GOOD BYE!",1
6940,Wow these new ads are ridiculous. If I have offerup still loaded but not actually on the app I still get these full blown screen ads that are extremely loud. I have now been interrupted twice when speaking with clients because of this and it is really embarrassing and should not be happening.,1
6941,"This has by far been the worst app with by far the worst customer service. Top it off they are thieves, Recently they started to offer a paid membership for $7.99 I decided to pay this the very next day I get a notification saying my account is disabled permanently for my improper post. I never posted anything. I have sent 17 emails over a 40day period not one reply to top this off they have continued to pull money out of my account. Still no reply from their CS Team. Liars and thieves.!!!!",1
6942,I like good business.,5
6943,"Terrible! It won't let me post, it just says ""failed try again"" And it just stays archived",1
6944,Helpful,5
6945,sold me a massage gun that didn't work,1
6946,offerup is ferry helpful,5
6947,Zero help dealing with scammers who filed an unauthorized charge for their Zelle payment 2 MONTHS after I loaded the items in their car.,1
6948,Super nice guy! Responsive and kind! Thank you!,5
6949,This app is an absolute joke.. they allow people on here to get robbed by liars and theives but offer no help...HORRIBLE APP good luck doing business on here...,1
6950,slow app,2
6951,It's not what it use to be before OfferUp took over.,2
6952,was 5 stars for years. i hate that the got freedy with the fee to sell stuff now,3
6953,Developer! offer up won't take my address it's the right address. The app has glitches and it doesn't respond when I order something.,2
6954,"This app has gone down hill. Can look up jobs now.. blah, it's harder to sort and find stuff because of the relevant ads. I miss the pre meger. Just like craiglist it's just changed, not as many people are using it and harder to sell things unless you pay to promote stuff.",2
6955,App is so glitches and is really unreliable I have a major hard time posting.,1
6956,good sight,5
6957,never no response,1
6958,"Very useful for finding cars, jobs and more.",5
6959,Even after disabling push notifications this app still sends you push notifications. Very annoying.,1
6960,App continues to provide notifications trying to get you to buy stuff after you've turned all notifications off. Uninstalled.,2
6961,"My postings don't appear when searched because a ""glitch"" locked my account. They flagged a legit item as fake. People are also flaky. It might not be entirely their fault because offer up mainly notifies you through the app, not necessarily email and never text. Messages don't get read by users right away. The experience has been frustrating.",1
6962,Good,5
6963,"No way to avoid dealer cars and when searching for slightly longer distance such as 80 miles, I get as far as Florida. Makes no sense",3
6964,Sadly its dead in my area. 50315,1
6965,"on time, good communication",5
6966,so many ads now make it pretty much unusable,1
6967,"if you're always on the budget like me,this is the perfect place to find what you may need for a portion of the real cost,. THANKS OFFERUP",5
6968,Stop sending me stuff I never look for.,2
6969,good app. for selling and buying.,5
6970,not very strict with sellers.,2
6971,Cool,5
6972,I used to like it now not so much . I've lost money selling through offerup shipped out a product out the very next day and offerup said it didn't get shipped out in time when in fact it did so y'all refunded my customer . Customer got the product and I didn't get paid for it. This has happened 3 time so I won't ship through offerup any more!!,1
6973,"The app is terrible, laggy, lots of ads, scammers, dealers, and more. I've been using this app since it took over let go. They also like to shadowban and take your items down without telling you.",1
6974,Offerup needs to add the technology were buyer and customer can send each other picture images of items the want to buy sale or trade before meet up with them.thanks.,5
6975,sucks,1
6976,"It seems every week they find new ways to put ads in. Overall the app works well but there are ads in place of nearly every other listing and now POPUP ADS... it makes me feel so disrespected, I don't even want to use the app anymore. What a shame.",1
6977,"Filters don't work. I tell it search within 30 miles of my city and it returns results 5 states away. I tell it to show closest first, same results. I gave up on this app 2 years ago. I made a mistake by trying to use it today.",2
6978,You have to pay 7.99 just to post an item to sell it horrible app don't download this it's worthless,1
6979,Omg spammer city I deleted my account nothing but spam,1
6980,"You don't even have to go against their guidelines or rules of posting, they decide whether you sell or not. My account was deleted overnight. I reached out and they restored my account but they deleted over 700 listings. Not to mention all the issues I had trying to sell on this app. This app is by far the worst app ever. DON'T BOTHER! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ‚ö†Ô∏è",1
6981,incredible app,5
6982,"kind ,respectable",5
6983,Ok,5
6984,better than Facebook,5
6985,"Now that they fix the vehicle and shipping scams that plagued this app for such an unreasonably long time, now the app is so slow it takes over 45 seconds to ""mark sold"" following an additional minute to minute in a half to mark who it was sold to. Tested over 30 other apps and my new tablet runs them all excellent. This app is the only one that runs this poorly. None are even close contenders.",2
6986,Meh,3
6987,No getting messages but got notification that i did,1
6988,kept asking for ratings. annoying.,1
6989,best ever offer upüëçüèΩ,5
6990,I love it,5
6991,Great way to sell unneeded items.,5
6992,"Slow, confusion using. The app.",2
6993,this is a wonderful app I like to call the garage sale of the Internet! No garage needed here! it's very convenient and categorized to search for whatever your heart desires. easy to ship and receive items as well. Perfect for browsing and overall great app,4
6994,"I have this account for long time. I bought a phone from someone that result it was stolen. I report it to offer up, and after that I received an email from them saying that I violated the community guidelines and my account was suspended. This people protect the thieves and don't care about other customers that lose their money. So people don't use this app.",1
6995,Great app Great,5
6996,you have to send in a picture of your id to post or your items get deleted,1
6997,Better than the best,5
6998,Intrusive ads. Too many scammers and stale ad listings. Slow app. Horrible experience.,1
6999,Can't do searches because shows me items n Kansas AND I AM IN HAWAII! Stupid app!!!!! No option to change location in search! Deleted !!!!!!!,1
7000,Love all the things that I can buy off the site,5
7001,The only thing I wish Offer up app did would be to auto delete old posts. There are items on here that are 1-2 years old.,5
7002,Everything is good with everything else,5
7003,"Excellent app, highly recommend.",5
7004,Messy app. Too many ads in the search results. Too many old posts and dead pages mucking up the place. Majority of sellers don't respond.,3
7005,so far so good,5
7006,Good üëç,5
7007,Glitchy and nothing but irrelevant ads. Shipping offers from across the states even when i search local. This app is a failure.,1
7008,Why not delete old post from 3 years ago smh Full with scammers,1
7009,the TV was advertised as free ... I felt I should pay something... I typed the guy 5. oo bucks... there for I get bragging rights... look at my 5 .oo dollar tv,5
7010,Horrible app. Mods appear to be racist. They don't care about your safety. I reported twice now that I have purchased cars on there that ended up being stolen cars. They did nothing. The same people are still there selling more stolen cars. But they will flag you for tiny infractions. And many people are complaining about being shadow band.,1
7011,"it's a perfect app, because help me to find everything what I looking for, thanks üëç.",4
7012,"No warnings with the use of this site, offer up deletes the account at their disgression, its okay though, we have other members that use this site, we'll continue our solicitation through our members.",1
7013,"love this app , everything you need can be found here , with no worries",5
7014,not worth the money,2
7015,Needs quality update. I'm seeing graphical glitches when swapping between apps on android 14. Phone also up quickly.,3
7016,The seller was very helpful.,5
7017,"A good way to find good deals, but I really dislike how I can't review a buyer or seller that agreed to meet and then just ghosts you. I had this happen this weekend with a seller that knew I was driving over and hour and a half, only to get there and they were not home or answering messages. I should be able to review this person to warn others.",3
7018,Very disappointed they will not let me post any health or vitamin items,1
7019,******üëç,5
7020,"It used to be a nice app, but with all the new stuff they put on it this app it sucks now, not recommended at all, Facebook marketplace is better if you looking to buy or sell something",1
7021,Make posts expire!!! Why are there so many posts from people that are 1+ years ago. Make these people renew or repost after let's say 30-45 days. There are hundreds of posts that are very old and the people never even respond.,3
7022,Updates keep making app more cumbersome to use. Too many abandoned postings.,2
7023,"The worst App for selling. I was warned about posting on this site specially here in South Florida, but I did because I needed to seel my priced belongings before I moved back to NYC. What I experienced was 97% of responses were SCAMMERS, BOTS, & TROLLS. then in addition to all that you get the lowest type of cheap, ignorant, and basically they expect you to ""donate"" your belongings as a ""charity "" I DON'T RECOMMEND SELLING STUFF ON THIS, UNLESS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH VERY CHEAP PEOPLE.",1
7024,Sssssmokin' !!!...,5
7025,perfect app for me!,5
7026,The app itself is not bad pretty easy to use and straight forward. The idea behind the app and the way users post is another story. There are users that post items extremely close to retail price. They also over price items that have so much wear and damage. It's just so interesting to me. I have found items and completed purchases through the app and that experience has been good. I just wish there was a way to not have people be so greedy! Always freezes now! Can never open app when needed.,2
7027,what I don't like about the app is that it does not work with many android phones,3
7028,Great service and very friendly.,5
7029,There are too many ads. I couldn't X out of some of them,1
7030,Always there when I need something!,5
7031,No option to renew your post unless you pay to promote it So your post gets lost,1
7032,"Slow + sometimes doesn't display items correctly by "" search"" ( ""newest "" items listed further down behind older listings of the same type/ keyword)",3
7033,app doesn't work. messages nor working,1
7034,I will start by giving the worst review.. I'm staying to sell hunting fishing..outdoor knives ... They are posted all over the site. All u have to do is type in ..knives. Of any type. If this is against rules. Why are they there? Makes no difference ..if it's a kitchen knife. ..any knife. So I get my whole account taken down. Because of it. I don't recomend this site to anyone. For anything....use market place. Or craigslist. It's easier anyway... And I will continue..to post these reviews...,1
7035,"Reasonably intuitive to set up listings. My biggest issue (unconfirmed if this is an S21 problem) being how terribly optimized the app is; every action takes has significant delay, and photos often require many 'try again' attempts to upload.",2
7036,well they ask right way,4
7037,To many scammers,1
7038,easy to use.,5
7039,"A nice additional resource, but I can't get notifications by text working, so I give out my number.",4
7040,Sucks,3
7041,Kinda can't sell anything,3
7042,PLEASE ADD A SELLER SEARCH OPTION,3
7043,Nothing but scammers.,1
7044,I love it u find anything here,5
7045,This is a great place to find lovely things,5
7046,nobody is buying my shoes,3

I have restarted my device and it still slow its doing the same thing with my wife's and kids device update 4/05/2023- update 11/04/2023 still not working properly it crashes , still slow. I have to use facebook market place and craigslist which I dont really like.",1

7055,Vendors take literal days to respond to you.,1
7056,Why can't I rate this for my laptop??I couldn't list an item on the site unless I download the app to my phone but then it won't let me edit the item on my computer where my pictures are stored. It's Terrible!!!,1
7057,I think that the app is great but I think that a lot of stuff is overrated,4
7058,love this app,5
7059,great app great prices,5
7060,It's alright for the most part.,5
7061,Not promote any more sales or anymore. Offers at items you suck.,1

7066,"""Unable to upload photos. Please try again""",1
7067,"This app has been reliably unreliable for the several years I've had it. Posting and checking your messages takes 20 minutes before it finally decides to load up. I almost never get notifications for messages when someone wants to buy something, but get ad type notifications multiple times a week. I've had this problem with several phones so I know it's not my device. Offerup, now that you're charging for vehicle listings you should be able to afford to fix the bugs you've had for years.",2
7068,This app was good I would always post and it would show now it just garbage to many adds and my post don't even show don't get this app,1
7069,great üëç,5

7080,I've changed my deposit account already. Thank you for letting me know.,5
7081,Offers up came to my rescue with my problem and solved it thanks for solving it in such a fast manner I will continue to do business with you I've been a member since 2016 and have made a lot of sales and purchases very happy thank you.üòä,5
7082,It's works out at times when you find the right deal.,3
7083,Everything I'm looking for at discounted prices!!,5
7084,it used to be good but to make it work like the way it used to you have to pay them $8 a month now. they should not have ads for other apps or things outside of the platform. when you search for something local you shouldn't be given things that are on Amazon that's not what we're looking for. if they keep giving this poor quality they're going to lose customers very quickly to Amazon and Facebook. they need to build a really nice community and not push their users away. stop being greedy,2
7085,"I really just love to use this app it's very easy to use, and I always find new and some gently used items and I've only had very postive encounters with all my interactions with sellers.Only negative is that I have yet to sell any of my items lol thsts on me not the app. keep up the good work offer up .",5
7086,It's a great place to sell your items. The only thing I will complain about is the app is a little slow but besides that it's golden.,5
7087,"App still super slow and buttons are non responsive, frustrating how slow it is to do anything not to mention ads everywhere and even forced pop up ads after exiting messages",1
7088,Glitch on the group by product on messages. Not grouping them ... It was doing it last week and now there's a problem.,3
7089,Got a new phone. Got logged out of old one. It's now wiped it's self of my account. so can't use that to help. On the new phone I put my email in and get the reset email. Then I press the rest in the email. It takes me back to the app and does not do anything else. I've uninstalled and done it multiple times...........,1
7090,I always find something good,5
7091,Somewhat a hustle helping hand,5
7092,excellent,5
7093,This app should have stayed with Let Go. No one ever answers ads on Offer Up.,1
7094,"I have had a few good experiences with offerup, thank you.",5
7095,"The app itself is fine, actually it does a good job showing me recommended stuff, but the quality of buyers and sellers is too low. It's simultaneously worse quality than FB marketplace and also casts a smaller net. So there's really no point in using this.",2
7096,Awesome map but it's more for the buyer..,5
7097,Not letting me sign or setup an account after my account was deleted,1
7098,"App is way too slow & gets stuck. Other than that, it's good.",1
7099,awsome,5
7100,this is a great place for buying thank you,5
7101,to much commercial advertising,2
7102,"offer Up sent a $30 gift card as a thank you for using their app. The link to claim the gift card was invalid. Thanks, Offer Up.",1
7103,"I'm absolutely disgusted. I've been messing and selling positively since 2020. Today my account got disabled for ""Not following the community guidelines"". When in reality I filled them. I messaged support only for them to lazily send me a automated message not telling me what I did, but only saying that I broke the rules, with no explanation. I spent over 2 years selling over 50 items and five star reviews only to have a prominent source of income ripped away from me.",1
7104,App is slow and buggy. The notifications are also really annoying and spam you weekly. If you disable notifications then you don't get notified of new messages. Really wish they would make the notifications work better.,1
7105,"I like offerup, but I really don't understand why we are being taxed all over again on something that we already bought and paid taxes on? Now that we don't like the way it fits you or not really into it anymore. if we resell it, we have to pay tax on it again. If you want to resell it again, you have to pay taxes on it again. But overall I like offer up",3
7106,"November 2023: I just updated to the newest version. Dark Mode no longer worked. After emailing O. Up, I received a fast reply how to fix it. Thank you. My earlier issue listed next, still applies. As of Sept. 2022: I get lots of fake ""new posts"" notices lately. Whether they say ""2, 20, or 200 new posts of XYZ..."" when you click on it, it takes you to your ""XYZ results you've already seen"" page. I have at least 3 saved searches doing this now on a daily basis. Sometimes twice a day. Please fix!",3
7107,Now that anything you post is held from being posted for half unless your premium is aggravating,2
7108,"okay app!... unlike ""letgo"" the shipping with taxes is a little over kill for buyer and seller!!!...but locally!!...the app is pretty cool!!....just beware of shady sellers. and remember to never send money to anyone other than through offerup!..",4
7109,Great selection,5
7110,"Great and easy to use, especially when you find a seller. That is hand trustworthy.",5
7111,the seller is awesome,5
7112,EVERYONE IS SCAMMING WITH THE SUPPOSED E-CHECK. FIVE PEOPLE INTERESTED. FIVE PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO SCAM ME. DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME.,1

7114,I think the app is rigged. Paying customers get their ads posted first while free posters are at the end. Too many scammers asking for personal info. App runs WAY too slow to spend any time with it. Absolutely terrible.,1
7115,Sucks no one hmu,1
7116,yeah it's good,4
7117,Very happy and satisfied with your service. Thanks so much!! keep up the good work,5
7118,Great,5
7119,I like it because I find everything!,5
7120,I keep getting an email for $30.00 rewards card for the site and I get sent to OfferUp app and the page is not available. I have tried Support from the app and it doesn't help.,1
7121,one word. ads,1
7122,Looked for an item and everything was listed 2 to 3 years ago... is this app even used anymore?,1
7123,Great app,5
7124,People more reality-based on OfferUp than FB Marketplace where 90% of the people are too messed up to buy or sell. But there's not enough people on OfferUp compared to FB marketplace,3
7125,it was a pleasant experience,5
7126,The best app to sell anything faster,5
7127,great,5
7128,It is useful but be prepared to get all sorts of nonsense notifications making purchase suggestions for things you never searched for even if you have all notification setting disabled (accept communicating with actual buyers),2
7129,I do not like this app. They should have never taken away the app that they replaced,1
7130,OfferUp is easy to maneuver easy to sell and they do everything,5
7131,website is always so slow.,3
7132,Yeah enough too bad do one of them more popular apps so above three not a five but a four,4
7133,üëç Great Service,5

7137,Sweet,5
7138,"New update, s**ks. Notifications don't come in and as a seller miss sells because of it. Ridiculous",1
7139,"nothing but window shoppers , scammers on this site . people post fake stuff all the time . offer up allows counterfeit stuff. when people send a message for meet ups nobody ever shows up . waste gas an time with people on offer up .",1

7142,Great app u always find what your looking for!,5
7143,Poor quality merchandise.,1
7144,Full of stolen items.,1
7145,Great,5
7146,"This app has either put my listings on the backburner after a few days or it doesnt show up amymore. It does not save your distance filter and seems to actually ignore it. I just put 5 miles and saw something in Iowa. Im in New England, like what? The ads are annoying. I get paying the bills but showing products to buy on different websites makes no sense. Good concept, decent app, but concerned with ease and functionality rn. EDIT: 1 star because I can no longer install on my Galaxy Note8. Sad.",1
7147,"great app, little slow loading but great way to get rid of cool stuff you don't want any more. make sure to meet in a safe place",5
7148,"misleading ads about ""sell 2x faster"" Does not work to accelerate sale.",2
7149,the app is the greatest.,5
7150,Was much better when it was Letgo. If you don't opt in for their payed service you'll never see your items listed on this site.,1
7151,Would rate higher but the app is very slow.,3
7152,Excellent job and great job,5
7153,Great place to buy and sale,5
7154,Didn't download,1
7155,Scam app not recommended,1
7156,don't quite understand the whole app yet but it does let you know when they find something you're looking for,4
7157,"None yet , but my told me about this.",3
7158,"As an app is the WORST and slowest. And now is getting full of ads and they charge to avoid ads??? Come on! You're supposed to get BETTER, not worst",2
7159,nice,5
7160,Hacked My account was hacked all my items I placed online were erased....beware folks!,5
7161,since updated see same items over and over. no new items for sale. see same category no new category or items. sucks now,1
7162,"There's a variety of things listed. Some negotiable, some not. Otherwise, I've been able to find some excellent merchandise for the price .",5
7163,For some reason it's not working right now? It just says sorry something is wrong when I open it.,2
7164,"This app is really getting aggravating I have it set to my location and when pushing to search my area within like 5 miles and pickup only. It's still picking up every state or so it seems . I've Uninstalled the app and reinstalled , I've cleared my cache etc. I don't know what's wrong. But I keep feeling like not even messing with it anymore and Uninstalling it altogether.",2
7165,"Please give a, complete details.",1
7166,great app speaks for itself,5
7167,"I rarely review apps but I had enough of this one. Even after turning off all optional notifications except the bare essentials to notify me of the item I'm selling, I still get notifications regarding things I am not interested in. The last straw was just a few minutes ago. Another notification that came through their chat system. If you turn this off you can't receive messages from potential sellers. A complete waste that is basically spam. Also, old items left for months....deleting...",2
7168,OfferUp premium is a scam. Got charged $20 to promote an item and it's sitting at zero views. Total rip off.,1
7169,GREAT,5
7170,Made it right!!,5
7171,"This app sucks. I've had no luck selling anything. No hits, minimal views. Letgo was so much better, I sold many items on there years ago in just a matter of days. There are posts that are several years old which goes to show how useless the app is and how little offerup actually cares about their users experience and how little it's maintained. If it is at all. The UI is bland and outdated and worthless for keeping users engaged and they don't care about any of the complaints we have either",1
7172,Good,5
7173,No comments,3
7174,I've had some sucess on this app,5
7175,"I disabled all notifications (which is purposely made tedious) except direct messages but still get push notifications for ""things I might like"". The only solution is blocking OfferUp notifications at a system level but then I have to remember to check for responses to my listings making the app very impractical.",2
7176,"Slow, glitches too much, doesn't even let me cancel my subscription smh",1
7177,Good,5
7178,number 1 app in American!,5
7179,"Professional, Friendly and prompt",5
7180,"This app are BS, I try to list a sale , but next day tahet take done my sale with out any notice or do not tell me why they take down, then I try to list again, they gonna charge me the money!!!",1
7181,I'm. very. happy. offer. up.,5
7182,awesome üëç easy to use,5
7183,This is a horrible app operating system that is nonsense now charging to post ads. Seller buyers are Liars waste time low baller Do not download this app dose not work and freezing all time just garbage app don't waste your time.,1
7184,Good. I like the way it looks and is very good,5
7185,"Easy, safe buying.",5
7186,App not allowing you to message back,3
7187,Looks good I found what I was looking for.,5
7188,app works to slow people should remove things after 2 years of not selling or auto delete it just saying,3
7189,Really buggy and unreliable app and slow customer support. Look elsewhere if you're trying to sell anything in a hurry.,1
7190,Good,5
7191,"I only want notifications for messages, and turned off all others. Why am I still getting other types of notifications?",2
7192,challenges to sell,3
7193,I used to love the app but lately it seems full of scammers.,1
7194,"Junk , 90% are amazon adds.",1
7195,OfferUp would be much more useful if ads could be created on a computer rather than just by using this app.,3
7196,Won't allow me to answer people and no update found,1
7197,This is the greatest app.,5
7198,You should wipe away ithem that not been sell in maxim 30day cus no one asnwer whem u ask is still for sale . Old product still for sale without the seller. Why dont just eliminated the product on sell. That simple. That save time to new users,1
7199,"They offer Promote Plus for a free 3 day trial, you cancel it before the end of the trial, they charge you and will not refund. Very sketchy, promote plus was useless anyway.",1
7200,awesome app lots of good deals. also helps put a penny in my pocket when I'm in need.,5
7201,I love offer up it so easy to navigate and searech thought ittems that you need or looking for,5
7202,"slow, not refresh or update contents as fast as the website. need better way to filter search result.",1
7203,Ok,5
7204,It's gone downhill fast,1
7205,great way to buy and sell,5
7206,Offer Up is a great site and easy to use! I've met a lot of great people in my dealings,5
7207,shopping made easy,5
7208,"Far more headache than it's worth, lots of scams and nonexistent customer service.",1
7209,a great app! I have had nothing but success with them.,5
7210,too much lag...,1
7211,great app,5
7212,Can't do anything without the app. Can't add a profile photo. Can't even delete your account. Absurd you need an app to do basic things.,1
7213,"Some of the Seller don't really want to Negotiate Prices even though they ask for ""Best Offer"" on their Posting. My acct. Had been terminated by Offerup but with No time Restrictions. So if you get terminated buy OfferUp, I'm guessing you can't come back to it.‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è. FYI Offerup. If your here to help, then why can't you help me? No Warning what so ever. Hello! ""They don't like bad reviews.....",3
7214,Good place to buy or sell in today's economy.,5
7215,easy to use,5
7216,"It appears to have trouble, when driving, getting messages through. Some of mine had said delivered, then they disappear. Sometimes I can't get it to work at all. Otherwise, good app.",3
7217,thus far every item I've clicked on that I'm interested in buying I've got no response and the item I'm selling has had not even one view...,1
7218,"I post items for sale and they don't show up for sale on my phone app. I also am not getting notifications when someone makes a offer on one of my items. I do often find offers on my desktop site in the spam folder. Even though, I have OfferUp as a allowed site.Yes, it is a nicer site than CL, but I really have to work to get my items sold. Not easy to sell sometimes. PLEASE fix these issues...!",3
7219,"Super glitchy. I missed out on purchasing something because the sellers repsonse to me didnt come through for several days. By then, they had already sold the items. Also I keep putting my settings for local pickup and I still kept getting results from other states.",2
7220,Offer up does not let me post wanted ads for certain items. All items actually kind of sucks.,3
7221,Loved it until is stopped working for me.,1
7222,Customer service is the absolute worst. No protection if you get robbed,1
7223,no sells dry now,1
7224,It's getting worse with a lot of spam and ridiculous links to links to links if you want to find something good and you want to waste your time you have to dig through it and find the legitimate ads,1
7225,Rated 1 star because OfferUp tends to discriminate against users trying to sell certain apparatuses I tried to sell a vaporizer and my account got flagged meanwhile there are people on there selling weapons and they are still allowed to sell them they discriminate against certain users as per Pennsylvania state law it is not a legal to sell a vaporizer this app sucks and discriminats against users... I have moved for a class action suit against OfferUp for discrimination and unlawful censorship.,1
7226,"I used to love this app, but ever since it merged with Letgo the advertisements have become out of control. I'm all in favor of ads to support a product. The problem is the advertisements are now in the way of the apps functionality.",2
7227,Like all this stuff!!!,5
7228,Very little activity unless you pay to get your products moved to the top.,1
7229,Very nice up,5
7230,on time,5
7231,Would not open!,1
7232,Nice üëç,5
7233,Since I use the app I'll give 2 stars. Insane amount of scams. Millions of bots asking if it's available.. now search feature isn't working. Go to look for a car type in the make and nothing pops up. But when you scroll with out searching you see the vehicles. Probably bc I don't pay for premium.,2
7234,This site is so stupid I posted a fridge and a cage from an exotic pet I had and they banned me I emailed and.of.course some bot finally got a legit person who had attitude and.said they reserve the right to remove any account don't waste your time with this site go to other local sites to sell or buy,1
7235,"Good concept, bad execution. Way too many ads/scams even when filtering by pick-up only. My account got hacked a month ago and despite changing pword I watched in real time as someone messaged people pretending to be me. Was forced to delete the account and emailed them about the issue (I didn't want to lose my good rating). Their response? Sorry to see you go, thanks for using Offerup. I just can't trust this app anymore.",2
7236,"it used to be great app, but now is to much of a cash grab, if you don't pay you don't sell. and if you are selling something for 8 to 20 $ paying for promotion is not practical. it contributed to pricing go up",1
7237,terrible this app shows you things that have been sold for weeks.,1
7238,great app for sales,5
7239,"The most clunky app I used daily. Legitimately so slow, if I click something it takes like 4 seconds to load, and oftentimes when I open the app it goes to some weird page saying I don't have any messages, so I have to refresh for a minute straight until it loads my messages. I have no idea how this app is so widely popular and yet it's the clunkiest app on my phone.",2
7240,"Offer charges, has bots post daily , lots of ads , and their support team is worthless .. ill stick with FB marketplace of Craigslist",1
7241,"Horrible slow app, horrible customer service only through the chat. and why you remove the prices from listings, now you need to click on the icon to see price!",1
7242,I give it a 10,5
7243,Gotten lots better üòâ,5
7244,"No one replies.....have had friends reply to same ads to verify, but same.issue....NO ONE REPLIES!!!!....offer up is a joke",1
7245,The new pop up ads are very intrusive. I will still use it but would recommend Facebook marketplace instead.,3
7246,Love how convenient and user friendly it is. Easy to search for great deals and sell my own items too,5
7247,good,5
7248,I used this app to sell items when I moved out of my apartment. One user I dealt with broke into my old building and stole an item that was still there. A neighbor confirmed this to me and I confronted the user on the app for payment. After refusing I reported him to Offerup and they did nothing. They suggested I file a report with the local police but I was no longer in state and they made no effort to rectify the situation. The user could very well still be on their platform scamming people.,1
7249,My account got stop. Needs cell number. Won't work w my cell number.,1
7250,I love offer up it helps me make ends meet so thank you offer up,5
7251,This is by far the one of the best apps to sell.,5
7252,good business everytime,5
7253,"Worst support ever, you can't talk to a real person no matter what. Just replying your mails with some automatic answers.",5
7254,"As a seller, I was hopeful with this app. but I've had very little success. Other platforms are much better. As a buyer, I find it extremely annoying that there are items years old still showing. it makes the app. very messy. I end up frustrated and shop elsewhere. üò§ LetGo was MUCH better. OfferUp needs to ""clean up the house"" ""throw out the trash for gosh sakes"" for a better user experience. it wouldn't take much to make it a successful app.",1
7255,"No one responds to questions, and items are usually listed wrong. App isn't really the problem, but someone needs to do something or this app is done",1
7256,"Make it so pictures can be uploaded, so many people looking for trades but we cant exchange trade photos in the messages",3
7257,it works,5
7258,good üëç,5
7259,"Excellent app,very helpful",5
7260,"Slow, spammy, and still sends push notifications for product recommendations to my phone even though I tried to disable those notifications in the settings. Unwanted notifications is like unwanted touching. Feels dirty. This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to give a negative review on any app.",1
7261,"App randomly decided I needed a phone number and shut all my listings down. When I tried to give it my phone number, app won't accept it. Had people meeting up tonight that I can no longer contact. Only had positive dealings with people buying and selling. The ironic thing is OfferUp just sent me a notification warning me not to share my phone number... and then demanded my phone number. Edit: support was no help, just told me my phone number should work without trying to solve the issue.",1
7262,maybe 2 messages zero buyers,1
7263,very kind and helpful,5
7264,People never answer,2
7265,"OfferUp was good, but is now trash. They don't respond to complaints. I bought an iPhone advertised as a brand a new 13 Pro. It looked like a real iPhone 13 Pro and had correct box but was a modified X. I tried to activate but IMEI didn't match box. I tried to contact the seller but no response. He didn't mark the item as sold to me so I couldn't rate him. I reached out to OfferUp 3 times. I never heard anything except the automatic email. UPDATE: I also added a review on Google reviews.",1
7266,This app only helps if you have thousands of dollars worth of items to sell. Trying to sell odd items here and there is pointless on this app.,1
7267,Easy to post easy to edit if youess up or want to change prices.,3
7268,Offered me a 3 day trial for a single item promotion and charged me 21.64 even though I canceled subscription the next day,1
7269,It's ok,1
7270,good app,5
7271,"This app is soo fricken slooow, it's ridiculous. Used to be better. The page layouts for several different screens within the app aren't designed as well as they previously were and there is less information provided than before. The prices used to stick out and be easily and quickly noticeable, now they're just another line in the description. Such a hassle to change the price of something",1
7272,buggy and slow,1
7273,I love the app. But it's so. Sluggish. Like incredibly sluggish to the point of getting me mad. I have a Pixel 7. It's just this app that's slow on my phone. It's bizarre and upsetting.,3
7274,awesome,5
7275,"1 star until I can change the default radius, seemingly nothing stored locally to device, bad when cell service is poor",1
7276,Smooth transaction. The seller was polite and punctual to our meeting site. The product is just as described. Definitely 5 stars.,5
7277,"Since recent forced update, app is so incredibly slow, buttons not responding to touch until 3rd or 4th try, every screen load takes way too much time...saying this as someone who has the patience for things generally. Tempted to stop using and finding another avenue to sell items because of the poor app experience in the updates.",2
7278,Literally gets worse with every single update,1
7279,Lots of annoying ads,3

7282,I posted a car for sale Within 20 mins it was removed stating I had violated some policy but no details a to which policy. They would not let me edit the posting. My only option was to create a new one for 7.99 a month because you can only post one free car posting a month. So I emailed them for there bad business practices accusing them of only deleting my posting in an attempt to get money. There response was to delete my account entirely and tell me that I can not create a new account.,1
7283,It was a pleasure doing business with this seller through Offer Up. Great app for the sellers as well as the buyers!,5
7284,Items stay on the app for years. Sellers don't respond in a timely manner. Recommends items across the country when I have it set for 20 miles.,1
7285,"Unbelievably slow. Does not respond when you tap on something. I have to tap something multiple times for the app to respond. Tapping a push notification about messages just takes you to the main page, instead of directly to a message or whatever the notification was about. A lot of activity that should be expressed as a notification doesn't pop up on the phone, such as a sale/purchase or someone messaging you about a product. I also can't post anything w/o the app.",1
7286,The platform works to buy and sell. I absolutely hate that the system has no expiration date. My other big complaint is that scammers are taking over and very little is being done. Why can't I default to see only items within 10 miles of me. You suck offerup!!,1
7287,"My complaint isn't the app itself, it's the lack of integrity of every person I've interacted with. I've had the app 2 weeks and have tried to purchase items 3 times. Each time the person strung me along, asked for more money after I sent payment for the item or I drove an hr to someone's house for them to say they changed their mind. Not sure if it's a known app to scam ppl, but obviously it's not working for me",2
7288,Decent app,4
7289,"Conceptually, good. Functionality? There are so many glitches in the app-ware that I couldn't rate it higher. But, it does what it says it does, not too many ads, and both buying and selling are easy.. except you must allow a LONG TIME to do anything. Currently, my app (latest version, updated) will only change screens for the top third of each screen. The bottom two-thirds is always stuck on the home page. It's not always this SAME problem, but there always is SOME problem.",2
7290,I'm scrolling down and all of a sudden I have a small rectangular screen like it's zoomed in on the photo and it won't leave until I close the app down,1
7291,They buy letgo just to ruin it and make a terrible app,1
7292,I like the hole platform and ease of access,5
7293,good experience. people tend to be reliable. friendly and honest,4
7294,"Not as user-friendly as I would expect. The functionality (to be able to update a listing, for example) is very different on a mobile app, than if I am on my laptop.",3
7295,awesome app,5
7296,love it,4
7297,App works but it is low quality. very laggy. Update: Too many ads. Deleting.,1
7298,Cool shopping app.,5
7299,Worst experience i have had with an app in a long time downloaded and immediately had problems with the program add things for sale and it removed one and never showed the other anyways tried to get help with customer service they suggested a few things i tried but didnt help then more problems and i had it would not recommend,1
7300,Love it,4
7301,I dont like that some thing are prohibited. It is slower now then before and you dont get notifications updates or sounds anymore,2
7302,Good Person excellent to work with looking forward to doing more business with him,5
7303,slow and notifications sux.,3
7304,I'd give it half a star but that's not an option. Administration needs a lot of work. This app isn't user friendly at all in that regard. if there is a phone number available that I could actually speak to someone in authority it would be appreciated.,1
7305,on point.. exactly as described works perfect üôåüèº,5
7306,I just got scammed. the sell charged my debt card but did not send the item and the team at offerup are just ignoring me,1
7307,"so many ads, poor search functionality, really hard to find what you're actually looking for. not sure why this app even still exists. it's owned by Facebook they should just combine it with marketplace.",2
7308,very simple and easy to you,5
7309,"App sucks , no matter how i set the parameters I can't find my own listing for sale so obviously nobody is seeing it unless I pay offerup the item promotion fee,... (update) I tried to sell a cosplay sword and they accused me of trying to sell a weapon lmao and deleted it but, before I posted I looked and saw other cosplay swords listed, AND REAL SWORDS sold by major sellers like Amazon and other manufacturers, so I have to be a corporation to have this privilege,surfdom still alive and well",1
7310,The app is broken. You are assaulted by adds till the app freezes or shuts down. Broken app,1
7311,too many advertisements,1
7312,Little slow and laggy but good app,4
7313,Love it,5
7314,Michael was polite and pleasant.,5
7315,this app is very helpful and legit. I definitely would recommend people to use this app if they want to buy and sell items.,5
7316,"This app flagged my account thinks I am a scammer, really OfferUp. UPDATE 10/24/2023 Offer up still can't make things right this is ridiculous. Still won't allow me because I don't have a number you know if I had a job it would be possible. Oh and I still can't respond to other buyers because of this.",1
7317,good stuff thanks,5

7328,"Doesn't let you cancel ""promote plus"". Makes you mark unsold items as sold if you can't find a buyer. Only low ballers and not serious buyers.",1
7329,stupid app. requires phone number in the middle of transaction and erases texts,1
7330,"Let me start off by saying that my buying and selling experience with this app has been great. That is not why I am giving a 1-star review. The 1-star review comes from the customer service, or should I say, ""the lack thereof"". I get it, there are rules and guidelines but if making a simple mistake gets you banned, that is a bit ridiculous. I sent an email asking what I did wrong. They responded by saying, OfferUp reserves the right to remove profiles at its own discretion without waring. Thank",1
7331,Never sign for monthly subscription,2
7332,they switched up the sell method to limit us and profit off of us. it's a no for me,1
7333,"Not good,can't even get back on the site. And then mention that theres going to take a payment for something I haven't even got yet or will get as far as that goes. Better not try to charge my card for anything!",1
7334,"Not the same as when I first started using this app a long time ago, plus tons of inconsistent, inconsiderate, disrespectful people on here, bunch of flakes and trolls, not so great of an app anymore and now there's all these people advertising their business and ads. I don't like it anymore, not friendly and not easy to sell your used goods anymore. It sucks.

7358,love offerup,5
7359,"It's hard to sell on this app. There's way too many ads like Amazon and others that get more attention and create competition with us everyday locals just wanting to sell used and unused items. Also, the ap sends the same text message twice for one message???",3
7360,I can't use the app on my phone,1
7361,People who r selling stuff.. I don't respond!! Besides that.. pretty good site,2
7362,This app needs an expiration date to remove post that are old. A lot are years old. Needs more category options in listings.,1
7363,"Won't let me send messages to anyone or verify my phone because ""it doesn't seem to be a us number"" BRUH JUST SEND ME THE CODE",1
7364,"If you wanna see posts from 5 years ago for nearly everything you search this is the site for it, offer up might be the worst buy/ sell platform on the internet",1
7365,"awful buggy app, absolutely hate this app with a passion. never works correctly, constantly freezes or lags, sometimes just shuts down all together. they really need a whole new redesign this app is depressing. If I didn't have to sell locally, I would likely never use this app again",1
7366,Got antique table.10$,2
7367,Small text and laggy...,2
7368,Why the hell is the price not showing until i click on a listing. Half of these are fakes... Use Facebook marketplace instead... They have a good idea here and these devs are about to screw it up because of ego and push for bottom line. But they will loose out on the current customer base and it's going to just get harder to make money with the force clicks,1
7369,"got a gmail from someone named dora, not thru the site or app. she wanted to buy my Toyota. will i thought and I can think, and replied to the gmail. lol it was offer up in Washington state. they did not want my car and I did call them on it not knowing who had sent the gmail. hears what they said. you don't like it, unsubscribe. lmao so u know what ima gonna do, yep unsubscribe. yall take care and fair wind fill your sails.",3
7370,"Just pictures in search results, very inconvenient",1
7371,"seems everybody on this site wants everything for nothing, cheap people.",3
7372,easy to use and communicate with sellers,5
7373,"Found a beautiful bedroom set, very reasonable.",5
7374,"Notification categories are unclear. Provide specific info on the category type. All just say ""offer up""",1
7375,awesome app.,5

7380,üëç good,5
7381,Great app,5
7382,"As many users have said, the ads are unbearable and even pop up in my actual DMs for listings and it lags. It's also deleted some posts of mine out of nowhere for no reason, which is annoying given I had actual buyers ready to pick up some items and now I have to repost them and start from scratch.",2
7383,great app just don't like waiting on responses,4
7384,Offerup subscription is almost impossible to cancel. I'll never advertise again.,2
7385,"I posted 4 items over the years and I have zero views. I try to buy things and not one seller replies. why is this happening to me. it is all fake and controlled, it seems. very angry on what my experience is on this app.",1

7387,ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©üôÇ,5
7388,could be better by updating the feed when i open the app. every time i open the app it still has old feeds from months ago,2
7389,great,5
7390,"I like this great advice, I learn more things about it",5
7391,Too unreliable,1
7392,I love selling on your site,4
7393,Horrible. Can't even get a single view in an item anymore unless you pay. Trash,1
7394,"I give this app 5 stars! It's helped me get my business off the ground to a slow roll but we have movement! Only thing I'd like to see, is to be able to have a store description so I can promote future events or discounts. Other than that I'm happy with the app!!",5
7395,love it,5
7396,priced several items very low. no takers. FB marketplace is a better choice.,1
7397,it works to dang slow. everything I have to check a message or message someone it takes so long I forget that I was answering messages and loose customers. everything I want to ask about something I get forced ads that add to the long wait times as it . I have better odds of selling on market place or craigslist because of these glitches that are on this sight. was way better sight before letgo took over,1
7398,Good,5
7399,Used to be way better but ads jobs and ads and more fees for shipping and whatnot... Premium Mode never made much of a difference for me when I tried it esp in recent years.,3
7400,I have to say that of all the sellers apps that offer up is my favorite no one has ever tried to scam me there like they try on marketplace and that makes all the difference in the world to me!!!!!!,5
7401,Great App!,5
7402,"UPDATE: I can not honestly recommend OfferUp to ANYONE. The app is garbage. It's flooded with ""verified local businesses"" that take up the majority of the posting space and do not update when an item isn't available. A lot of these businesses are terrible at responding. There isn't even an option to hide posts from a user that scammed you. Don't waste your time if you're looking for an app to buy locally. Just use FB Marketplace or something that sucks less than OfferUp.",1
7403,All old ads,1
7404,"I thoroughly enjoy ""window"" shopping on the Offer Up site!!! And...Sometimes I ""go in"", because the prices are affordable, I browse some more and BUY!!! ITS FUN!!!",5
7405,"never had a issue, I recommend doing your research before buying anything",5
7406,"I only got messages with ""Is this item still available?"", but nothing else. Couldn't sell anything.",3
7407,Great app but since the recent update I can no longer view items near me. Only items from other states show up. Fix it please.,1
7408,Stopped working recently. Won't open the app at all on my phone just frozen. I use this all the time so I hope they can address it. Note 10+ version 4.1 is corrupt.,2

7412,happy,5
7413,The free 3 days automatically turns into 19. 99 a month. They steal your credit card information off Google play without you pressing subscribe!! It's hard as he'll to cancel them.,1
7414,"Awful UI, the app is a hot mess to navigate or find anything on, and if you search anything even once you'll get notifications about it every god damn day. Awful app",2
7415,Cool.,5
7416,"Do NOT get fooled by the 3 day ""free"" trial. You actually need to cancel the second day. On the third day, they enroll you for a month. They also don't let you cancel through the ap. You need to go through the playstore. It's confusing to ensure they get at least one month out of you. It also only lets you promote one item at a time. It's not worth it!!",1
7417,you can find lots of things here,5
7418,this site says they don't but they do a lot of shadow banding were no one will see your listing it there way of getting you to pay there premiums,1
7419,very helpful and useful!!,4
7420,I'm having problems selling my post won't go up,5
7421,Offerup said I had afended someone when I'd never even remotely came close to having g an altercation and they shut down my account with no explanation. Now I can never have another account. They won't even tell me what the incident was about. There was none. They made it up. I'm so disappointed.,1
7422,"I reside in Southeast Idaho, and the application says I'm not in the USA. Last time I checked the map, Idaho, the only state in America, shaped like a gun üî´ IS west of Wyoming, and southwest of Montana, is north of Utah and borders both Oregon and Washington, so SOS developers need to get together and figure out how Idaho is NOT in America?

7424,"Not to positive,...",1
7425,got alot of good stuff,5
7426,Too many intrusive ads. Many sellers confused regarding how their items are available for shipping when they wanna do local only. No way to leave comments in seller/buyer reviews. Your pricing for promotions is too much money. Lost my business as a result.,1
7427,I thought this app was free,1
7428,App is painfully SLOW! Spam notifications for items like what you've searched for are put into a folder under your inbox tab where you receive messages about items you're selling. A notification bubble shows like you've received a message about an item your selling and disabling the notification does not work. The support process is pathetically horrible. *Update to the OfferUp response- 3 emails and your team just repeats the same garage that doesn't work. Move the folder out of the Inbox,2
7429,"You have to be careful because sometimes people will be fake. I've experienced that. However, it's a good place to sell and purchase items.",5
7430,Great,5
7431,"once upon a time offer up and let it go we're both great apps.... Today this app has completely wasted my time, I been I this app for years and but now they updated I have ZERO reviews on hot ticket items like Yeti cooler very awesome product zero reviews, and the twelve posts have zero reviews.... Everyone just delete this app now and let find something better",1
7432,"Won't load anything. For several months the app just says ""sorry, something went wrong"" every time I open it. I can't even try to log in.",1
7433,Good,5
7434,"With the new paid premium subscription model and their constant add spam this app has become almost unusable. Every other listing is an add. Often more ads than listings, lol. People gaming the price search by simply listing stuff for 1$. They are forgetting Facebook marketplace and Craigslist are completely free. It's becoming carbage and u really don't need to use Offerup at all with so much great alternatives, lol.",1
7435,slowest app ever takes more than. a minute just to change screens click min + go back min + get in the app 5 min + exit freezes can't even reply on time to anyone,1
7436,Good way to save a buck n make a buck,5
7437,I love Offer Up. I buy a lot of my ELVIS PRESEY items. I always find unique treasures.,5
7438,"Dangerous and awful place to try and sell something. Full of scammers and A.I. bots that waste your time. OfferUp uses A.I. chat bots to send you messages so you think your items are generating a lot of interest. Shameful, manipulative, time wasting practice. Should be illegal.",1
7439,"The exercise bike was in great condition, just as pictured.",5
7440,Not good costumer service!!! I still waiting answers for service 5 days.,1
7441,"Poor...makes it very hard to cancel free trial. want to cancel after one day and it's impossible to find where to do it on the app. To make matters worse you have to cancel one day PRIOR TO AHE 3 DAY TRIAL. POOR, POOR, POOR",1

It goes like this, in an email no doubt. Can u uninstall & reinstall the app? Yes many times Which version R u trying 2 use? what service provider do u have? what type of phone? How about like I suggested delete my account & lets start over. Oh hell no thats not about 2 happen offer up wont do that. WHY? BUBYEüëé",1
7443,I like this app. easy-to-use.,5
7444,It is a good app. Thank you offer up,5
7445,"It used to be great for buying and selling. many people don't respond or forget to mark their items as sold. It's terrible now with the ads. When searching for items locally, it only shows shipped items. I had to Uninstall and install the app for it to work properly.",2
7446,Dreadful. They decided my items were against there standards which is sad,1
7447,It doesn't matter how much data I have available or how good my WiFi strength is this app is always slower than molasses everything takes at least a minute or more to load. It definitely has made it to where I am using the app less and less it is discouraging.,1

7456,"Very happy with the user friendly app, quick response and simple transaction from this seller. A+",5
7457,Love to sell and purchase items on offer up. It's easy and convenient.,5
7458,Everything is done with thumbnail photos. Takes to long to get info for each item. FB marketplace is still king.,1
7459,It can be a really good app if they could just fix a couple of cinks out.the most frustrating thing about the app is how slow it is!!üò≠,3
7460,It's not as good as I remember.people are just rude and antagonist.,2
7461,be careful and seek carefully without giving out addresses and names,5
7462,Nothing is local at all. Literally nothing and everything is just insanely expensive.,1
7463,"I bought something over a year ago, I have not received it yet. Every time i click chat, it redirects me to common question facts thats totally unrelated.",1
7464,very nice,5
7465,"A very bad app. Is a serious waste of time. Can't name all of the scams and scalper posts I've seen on here not to mention how much they push ""offer up shipping and promotions"" onto there users.",1

7467,"It's an easy, quick way to sell items.",5
7468,it loads to slow,1

7471,people if ur not interested in buying don't waste others time,4
7472,so friendly and accommodating!,5

7474,"Today I was banned for with no reasonable explination. I just got an email saying my account was removed for violating community guidelines. Ok, what exactly was the alleged post that I put up that violated your rules? Because the last time I interacted with anyone was a few months ago, and those messages were all legit. If you're gonna ban someone, reference the post so we can learn from our mistake, or in my case, fight the charges, because OfferUp is clearly in the wrong.",1
7475,"offerUp, become part of my life, is a relief, life saver, many times I needed money to pay a bill or buy something, offerUp was there, just on time , always a smile after the notification sound.",5
7476,Great! thank you üòä,5
7477,This app will not allow me to post unless I do tru you and I do not have an I'd so it gets one lonely star from me.,1

7488,Steals and Deals ALL DAY. Great for thrifters and collectors too üëçüèªüîñ,5
7489,excellent,5
7490,Destroyed with pop up ads and full of delivery ads. I get it must make money but at least do the ads right now those cheap annoying ads. Also when I try searching just for local pickup it forces delivery. Offerup was great before this.,1
7491,you guys have taken a good product I made it impossible to sell on here anymore,2
7492,cool app,5
7493,Love it!,4
7494,"all my offers have zero views, was told it was a glitch by customer support yet they never fixed the problem",1

7497,Very user friendly and I just love the OfferUp app!,5
7498,"Too many scams. Don't bother making a complaint about the scams Offer Up does nothing about it. It would be so simple to clean up the scams, but they make more money if it seems like they have more items. Do better Offer Up",2
7499,Extremely slow and glitchy.,2
7500,haven't gotten a bad deal once üòÅüò¨üëç,5
7501,Does not work with a US based VPN. My location is on. So VPN shouldn't be an issue.,1
7502,"Completely useless app now. You are basically FORCED to buy their expensive monthly promotion or else you get NO REPLIES. The replies you do get are people who message the default ""Hello I'd like to buy this"" and then they never message again after you reply. Dead app, I've used it since 2015 and it's been a steady decline all the way to the rock bottom state it's in now. Do NOT download this app, just let it die already. I recommend Mercari over this useless service. Much more traffic",1
7503,2023.. App running very slow. And the premium price is crazy.,1
7504,awesome! give offerup a RAISE!!,5
7505,I have a S23 Ultra but it won't let me download it,1
7506,easy to use.,5
7507,great support in times of glitches,5
7508,Couldn't even get a bike...,1
7509,Used to be pretty good but I never get people getting back to me and it breeds flaky people. I went back to the good ol craigslist,1
7510,This will change when yall change something. I've had things posted for months and they still have 000000 reviews I'm posting more stuff but now I'm afraid of doing so because I have zero reviews for no reason?!?!?! What the hell is going on bro. üò°,1
7511,good bargains that I could not find anywhere else,5
7512,Horrible horrible customer service! They deactivate my account without reason or explanation and then don't respond after asking why they did it? I've emailed more than 5 times over a month and no one has responded. Update: They asked me to email me on here and I did on 10/10/2023 and they still haven't responded.,1
7513,so many items to where to look for,5
7514,"people come and view my things, the majority buy them I'm not just trying to make a buck I like to give a good deal as I like to purchase a good deal.",5
7515,My post is repeatedly being taken down and no one can seem to explain to me why.,1
7516,Already verified. But app still made me lose customers. F this app,1
7517,Horrible!!,1
7518,one of the best secondhand deal app for local goods being sold or bought at great prices easy to use and communicate with sellers and buyers. filters to find things you love easier and to save listings or to have new posts sent to you to keep you updated on the things you love. a great review system to find out if a seller or buyer is on the up-and-up so that you are not cheated. haven't tried the new job posting area I can't really comment on it but it is a great idea for finding local gigs.,5
7519,It's all right thus app,3
7520,"as long as you know how to avoid the scammers, everything is great!",5
7521,Cool,4
7522,Ads make this completely unusable,1
7523,friendly,5
7524,it is difficult for me to keep track of communications with potential sellers and buyers.,3
7525,great so far.,5
7526,I love this site Beavis and butt-head would say this is cool,5
7527,Used option for a 3 day post. Offerup deleted all my post after 2 days.,1
7528,"I loved them fit good, and they look great",5
7529,so far I have not got a reply from anyone I tried to buy from,1
7530,Great app for everything in your area or in other states. You can also review items and sellers which is more informative and important when purchasing.,5
7531,"Buggy mess now. I get blank messages from people, shows like I'm asking to buy my own items now. Unable to share links to my items through the app. Huge push towards their ""premium sale gimmick"". I've been buying g/selling/trading on this app for years and now it's almost completely useless.",1
7532,Customer support is next to none. Have had some payment issues that I needed some help with. Tried to reach out to offer up and sent a e mail to them. I never got a response and never received my payment. Customer Support is next to none. Can't we do better Offer up.,1
7533,The UI needs to change. The menu should display more than just a single picture. It should display the basics of the ad. Like the price and title of listing.,3
7534,This app claims it's prohibited to sell live animals yet pets of all kinds can be found for sell Maybe you should start banning people being reported Or actually look at what's being sold on your app You've allowed this to become over populated by abused animals and scammers Don't waste your time or money,1
7535,Excellent,5
7536,good local finds,5
7537,"I've had a brand new kitchen set on other apps. for a few days, Which got responses but never came through. This app only took a few minutes and sale was successful.

7538,"It's really easy to sell and buy things. There are a lot of scammers and rude people, so make sure not to give out personal info like emails or phone numbers. Great way to find high value items for a low price.",5

7540,fun,5
7541,"This app is 100% without question the absolute worst experience I've ever had from an app created by such a well funded company. As an app and web developer, I'm absolutely shocked this was released to the general public in its current state. It would be unfair to myself and my current employer to describe the details of the multitude of problems I've experienced as I am not being paid to do QA. I wish the developers the best of luck.",1
7542,I've been selling things on OfferUp for a few years. I love this app don't know what I would of did without it.,5
7543,Your customer service is awful can't get a hold of anyone!!!,1
7544,"Love Offer Up! Many see what your selling,which is great! I recommend using it if you have items you want to get rid of.",5
7545,good,5
7546,The filters don't work. I put local only (30 miles) and am seeing nothing but results from other states. I don't love close to a border.,2
7547,Sending me ads on DM? Are you serious?,1
7548,I have had a great experience with my purchase.,4
7549,Not recommended. No seller on this app replies. Can't even report it. Disorganized. High shipping price too. My account got deleted cause I was selling 20lb halo dog food lol. I have no idea what their problem is. I asked what violation about the food and they never replied.,1
7550,awesome to things either cheaper or just not available in stores,5
7551,put in 30 miles from me an it show all over country not up to date things on there from up to 2 years ago,1
7552,Love the Prices,5
7553,This should be an easier way to cancel premium for subscription that I didn't subscribe to how to change my password and everything an OfferUp will not cancel my subscription and I cannot see anything on my Google Play Store showing I've been subscribed I will not highly recommend this until they fix these issues,1
7554,"ap freezing up a lot since they started putting ads when you message someone, takes a long time to load, takes a long time to load photos, not good needs improvement",1
7555,Good App to help you sale things you no longer need,5
7556,offerup is the best website in the world. it helps you make some money by selling stuff,5
7557,very friendly and kind thank you!,5
7558,The app stopped working even though I've tried to reinstall.,1
7559,"I have bought and sold many items on Offerup, and have never had any issues. It has been very useful for me and would recommend it to others.",5
7560,great app good protection from scamners,5
7561,I love this app,5
7562,"I bought things, I sold things. I never had a problem.",5
7563,sucks,1
7564,To many ads that no one cares about making navigating through sales a horrible experience.,1
7565,so far it's been good opening up new world of possibilities and creating opportunities the folks around here needed to see and be a part of. Offer up did just that created hope here where there was a need no one saw. Helping your neighbor never felt so rewarding and fun.,5
7566,It's just always good,5
7567,"Still pushes notifications even when every single one is all turned off in the app under ""manage notifications"". Scummy practice.",1
7568,"The selling system is fine, but buying terrible. I waited a whole week for two purchases just for a refund.",2
7569,good,4
7570,I like it,5
7571,awesome,5
7572,"Let go was great, offerup has always been trash. It sucks that they became combined, completely ruined it. Don't waste your time on this selling app. Edit: years later and it is still trash",1
7573,Extremely hard to sell anything on this app. It does a bad job qith notifications and messages. I have missed out on multiple sales because it does not email or notify you when someone messages about items. DO NOT use this app to sell things. You will have better luck on other apps that actually alert you to messages.,1
7574,Great App,5
7575,"Worthless app. Have to pay, said I already used free post and this is first time ever using. People on here suck, never answer you back when your trying to buy something. 0 stars!!! Scammers on here and they just tell you to call police, they will not remove them. Thay are promoting these people.",1
7576,They throttle the speed unless you pay a monthly subscription.,1
7577,should be a limit on how long the items are up.,1
7578,"I've used this app for a long time. I've always loved it but recently it's getting really annoying. I could search, say, laptops. Then every time I pull it up again, I'm shown nothing but laptops and computers. NOTHING else. I understand the algorithm and search history stuff but it isn't showing any new listings. Just every single thing that's ever been posted pertaining to laptops.",3
7579,"This app is a joke, better don't waste your time. They have all those ridiculous rules ban normal user without verify. Trust me any other app would be better. Any.",1
7580,great app,5
7581,I've had a post on there forever that I removed and it will not go away,3
7582,It was wonderful.,5
7583,Can you please add filter option where you can choose from private owner or dealer like the app letgo had thank you,2
7584,good,5
7585,Love this app,5
7586,"very difficult to deal with app administrators. they just randomly ban accounts for no given reason and trying to talk to customer support to reverse the decision is like talking to a wall, that is if you get a response from customer service at all.",1
7587,horrible and old,1
7588,App has went far down hill. Used to be good but the only people who are on this app anymore isn't serious about anything. No one is serious about buying anything delete this app,1
7589,great üëç,5
7590,They lost my package there is no phone number for customer service they literally ignore you they don't care there is no phone number at all you can try to leave messages and they don't get back to you at all they don't care they literally don't care they don't even respond to you let you know that they don't care they just literally don't even care so much that they don't even care to tell you that they don't care,1
7591,Love it,5
7592,Great way todo sell your stuff,5
7593,if you dont promite or paybyou rarely get any action about you sale,3
7594,I turn it off when ads pop up and hijack my device.,1
7595,great app.. it's just a Lil slow,5
7596,never had any issues,5
7597,"OfferUp charged me a fee for a car that I tried to post They never posted the vehicle. When I asked for them to fix it or return the charge they suspended my account for ""violating their services"". Instead of fixing the issue I was having. I did not violate any services I had a excellent customer review status And I had paid them quite a few times to post cars over the last few years. You cannot get a real person to talk to you, Instead you get automated responses included the link below.",1
7598,wonderful exchange,5
7599,This app need some fixing on the filter i set it to search within 10 miles but everytime i check the listings i see new york sellers and i live in california..,3
7600,great app,5
7601,I love it,5
7602,seamlessly and anonymously buy and sell locally.,5
7603,Does anyone ever sell anything on this App??,1
7604,I'm sick and tired of people who aren't responsible. I'm looking forward to deleting my account üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé,2
7605,"I was selling a vehicle on OfferUp and 4 minutes after I sold my car the person driving my car away canceled the transaction I have contacted OfferUp and the police to report the car stolen and was told it was a civil matter I am now out of vehicle I don't have the gentlemen's real true information and no money to purchase a new one who was over $2,000 for the car this is not a safe place to do business.",1
7606,good contacts fast and easy,5
7607,Buying on here has been wonderful (except for 1 bad seed so far) but selling on here for me was a nightmare!,4
7608,Very easy and efficient process.,5
7609,Never find anything in my area,3
7610,Haven't tried it yet,5
7611,bought the item got it home and it didn't work I asked the seller if it did but he lied,1
7612,yes will use again. A really good app,5
7613,can't unarchive. I push the okay button and nothing happens. I can't even back out of the app. I have to close it.,1
7614,"Do not trust this application, it is stealing and using your identities for other purposes.",1
7615,I absolutely love shopping on OfferUp. I have gotten some amazing deals on here. It always gives me a warm feeling when I get to acquire items at a very reasonable price.,5
7616,it's like it doesn't really post your stuff unless you pay for the promotions kind of a waste of time I stop making money on app when it switched from let-go,1
7617,"This app isn't really for the casual seller. There is a lot of time wasted trying to sell extra furniture or items from your home to the point donating them items was the more worthwhile option. People routinely ghost you, even after asking you to make special considerations for their availability without any recourse to rate them for bad communication. One item had 7 people say they were coming to just not say anything. This was extra frustrating since I was moving and was at the old apartment",1
7618,"Charged me 20 dollars for a ""free trial"" that didn't even help me sell my several items. Trash service. Just use Facebook Marketplace.",1
7619,"Yeah ya can keep those ads on the app, I'm just deleting the app",1
7620,"It is used to be a good app. Nowadays, it's worthless",1
7621,Using this app is a waste of time Like most of us that sell we use multiple platforms this is the only one I haven't sold anything on I've never been contacted about an item nor have I ever received a response from sellers that had items I wanted to buy,1
7622,"So i have this listing on Offer Up for 2 months and its been sitting around 640 views for weeks now. I did the free 3 day trial ""promote plus"" to get more views. The 3-day trial has expired and I'm still at around 640 views. I have the option to extend the subscription of ""promote plus"" for a month at $19.99. Um, no thanks. I didn't get any views with the free trial. What makes you think I'll get some views after paying a hefty fee? Failed!",2
7623,"Keeps sending me notifications for items I might be interested in, even though all search alert notifications are turned off. App UX needs a lot of improvement. Saves should be on bottom toolbar. Should be easier to get to profile from the search screen. Would appreciate it if Offerup encouraged sellers to put more info in description - - sellers on this platform expect the photos to say everything.",1
7624,"I've uninstalled and installed the app twice now, and I still get a ""sorry, something went wrong"" message. There isn't even a way to report it in the app. Please fix.",1
7625,he was nice straight forward about the product and was cool üëç,5
7626,"This app now sucks. It used to be ok and I've sold many things on there. Then a couple of months ago I declined to do a trial promotion on there""promotion"" scam, so they can generate more money for themselves and in two months I have not gotten 1 view on anything. Absolutely shameful!!",1
7627,"Not really liking it so much anymore, people be posting but do not repond after you ask if available. Honestly they should remove the (its available question) and just removed post that be around for to long like years. The developers should put a time limit like, for example if you post anything you have 3 months for that post and right before it expires, the app will automatically ask you if you need more time with your listing. If you do not add more time, then your post will be removed.",3
7628,great app love it,5
7629,This app is so frustrating. It's sooo slow. Takes me forever to post a lot of items. Or even messaging people back takes so long to load anything..... why is this?,2
7630,Hate it - can't delete messages and can't block users from messaging you I used to be able to do both I hate this app. now that I have to pay they removed the features that I like,1
7631,love the app,5
7632,Lagging hard.. updates do no justice. Please take out the ads I can't scroll or message peacefully with out having a ad popping that's irrelevant to me. I've been using this app for years and now I feel like the devs only care about $ with all these ads.,1
7633,"Very slow app, takes seconds to react to my clicks and as a seller I wish we had more regulation to time wasters, literally more than half of people are wasting my time on the messages.",2
7634,not one sale!,1
7635,üëåüëç,5
7636,"Can't use the share button, but all the other buttons work well, why?",2
7637,"Great place to sell your stuff, and to find what you need.",5
7638,the app is slow,2
7639,"I love the app, but I can't stand that things have been posted for 7 years and still on here!!! And most people don't respond ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î been many times that I wanted something on here and I never get a response! I've even offered more than what they're asking and still don't get responded to please explain that to me ? Seems like if the person is not active on the app they should be warned about being removed or something because something has to be done to make this a little better experience.",3
7640,great app,5
7641,Great App.,5
7642,I think off-road is a good business now it's all messed up and burnt stove but overall it's really a good and now they got jobs,4
7643,"if you need something,you can't find in stores you can find it here.",4
7644,"I've been able to make extra cash from items I wouldn't expect to sell, crazy! Gotta give a try. Just keep up with it, and be as honest and accurate with describing and information of the items you r selling, buyers are able to rate your service.",5
7645,I can't even message anyone I went on that verify and did phone verification just not the id part cause my id was stolen and it's got everything but my pic and it still won't let me communicate thays obserd how I can't even ask a question about anything please fix emediatly or I'm done that's rediculous if u need id in order to communicate what's this world coming to no nobody trust nobody anymore get a grip no wonder why everybody's mad half the time look what people do to make it impossible,2
7646,App is slow and buggy no way im paying for premium.,1
7647,"As soon as a better selling app is available I'm deleting OfferUp. Between the absurd lagging, pop up/data harvesting, lack of customer support and shadowbanning the OfferUp app is a hot pile of giraffe poop. I'm giving 1 star only because I've made sales on the app.",1
7648,Cant post things for sale. invalid category and the category cant be changed app is broken since this update,1
7649,"fantastic site to find just about anything. Don't really enjoy the retail stores new items because this is supposed to be used items, people making offers for them. But fantastic just the same.",5
7650,"Nice app just have been charge several x,s for things that were to fe free for a certain x. Period a & that was a bad choice ,bad experience. Just doing a little more research before choosing Between options.",5
7651,great buy,5
7652,"Worst app/service for selling items I've ever used. Postings disappeared, no web support for adding/editing posts, photo selection is a nightmare, editing tools are minimal (cropping only?), 13% fee if you ship and only half as likely to sell unless you pay to boost. Use FB marketplace instead. Skip this headache.",1
7653,loaded with ads,1
7654,Okay,3
7655,K yeah I need to get it a use free cars or trucks help me plz,5
7656,"love this site, it serves its purpose quite well.",5
7657,great,5
7658,I love this app,5
7659,"Same nonsense restrictive selling polices as BETTER apps, this is waste of time.",1
7660,easy to use most people are very friendly and accommodating I've had the privilege of buying four or five things and each experience has been good,5
7661,"POS app run by robots. A lot of times it won't let you post stuff for no reason, then you can't contact anyone to dispute it. Not better than craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Good when it works out, but trash when it doesn't. And it usually 'doesn'ts'",1
7662,this app is weird people post items for sale but they never answer the message,2
7663,"I have all notifications turned off in the app except chat messages and get it still sends notifs on ""items I might want"". No thanks.",1
7664,10/08/2023 when you think they couldn't get worse then they do. They've been only adds for almost 2 years now. No real posts just address scammers And big businesses that aren't really selling anything. They are now just collecting add revenue so they don't care about the people that helped them become big. It's just one big add for big businesses. I'm expecting there to be political adds soon. Just a garbage company,1
7665,too many old sitings,3
7666,I've bought items from here before and they have been all good including the people,5
7667,great place to sell stuff local .,5
7668,for some reason this site has items of mine marked as sold. I haven't sold thing. I don't even know where my items are on line or how far down they are on searches..not impressed,1
7669,This app help me clean up my stuff by clearing things out for me by selling it.,5
7670,perfect for selling and buying,5
7671,I'm not selling anything,1
7672,I'm giving you only 4 * so you always keep trying,4
7673,if you're looking for appliances. you need to check out this place.. great prices and they have a big selection. you can't go wrong,5
7674,Way to many commercials! Changing for the worst! And your filling up our phone with updates because I can't open it up otherwise?,1
7675,excellent,5
7676,potential buyers are much friendlier and honest,5
7677,Why am I being charged $$ to post something? This is something new...,1
7678,"My TruYou status has been removed for some unknown reason. My account won't allow me to register my phone number or driver's license after I already did that previously. It says, ""The phone number you entered is associated with too many user accounts."" when I try to add my number back onto my account. Probably because this account was already registered with that phone number. Help me out here OfferUp.",1
7679,OfferUp is a great platform to buy and sell!,5
7680,too many flaky people,1
7681,no sales....unimpressed,3
7682,Great deal and great seller!,5
7683,"I've been using offerup for years now and has been good til the merge of letgo. The app is very slow and at times i have trouble posting items. This was my main go to for buying/selling items in the past but I've found other apps to be way more useful since then. I never thought it'd come to the day I give it a 1 star rating but they've earned it with all the ads, decreased speeds, glitches, and other post difficulties I've found.",1
7684,"I spent an hour setting up my account. I carefully posted three items and they were all ""removed"". Uninstalled",1
7685,"The UI is messy. When searching or browsing It's just a grid of photos, no other information, no price, not even a word of WTFever that tiny picture is. You have to click the tiny unknown picture because it's too small to figure out what it is to see if it's relevant to what you're looking for or even the freaking price. What a waste of time, I give a search 2 or 3 clicks and then get annoyed and leave. I've looked at setting, even help files but wasted enough time, uninstalling this turd",1
7686,very good,5
7687,"Says it does not have ads yet each page has 2 ads. Only sellers, no buyers, no way to search ads that I could find....Request refund due to false advertising.",1
7688,"Don't download it. It's a waste of your time. They will delete your account for no reason. Had accout since 2018. Over 100 transactions, all positive feedback, and everything was verified. Login in today to sell my car, and when I hit post, they said that the account is lost its credential and the account is gone. Wrote the email, and their response was that it violation of their policy, and that is it. No explanation or anything. What is the point of having an account for 5 years?",1
7689,this app has not worked for me in over a year. I've tried to get help. And there's nothing I've been able to figure out no way to contact anyone. I would love some help if anyone has suggestions.,1
7690,"Uninstalling. Top 3 complaints: 1. You still get flakes because you can only rate people if you close a transaction. I've reported no shows to OfferUp and I didn't see the other person's rating drop. I think they just send out emails. Also, you can pad your rating if you have friends, simply buy/sell fake items to one another. 2. Items don't expire, I've seen motorcycles and parts on OfferUp for 2+ years. 3. Hypocrisy in ToS. They allow vehicles without titles even though it's against TOS.",1
7691,"It drains a lot of battery with light usage of the app, please optimize it.",3
7692,Nothing sells.. everyone expects this to be a Garage Sale app.. Not for selling Reconditioned or Quality goods or well Cared for Devices.. you Could Sell A Brand New Console but People will ask for Half the Asking price.. or it won't get any offers... I get we are in a Recession.. but.. I've been using this app for years and only sold a few items..,3
7693,It constantly throws you out and closes out so you have to reopen again and again and again also you have no way of deleting old messages can't post only share your sales and post not the greatest site awful,1
7694,"Slow interface. Constant bugs. don't even worry about ads, that's le least of my problems while using the app. 2 stars because Because I can find and sell a lot of stuff",2
7695,"The new patch has broken the ability to add pictures. This might not be as big of an issue if I was able to use Offerup on older android operating system, if it allowed for Item Listings on their desktop site, or if they allowed for apk mirrors to be downloaded for use on emulators. But they don't allow for any of these.",1
7696,Many ads for a single item for sale are years old! Doing a search for an RV or Motorcyle gets more ads for items completely unrelated than ads actually related to the search. I won't even get into the rampant scams!,1
7697,The app is very slow and you have to click on the listing and go to another page in order to see the price of an item. All other buy/sell apps show the price right off the bat. With OfferUp there's an extra step required if you want to see the price.,3
7698,good place to find just what your looking for at a negotiable price new/or used,5
7699,Fun buying........,5
7700,Archived all my listings and told me I need to verify my phone number. Went to verify phone number and it says it's on another account. I sell 50 times more on Craigslist. Dumping all my listings from here. Have had numerous bad experiences dealing with idiots on this app,1
7701,Love the app but highly dislike playing message tag with ppl instead of having a straight up back and forth conversation instead of 1 message at 9am 2nd message at 445 pm ect. Wish it was more consistent with customer conversations.,5
7702,fix the stupid huge listing windows on a android tablet or make it sizeable so more listings fit on the screen,1
7703,We have purchased quite a few things as every purchase and seller have been awesome!!!,5
7704,So far so good!,5
7705,very kind . furniture was as described. very happy with my furniture.,5
7706,"The slowest APP ever! I'm literally waiting and waiting and waiting for things to upload! I couldn't tell you how many sales I've lost! Just waiting to respond, waiting to upload waiting to archive. It's cringe how slow this app is!!! Please someone do something",1
7707,"This app had it's day, but it has since come and gone. Overwhelming advertisement to force you into a 'Premium Membership', and it's nearly impossible to access old purchases/seller information. The app sold to a different company and things went downhill fast. Reddit also suggests this app is done for. Let's move onto the next one.",1

7709,best thing since sliced bread,5
7710,"I signed up for the app, then cancelled my subscription within 24 hours. I've since been charged every month. I've tried to log on to the app, but the account is closed. I've called their customer service# and it says the office is closed. I tried the customer service link in the rules and regulations and the link is dead. Finally, I had to call my bank and put a stop payment on the charge. The app claims to have an easy process to discontinue service, but its BS.",1
7711,Great,5
7712,I posted a ps5 they removed it.. than they terminated my account for no reason,1
7713,"love this app, get awesome deals and meet awesome people",5
7714,OfferUp is a complete program except the fact that they don't let you know that your ad is not running you may turn around to look at your listings and they're not available to the public because of something you failed to do this takes up a lot of your sales time that you thought was in motion I'm going to give google Play four stars because that could be a costly oversight,5
7715,bunch of scammers,1
7716,"There's a big problem with the app your phone number if it was used by someone else they will not let you message anyone, therefore you can not use their app. The emails once the account is deleted you can no longer use the same email to reopen the account a new, not all of us wants 10 different emails they should be a verification phone number text message it did not let me use my current phone number.",4
7717,Great app!,5
7718,most of the items posted have been on here for years and we're never removed. It's a waste of time. people selling items should have to repost the item after 90 days if it didn't sell. items from 4 plus years ago are no good.,2
7719,It stops working while searching,1
7720,"the epitome of a good service wringed out by corp America, then poured into an ice cold glass, and served on a silver platter. Id be fine if they actually made the service better or tried new things but ""these"" or ""this"" idiot is just milking the monopoly and getting rid of all overhead and personnel, while quadrupling the amount of ads and then taking a 13% cut of every shipped sale for doing nothing...not even upgrading servers. Netflix makes movies for less than ou charges off 1 sale. FU!",1

I reached out to Offer Up support each time and received scripted emails in return, with no actual assistance. When I reached out to the email they gave in their response, I had to go through the ID process a 4th time, but it was accepted. It shouldn't require making an issue public to get support.",3
7724,easy!,5
7725,wish it could post my items little faster.. no views for like the first two hours.. don't know why,5
7726,It's very slow moves by it self and I know it's not my phone because I have downloaded it on all of my phones including my husbands and tablets and it looks like it has a bug or something it also freezes and have to close and restart and do it all over again,1
7727,very easy to sell any product or item,4
7728,"Someone higher up, in the office should be deleting the items that were sold or listing that are very old",3
7729,When this app was just LET GO it was good now it's hot garbage. Used to just post and talk to someone bang meet up sell cash in hand done. I don't do shipping so this app is really hot HOT garbage.,1
7730,garbage,1
7731,I find the best things on OfferUp! Hooked on OfferUp App!!!,5
7732,Tons of notification spam even when I turn it off. Too many adds and promoted items too,1
7733,not Asami users as I hoped but making sales,5
7734,"Total Trash. I joined Offer Up in search of a cricut maker 3. I found several. Great prices , I messaged 5 different people about their makers. Originally the first 2 people I messaged never responded. So I gave them some time and when they still didn't respond I messaged 3 other people. It's been almost a month and no one is responding. When it first happened, I emailed OFFER up customer service and was told that nothing is wrong with my account it's just that people aren't responding, really?",1

7739,"Would give 0 stars and a negative if I could. In order to even get a response, you need to be a premium member. Then, I reported fake items on accounts and got an email saying my account was closed for violation of TOS. For what exactly? This app is a joke seriously. Allows sellers to post fake items, and you can't even ask a question that will get answered unless you pay to become premium.",1
7740,I use to love this app. Now it's very slow. Too many ads. When you want to sort messages it doesn't save preferences have to always adjust. Notices are slow.,1

Offerup allowed the customers to keep MY products, and refunded those clients. I'm left with NOTHING. No product and no profit. That is ROBBERY. I'm owed money. Offerup REFUSES to respond back to me, and REFUSES to answer BBB complaints. I will let everyone know on every social media platform that I was robbed by these people!!",1
7744,Can't even sell a small commemorative pocket knife. Pound sand. Terrible since letgo was bought out. Wish I could give negative stars. Beware this app is a disappointment.,1
7745,"No one ever actually bought anything. They just asked a bunch of questions, scheduled meet-ups, and then didn't show up. Then there's tons listing, which look like obvious scams.

7748,It used to work well now with all these extras there are problems. Even though the seller confirmed for me it showed the item was sold to someone else so I cannot leave feedback for the seller. :/,3
7749,Cannot cancel. Want us to cancel w/ itunes Cannot get assistance. No available phone number.,1
7750,great app,5
7751,excellent way to shop and sell,5
7752,OfferUp works great for selling locally while having some security selling to people you don't know. All the buyers I've dealt with have been more reliable than the average Craigslist buyer.,5
7753,Offerup is one of those exceptional blessings I am grateful for,5
7754,great app for sell and trade also great for job opportunities,5
7755,Great üëå,5
7756,excelente üëå,4
7757,It's so incredibly slow when trying to message people back,2
7758,App works good for the most part.. my only concern is that the share function doesn't work for me and even when my friends share anything with me I'm not able to open the link,2
7759,Can't delete old listing. Dumb.,2
7760,"What a terrible app. I don't want to see things from unknown shippers, I want to see local matches. The interface is terrible, so is the search functionality,with a limit on local results.",1
7761,This app sucks it takes forever to load every new screen. I miss letgo now that was a good app. Then offer up bought it n still can't get offer up to run right. Offer up is the worst sell app I've ever used.,1
7762,"The developers should be ashamed of themselves. It was a good app to sell stuff and buy stuff. But, merging, and being sold out to Facebook has made this once great app terrible and pricey if you are trying to list a vehicle for sale.",1
7763,Excellent,5
7764,very professional.. I will definitely purchase again from this seller,5
7765,"This app used to be awesome, but now you have to pay to get any views and to not see 80 million ads or expired products. Scammers are rampant and I don't recommend this app to anyone! Use Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist not this!!",1
7766,can the scan card part of the app please be fixed?,3
7767,"Constant notifications, ridiculous full screen ads, and of course, a market place of stolen items, and scammers that the app refuses do do anything about",1
7768,nice so far üëå,4
7769,Useless,1
7770,"Very poorly managed, at best. I make offers and try to contact sellers, it's like they don't exist. If you look close, some listings are years old and obviously forgotten. Waste of time.",1
7771,Thank you again! I really appreciate it!,5
7772,It's a good app but the notification feature doesn't work anymore. I checked my phone and app settings and still don't get notified when I get a message.,3
7773,Not free for vehicles,1
7774,easy to use ..I got responses almost instantly....,5
7775,This review is based on the job listings. Everything that I've applied to was a scam. One even got my Marketplace access removed. I've reported the listing but who knows if they actually do leg work and follow through. I've had no communication from Offer up since flagging 2 postings.,1
7776,great app,5
7777,"Great Platform BEFORE Facebook bought!! It used to be light easy and quick, social. Since it had been purchased by Zuckeberg it has been ruined. Few ppl use it now. It is invasive, laggy, disfunctional, misdirected, spies and is full of address farmers and bots. Best to go else where.",1
7778,Great app.,4
7779,The worst app around super slow,1
7780,"Had this worked for anyone? As in sold anything? What a jumble of small images without prices- wouldn't want to shop here Top paid app because they're pushing too hard to upgrade to paid use. it's just cringe. Do not waste your time, put a brand new W/D for cheap and didn't even get a question about it.... worthless - guaranteed only going to show people that sign up for paid... Scam",1
7781,I get notifications for messages only to find out they are advertisements for the app. Stop please!,2
7782,"Horrible since intrusive ads now popup in the middle of your searches and anywhere you're using the app. The ads Behave as if it were an uncertified app or malware, and even takes over your screen when using. The other huge issue is extreme poor performance, which has gotten much worse since the inclusion of popup ads.",2
7783,mason screen doesn't show all items in areas you specify and have to individually look up something in order to see all available. turning into a party to use platform regardless of all the ads already.,1
7784,"This app has too many old post that's been there for years. OfferUp needs to remove old post and put a cap on how long a post can stay open. That's how letgo used to do it before offer up took over letgo. Thats what made letgo a way better app. It Set a cap of one to two weeks, for a post to be active, then alert the the seller their time is expired with an option of just selecting an option to relist. That would clean up all the clutter and outdated post in this app and make it easier to sell.",1
7785,Not very user friendly tryed to add photographs from my other phone I share with other phone didn't accept photos,1
7786,ad heavy,3
7787,"I really hate this app, and have been nothing but disappointed since they bought out ""Let go"", which was actually decent. first of all the app is slow and clunky, especially if you have a sub par phone. It is also far from user friendly, in fact, it's pretty horrible. Almost every action, is more difficult than it should be. I've lost SO MANY of my sales, and ALL of my purchase history, AND all of my ratings for them. You can't even rate the sellers on this app! What is the point of that!!",1
7788,Great app for buying and selling. user friendly and easy to use.,5
7789,A lot of fraudulent characters trying to swindle people on the app makes it really hard for honest people to legitimately post and sell stuff trustingly,2
7790,great person üëç,5
7791,Great app for selling products to real local people. The UX is clean and easy to use. I've sold hundreds of dollars worth of items. I haven't tried selling using the shipping feature. I wish i could list and edit listings post from a PC. That would make it easier to post items faster. That's why I gave it 4 stars.,4
7792,"I posted items for sale and had my friend check his app to see if they are posted. Can find them and it seems like offer up isn't posting anything if you don't pay. App deleted! Will be using Facebook marketplace. PS. I did email multiple times, no response. Pretty bad customer service!",1
7793,Removing App. What is the point if 90% of what is shown is shopping online for new items? I'm not paying premium to be able to use the app for what it is supposed to be. Either be an app for individuals in the area to sell used items or be one big advertisement for things I could just google.,1
7794,Only gig in town for quick sales in NYC but the bots are getting bad.,3
7795,Can't even long in with Facebook,1
7796,App is flooded with ads. Posts never expire so you're always browsing items you cannot buy.,1
7797,"Soooo many SCAMMERS & also OLD LISTINGS. OfferUp doesn't seem to care about scammers OR have tech in place to help reduce them, only removing listings if someone complains, & not even removing seller. And TONS of listings YEARS old (even 7 & 8 years old), obviously inactive sellers or expired items, etc. AGAIN, Offerup doesn't care. No way to filter search for newer listings. HORRIBLE USER EXPERIENCE. WARNING... ONLY buy local so can inspect. DON'T buy via mail - only TWO DAYS to inspect. Ugh.",1
7798,Awesome,5
7799,Posting issue. Was trueid verified yesterday and posts still going to archives or nowhere. Please correct very frustrating. Will go premier if I am actually able to post. Haven't sold a single item.,4
7800,Great place to find anything you need,5
7801,great platform for whatever you want and want to sell,5
7802,"Horrible. So slow. Takes forever to list, update, mark sold or archive your item. Very glitchy. Please fix",1
7803,"it was great,Ricky was extremely helpful,very polite and just wanting to make everything good ,if anything does go wrong is willing to help me fix in the future!for $1000 how could I go wrong?",5
7804,"This app sucks now.. It has a lot more pop-up advertisements. There are more small businesses that blast their products, so its hard to actually find a deal from someone who is actually selling something for a deal. I no longer recommend this app.",1
7805,Not a bad app. The biggest drawback is they don't clean out the old postings of things that are no longer for sale.,3
7806,"Edit: The app hasn't been really working for the last month or so. I've tried posting and relisting over a dozen times and none of them get views anymore, just completely blank. Even listings that previously got dozens of views now have no feedback at all.",2
7807,Item listings a year or older should be automatically deleted.,2
7808,"There are too many ads and a very heavy platform, even flagship samsung Note 20 ultra with 18gb ram (12gb + 4gb SD card shared), and with that still, the app is slow and it is the only app that I experience such thing in my phone, pushing ads like crazy and so annoying pushing to get premium like they forget that Facebook is free and light and fast and even allows you do more things like sending photos and location and even paying and they managed to keep it free and fast, horrible experience",1
7809,I hate this app coz the people from phone stores and pawn shops post overpriced items. You need to do something offerup they post over 100 posts overtaking all our space!!,1
7810,V|ty reliable app to get what your looking for.,5
7811,"A bunch of scammers. Listings stay there forever, could be a couple of years and it still there. Wish they implemented a time duration for the listings.",1
7812,Easy pezzy.,5
7813,I love it I find good deals and I sell some of my stuff it's a wonderful place to shop,5
7814,"Awful app. Ads never get delisted so chances are anything you see was sold years ago, app constantly spams you with notifications about new listings being added without a way to directly view the new listings. Overall an absolutely garbage experience from offer up. If I could give 0 stars I would.",1
7815,"I enjoy the app and the contents, I just don't care for resetting my local location every time I log on. Going to do it now lol",4
7816,Great app the prices are surprisingly good.,4
7817,Nobody uses this app. Nobody responds to offers. Recommended item notifications are a joke. They don't even relate to the items I searched for or put in offers for. The app is dead. Deleted.,1
7818,I think you need to keep the cars that are for sale by private owners and the ones for sale by a company separate like it says when you punch it in. are you get bombarded with all sorts of car dealer ads instead of things that you're looking for,4
7819,Bad algorithm and a lot of listings say call for details what's so hard about a price and listing what is and isn't working but they don't let you do that is the thing kinda just a bad app around no wonder it's failing,1
7820,Great job guys,5
7821,I recommend this platform.,5
7822,Too many outdated listings and sellers who fail to complete full price buys. Waste of time.,1
7823,great job good products for everyone,5
7824,Deployed and can't use the app.,1
7825,SCAMMERS! Don't do free trials with them. They charge you immediately and then refuse to refund you.,1
7826,I'm trying to do a 2-day purchase protection. It says I need to click on notifications inside of my messages and I could see them on the website but I can't find them on the application. I have updated to the newest version and I still have no access to it,1
7827,People don't know how to read Bios and They always Low ball you and others never answer back. Need to remove those type of Disrespectful People. It's annoying already.,1
7828,I don't like the amount of money that you take out of my sales.,1
7829,they have robots and lot of people looking ro scam no good prospect ...offer up has been corrupted,1
7830,Stupid ads,2
7831,Not very reliable not very useful extremely disappointing and frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this site if you trying to sell something worthwhile people like to buy junk and that's something I don't have,3
7832,it's not bad but be careful of scammers on the website there's plenty of them posing as seller's just be wise and meet up in a well lit area when doing cash transactions and meeting ppl in public places..,5
7833,keeps freezing since update,2
7834,"App is inaccessible and broken. It keeps telling me ""sorry we weren't able to determine your location"". I live in the US and I do not have any proxy or VPN running when accessing the app. I can run it on my laptop fine. My GF who has an iPhone can pull it up. Don't know what's wrong here.",1
7835,ok app not enough people on here though,4
7836,"freezes my phone and hackers included, unless premium is paid for",1
7837,"Can't make any offers, the app asks me to verify my phone number every time, even if I already verified it. No field in the app to report problem",1
7838,Another App Fighting VPN's for no reason.,1
7839,soo much spam it's unreal. same product posted hundreds of times.,1
7840,I don't like the advertising and was better when there was 2 platforms you got much better deals now it's a monopoly with only one voice,1
7841,Horrible app. You invest 20 min in describing everything in detail and in 90% they will remove the listing without any information what what wrong. Save your time and stay away from this completely unprofessional platform,1
7842,"It's a decent app with the normal faults, but like some of the best sites today, they once were as OfferUp is now. It's not really the app that I really struggle with, but the people that I've got to deal with on this site. Everyone wants something for nothing and I consider it the garage sale site. But I've made some decent money here and have found some killer deals, so I'll continue to use it.",4
7843,thank you so much! for the items,5
7844,"great place to buy and sell anything you could want, locally or accross the country",5
7845,"This app still sends push notifications for "" sellers I follow"" even though I turned off notifications for that. I only allowed notifications for communication. I'm deleting this app and so should you.",1
7846,This app has a lot of Problems,1
7847,I'm very disappointed that my letgo items don't transfer to offerup and there are way too many ads. Offerup is not as easy to use as letgo was. OfferUp acquired Letgo and did not carry my items posted nor all the wonderful contacts I made selling. All my Letgo stuff just disappeared! A shame for many others besides me.,3
7848,lawnmower works great,5
7849,Very slow and I haven't sold nothing on this site over 6 months,3
7850,New updates there terrible!!!!,1
7851,all you can see is cars in a dealership not recommended app,1
7852,I get frustrated because the app is so slow.,2
7853,Tried to sell my items only to have all my items deleted on the same day as signing up for the 2x promo trial after having the same items up for a week and a half.,1
7854,Offer up has become a joke with its charges for verification status and pathetic ads. Done with this app.,1
7855,Why why why would you purposely not keep user settings like the range distance and other bugs??? I kind of understand why you did it but it still pisses me off that you would put the consumer comfort in the back seat.,1
7856,I cannot use the app because of a phone verification glitch. I have only one phone number it just costs me a sale as I couldn't communicate with the buyer.,1
7857,Awesome App!,5
7858,Useless app,1
7859,It used to be good but now it's just garbage nobody calls nobody text nobody doing nothing just spam and people trying to call you on your money it's garbage now these days I haven't used it in about a year that's how bad it got within the past year,1
7860,Please work.. sell all my stuff,5
7861,No one uses this app let-go was better everything on here for sale is posted 2 or 3 years ago the people not even active anymore on it to buy from,1
7862,"easy to use, has notifications so u can respond quickly",5
7863,I love offer up and I have used the shipping as well and it's great.,5
7864,I hate all the constant notification,1
7865,nice app !,5
7866,Posts are 2-4 years old,1
7867,The best,5
7868,The amount of scammers on this product is insane. support doesn't ban them either. Had one person try to get me to use a 3rd party to buy from then instead of through offer up so they could scam me. Avoid at all costs,1
7869,"I Can't Post an Item to Sell, it freezes then kicks me out of the app.",1
7870,"It's good until it ain't! I got scammed and reported the sellers. I notified Offer Up, and basically nothing happened. Got few auto reply emails stating ""...we take these reports seriously..."" blah, blah üôÑ. Seller/scammer accounts were still active. You can't even leave a review of the person to warn others. App has turned to üí©. Thanks for this rotting pile of flesh that attracts buzzards and jackals.",1
7871,I used to love offer up. what a joke now. Ads. ads. ads. and so much BS. SLOW And clearly just for app owners to make serious loot. I'll be canceling my account after 4 years. shame on u offer up.,1
7872,"Really nice person, honest. Friendly.",5
7873,Middle-of-the-road performing platform. Messages could be better. Fewer ads would be nicer. Fake postings run rampant.,3
7874,Tires were as advertised. Seller was forthright and honest.,5
7875,"Other than the usual nonsense of online tire kickers , it's a pretty good way to sell your stuff. App features are good and it's easy to post .",4
7876,Nice way to post things but just for a 3 day trial then you have to pay what?..... I don't enjoy that,3
7877,"too many ads, it's annoying now.",1
7878,Great,5
7879,Offer up is pretty darn good,3
7880,Depends if people inyour area actually use it..,5
7881,a lot of fakes üòí,2
7882,still early don't like being constantly pestered to buy better sales,2
7883,"On my galaxy s20 ultra, Since the new update, I can't share listings with others. Frustrating",2
7884,"the customer support is lackluster at best. When I've had issues with transactions or encountered scammers, reaching out to support has often been an exercise in futility. It feels like they don't prioritize user concerns.",1
7885,Not good it says zero views so does anyone uses this app nothing is salein any more,1
7886,very convenient,5
7887,"Laggy, slow",1
7888,This app was cool until now they charge for posting furniture,1
7889,I did my first sell and I gotta admit it was pretty cool shout-out to OfferUp,5
7890,Does not supervise fake counts and people that are flakes,1
7891,I guess my items don't post unless I pay for upgrade.,1
7892,Made my first sell after a month. It was pretty easy to navigate the app and shipping was easy to do as well. I will continue using it to see how useful it can be! So far so good!,4
7893,Notifications of new listings as soon as they're posted are behind the paywall. Ads are completely out of control and the app can be 60% faster if you pay proving what many have thought all along - they are crippling it on purpose. I hope the devs read this. I will never pay for this app.,1
7894,"Has a few kinks to work out but All in All, gets the job done!!!",4
7895,"This app used to be stable and functional. Now images can't load, can't post properly and view doesn't refresh. App tries too hard to list focused items rather than showing what people are selling missing the fundamental. Now with all the popup ads to block my communication? Really? My rating changed from 5 star to 1 over the past 5 years.",1
7896,nobody can see my post or my messages,1
7897,"Great deal, friendly and knowledgeable sellers.",5
7898,The app is convenient but the person I tried to buy a PS4 from took my money and I don't have the merchandise. So now I don't trust this.,3
7899,Great app.,5
7900,Easy to use and a really neat app,4
7901,I sold 2 headphones and delivered them to the buyer but after weeks of waiting I got my money in my account yet. Something wrong with this app,1

7905,Very good place to go. My andy neighbors place. Nice people,4
7906,Offer up is easy to use for selling and for buying. They protect each party by utilizing the app message feature.,5

7909,freezes up when you want to chat. must restart program. ahh. ahh. ahh.,4

7917,Good app,5
7918,"so far OfferUp has been great! I can choose how to sell my items and then the shipping process is easy. My only issue is that in order to take items off market I would have to mark them sold. It isn't obvious on how to delete a post once it is posted. I still haven't figured it out, or know if it is possible to do so. Also, I got a message saying I needed to add a payment account in order to get paid, but I never received a message saying that I was paid. I think I was, but that was confusing.",4

8178,lot of people reaching out asking me to send a code to prove who I am.,3
8179,Now has ads! Can't leave reviews for items I purchased. Not receiving reviews for items I bought eitherotifications are not messages! Where is the tab for save searches it should be on the main screen. Be careful with shipped items. Offerup took money from me when an item never arrived weeks after the complaint time and offerup is difficult to communicate with,1
8180,not letting me see my messages,2
8181,It is really easy to use and get items sold.,5
8182,"Too many car dealerships spamming the app, you look up anything and you just get cars being sold by dealerships. I looked up ""exterior door"" and out of 100 posts you get 90 cars. Really annoying wish they banned dealerships from doing this.",1
8183,Garage sale fun with online convenience!,5
8184,good app,4
8185,"The same day I installed the app I received a message from a potential buyer and replied. The message is gone. Support asked for screenshots & details of the issue, and gave me steps to take. Nothing worked. I sent images & details of issue. Support replies asking for more details like ""what did I expect to happen when I incurred the issue."" It also said to wait until an update is released to fix the issue. I expect to see my messages. Please have a real person not AI answer your support emails.",1
8186,they say no ads and I see tons of ads,1
8187,i dont sell very much personally but the people selling are selling at retail or way above retail prices.,4
8188,great app!üòäüëç,5
8189,"When I used to have this app ...it was basically the same as all the other, except that there was always some jackass ,administration guy or girl that was trying to tell you about how you post, and not being able to call anyone, some of us don't want to be on the phone texting and writing emails. If I can't talk with a person before I buy them I usually don't..",2
8190,This app is hacked...every time I ask for a lower offer the item is sold next day...these people go through the offers or text that you send and when the seller agree to sell they buy it for them self while I'm left finding all the deals....don't sell or buy from this app.,1
8191,Will not stop taking my money! I did an ad with with promote plus for one month. During that month I tried to cancel and Offerup and Google play had no USEFL information on cancellation. I moved and 9 months later they are still charging me. I didn't notice until last month and I tried again to no avail. They make it easy to sign up and extremely difficult to cancel. Don't purchase any Offerup extras. You'll pay forever.,1
8192,"responsive, on time, courteous, honest",5
8193,lots of exposure I've sold most of what I posted without having to pay for upgrsdeüëç,4
8194,Trash,1
8195,The app used to work well for me. Lately the app has been failing to notify me of messages from interested buyers despite has all notifications settings turned on. I'm losing sales because of this. Also for some reason the app is now only showing me items for purchase in Kansas. I live on the other side of the country. My location settings are on and my city has been set on the app for years. I'm not sure what is happening.,2
8196,Goodüëç,5
8197,"Got scammed by someone so I requested a return, they didn't accept so I contacted offer up and they didn't even respond.",1

8199,We're Trying to find Some Affordable houses,4
8200,love offer up,5
8201,Great app. The platform works as it's intended,5
8202,This used to be great! Now it slow and has way to many pop us. Sometimes it crashes and then sometimes it slows down and you have to redo post and set up settings. Seems buggy. Can you fix the app?,1
8203,My email is not linking up .,1
8204,Won't subscribe payments error for months now,1
8205,"Full page ads is killing this app. It feels like those cheap games apps that bombard you with ads all the time. Also it's getting harder to find regular people selling their stuff. The listings are mostly small businesses posting many duplicate posts of items they're selling, specially furniture. Those posts should be limited.",1
8206,Used to be great. Now ads are terrible.,1
8207,This aid. Will make you'll love it,5
8208,Smooth transaction. No issues. Thank you Jennifer.,5

8212,Very good,5
8213,Selection poor much new for sale. Not what I expected,2
8214,"I just uninstalled after there latest and greatest update. Basically when premium came in the Picture , it made sure if you don't pay you won't get replies . Since premium came in the picture a couple months ago I can't seem to get a single reply. Heck they won't even read my messages anymore. Offer up makes sure you get pushed to the bottom and never seen. It's useless now to the every day person. It's become a resellers paradise, and I am going back to Craigslist since its the same stuff poste",1
8215,Update# 2: decided to try the app again and can't get anyone to answer any of my messages asking about products. It's been 2 weeks since I've messaged some and nothing. Keeps wanting me to pay for faster responses but im getting no responses. Seems like messages are not going through ilunless you pay for premium. But I keep get job updates which I never asked for. Deleted again. What a waste of time.,1
8216,Back from a 1 star to a 5 star. Have been quite a few issues lately. At this moment I went back to a five star cuz it seems like everything is doing good. Time will tell,5
8217,"When this app gained popularity in 2016 it was such a great platform to buy and sell on. Worked smoothly and it was so simple and easy to use. Now as were approaching 2024 ive finally decided to delete it. Its loaded with adds and they are constantly pushing you to buy the ""premium sellers package"" its laggy and often crashes, and worst of all i get almost NO legit offers. If your seirous about selling anything. Do yourself a favor and go to facebook marketplace!",1
8218,"Unable to access, the app says I violated its terms of service but I haven't even used it. Dumb.",1
8219,very good,5
8220,So many of the postings are ads and it's hard to find local postings.,1
8221,people never responded back,2
8222,Its alright it gets the job done,5
8223,A great way to buy and sell things.,5

8225,"every user should be verified. the chances or getting robe or hurt are getting bigger, and a lot of accounts are fake accounts.",3
8226,"Honestly, this app and the entire platform has been devolving. The only place I can see the prices and titles for items listed without actually clicking on the listing is on the desktop site, not the mobile site or the app, it wasn't always like this. Also the deceiving ads are ridiculous, I click on what I think is a listing on offerup and instead I'm directed to a nonsense eBay page or something similar. Friggin crazy! It was great and now it sucks. Why??? Edit: Ads now have sound -100 points",1
8227,it's the best app around,5
8228,best way to thrift shop,5
8229,Best app to find good quality things at low cost.,5

8237,great app but idk if the messages come late on purpose. also be prepared for a lot of inquiries that just end there.,5
8238,Great app but not receiving notifications of messages.,4
8239,ok,5
8240,"Used to be king but now very slow, and I have tested on several devices. Hate to say it, but Facebook marketplace is better. OfferUp please fix.",2
8241,definitely recommend,5
8242,I enjoy using the app but the search perimeters need to have an option for how old a post is. I don't want to see year or 2 old posts because those items are probably gone and forgoten about. Otherwise a very useful app,4
8243,app sucks. messaging is buggy. preset filters constantly reset. full of ads.,1
8244,it ask to manny personal information,1
8245,"Just so so This used to be a decent platform (from a shopper's perspective), but now it is clogged up with outdated posts, repeat posts, and sellers who never respond. Update 9/10/23. OfferUp has added pop ads and offers a ""premium"" version so you can pay to not have ads. No improvement with outdated listings and sellers who don't bother to respond.",2
8246,it will not allow me to rate my buys,3
8247,great guy great prices thank you,5
8248,"TruYou??!! After 6 years on Offerup, 30 transactions and a 5 star rating you want my DL information/pic front and back and me take a selfie??!! For what??!! Are you extending me credit? Am I signing a contract? No... exactly, so this is absurd and looks like I will no longer be using this platform. I'm trying to buy a clothes dryer and your developers wanna play FBi. No thanks!! I'll go back to Craigslist.",2
8249,I love it !!,5
8250,The app seems to not function properly. I don't get responses when I inquire on an item. There seems to be something wrong with the inbox.,3

8252,"Found several items I needed at good prices. Liked LetGo that had less promoted & commercial sales, but still able to find personal items that I prefer. Changed!!! First review from 2021 Refuse to use in 2023 if the Only way is to give credit card info to app to store & get hacked!!! Bye, bye Offerup!!",1
8253,I used to love this app but all of a sudden I put a car for sale and they suspended my account for no reason all it says I violated some guidelines smh now I can't even use it anymore,1
8254,Can always find good deals and more on everything I'm looking for..,5
8255,Had great experiences but Facebook marketplace seems to have the monopoly now,5
8256,Because they Stand by us and keep our information safe.,5
8257,very well app to use.,5
8258,dont use this app its filled with scammers and stolen items and offerup deactivates your account when you report a user for selling you a stolen phone that was supposedly unlocked and this app slows your phone down so badly and the worst part is how this app wants you to pay like 30 or 40 a MONTH to promote items like this app can go kick rocks DO NOT USE THIS APP,1
8259,Good app but you have to weed thru a lot of listings at times .,5
8260,todo lo que mire es m√°s caro que en tiendas de renombre!,1
8261,"App dosnt work, cant login in apl at all",2
8262,"Constant issues, wrong charges, i paid 20$ for promote plus and don't see my add popping up anywhere on the app, even when i search by the exact title..",1

8264,Garbage listings all ads and pushes shipping when trying to buy local,1
8265,I would rate this app higher except the ads drive me crazy.,3
8266,"app closes after 2 posts, nobody buys anything. lol.",3
8267,excellent quality,5
8268,All old posts,1
8269,"Sadly, the issue with offer up is that you have to pay to move your listing higher. I got zero views in first 24 hours for my sofa!",1
8270,you guys are the best,5
8271,I was charged $19.99 before the 3 day free trial even started,1
8272,Great app with the mssg features were a little better tho.,4
8273,"app is good for selling, but has glitches with notifications so you miss sales, ALSO Ads are more prevalent and annoying now, they are timed so you have to see the ad. Or the will not close. Will start looking for alternatives if anyone has suggestions please post",1
8274,I loved my desk purchased from Yesenia,5
8275,works fine,4
8276,"I just made a purchase and it was excellent, problem comes when I try to give the seller a good rating the app won't let me. It keep saying go to the app when I'M ALREADY IN THE APP! Make that make sense.",1
8277,I can't sell anything its aweful,1
8278,"Offerup is the worst app by far. I have a side hustle where I flip items and Offerup has banned me for no reason, only because they feel like it. Their customer support is also awful - they never got back to me.",1
8279,love it have everything I need and look for and more thank you for putting it all in one,5
8280,Ads make the app so slow now.,3
8281,I am reviewing my recommendation for this app. Too many unsolicited ads. It lacks searching for items by city name.. some cities have more than one zip code. You can tell the support is not from the United States.,2
8282,there isn't any control to block scammers. this app is filled with scammers,1
8283,grat app,5
8284,great venue for used and or specialty items. great deals to be had.,5
8285,"This app is just a waste of time, seems to freeze a lot when posting new items to sell, than completely erase everything you've just done to start all over again. On top of all that sellers and buyers on here are such a waste of time, buyers never come through on meetings even after you give them your address or location destination or want everything for way cheaper than what you have posted for a brand new item when they themselves over charge for beaten down worn out items they have.",1
8286,Good ap for buyers and sellers alike!,5
8287,Effective and easy. Should have tried this sooner.,5
8288,customer service is really poor you cannot reach a human it's automated,1
8289,to many people posting the same item at one price then you get there it's 3 times higher,1
8290,great selling app!,5
8291,Usefull and easy,4
8292,great,5
8293,I love OfferUp! üòÅ,5
8294,I like having a way to buy and sell for free.,5
8295,I've been using OfferUp on and off for a number of years. I never had any problems with selling. I don't recall ever buying anything on the app though. So i can't review that part of it.,5
8296,Many post are out of date. Some are from 4 years ago.,3
8297,"I have no problem with ads on apps like this. What I take issue with are ads that take up the ENTIRETY of my screen that you can't ""x"" out of and have to close the app to get rid of. I take issue with this app auto playing AUDIO with no ad in sight. I know I this app does not have permission to access my phone's speakers, and it makes me absolutely livid. Offer up needs to reign in their greed and go back to airing appropriate ads",1
8298,love this app helps in so many ways,5
8299,Seriously please update so that it doesnt lag on messages so annoying,1
8300,it won't let me UNsubscribe from the $20 per month fee and keeps chaRging my debit card $20 monthly!,1
8301,"App wants me to upload photos of my gov issued IDs to a website I've never heard of and have zero trust in, just so I can continue communicating with a seller. Also, before app cut me off, seller let me know the app won't let them ship items over 18 lbs. I'm going back to CL.",1

8308,Just Looking ü§î,5
8309,Amber and husband were very nice and respectful and were on time. good people,5
8310,Scammers will be the only buyers for you. And the app will not help you deal with all of them.,1

I emailed their CS several times as they suggested in their reply to this review and got no reply. Between their annoying ""recommended"" in-app alerts disguised as new messages from sellers/buyers, no CS support, and not getting push notifications it's time to uninstall and go back to CL/FB Marketplace.",1
8318,many people don't use offerup anymore because it does not delete the old posts. you see something you like and then notice it's been on here for over a year,1

8325,Was good until the scams and ad sales took it over and why is it so unbelievably slow its like im using dial up modems again,2
8326,"The app is acting buggy and the customer service response sucks. In my profile, if I click on purchases & sales, I only see my payment info. In my notifications, I can no longer rate recent transactions.

8330,Great app,5
8331,Useful,3
8332,Everytime I try to sell something on here I'm being told that I'm violating the community rules which I don't understand why if I ask someone to come and pick it up is because I don't have a vehicle to go drop it off and I don't have money to ship it so that is a bad experience that is reason why I'm giving it 2 stars,2

Slow customer service in response to falsely removed posts, more of a push for shipped items to show up in your search (because offerup gets a % of the sale price), significant increase in ads, now with full screen pop up ads with a countdown to close.

Then bought an item.Waited.Was rare.Waited.Not ship but label.Waited then wrote seller.No reply.Seller Cancelled order. Even had 2 item by the site.Get refund Days still waiting on that now. So all in all not doing to good in my eyes. Offer free 3 day trial upgrade to get better selling but that doesnt seem to want to work either. But is free and item is out there up for sale. So 3 stars now.,3
8367,I upgraded to get more interest on a car I'm trying to sell. So far I have only 2 people that sent me messages about my car. I'm not sure if this is worth the upgrade it's been almost 3 weeks.,2
8368,Good at first. Now my location set 30 miles from home. Settings/filter set to pickup only but all I see are for sale ads from TX or IL or California and the page is overloaded with ads and scams. Pointless to use this app. Can barely find anything local and the ad sites/shipping sites are typical scam sites,1

So I emailed them to see why that was happening. I even got the premium to try out. The next day I get a email saying I am banned and they have the right to not tell me why.

The app was good before, but they have a problem with their automatic banning system that is infuriating. Too many ads and pop-ups bother you every type you close a chat log or look at listing.",1
8390,I've had nothing but a good experience with the purchases I've had here. I believe offer up is safer than marketple and craigslist.,5
8391,Offerup is the WORST APP EVER! I have been a seller since before they took over Let Go (many years). I've never posted anything that goes against the rules or policies yet they have constantly been removing my listings. When I dispute it they reinstate my listings. Now they have deleted my account due to their incompetent system! They are the absolute WORST! A class action lawsuit needs to be filed by the sellers that have been wronged by OFFERUP!,1
8392,u can't see the price until you enter each item and it's very hard to actually find something that's in your area or shippable regardless of the filters,2
8393,good communication.items as show,5
8394,I downloaded this app for the first time today. It prompted me to verify my ID with a credit card. Immediately got hit with a fraudulent $39.99 and $3.99 charge that was fortunately caught by fraud protection. I've never used OfferUp and I never will,1
8395,Tried 6 times to post an item. Even signed up for the trial. Listing just vanishes.. no explanation. Not impressed.,2

8397,My 1st time using Offer Up. I am getting a lot of responses/sells. Yeah! The only thing that took awhile to figure out was the photo. Apparently u must submit 2. Either same or different. No guidelines or instructions make any app pretty time consuming and aggravating. So far so Good,5

8401,"Doesn't seem Offer Up holds their sellers accountable for responding to buyers. Messaged 17 sellers only 3 have messaged me back within 2 days. There are some good deals on here if people respond. And why do I have to be ""Premium"" to get faster responses for me to buy something. You'd think a business would prioritize making money from any buyer not just premium members. There is a great potential with this application. But it seems they care more about a subscription than you actually buying.",3

8404,"Never had the speed issues or ad issues other have had, but currently I'm unable to leave buyer and seller reviews. I updated the app but no change.

8417,Unusable,1
8418,App used to be good the ads are such a bother now that they stop you and Force you to stare at an ad for a set time where before they were only mixed images in between offerup items now it's both after about 5 min of using the app I just close it and check Craigslist.,1
8419,very low probability of a sale on here,2

8424,"Taking off another star after my feebie ad was removed and a message said that if i thought the company made a mistake, i could repost it but that i might be banned for another violation. That is very bad advice to tell the poster to gamble on a repost. Somebody wasn't thinking when writing that policy. Has great potential but definitely needs some more polish. App does not send reference emails when you post an ad like literally everyone else does.",2

8437,"I mean it's a decent marketplace but the biggest thing that stops me from using it effectively is both the fake notifications aswell as the barrage of useless ones. When I try to change the settings so it's only messages from items I'm selling or interested in, there is no specific notification settings for that. So you just get all the garbage basically. When I say fake notifications, it literally shows 1- 2 notifications at all times even though it's not actually anything relevant",2
8438,don't list stuff that was posted a year ago and outside the area I just told you I am looking in,1
8439,The update is a Dumpster fire üî• of trash now the old app was better the developers who did this update need to use a better Gui the older app version items were easier to find. Whom ever designed this new update should be fired üò≥ üò†üò†üò†,1

I worked out every morning, was a member of the PTA, and owned my own home. Because the developers of OfferUp went on strike years ago and were never able to update it in any meaningful way, the glitches and incorrect notifications have driven me to go mad and lose everything. I'm 96 years old, haven't posted my bike and am now homeless. Thanks O U!",1
8444,OfferUp USED to be a great alternative to other bid websites and local ad postings. It's now full of people who constantly lowball items as though they are running a flipping business. They give you the option to report people for a myriad of reasons but it doesn't do anything. No follow-up. People just get to waste your time. The app also doesn't geolocate well or tell you upfront if you're getting fed ads for items outside of your search radius. Everyone who works here should quit.,1

8450,"With the latest update the app has gotten to it's lowest point. My items are being removed for violating rules when the items violate no rules ((cleaning products, women's clothing, sporting goods)). I get generic responses about not posting things that violate rules amd the items get reposted but after much unnecessary legwork on my part. The algorithm for removing items is TERRIBLE and severely flawed.",1
8451,so I have been using offer up since their inseption. Different changws have been made but mostly to improve the site. I personally LOVE the OFFER UP app. for selling and buying. I give them a 4 star review would have given them a five but I think if you think you have perfect score there seems to not motivate to strive to do better so more thought put into our decisions. You go OFFER UP. RHONDA ARIZONA,5

8454,very good app,5
8455,"I'm not that great with technology, but I know more than the basics and OfferUp is the most unfriendly to use app ever. For example, where is the edit button for my post? What if I want to add a photo to my post? There is no edit button. Plus, OfferUp is very, very slow to upload anything. I was done with my ad in less than 5 minutes on Craigslist. Whereas with OfferUp, I'm still waiting to see my post uploaded after an hour. Not user-friendly at all.",1
8456,I bought something from the OfferUp app and the seller hasn't been in contact and hasn't shipped the item yet. It has been over 3 days and I still do not have a refund. I have emailed you guys and still have yet to hear from anyone. I just want my money back.,1

8583,"I've tried to post an item with full description and pictures for the last 24 hours. It literally just never shows up. I even bought the premium service that said my post was ""boosted"" nothing. I canceled that service quick. I'll just stick to craiglist and Facebook I guess.",1
8584,It was what it supposed to be,4
8585,never had any issues.,5
8586,Rate wont work,5
8587,I spent $3 for a day's boost for my ad. It got about 106 clicks in the first 12 hours and mostly stopped delivering clicks afterwards. What a waste of money.,1
8588,I love the food!,5
8589,when advertising started to pop up. this became the worst app. I understand that they need to make extra money. but the intensity of ads is too much,3

After receiving a shadow ban on my account, I reached out to your Support for assistance.

I believe in the potential of your platform, but this experience has left me disheartened. I kindly request a thorough review of my situation and a fair resolution.",1
8592,SUCKS!!!! Need to improve this!!! Go Back To Letgo!!! Not Free when you sell a vehicle!!,1
8593,the difficulty of posting and the need to do it over and over again has me planning to shift my business. There used to be access to very simply repost and edit similar to Craigslist I've tried the promotional posting ang it was NEVER done but I was charged. My posts have been removed wrongly with no course of action since there's no way to speak to anyone Posts are left open for years when the item is gone or no one monitoring Now it mostly just paid Ads that are hard to avoid.,2
8594,works as designed.,5
8595,I do not understand the mindset of many users of this app. items I am selling are in great shape and my asking price is generally half of what I paid. If an item is priced at $50 what makes people think i will let it go for $5.00? I certainly understand the desire to negotiate a lower price. But I think some users only offer low ball price just so they can resell the item.,2
8596,-Offerup locked me out of my account (which cost me a purchase myself) for literally no reason claiming i had broken company violation (i had just asked someone when could i pick the item up which is hardly violating anything). I asked offerup what happened they didnt respond despite saying they would. - recent update forces u to add your phone number. - extremely intrusive ads - noticeably more ignoring from sellers,1
8597,Love this app it's easy to get rid of stuff and buy stuff,5
8598,simple app to use just not alot of buyers and sellers,4
8599,"App stops sending notifications on my phone so I miss all the conversations if I don't actually open the app. I have missed plenty of sale opportunities. Otherwise, good place to sell",3

I'm so sad and disappointed. I hope that the issue is resolved soon.",1
8603,App stops working after a few minutes. It is awkward to navigate. You can click a heart icon to mark favorites but I can find no way to display those items afterwards. There is no way to delete in-app messages.,2
8604,the offerup app is very user friendly !!!,5
8605,"App is great, but there are way too many irrelevant push notifications that get sent. Things like 'new item posted that you might be interested in.'

8608,excellent and safe way to buy,5
8609,"I've used this app for years and loved it. Now, I can't even post anything to sell because it claims it's not in their guidelines. It's ridiculous because people are selling the exact same item. Not sure if it's a glitch in the app, but I'm more upset I can't just call and speak to someone on the phone to fix it. This app has gone downhill and it's a bummer because I've bought and sold hundreds of items on it.",1
8610,"Actual garbage, after the new update with the ads, the app takes 5-15 seconds to load what I pressed. The ads are very misleading and trys to make you think its apaty of the app and wants you to sign up to some scummy website",1
8611,App is dead no one responds. It was better when it was just letgo.,1
8612,"first when I look up a specific item , I get several unrelated items, so search is not great, second many ads are very old. third many sellers are unresponsive so old ads and unresponsive sellers should be removed, how about having sellers renew their ads for a specific length of time or be removed. fourth too many ads confuses the search. to be honest, let go was much better, and offer up ruined, and ultimately killed it. I also liked let go better because it was all local merchandise.",3

8614,I can't get my noteafucshon bell to work,5
8615,There is no way you can unsubscribe from the premium 3 day try,1
8616,I think it's pretty cool. You must check out continuously throughout the day if you want it. I desperately needed a portable dishwasher and got one practically new for $150.00 it was worth easily $300! (and seller was willing to deliver).,3
8617,"It's great and easy to post and sell stuff on. But this latest update has made the app near excruciating to have to use because of how damn slow in now runs. It for sure is not my phone either. You guys need to fix it please. It didn't run this awful before, not even close.",3

8623,None,5
8624,horrible support,1
8625,"By far, one of the worst app for selling. Tons of advertisements, and they would just delete your posting for no reason that is not included in their policy. They deleted my posting because they felt it was not a true tangible item to sell..the posting was my car. In addition, the app takes 5 seconds to react to any tap, especially going to messages.",1

8632,it's ok...worst part is the people who pay to get the Blue shield and are supposed to be the best to interact with never reply or never show up...these people it says has 100 percent reply rate and are completely verified...and then someone like me who answers all messages...when you actually notify me and sells things that are exactly as pictured don't get the same recognition...do better offer up...and when you get complaints from actual people and not your silly policies ...do something...,2
8633,App will not let me review seller on the purchase i just did.,2
8634,Offerup will pick and choose what they actually list. I've paid to promote items and have them almost instantly stop showing as listed. Starting to feel scammed. Pick a different platform. Tried contacting customer support but it's just a bunch of automated emails requesting more and more of the same information. Last time I contacted them they just shut my page down. Terrible customer service.,1
8635,Lost of words........,1
8636,"When you want to have something shipped to you, you must have your card scanned in order to complete the purchase/offer. But this app doesn't work when you try to scan it.

8668,"OfferUp, when it works as intended, is a great way to shop with others for items you may not be able to get elsewhere. But, there are a TON of bad actors on this app trying to pull a fast one on you, whether you're buying or selling. Even worse, the only way to contact OfferUp is via email, at least as of this review date. This means it can take forever for a dispute to be resolved, and by then, it's usually too late. So, I'm giving them 1 star for the terrible customer and app experience.",1

8760,This app used to be good. I looked up a couple of different items and showed me things that were 1 plus year(s) old. The app(Let Go) used to be amazing before it was bought out and combined with this app. Bring back an actual local app that doesn't need to collect all your data for no reason when all people want to do is sell some personal stuff from person to person.,1

You have to sift through ads by stores (if I wanted to pay MSRP, I'd do to you, smh), and the offers you do recueve aren't real. The recent addition of ADS is also very annoying. B-",3
8785,Keeps deleting my listing with no explanation why. Not able to sell my item on this app.,1
8786,"The app cant determine my location due to proxy or vpn. Well im running neither. Losing business, if you care.",1

8791,"didn't take long to notice this app sucks! It sucked before they merged with another sucky app to form an even suckier app if that's possible. The scrolling sucks, it's, slow, too many ads, apparently people list on this ghost town and never return. Most of the listings are over a year old if you can get someone to talk about what they're selling, they stop after more than 1 question. If you enjoy shopping for things you can't buy, this is the place to do it. Cant believe people place ads here.",1
8792,"Refunds, no contact number to call. I went to the website and it takes you all over the place. There is no contact or anyway to ask for a refund from offer up to cancel asking the monthly subscription of 21.76",1
8793,Above average buy/sell app. and easy to use...,5
8794,It's says it's mine. I told you my life has been screwed up because of security systems and local trash cans. And using some of the internet resources and locations to go in and out of these projective gates and meet up with ppl was life changing if I were to sum it up til now. For 5 or 10 buck most the time. But it a blessing just felt left out to do by doing so by the ppl who surround me and my family at the time. Only one I didn't end up left out of is me. I'm unemployed. Addicted and lost.,5
8795,This app is absolutely garbage. I tried posting an item for sale 4 different times and it deletes itself immediately after. Plus the ui is extremely buggy.,1
8796,OfferUp is a good app to find whatever,5
8797,Good,5
8798,Love you,5
8799,I love it,5
8800,better than marketplace,5
8801,great way to save a few bucks as well as confidently and conveniently sale thing you no longer need,5
8802,great platform to buy/sell.,5
8803,it won't let me cancel a order that I accidentally paid for,3
8804,"Slow, glitchy and the ads are excessive.",1
8805,fake,1
8806,"this app has a lot of disrespectful people here. You put an offer, and they want everything almost free, and they don't respect each other. (not all the people, but at least 50%)",1
8807,love the app and the people on this forum,5
8808,You know I wouldn't mind using this app more often but like the people who post stuff have a tendency to never take their stuff now or two never respond. So I wish it was an automatic feature to delete your post after 30 days so if no one or you decide to not do anything with it delete itself.,3
8809,Been fantastic so far!!,5
8810,Great,5
8811,Nice,3
8812,great item to buy,5
8813,Excellent,5

8816,now it has ads,3
8817,Find stuff local at good price,5
8818,So many people will assign a meet up and never show up. Many accounts are fake this app needs better quality control on its buyers and sellers,1
8819,This app sucks. Everyone expects stuff for free. So many flakey people that don't know how to communicate correctly. Lots of scammers who sell replicas.,2
8820,I try to post something to sell online and it tells me photos won't load and finally when it does it automatically removes it for no reason at all,1
8821,best ads try it you will see! by,5
8822,works well,5
8823,I love the app but when I post the things I'm selling it never get views I even try on my moms my brother's but I feel like it's because I have Samsung my sister has iPhone and my last phone was a Motorola and it worked for those so I think this app ant for Samsung,4
8824,"Only people contacting me on Offer Up are scam bots asking if my item is ""still available"". Also, about a third of my items listed for sale are ghosted by Offer Up. Those items don't show any views after weeks on the site. And, those items can't be found by myself and others when searching for them. OFFER UP has been contacted numerous times about this & STILL NOT FIXED. Between those problems and seller items listed on the site for over THREE years. OFFER UP IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!",1
8825,good app,5
8826,So far so good,3
8827,"So the platform is great, however it is utterly slow. I have done all the updates, restarted my phone, uninstalled then reinstalled it, and no luck. It runs just astronomically slow. No idea why.",3
8828,Ads make app useless.,1
8829,App is ok. Lags a lot moving from section to section or scrolling. Typing. Ect.,3
8830,"Awful. 90% stores making multiple accounts for free advertising with no way to block accounts to stop seeing them, OfferUp won't do anything about them either.",1
8831,very user friendly and safe .I appreciate this app,5
8832,Cant get in to sell stuff always say something went wronf,5
8833,Just updated again. Now it's even slower than it was before. Thought I would update the app since it said it would help speed things up. I am very disappointed that I updated. App is slow and laggy more so than it has ever been. Very frustrating makes me want to delete the app altogether,2
8834,"Noice, real freakin noice noice!!!",5
8835,"This app has the WORST user experience on any app I've used. My account was removed because their system mistakenly detected an alleged advertisement inalsteadbof an item for sale. I attempted to repost and was immediately flagged & removed. After about 3 tries, they removed my account dtatingnI broke the rules and posted advertisement instead of items for sale. Customer support will not even take the time to look at my post and clearly see it is NOT an advertisement. USELESS APP.",1
8836,wish there was an easier way to delete saved posts. especially when there are a bunch. doesn't stay in chronological order. wish there was an exact date when an ad posts.,4
8837,good service however that app itself needs some heavy-duty maintenance or upgrades because on the mobile sites from your phone it takes forever for every little thing to load and it's not the phone having issues because I've talked to a few people that I know that also have the app and they say the same thing takes forever to load and go from issue to issue category to category so that's a big problem,3
8838,Stupid app with lack of Customer service support.,1
8839,"great place to find things you might need, and don't need it brand new.",5
8840,I use to love this app!!! USE to. Its awful now. I was going to re use it until I saw all the Negative Reviews. They never fixed all the bugs and scams or the pile up adds.,1
8841,Way too many ads seem like they're direct from WISH and then the bulk of what I've looked at so far were posted sometimes years ago. When I search for something local to me the results show things from all over the country and things that are completely unrelated. It's like no one's actually monitoring this app at all. Maybe it's abandoned. I don't know.,1
8842,"OfferUp hides your ads unless you pay to reach a ""larger audience"" and even then you get few serious hits on your listings. They don't respond when you contact them. The app is laggy. Their service fees for shipping items for both buyer & seller are ridiculous. Consider other apps such as Craigslist, 5Miles, or Varage Sale if you want to actually sell your stuff. KILL THEIR APP BY DELETING YOUR ACCT. THEY MAKE $ JUST FROM YOU HAVING AN ACCOUNT. THEY SELL YOUR DATA & GIVE YOU NOTHING IN RETURN!",1
8843,been good to me 85% of the time,5
8844,"I STILL see listings from blocked SPAM accounts... This is ridiculous . I'm in the market for rims. There's a guy that posts probably 1000 times a day, likely with a bot, so I block that account but OfferUp for whatever reason STILL decides to show me every one of those SPAM listings from the account I blocked. This is the single most pointless block feature in any app I've ever used. When I block a spam account, I fully expect to never see one of their posts. This has been happening for YEARS",1
8845,Ads ruined the app for me. Won't be using it anymore,1
8846,Buggy slow and honestly the developers have let to many robots and scammers onto the program it needs to have a better screening app to actually give real people the right to sell their items to real buyers who aren't trying to make Google voice accounts with your info.... Should have a at least 3 forms of verification before you can message people ... 4 to actually be able to post stuff in general and all items should require a selfie of the person with the item not that it gets publicdisplayed,5
8847,Real good costumer service,5
8848,"Forcing 5 stars users to be truly member to be more trusted when they have above 90+ stars, basically the idea is to sell their info by providing the driver license, even though Offerup is in Class Settlement for doing this! You tell me now what offer up has become?",1

8851,Can't use app. Says I'm not in the USA.,2
8852,you make to hard to post and don't like when you sell something it's to hard to get paid,3
8853,Terrible app ! Back in 2017-19 it was great until the ads started showing and promotions were put on the app it became terrible it also banned me because I didnt want to buy their offers over a year ago I'm still banned til this day,1
8854,It's ok but a little slow,3
8855,The ads make this app so annoying to navigate especially when the UI is huge and bulky üëéüèª,1
8856,"Like most companies these days, if you let them get into your account, it's impossible to get them out of it. I finally went to PayPal and blocked Google as a whole. I also let my card get down to $2. This is all after going back and forth with them in emails. Having a heated exchange. I don't know how it's legal for these companies to keep taking your money when you do everything in your power to stop it. But once you open the door, they can just keep taking money. And you can't do anything. ü§∑",1
8857,too slow and sometimes it doesn't notify me of my messages that's the only reason why I like Facebook marketplace better,1
8858,Everytime I try and post something it gets removed but never told why. Offering a free dining room table and chair and each time I get notified that it's prohibited. Same listing on other sites post this same thing out with no issues. Not worth the effort.,1
8859,Great app but was better before they started the pay part of the app.,4
8860,Good app I like it,5
8861,great site to find a bargain.,5
8862,Not sure what happened but now I am getting very little local results and the querys don't seem to work. Always forcing me to search for 'delivey'.,1
8863,"This app has really gone down hill. Its insanely slow. Painful slow. Posts get flagged for zero reason. The entire app as you use it has crazy third party ads embedded in it that they themselves can't acknowledge that is on the app so essentially you are scrolling through ads posted by individuals and then also adds that you click on that wall take you outside of the app it's crazy. Offer up has turn into trash. Also, why does offer up not allow you you to post via desktop? So trash.",1
8864,Excellent,5
8865,"used to be great now it's not. Offer up doesnt like when u report users who are doing Medical Procedures and obviously are not certified nor a doctor. Horrible app, waste of time. Ill trow my stuff away than sell it on this app.",1
8866,It seems I'm not allowed to make an offer for an item without giving OfferUp a PICTURE of my CC? No way. Corporate security is a joke. They'll be charging my card in Vegas within a week.,1
8867,Everytime I explore anything it is met with a reasonable time and I don't have to wonder because of the response to My question,5
8868,App broke will not let me cash out from items I've shipped I'm fully verified an it's been more than 5 days since the buyer received the item. I've reached out to support an nothing. Would like my money or I will be having a class action lawsuit.,1
8869,too many ads. ads impeded in listing and pop up ads.,3
8870,"This APP is pathetic... can't log in no matter what, but the browser version is fine, app is Slow, very laggy, the ads make it horrid and slow the device to a crawl. Why do they make us have to use this GARBAGE app instead of being able to make posts from a browser or our computer?",1
8871,sure beats e bay,5
8872,"Decent app, but just not as popular as marketplace on FB. Needs more traffic.",4
8873,WOW GREAT DEALS !,5
8874,I was supposed to have a free listing and that didn't happen.. I paid for a listing and that also didn't happen..,1
8875,the pop up ads are irritating,2
8876,awesome u can find everything at your price!,5
8877,always have loved it even no the adds are bad now a day's still one of the best apps to sell with.,5
8878,Wow!!! This app shows you what is so wrong with society It's so bad for your mental health please avoid!!!,1
8879,honest and reliable,5
8880,Randomly stopped working,2
8881,it's takes forever to load,4
8882,"Had it for 9 years and loved it. Then their system fails and says 4 of my posts selling items were ""advertisements"" . I tried showing them their own emails they sent me that show my items were actual items and they deactivated my account and won't look into it even. 9 years, 3100+ sales, 1544 followers, 1200+ 5 star reviews and gets dropped cause their system failed and their ""support"" is useless emails, mostly automated.",1
8883,I love offerup.,5

8885,Good,5
8886,"Since I've posted, I have been bombarded with usless posts from Offer Up. I don't like it.",1
8887,too slow with too many ads,1
8888,them: is this still available?? me: yes it is them: (seen 3mo ago),1
8889,SO SLOW Why is this app so freaking slow,2
8890,Horrible since it merged with let go!!!! Will not allow you to filter for local only and way too many advertisements! App sucks!!,1
8891,good site to sell,5
8892,Thrift shop Online üòÑ,5
8893,SCAMMER CENTRAL Every single message I've gotten has been someone asking me to send my number/email so they can further discuss details or asking if they can send a check. It's a waste of time and MY money since I pay for the app to get my listings more visibility.,1
8894,won't upload pictures,3
8895,Sold kits of stuff,5
8896,Use to be my favorite app but now I hate it And is not free anymore.,1
8897,ad is good,4
8898,"I like the app... but... You still can't delete messages from trolls and rude people. Very toxic app, lots of scams. Having to deal with broke people who get mad at you because you won't sell them something at the price THEY think it should be. Maybe it's just the area I'm in. P.S. - The link you gave links to this -> ""oops The page you were looking for doesn't exist"" I already know you can ""report"" a person, but that does nothing to remove the message. It blocks them. SOMETIMES. It is very aggravating to log in and have to look at rude and inappropriate comments from broke people and trolls. I have complained about this for years. Just put a DELETE button for messages you don't want to see every time you open the app. If facebook can do it, I know Offerup can.",5
8899,love the app it's great,5
8900,Your move to make ads the primary function of your app has just got me searching for a new platform. It SUCKS,1
8901,This app sends way to many unnecessary notifications. When I'm not using it to sell something I disable its notifications.,2
8902,It says free app and then it charges you when you try and set up your account not my bank denied the charge so glad they did,1
8903,Roxanne replied promptly & was super easy to communicate with!,5
8904,Great app for selling things. Unfortunately the app constantly does not respond and freezes while I'm messaging.,2
8905,Ridiculous it's slow and a lot bugs can't use it anymore deleting,1
8906,"OK so now if you have listed an item in a specific category (jewelry, for example) and want to list another in the same category you have to pay $. 50? Together with being constantly shadow banned, listings being deleted without explanation and it being the slowest app I have ever used... I give one generous star. Cannot wait for a new app to buy and sell from! I would plead with you to fix the app but I know it will fall on deaf ears as it's been years of this and no fixes.",1
8907,It is inconvenient not having a matching desktop app or even website when creating your ads. Forces you to work off the phone which is cumbersome.,3
8908,Horrible!!!! I live on this app... and now I have no access!!! Its impossible to cancel subscription!!! And there is no customer service... but you have no problem taking the money!!!!,1
8909,"This is not an honest company! They charge you so that you can place an ad, but then don't allow it to be seen unless you upgrade. Then when I call them out on it, they say no refunds. This is a BS company.",1
8910,"I used this app for one day until it decided not to load any listing for me. Terrible app, do not waste your time it's too buggy. Oh and can't forget the extremely invasive ads.",1
8911,App does not work crashes after pushing 2 buttons . only works on laptops,1
8912,Scam. They charge for 30 days of advertising but provide only a week or two at most.,1
8913,"They destroyed the app with limited posting ! You only get 200 posts a month. After, you have to pay$1 per post ! They are insane and too greedy! They don't have enough getting money from these ads! Offer up needs to get a new update, or all valuable sellers will be gone!",1
8914,works well. have had good people meet up,5
8915,"More Intrusive ADDS!!! Another step in the wrong direction. Dont like the NEW update. How about removing all listings over 30 days old!!! Your Shipping option is annoying. Old listings over 30 days should be removed, complete waste of time. More advertisements!!! Listings several years old. FACEBOOK MARKET PLACE IS WAY BETTER. With intrusive adds, this app is junk.",1
8916,The app itself is very useful at times. The only issue which is a really big issue is that there is a lot of ripping people off going on. I dont know how it could be stopped but it is what it is. I rate this app 3 stars for now.,3
8917,I miss Letgo.,1
8918,would get better rating if it were not asking me for personal identification to recognize me,2
8919,yeah it's good üëçüèº,5
8920,An offer up employee tried to scam me when I posted a item forsale on the site.. once I confronted them on the website..they closed my account and erased the messages showing there fraud attempt.. I reached out to customer service but no one will call me back after several attempts to report the incident... so I deleted their app and notified Google about the incident... This is an unsafe APP.,1
8921,Runs slow should have left the 2 apps separate let go and offer up instead of combined them. Can't seem to find or sell anything. On letgo you couls make alot of purchases or sell alot of things now its hard too within both of them combined.,3
8922,good app,5
8923,"It just to be good, now all items are not local anymore, all over the state, I like to be able to meet the seller and pick it up",1
8924,"OfferUp always asking for money to continue to post on their ""buy & sale"" platform. My account was disabled. It was super nice app before buying Letgo. Then I assume that they've been thinking to get money from users to compensate the expenses. I worked as a sales associate by posting items on sale on OfferUp for years. That was not a bad thing. People who are looking for something can find some unbeatable deals. If you don't allow free postings and liberate the retailers, you'll be also loser.",1
8925,I tried Truyou to verify my verification but would not accept my mobile phone number.,3
8926,their Ggrreeaatt!!!;,5
8927,Love this app but hate the ads.,4
8928,I'm deleting this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. My accounts were removed last week for no reason and I've emailed the support team multiple times and haven't heard from anyone but an automated response stating that I've violated community guidelines when I haven't. I've been using this app for more than 5 years and I use it to make some extra money on the side and have never violated any community guidelines. Based on other reviews this app seems to be going down the drain fast.,1
8929,Too many businesses advertising their brand new furniture products. This should only be a re-sell site or those selling their crafts.,2
8930,*NOW WITH ADS AND FAKE NOTIFICATIONS AND JOB LISTINGS INSTEAD OF ITEMS * **,1
8931,pretty much have to pay to sell your stuff,1
8932,Didn't get what I ordered. They sent me a thank you gift but not my dog kennel,1
8933,I would give 0 but I can't please fix the problems on this app it use to be so good now it just has to many problems,1
8934,I wish our profile had a Wanted section. Because I posted a game I Wanted that I did not have because I can't find it without getting it shipped or costing an arm and leg.,1
8935,"The app is getting worse. Ads, scammers, old posts that never get deleted, can't see the price unless you click on the item, unable to join TruYou and customer service was clueless, you won't get priority when it comes to getting responses from sellers and see new items unless you pay for Premium, and lastly... it keeps showing you shipped items even when I have selected ""local"" only.",3
8936,"Garbage platform, everything I posted for sale was immediately removed by the 'algorithm' with no explanation",1
8937,I always had good luck on my sales. I recommend it .,5
8938,this app is a waste of time have better luck on FB yard sale,1
8939,Full of scammers and I will no longer use this app. I miss let go,1
8940,It would be okay if not for all the car lots listings. If people would actually answer there ads.they have and take down 2 &3 year old ads. Watch out for the scamming that goes on! That's why I didn't give a star never no luck at buying ANYTHING I guess I have to give it a star to be able to post this damn it,1
8941,Easy to use app to sell or look for items.,4
8942,so good,5
8943,wish the price was on the picture shown,4
8944,someone needs to make a better app like offer up.....why are posts still here from 2 years ago? and why is it not in chronological order....basic common sense,1
8945,"Giant, intrusive ads.",1
8946,"Many old ads, unresponsive sellers, and scammers. No way to stop seeing same ads once identified. Disappointing reporting process, as nothing is resolved.

8953,If you use your phone the screen is way too small. You can barely see any of the items for sale and only one line at a time with all the ads and all the extra stuff.

8954,dealerships have the cars section taken over by a bunch of repeats this app sucks now,1

8956,"App is complete garbage. Users are also NOT able to see how many transactions they had with any other individual user. Another thing is that other trash users are able to boost their ratings via friends/family accounts by 'marking as sold' to those accounts, with zero consequences.",1
8957,So I'm trying to sell something That is used for 10 bucks and you're trying to tell me it's an advertisement? I listed a handbag and some shelves and both items were flagged as an advertisement which makes absolutely no sense! What is wrong with you people?,1

8959,"always found good deals, and I never had a problem meeting with sellers.",5
8960,Dishonest platform that allows scammers to interact,2
8961,App is decent. Didnt get much interaction since they merged with Let Go. Really dont like that you cant list items from a web browser,3
8962,ok,4
8963,I have sold multiple items with some over a year old I still haven't been paid for and has been pending for just as long. I have tried messaging offerup and still no help.,1
8964,the app is good overall but that limited posting a month thing is no good and should be taken out also remove non active post,2

8967,"You can no longer use the website to post items.

8969,I love offer up because app sucks it always crashes on me it lags and needs some fixing,2
8970,"Worthless app. I believe the 4 and 5 start reviews must be fake. How is this app an editors choice app? Sellers never respond.

8979,IDK if it's me or My stuff or My price's.. but I've been member since 2017 I got Good stuff on line yet ain't sold nothing yet The 2things I did sell was off line. So tried offer up promoting My stuff yea got few more views than normally but bottom line still hasn't sold One idem on line.. very frustrating,3
8980,many scammers use this site to hack and steal info from anxious sellers & buyers... Shame as it could be a good app.,1
8981,"Think of this app as an online ""Yard Sale"". It's great for selling your ""used"" items to local buyers looking for a bargain. Like a yard sale, most buyers Expect a bargain no matter what your asking price is. So when selling give yourself wiggle room. Business should Not be allowed to sell through app. Be Aware! Cars, furniture, any electronic item may be a store or Pawn shop. Research and compare, Negotiate price, and above all be Safe. 8/14/23 latest update causing crashes and unable to open",5
8982,all good. üëç,5
8983,"Adding adds made me stop using this app, and I'm looking for another one to use.",1
8984,"this app used to be great but has since become extremely slow. To the devs, please update your app. running extremely slow these days",2
8985,üóë trash,1
8986,"Takes forever to get your money. I mailed it the day they gave me the USPS scan. 3 days later it arrived. Customer approved. Now 3 more days and I have no idea where my money is. There's no phone, the contact is terrible, at best. I guess I'm just used to EBay and market place. You get money when deal is made.",1
8987,very informational and easy to comun√≠cate.,5
8988,"The app WAS nice and helpful, now it's an ad monster with an even worse ""premium"" version for a fee! Remember when apps earned their value by being useful by default? OfferUp HAD that but threw it away to chase after more money in the lowest way possible.",3
8989,Ads 2 years old still come back on searches. Lots of improvement could be done,1
8990,like app very much...fun app,5
8991,Another trash app USED TO BE A NUMBER 1 APP now is hard to post items everything is about money we have to pay money to post items,1
8992,I want to cancel the promotion payment how I'll do that i'm done Whit this app not good anymore like used to be before Now we have limits to post it I'll try other apps,1
8993,"Utterly useless for posting a single item. Online site forced app download to post. Online says unlimited free postings, then wouldn't let me post without CC info.",1
8994,sometimes app won't respond.,4
8995,"Impossible search parameters. You post and cant find the item anywhere. Also, post from all over the country even when you set the zip code",1
8996,‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚ô°,5
8997,"Slow and buggy, so, so, annoying.",2
8998,Update ghosted my account,1
8999,"app works very slowly, and has become very full of ads unless you pay $",2
9000,EDIT: I DOWNLOAD OFFER UP EVERY SO OFTEN HOPING ITS NOT A GARBAGE APP IT NEVER GETS BETTER! Terrible app. You input your distance now search and no matter what u end up looking at things 500 miles away even if u have it set at 50 miles and there's tons of dead accounts and items that have been posted for years,1
9001,Lots of scammers,2
9002,This app is a scam don't waste your time or money on this app all these people on here are all scammers I got scam 2 times on this app so don't download it,1
9003,"trying to sell things but it keeps logging me out, changing my password and telling me i am suspicious. had zero issues posting on facebook marketplace, craigslist or ebay",1
9004,Good and friendly,3
9005,this app is no bueno.. zero stars,1
9006,One of a kind .,4
9007,love this app,5
9008,New ads suck. Auto open but I have to click the close button or it proceeds to sellers website. Sneaky ads look almost same as listings and take up nearly a full screen so you have to pay attention to NOT select them. Still same old lousy list management with items saved in no apparent order that takes forever to delete each individual thing you no longer want to watch. Promote feature doesn't use your saved cards?,3
9009,"its a spam, I posted items and its not showing",1
9010,this site sucks. they never up date anything things are on here from 2 years ago,1
9011,Not letting me upload pics,3
9012,getting messages without notification. losing out on selling items,2
9013,Great app,5
9014,sent me a free $30.00 then said it doesn't exist..,1
9015,good place to find something you need an lots of stuff no matter what it is an can get cheap if look enough,5
9016,"If I could give this zero i would. Their customer service is the wrost that I have ever seen, and on top of that the app has included ads Now! If you're scrolling into the list it will pop up, if you're sending a msg it will to, even if you want to read the description it just ads. This app was bad as it was now is just bigger pile of......",1
9017,I miss the old interface. And it is hard to keep in contact with sellers I would also appreciate if we could filter out sellers and their listings from our search results as The Phone Guys (company) keep spamming listings for the same items making it near impossible to find other sellers in the sea of their listings. And blocking accounts does not filter out their activity.,1
9018,I've been using this app for many years and I have had great experiences and good deals. Recommended,5
9019,Since when is offer up a system app in my phone that I can't delete. That's B. S. And I know you don't have that many 5 star reviews. You're paying for those stats . Just like our government lie till they believe it .,1
9020,Excellent,5
9021,Love this apps,5
9022,perfect!,5
9023,having trouble selling anything here lately,2
9024,Can't even buy stuff nobody responds. Tested the selling does not work. Sadly enough craigslist was easier to purchase items.,1
9025,good app,5
9026,easy transaction,5
9027,awesome!!!,5
9028,It's a very good app,5
9029,Requires you to turn off your vpn to use it. Why can't it just use GPS to determine my location?,1
9030,Very nice,5
9031,The app routed me to a Web site known to suspicious to collect credit card info,1
9032,I wish it was a little easier to use this appI don't need them to tell me they have something for me to buy if I want to I will buy something right now I'm in the mood to sell,3
9033,I like the app,5
9034,easy & I've met some very nice people on here,5
9035,"The ads ruined it, also no one seems to reply You are searching and ads pop, buyers don't respond, idk if it's the app, or just they don't reply to messages.",1
9036,surprisingly effective for selling musical instruments,5
9037,outstanding App,5
9038,Sellers are great about working with you when submitting offers They respond immediately...I've had a great experience with OfferUp! Thank you!! ü§óü§óü§ó,5
9039,It's a great app sometimes you have to reboot or remove and install again The most important thing to remember is the price and no machine is going to be perfect I need a nice dinner date for Saturday night maybe a nice young lady about 35 years of age 35 to 45 Yes I will help you pay your bills Thank you,5
9040,great reliable folks,5
9041,have only purchased 5 times off of offer up and all 5 have been very easy and descriptions were all accurate,5
9042,"Easy to use, both for searching and selling.",5
9043,Scammers on this app and literally nothing else,1
9044,"the best all to all things , Easy and simple to use! I love it !",5
9045,"Too much lag, freezes at times or force closes. PLEASE FIX!!!",2
9046,Would of gave 5 stars but SO MANY sellers say they ship thru Offerup but then when it's time to complete tyhe transaction they don't accept. Stop Sellers from saying they will ship when they post their items If they're not gonna ship thru Offerup!,3
9047,the app is great BUT I really dislike how it brings up ads from YEARS ago. The app should have an expiration on all ads posted.,2
9048,As Wesome,4
9049,"App likes to return to main screen at random, can't bother to look for anything or do anything with it",1
9050,I GOT REPORTED AND BANNED BEEN SHADOW BAN MY POST DONT SHOW UP I HAVE EMAIL YOU GUYS AND NO RESPONSE AFTER MONTHS!!! I HAVE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION AND STILL NO FIX TO THIS AFTER SELLING FOR YEARS HERE AND HAVING 5 STARS WITH 32 REVIEWS I GET BANNED BECAUSE SOME STUPID BUYER REPORTS ME FOR NOT LIKING MY PRICES THATS BS!!! WHAT? AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE BS FROM BUYERS?? YOU GUYS NEED TO GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER AND FIX THIS OR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF THE SERVICE,1
9051,Everything is deemed unsafe to sell! It's just as bad as the communist social media platforms.,1
9052,"None really, I just think there are too many commercials and they should ask you your interests before displaying everything but I like it",3
9053,Ok,5
9054,love getting what I need randomly reasonably priced,5
9055,lots of OVER PRICED JUNK,3
9056,I got very fortunate and found EXACTLY what I was looking for.,5
9057,They banned my 7 years account because I was hacked and the most frustrating thing is that I massaged them that someone hacked my account yet they still banned it. I buy and sell on the app with 5 stars rating. Yet they destroyed my main source of income. I guess I'll go back to FB market place.,1
9058,very easy to sell items,4
9059,"I posted a couch for sale and got 3 quick responses. All were attempted scams that tried to convince me to text outside the app, then tried to convince me to accept a check and pay them some additional money from the check funds (that obviously would have disappeared after bouncing a few days later). I didn't get a single real offer, then OfferUp suspended MY account. I can only assume one of the scammers reported me after I called them out, then OfferUp disabled my account with no investigation",1
9060,excellent communication. as described. friendly. would deal with again.,5
9061,"Was great let go was best, Then this app started to crank,Then gone, Came back it sucked.Now,. Sellers are Gritting teeth HUGE They (app ) make you pay to sell. Even cheap stuff. Not worth it.You lost a customer. ME. They want Cashish from both sellers and Advertisers there off ther Horse! NOT GETTING HORSE SNOT from me or my Sponserd Palomino. Your reeming people, Could have gotten a pair. Full set GolD + and even trail Saddle.Courtesy of ACME BEST SHOES SADDLES IN THE STABLES. TALLY HOE",1
9062,Do not get promote plus. They made it nearly impossible to find where to cancel the subscription. Although I was corresponding with technical support via email trying to get it cancelled they still charged my credit card the next day! I tried my best to cancel!,1
9063,I can't get into my account. What is beta,5
9064,"#1 NOT HAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT ONCE OfferUp offers me TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS and I say not to it, it does not give me an option to not show that again and keeps asking me next day again. #2 When I click on something, it keeps sticking different store sales of the same item. If I want to buy new, I won't be on OfferUp. #3 The completely random suggestions and selections that OfferUp sends me, what they think I may like, are at minimum stupid at maximum ridiculous. Used tampons any1?",1
9065,Requires you to give them all your personal information. Also requires you to scan your license or ID. Unfortunately I have a government-issued ID and they do not accept that. Leaving me with a useless app I can't use,1
9066,this app is very slow,2
9067,"Awful, useless customer support. Buggy app that never works correctly.",1
9068,Great and easy,5
9069,It's absolutely ridiculous to pay that much money,3
9070,Love it,5
9071,Ooh I'm N mmcki,1
9072,"Supposably first post is free. I tried posting for the first time and it never went through. I put in a ticket that never got an answer. Was trying to sell my truck to catch up on bills. Time is money. Now after going back into the app and trying to repost my original first post. I'd have to pay $7.99 plus tax because, it says the post for the first time has been posted. The post never shows up in my list or anywhere for that matter. The whole experience feels like a scam.",1
9073,awesome app I recommended for anyone if you're looking to buy items are sell items,5
9074,"Every time I type something in this app it freezes after 100 letters or so. I am forced to use the web version to even reply to messages. App is unusable. Edit: video ads and premium subscription? Instant uninstall. I would rather use ebay, or go back to craigslist",1
9075,Account lock out without any notification why. Item are not showing on local search,2
9076,"This app has really gone downhill. Local businesses like pawn shops or appliance stores are spamming the app with bogus listings advertising their stores. The item(s) in the listing aren't actually available. Reporting these listings does nothing. This makes it impossible to actually use the app for actually buying, selling, or even browsing for legitimate listings.",1
9077,Very reasonable on price and fast shipping. Would buy from them again.,5
9078,Excellent seller. Friendly and professional.,5
9079,Great app! Easy to navigate.,5
9080,"The app is very sluggish to use. I make an account and it asks me to verify with my ID (massive breach of privacy) but I did it, verification never went through and refuses to. Was this app even tested?",1
9081,"I've had the app for 3 days and it's horrid. If you send out messages for items you'd like, no one (except scammers) will answer. You literally can't buy anything here and there are no penalties for non responsive sellers. They can post as much as they want and ignore messages entirely. Accounts like this should be removed or disabled from posting because it just wastes people's time.",1
9082,great app,5
9083,UPGRADE,5
9084,"To many fake items and scammers, not enough real listings",2
9085,"Almost impossible to cancel "" selling premium""!!",1
9086,it's great when it works. Has a timing out glitch every now and then,5
9087,Since ads and paid memberships the app is basically worthless. They try to nickle and dime you any way they can with a premium membership that is separate from paying to promote so at a minimum you're paying $27 a month. I hope they go out of business,1
9088,"Horrible. Before it was Offer Up and it was Letgo it was incredible. You could ACTUALLY post, search, and even find what you were looking for. Now, however, it's garbage. I live in a small town separated by 20+ miles until the next town and I barely see anything local now. If I wanted to purely buy online and get something shipped I would do that but it's ridiculous to get on a used local listings app only to be overwhelmed with non-local NEW items I can't even filter out! Do not use this.",1
9089,"Idiot developers refused to let users post from website. ""Download our app"" yea I'll download your broken privacy violating app just to leave you a negative review. Who's your direct competition? I'm going with them, since they know how to make their website work.",1
9090,Don't work,1
9091,Got scammed shipping it's been over 3 weeks and nobody seems to be able to help,1
9092,Great app. Need a way to schedule meetings through the app. I have random people drive out before confirming a specific time.,4
9093,"The last 4 items I've attempted to sell have had 0 views over a year span. After they launched the paid membership, non paying members have absolutely no chance of selling anything. They want you to sign up for the $3/month plan and if you don't? They'll send no viewers your way. I'm going back to Craigslist",2
9094,"I love OfferUp. I like all the features and options available for streamlining my search(s), or just enjoy browsing to see what's new. I like to use the 'Free Stuff', search when I travel between Edmonds, Auburn, Puyallup and Westport. Being able to easily choose and change my current location and the distance (off route) I'm willing to travel, makes a blah trip into a treasure hunt I look forward to.",5
9095,Great app,5
9096,no enough options and it's hard to answers.,1
9097,NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT.,1
9098,Too many links to Amazon and Tamu. I'm interested in buying from private parties only.,1
9099,"great venue to buy and sell, only drawback: difficult to contact and get a response from offer up when you have a problem.",4
9100,App was better before the recent updates.,1
9101,Sucked,1
9102,it's a great way to find items at a good price.,5
9103,It will great üëç,5
9104,The best,5
9105,great app,5
9106,Excellent variety of things,5
9107,terrible,1
9108,Great app to buy and sell goods locally.,5
9109,"Still the best and fastest way to resell something quick. Reliable and easy to navigate for even the ""beginner"".",5
9110,"Another app that promotes local sellers in your area, but all the results are from 3 or more states away where whatever you want will have to be shipped. I miss Letgo, this isn't it.",1
9111,quick and easy to post items. thank you,5
9112,"The TruYou verification refuses to accept my state ID!!! It will not let me post an item without using it! No matter how clear the ID photo comes out, it still says ""Blurry"" and forces you to try and verify again, and again, and again. WHY would you force this on the user??? It's stupid!",1
9113,"I was pushed to ""promote"" my listing's and finally, after years of success without promoting through offer up I relented and ive sold nothing... Thanks for nothing offer up!",2
9114,"Their attempts to more aggressively monetize the app are alienating their users and will ruin the app. The free money is gone and despite having the highest seller fees in the business, OfferUp has decided they need to pack the non-premium experience with ads to pay its keep. My inbox is so littered with ads my messages don't even load. Now, they are limiting access to new ads by locking away access behind premium. I know everyone hates Facebook, but you're better off on marketplace.",1
9115,totally happy with this app very easy to use,5
9116,This app is suck. Everything I look for something it only show things that's been for sale 3 or 4 or even more years ago. I uninstalled the app n reinstalled it to see if an upgrade was needed but still the same,1
9117,a don't have no view on my account problem a har muy other one a different account is still not working no sales,2
9118,"Works better as a website, which says a lot as the website barely works. App is built in such a way that it is hard to access the content and scroll between listings. Really frustrating.",2
9119,"Nice item, as described. Easy transaction.",5
9120,not bad seem to be a fair amount of scammers-and cust service is tough when they don't pay attention to questions,3
9121,"Sad, but Offer Up assumes everyone is a Preditor.",5
9122,"App is horribly slow, both for loading data and app responsiveness",2
9123,I've been trying to get help from support and still not able to receive messages. I have a buyer for an item and can't take advantage,1
9124,love this app,5
9125,Chairs were exactly how described and a great price!,5
9126,have always had such good luck on offer up.,5
9127,very nice üëç,5
9128,practical app for buying items,5
9129,Better than garage sales.,5
9130,scammers everywhere,2
9131,cant read if people messaging you looks like it wants you to buy premium just so you can read if someone made a offer,1
9132,Easy Way To Make Money,5
9133,Just dont do it it won't even show you the price unless you click on it it's very unorganized.,1
9134,"I've bought 5 things recently where every single time my money just sits in escrow for 5 days and then the order gets cancelled because the seller was fake. Don't use this app, use eBay instead. Offer up is absolutely useless at removing fakes.",1
9135,Love this app you can buy use stuff that's good,5
9136,"Getting charged double. They are charging me 19.99 twice a month.... I've just emailed them. Once I get a response to see how they handle it, I will update my review",1
9137,Why aren't prices displayed over the post pictures like it is on the website? Its very annoying to have to click into a post to see the price,2
9138,"I like offer up, but I can't download the app on my tablet so I can't sell anything.. really lame that they do it like this..",3
9139,Pretty cool,3
9140,love this sight thank you offerup,5
9141,"You won't be able to purchase anything with a card, you'll need to ""scan"" it first, which straight up doesn't work even after 2 hours of trying different cards, lighting, etc. And support will just tell you too bad, you have to scan it. Waste of time.",1
9142,Rip off. They refused to refund even months after the item i initially promoted was sold somewhere else.,1
9143,Ads are intrusive and annoying. Pop ups automatically take you up 3rd party's website.,1
9144,"Never told me I have to pay 20+ for the app, I want my refund as soon as possible.",1
9145,not really worth your time to sell stuff.,1
9146,Too many ads.,1
9147,before you can post and sell as much as you want. And now it's ince a month to sell things,3
9148,"they delete your account as they wish. this app is NOT intended that you sell your stuff. they have a contract with amazon to push amazon items!! they are allowed to show price on the pic, you are NOT allowed to show price on the pic!",1
9149,"Offer Up is a company riddled with deception. I made a complaint to customer service that never got resolved. I paid for a one-time posting to sell my car, and they deleted the posting within seconds. After many emails asking what happened, I still have no explanation. They refused to refund the charge, even though I paid for a service I never ended up receiving. I asked for a free post in lieu of a refund to no avail. They refuse to tell me why my posting was removed and why they kept my money.",1
9150,Horrible!!!! Am I the only person that is having the problem where a new post erases the old posts or are you only allowed to have 2 posts?,1

Ive reported to better business bureau whats right is right & this is just plain wrong Shame on you offer up!,1
9158,Old posts . You can't sort,1

9163,Great app!,5
9164,Garbage app with atrocious customer service. Don't waste your time.,1
9165,The very first time I went on this app I was looking for a PlayStation controller for a family member found some paid the gentleman only to find out that I've been ripped off and taking advantage of by some scumbag from Houston Texas. Went to my local authorities complained offer up told them I don't want to continue using their site because of my first experience was horrid what did they do send me a $30 gift card to continue shopping at OfferUp I suggest folks stay away from the apps like this,1
9166,Good content,5
9167,It pays extra pocket $$,5
9168,"This app is a good idea, but seems ruined by what I would call a ""pay to sell"" model. You can pay $3 to promote your item for a single day, or $8 to promote it for three days. I opted not to pay - and 5 months later I have only 10 views on my post. So you either pay and perhaps find a buyer, or your posted item is simply buried. This isn't even mentioning how when you scroll through items, there are ads that look EXACTLY like postings, tricking you into clicking and giving them ad revenue. Nope.",1
9169,no users reach out or interact,2
9170,"It just keeps getting worse, now all it says is "" oops something went wrong"" and nothing else",1

9172,awesome,5
9173,"(Was) One of the better resale applications needs to eliminate users who post repetitive listing and prohibited items and services that clutter the listings. Hope they can improve in those areas as depending on users to monitor is not effective and not our job. UPDATE 8.6.23 Ads now are unsolicated Pop ups, that often require closing the app to end them. More posts that are just ads with no item. OFFERUP REFUSES TO REMOVE POSTING VIOLATIONS SCAMMERS POSTS & OUTDATED POSTS. SLOWS APP",4

I can't use the app nomore ?? Ridiculous will change my rating if I can at least reuse my email,1
9176,Sometimes the people who are interested don't even write back. You're better off having a garage sale than trying to sell on here,2
9177,Back then like 3 years ago offer up was excellent today 7-6-2023 this app went from excellent to really bad now they limit post to 200 post a month. And after 200 post I need to pay a fee. Hell no I ain't paying money. I be going to Facebook market place. üòÜ ü§£,1

9187,Pages take too long to load all images & saturated with ads that crash the post and freeze the screen. Old post with no activity are posted and no way of deleting them or filtering. Lots of scams and misleading click bate is very common on the app. Lots of stolen items sold on the app. The app is full of illegal activity and when reported nothing is done by the app managers. The app promotes human trafficking. The app seems to be getting worse to navigate and use effectively. Need better filter,1

Reputable companies would thrive by offering great apps without such tactics. 2) I can't update new address. Of course the app allows me to update my billing address, but not changing shipping address (same as billing). Customer service does not respond at all.",1
9193,Good,3
9194,Thieves. Under no circumstances should you buy a subscription or do anything with this company involving giving them credit card or any payment types. They will steal your money.,1
9195,"I like OfferUp, a good way to save money and it benefits both parties, buyer and seller.",5
9196,Awesome! I've met great people & subsequently purchased items that pleased me. Thanks.,5
9197,comes in handy for me n want I do not want anymore. Even to trade. only thing sucks is.. I think price lil high.,4
9198,I was trying to sell some furniture because I was moving across the country. A couple days after posting. It said I broke the terms of service. I tried getting it cleared up as to why. I was only givin the run around.,1
9199,"Decent app. Was able to sell a couple items. 2 stars for email harassment. I've deleted the app and unsubscribed numerous times, but I still get daily emails!!",2
9200,OfferUp needs to figure out how to take down OLD posts!!!!,3
9201,"good app all around, enjoy the pics an humble ppl",5
9202,"Does the app verifies the buy or seller ? Genuine personality, I hope it doesn't. it lacks that. That's one of biggest. I had bad experience. üëé",1
9203,1st purchase was a bust. seller had it labeled as said brand and when they finally did make it to meet up spot late I failed to realize none of products except 1 thing was the brand seller had labeled and to boot seller brought a jumble of items that aftrrwards thinking bout it didnt take the time to male sure any of it was the right size!! only a couple things were right size and honestly l Very much a let down and felt as if I was scammed. Bad first experience for sure.,2
9204,Good app,3
9205,"JUST ME luv the app but I need favor pls pls pretty pls but i get feeling only 1 of u works behind counter vs biz of folks (dont tell me either whateva works k lol) If I dont ask u 4 a thing until next year so 2024??? dble chk that yr. & IF any1 so much as mentions ur biz I'll say OUTLOUD how there's no other app id rather b using than it (the truth basic ;) & u go into my acct& change default miles from 30 to 10 ""willing to travel""?! Do we have a deal?! üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è + 5 stars vs the 4 OBV DEAL?!üíï",4
9206,Intuitive Interface. Features Work. lots of Traffic.,5
9207,"horrendous ""customer support"" what will never reply more than one time to ANY inquiry. you will always get a reply to your first message but NEVER the second.... the first reply you get will be from a human but is ALWAYS a copy paste. also... if you get scammed they just ban everyone involved or no one at all.... never just the scammer",1
9208,honest,5
9209,lost the ability to communicate with sellers. been texting customer support for weeks with out response.,1
9210,Very good.,4
9211,Quick easy way to unclutter,5
9212,Offer up is good to for selling an buying.,5
9213,no traffic,1
9214,Good,5
9215,You are a fraud,1
9216,Updating from July 23/24 sucks ball's.. done had enough. Ain't worth the stress.. in 15 min it boots you about over 20 times.. don't download.. Save ya self the stress and just go to FB marketplace. Got a star cause I couldn't leave it without one smh,1
9217,"This app used to be my go-to for buying & selling. 5 yrs later, it's lost most of its charm. Most annoying part: search results are spammed by retailers with irrelevant posts (search for ""dresser"" and get 100s of couches & dining sets). I wish the developers would do something about this. Monitor posts for keyword spamming, have a ""for sale by owner"" vs retailer option, display prices on thumbnails, and let us scroll through pictures w/o opening posts in case multiple items are being sold.",3
9218,I'm trying to BUY a washer!!! No results!!!,1
9219,The listings don't show prices on Android. It's annoying to have to tap every single item just to see the price.,3
9220,"""Something Went Wrong"" Thats literally all it says. Good luck getthing support to solve that issue. If that gives you any info about how they treat their users, evidently they just randomly dont care to let the app work for some ppl. Samsung galaxy phones are just too rare i guess.",1
9221,Sucks,1
9222,They disable accounts with no explanation,1
9223,"THEY WILL STEAL FROM YOU! I sold multiple items and as soon as they shipped, Offer Up canceled my orders (even the buyers were confused) and the buyers still got my items, but for free. I didn't get paid. I've tried for over a week to get ahold of support and they are ignoring me. DO NOT USE THIS APP. EDIT: Offer Up commented on my review and simply told me to contact customer support. They didn't even read in my review that I contacted them multiple times for over a week with NO response.",1
9224,people are spooked easily and are not buying my stuff...ü§®,3
9225,"I thought anyone is able to purchase,then why is it that a particular individual chooses not to allow me to purchase anything at all. Is this being prejudice? Linda B.",5
9226,"friendly, and legit!",5
9227,no one on this app is serious no one is trying to buy or sell it doesn't matter if you respond to the messages or not even if you respond to the message within 30 seconds they still will never open up your again turn off notifications unless it's a message there should not be notifications I don't care about spring cleaning or you looked up dressers look again notifications,1
9228,"I can't seem to make notifications for important things like messages and replies to my ads come as push notifications while excluding annoying ""hey we found some stuff for you"" notifications from the app itself. Very under-handed and subversive of the admins to not allow you to exclude their notifications while keeping the useful ones on.",3
9229,l like offer up I sold a bike on here with no problems,5
9230,Great,5
9231,very useful,4
9232,This is my 1st time using it. Found what I was looking for that was posted 2 years ago. I ask questions about it and wanted to make sure they actually shipped it instead of picking up. Due to living different states. Some people said i have to pick it up front door or meeting them. They answer I don't know? Can you just give us personal information? It was a red flag for me. üö©üö©üö©,1
9233,some great people and opportunities to buy and sell some great stuff!!,5
9234,Suck no response I try buy stuff from others no response,1
9235,Prices are way to high. For the price on stuff you can buy new.,1
9236,Glitchy just tried to post a car and its saying I'm out of free posts. Contacted customer service and they needed screen shots and my phones info to try to help me. Shouldn't be this difficult to just list a car. Now they want to email me at 10pm worried about me having multiple accounts and to tell them the correct account so they can delete the others when I have no idea what account I'm using when I signed up it said an account already exists with this email so I requested password recovery,1
9237,Horrible. Can't buy anything. Stupid thing wants me to scan my card and I do it but it just says processing payment and doesn't go through,1
9238,Seems like every posting I contact turns out to be a scam. Waist of time. Be careful people.,1
9239,"App is getting worse and worse, so MANY adds mixed in everything and since recents updates notifications are a mess. Now also scammers AND you have to pay a premium to get latest results, offer up just got so greedy.",1
9240,won't upload my pics,1
9241,"the app does work, but it's pretty clunky and annoying to use.",2
9242,"I got banned with no explanation. Made a new email didn't include my phone number, was able to post an item, I paid for a 3-day promotion on the wristband for HARDsummer 2023, but I'm not getting any views or hits. Customer service is doesn't exist.",1
9243,Good,4
9244,"when I first opened takes a long time to respond, then when I click on messages and also takes a long time to respond",2
9245,No one is going to look for my kitchen/home item under clothing. Serious issue needs to be fixed. If you see this review it means OfferUp is no response app. Listed a luxury kitchen item for sale using the brand first in the title and the new OfferUp category generator put it under clothing and accessories and after an app update is no longer allowing sellers to change the category OfferUp auto populates. This luxury brand does not make clothing and accessories. I sent a notification to support.,1
9246,extremely happy with my purchase thank you gems,5
9247,I can't get replies because of the stupid protocols,1
9248,The fact that you cannot use a desktop pc or laptop to post items for sale is a very bad feature and very inconvenient.,1
9249,"Still sucks, let go was better, Facebook marketplace is way better",1
9250,freaking awesome,5
9251,"very easy app,they don't bother u and the things u post practically sells itself.0hooked",5
9252,"Sellers are extremely flakey, response rates are horrible! OfferUp needs to hold sellers accountable!",1
9253,I sold an item and it was returned damaged and parts missing and the box is beyond gone and the buyer nor the company would fix the problem I reported them to better business bureau DON'T USE THIS APP it's not worth it update I have messaged the company multiple times because there is no phone number to reach them I have also now filled charges at the police and been in touch with my lawyer about this criminal charges on the company I am done trying to get them to fix it I want them shut down,1
9254,Open opinion,1
9255,easy communication between seller and buyers.,5
9256,Great app,5
9257,this app is so helpful for others!,5
9258,App has become trash. Constant crashing. And 99% of searches are just shady resale business reposts.,1
9259,It keeps freezing and won't let me sign in or use my location,1
9260,To many ads now it lags so bad it's used to be good now it seems like a hassle to use,1
9261,Has to many ads lately and mi money sound notifications don't work anymore,3
9262,Cant even input payment info,1
9263,A lot of cool stuff for cheap...plus I can sell a lot of stuff,4
9264,Lots of scammers,1
9265,The absolute worst out of all the selling apps. People selling never respond. If you are selling people want things for nothing and make ridiculous offers. Not a lot of good stuff on here like eBay and Mercari. Bad experience and waste of time,1
9266,Completely stupid to show listings from years ago serve no purpose,1
9267,excellent application,4
9268,I love that you can find everything you need. I really hate how nobody will respond because the app doesn't ask you to turn on notifications.... So nobody ever answers.,1
9269,It works well.,5
9270,ray was phenomenal! I love the walker and would definitely purchase items again. THANK YOU üíú,5
9271,"after the post an item, the first messages come from the scam. am I paying $7.99 to get scammers to write to me and try to steal my money from me? When will you solve the problem with registering a fraudster?",1
9272,"Don't use this app. I recently bought an iPhone 14 through offer up using the buyer 2 days protection plan last week, and now I'm getting informed by usps in my mail that the seller never shipped now I'm here waiting for a refund because in the website it says offer up will cancel the payment in 6 days but it's now the 8th day and no message in my email im still waiting for the refund the person that scammed me is named Theydislike_Young beware of him",1
9273,"I dont understand how they take a company like letgo who had such a clean, easy to use system. And ruined it with offerup. Should have closed offer up and kept letgo running. NOBODY talks about this app anymore. And EVERYONE used to use letgo. Im not trying to bash them, i just dont understand what happened.",1
9274,very happy with my purchase!,5
9275,I posted 1 item for sale - was contacted by several people trying to scam me. Canceled my account and keep getting charged every month.,1
9276,Used to be good but now it spam you with ADs and posts from years ago,2
9277,"They are now charging over 12% fee for processing & shipping through them! It used to be my favorite go to app, but it's getting more & more pricey to use.",3
9278,"Has gotten worse over time. It will take me 5 mins to post 1 item. It lags inbetween each step, any time I click on something new...ect. I used to be able to post items super fast, loved it. Now it takes me forever and on top of that I dont get notifications half the time when someone messages. About ready to give up on this app üòî",1
9279,Sales cancellation.can you please explain to me Why a seller or buyer don't have the option to cancle a sale ü§î and why customer service takes over 8 days to get back to you?,1
9280,easy to use. And easy to navigate.,5
9281,"Every fourth time I open this app, it crashes and restarts my phone.",3
9282,"People selling stuff don't respond. if their stuff is sold, they need to remove the ad.",3
9283,"too much spam, they message you but they don't follow through on what they say. only one person came through with the purchase and that's why I dropped the price for the customer for following through. uninstalled.",1
9284,I used to be able to see my inbox messages now I can't unless I purchase the premium version now this app is pretty much useless to me now I don't want yet another app I have to pay for just to use and I don't even use it that often,1
9285,"works, many users.",5
9286,i love this app it has so many good deals and usually everyone that post items here always reply quickly,5
9287,App sucks now keeps saying app not responding then closes it self does it like every 3 mins when app is open I tried to update tired to uninstall and reinstall still same thing,1
9288,"to hard to list things,its to hard to make contact with buyers and sellers",1
9289,people on offerup never respond when you're selling stuff. they ask to buy something then never respond to buy. the low ballers are ridiculous. the messages are not always sent through right away. offerup is really slow and I hesitate on using this app,2
9290,"You want to sell something on this app, ha. Be prepared for extreme aggregation and long periods of time between each message sent. Get ready to hear ""I'm at work right now"" ....and endless kids excuses. You can post a brand new car on this app for $5 and it will take you weeks to sell. The people looking to buy are totally scattered brained and can not concentrate for more then 30 seconds so be prepared for the headache. Absolutely unbelievable",3
9291,"I don't use offer up anymore, since there has been a payment pending for and item I sold over a year ago.. NEVER GOT PAID from the app. ZERO customer support. Many emails sent, Only automated replies. I've given up recovering the $ that was supposed to be paid to me. This is theft! Contact me and pay me for the item sold to have me update this review. I would advise extreme caution when using this platform.",1
9292,This app functioned so much better when it was called Letgo. Offer up is nothing but a big ad! üëé,1
9293,"I have had great success with this site as far as buying and selling items but I wish I could upload photos from my computer. if I have photos that were taken any other way than with a phone I have to email them my to myself, go to my email on my phone, download them and then upload them to the app.",4
9294,Scam,1
9295,I spent hours taking pictures to post and went through all the process got my ad up it confirmed it was posted and I've done it five times and there has been nothing on there that's mine and there's nothing in my active ads so that's less than ideal. And there's no customer service Link in it so I have to come on here to even ask why. Fail. Maybe put it back the way it was. It used to work,1
9296,Offers a very unique service...,5
9297,Adds killed this app.,1
9298,It's good as long as you stay local I done the shipping thing they paid for the label I paid for all the shipping supplies I had already discounted the item to from 300 to 150 as soon as I sent it offerup decided to take 20 for taxes but nothing until after I sent it and I am on say 4 and still have not been paid,3
9299,"This is pissing me off, I spent countless months making my account and now it merged with offerup and its not working, screw letgo and offerup. They ruined my experience with these apps. Update, Now that I have posted My review, they ban any account I make on My phone! Offerup is a joke",1
9300,"Too clunky and Support just gives you ""Articles that Might Help"" when you have an issue. I'm trying to find if you can delete a post, and no answers. Useless",2
9301,This has been horrible. Just because I have two emails it has totally screwed everything up and I can't figure this out. And no one will talk to me.,1
9302,love this app!,5
9303,"Notifications for incoming texts are vibrate, easily missed. Unclear how to change to a louder sound notification.",3
9304,Server is not healthy,1
9305,i ca t even get it to pull up my stuff,1
9306,"Well... This app certainly leaves a lot to be desired. Constantly stuck on ""loading"" when trying to post. The main screen seems to always say ""something went wrong"" You gotta have something that works if you're going to succeed in this tech based society.",2
9307,need a lot of work to make it good and safe..,1
9308,too many scammers but sometimes i can find something good,3
9309,YES ALWAYS VERY CONVENIENT,5
9310,A very good way to shop and also sell.,5
9311,Id give 5 stars the app itself is great but freezes up after sending a message or on the middle of typing and then o have to logout then login and start over..,4
9312,"Keeps removing posts right after posting with no explanation as to why. Very standard post, no url's, no duplicates, nothing against guidelines. I was going to try on web browser version of OfferUp... but they don't have that option!",3
9313,"good app, but it should remove sold items",4
9314,I've not been able to shere and copy links from this app,1
9315,Too many ads.,1
9316,I wish you guys stop updating it no one likes it why you guys can't good back the way it was simple don't start acting like Elon Musk and treating this app like how he treats Twitter,1
9317,"Just installed this app, and so far I'm pretty unhappy. Have sent personalized messages to multiple sellers, and so far none of them have even read my message, despite them being shown as active online. Based on what I've read, I question whether the app even shows messages half the time. Also obviously it's stealing data, but that's a given for a shopping app",2
9318,Sold lots of things off of this app,5
9319,great app!!!,5
9320,Great app,5
9321,"Lots of things being sold..4 stars. Its ah-some try it..JJC sebastian,fl",4
9322,"after all the intrusive ads, the app has become very buggy and slow",1
9323,good finds,5
9324,"So many bugs, and it's such a slow interface when it does work. App was definitely designed by the lowest bidder, and they don't even let you make posts on a computer so you're forced to use this app. Very disappointing",1
9325,Trash,1
9326,Deleted my account that I have been working on for several years for no reason no explanation no warning the people at offer up are DICTATORS!!!!!,1
9327,Very poor website crashes everytime I log on complete junk,1

9329,I'm not getting solid bids on my posts.,3
9330,best app out,5
9331,"App is okay but ads are more and more intrusive lately. Now I really have to focus on ignoring the many ads pushed into the feed, and there are full screen pop-ups lately which I do not appreciate. I'll be looking for other options. This used to be my favorite but now it's just frustrating.",3
9332,great experience,5
9333,"this is a pretty good app. My complaints are that it can be slow to notify you of items for sale. Additionally, if you are out of the country and someone messages you, you can't respond. it tells you that OfferUp is not available in your location. I've bought items from a few people and sometimes they find more for me, so they will message me. it's unfortunate that I can't message back until I return from my vacation. that said, this is still a really good app!",5
9334,Great transaction! Great quality! Excellent communication!! Will Shop again,5
9335,best app,5
9336,Worst service I've come across for a while.,1
9337,Ads have ruined this app,1
9338,too many dealers!,3
9339,"You'd think that this dying app would be doing anything to increase the paltry number of items on offer, for their own benefit if not that of their shrinking user base, but no. Can't list anything without downloading the app and I'm not cluttering my phone with yet another useless app that will only be used to tell people 2x/yr that the item sold elsewhere and I forgot to remove it from this obsolete clunker. Even on desktop pc! Seriously, who do you devs think you are?",1
9340,Swindled on my first purchase. No protections in place for buyers.,1
9341,Uninstalled app. Was great up until full screen ads. Terrible decision on part of Offerup team. Full screen ads offer bad experience.,1
9342,"I would give OfferUp zero stars if I could. They always side with the buyer, and leave the seller high and dry. Someone recently demanded a refund from me, but sent back an empty envelope. OfferUp gave them the refund after I declined it initially. Buyer still has the item. That is theft. OfferUp has absolutely zero seller protection. Do not use this app. The company deserves to go bankrupt.",1
9343,"From 4 stars in 2019 to 1 star in 2023? Ads ads ads. It can have them, but the app is just not optimized correctly that it stutters crashes, and I don't understand how it got so bad compared to the past. Like most, it was my favorite app, but not anymore.",1
9344,SPECTACULAR,5
9345,Fine but slow to download. Setting up account could be easier.p,5
9346,Why does your app suck so much?,1
9347,Am not able to post a vehicle for sale. Declined the in app advertisements for the vehicle both times I attempted to post but it didn't go through. L app!,1
9348,"Don't waste your time, too many ads. I'll start using it again once they get rid of the ads.",1
9349,This app wants you to pay for it now. Used to be free plain stupid. Dont install,1
9350,"This app is a cesspool for scammers and deceits. Don't expect OfferUp to ever help you! Beware the car dealers on here, they will rip you off & if you dare complain to OfferUp, they block you from interacting on the app and side with the scammers!",1
9351,great app,5
9352,scammers,1
9353,to many fake sales,1
9354,Horrible. Listings don't get any views after 3months + Offerup you keep deleting / removing my account non stop. You don't even give the ecxact reason. So you are basically discriminating new users. Paid $7.99 subscription fee you also failed to refund. HORRIBLE ! Let this be your warning from Universe : stay away from this app.,1
9355,"I have never sold anything thing on this app all I get is do you still have and that's it. and I get OfferUp trying to get me to pay them to sale it for me, I get more of that then anything.",1
9356,Why do you not allow users to post items for sale on the web browser version? I refuse to download yet another app just to sell things when I can do it easier on a different web service.,1
9357,awsum job,5
9358,It keeps flickering on and off during a POS.,1
9359,"good app, buy chipest items and save money.",5
9360,excellent experience,5
9361,"easy to use, great way to sell collectibles.",5
9362,Wouldn't even open past the logo screen the first time I tried to use it.,1
9363,great app,5

9365,Why can't you add photos to messages? rave,2
9366,"riddled with ads, no usability for managing posts on a PC, glitchy notifications, limited notification toggling, filters auto reset.",2
9367,"It's a nice app but I prefer the online version, the app boots you out if your on there too long which makes it REALLY ANNOYING! The prices are high. I don't know what else to say-",3
9368,was a great app before they got gready and started charging to post more than once a month and have ads pop up after every click,1
9369,"they made it even harder to Uninstall the subscription.. this app really sucks been paying for nothing, nothing like LETGO",1
9370,I don't like that you can only archive listing and not delete.,3
9371,Request credit card to be on app. Negative I won't,2
9372,It used to be a great app. I've sold so many things. Now it is literally nothing but ads ads ads and ads. You have to just click on one thing such as a pressure washer. Every four listings is an ad about pressure washers now. Not to mention everything is then curved towards what they think you want. And it's annoying and you can't reset preferences. The app is trash now it completely fell apart. Which is a shame. Facebook marketplace is the new king. Craigslist may you never die,2
9373,I downloaded offer up a couple years ago and from day one it didn't work. Every time I asked about a product that was for sale I never revived a response. This went on for a couple weeks. I used my wife's account and she promptly received responses. I made this known to offer up and they attempted to fixed it. It was never fixed. I tried again a few days ago and my account was terminated because they said I posted inappropriate items. That's insane because I never even had the ability to post.,1
9374,"This app is terrible.. can't find anything without clicking on each picture to see where the item is located.. I only want a 30 mile radius & I'm not interested in shipping. I select 30 miles, no shipping.. and I get stuff located all over the country.. annoying üôÑ",1
9375,This is a total rip off. They offer you a free trial and then don't let you cancel and charge you 20.00 per month membership.,1
9376,monkey is cool,4
9377,so far so good!,5
9378,no one buying our products. too much charges,1
9379,"I generally have NordVPN running all the time as an extra layer off protection. I'm connected to a server in the US, but this app won't work because it claims only runs in the US and cannot get my location data. This is false; it can get my location based off a server some 90 miles away, but it's still in the US. I guess it's back to Craigslist and perhaps Facebook marketplace.",1
9380,best app around love it,5
9381,Too many double tap ads that will activate. I'll be going back to Craigslist,1
9382,"Absolute trash now. Last week I sold a 510 thread battery and they took their 13%... This week I repost the exact same item, update the app and my account is disabled... Oh yea and it lags like hell and autofills random categories and the fact they wanna charge for selling ""up to 2x faster"" means if you're not paying them dont expect to make money",1
9383,"If you sell and ship an item, Offer Up will ask for your bank acct, and social security number. I did not know this and refuse to supply it. Not worth the $12 item I sold. Offer up pesters me daily to give them this info.",1
9384,Brand new to this app. Creating a posting was a simple interface and easy to use. However.... I tried creating a posting numerous times. Each time it says it was created but when I go to view it I'm told it was deleted. Am canceling account and deleting app. Absolutely useless.,1
9385,Easy to sell items on here. Biting is easy to so much stuff to choose from.,5
9386,Doesn't seem to work at all now I uninstalled and installed back and it's just a white screen doesn't let me see anything.,1
9387,"Quick response, easy to communicate and deal with easy transaction just as advertised.",5
9388,Great opportunities,5
9389,"Great app, but to many sold and unavailable posts from a year to 3 years old that come up when you are searching for products.",3
9390,i like it better before all the comercials,4
9391,cool local sellers and buyers app,5
9392,It crashes so often now and takes days for me to be able to look at it again,1
9393,Video ads and the fact that you still can't see price without clicking into the listings just really turn me away. I will still use ofcourse because sometimes I still need to search multiple platforms to find what Im looking for.,2

9408,"Constant runaround with support- For over two weeks I have contacted support about my listings that show zero views and don't show up in searches- Each time, I'm either told it's fixed or I have to remove/reinstall the app or logout/login. They are quick to send me notifications about upgrading my account (paying) or new items that might interest me. I'd rather have them fix my issues first. I have been quite cordial when asking them for help. So far, only craigslist has been of use, not offerup",1
9409,Very unique and very convenient I really recommend this app,5
9410,Keeps deleting my post for sale.,1
9411,Great app,5
9412,Great place to sale items,5

9414,Used to be a great app for buying and selling. Now it's completely useless.,1
9415,"The last ""update"" to the app ruined it. It just made it a worse user experience rather then a better one. It had more glitches then before and notifications are repeatative.",1
9416,because of Facebook this app I feel doesn't get enough advertising üôÉ it's really hard to sell things on here. just my opinion..,1
9417,I don't get results.,2

9419,New bedrooms moving and Holly likes this site,3
9420,so far so good,4
9421,Complete trash. I can't log in because It says Violate user agreement which I don't know why I don't sign into the account so 0 stars if it was possible,1
9422,they kicked me off because I was trying to sell my collectible Knifes but no it's okay to sell butcher Knifes I don't get it seems to me that you keen do have the same problem with both kinds of these,1
9423,Never a bad experience always prompt n very good negotiating,5
9424,Great deals and easy to use app.,5
9425,"I loved letgo I hate offerup. I save an item then I can't get to it. I can only save but can't access ,(that's stupid) They have made zero improvements since offer up took over but have made it worse. When I want several items from a vendor I have to go into each one again just to see which one I marked (stupid again). How do I access my saved items?",1
9426,Shipped sonething from my own pocket Offerup won't pay me. This is the only way to get a hold of Offerups attention,2
9427,Its cool app for the past couple of months every time I login it gives me a blank screen,1
9428,Used to work great on my tablet but has begun to seriously lag. Clean uninstall/reinstall doesn't help. Fix the damn thing! How many complaints must you collect before you act?!,1
9429,great app to sale or buy stuff!,5
9430,great app.. bought a few things and sold some.. easy to use. would like more options when filtering a search. especially cars,5
9431,Ads are very large and annoying. You have to be careful how you scroll while browsing or you‚Äôll click an ad.,1
9432,the app no longer saves my favorites,3

9434,always something I want,5

9436,Terrific! I don't have to spend money for shipping!,5
9437,"Hard to sell on this site. You have to pay Xtra to market your items. If you don't, you will not even see your items. Be prepared to wait as some items take years to sell even with good marketing .",1
9438,Got everything u might want and then some,5
9439,ALL SCAMMERS WELCOME! THIS APP RIP SELLERS AND GLORIFY ROBBERY. YOU'LL LOSE MONEY SO BEWARE!,1
9440,I have never had anyone buy one thing on this app. A waist of your time,1
9441,"The app definitely needs an overhaul. The fact that there are posts that are 4, 5, and even 7 years old is ridiculous.. It just takes up valuable space and wastes peoples time. It's annoying when you message about an item, and they never respond, then realize it's 5 years old.. Delete in active posts.. limit the number of pictures or duplicate posts, especially from the same seller.. no one wants to see over 100 pics of the same or similar items .. Really ..",2
9442,great guy on time and easy to work with,5
9443,Unusable. Crashes constantly needs optimization it's horrible.,1
9444,Real good. Has everything built in to make the sale. Good communication platform. Ads aren't intrusive and easy to spot.,5
9445,Some items for sale have been listed for several years. There are a lot of scams. Some people do not contact you and sell to someone else.,2
9446,I'm really grateful for the furniture set it really was a blessing and nice clean furniture almost new... thankyou,5
9447,AlYs freezes,1
9448,I do not like OfferUp since they bought. Let it go. It has got worse. You don't ever see any items you want for sale anymore in if there is. It's only one item for your location or of the 30 mi. Just too many ads on there that claims their stuff for sale and everything is just basically out of your state and it's hard to sell stuff on there as far as what I heard but I just don't like the fact that's not as good as it used to be. I will no longer be using this app,1
9449,"I don't really like the format of this app, i dont like that you have to click on everything just to check the price",2
9450,Lots and lots of non replies. Often there is so little information it is easy to misjudge an item. Map indicating location is often way off.,3
9451,Very nice plant selection at great prices.,5
9452,Great app/site...one of the best selling sites on the internet...we highly recommend it to others...we love it...,5
9453,TIRED OF LINKS TO OTHER BUSSNESS OR W A Y TO FAR AWAY FROM ME,1
9454,"Horrible app... I send messages no one responds anymore, and no one can find my items on the app it seems offerup blocked me, and now i can no longer login with Facebook after update. Everyday, there's an issue with this app. Nothing but ads and scammers. Update: in the past 3 years I haven't sold one thing off this app with over 80 items listed.they made it harder for buyers to reach you, they have to watch an ad be sending a message or an offer. Useless app",1

9460,"App ""needs to determine"" your location or it won't open. It says turn off your VPN. Nonsense! Allow the user to open the app and enter a location. This would also allow the user to search somewhere away from home. Don't make the user sacrifice security. Deleted the app rather than risk security. Suggest Trans Nothing, Buy Nothing, or Craigslist.",1
9461,GREAT,5
9462,The new pop up ads are unbearable. Steer clear from this app.,1
9463,Got banned for no reason. I contacted support and received a bot response with no resolution.... App got updated with mandatory ads... Don't waste your time here,1
9464,Ghost banned my account for zero reason or warning . I PAY FOR YOUR SERVICE. Beware when giving them money this could happen to you and they basically say take a hike. Never in my life have I been treated so poorly from a company I pay for,1
9465,Asome,5
9466,"I love this app. But it has so many problems. My main complaint is, I can't seem to post any adds. After I make my post, adding pics and description, on the last step I click ""Post"" on the finish page and it adds one extra number to my number of photos. ( I'll only add one photo but it's trying to upload two photos ) and then it will say ""Photos didn't load, try again"" . I rarely get to even post anytime because of this issue. If I keep trying to reload the app closes and I lose my description",3
9467,"People advertise low prices to get your attention, and give you another price when you show interest, sad but true, smh",2
9468,screw your commerials,1
9469,everything!,5
9470,"Update: terrible app and a waste of time. Sell your things elsewhere. OfferUp removes the number of the part that I'm selling because it thinks it's a phone number. Plus you can't edit on desktop, so overall it's a fat waste of time. App has a few bugs making it freeze up and the UI for searching for items could definitely be improved. Also, there are so many scammers on this app. Not the app's fault, but it is super annoying and makes listing here a waste of time",1
9471,offer up Rocks!!,5
9472,if they let you send pictures in the messages it would make some things much easier,4
9473,i purchase and sell on OfferUp and have always had an enjoyable experience. love it!!!,5
9474,"Overall it's a good platform, but the app itself does have a delay in loading and responding back. It is slow.. Needs some improvements in the technical aspect of the app.",4
9475,interruptive adds with tricky (x) exit button which sometimes are not found until a certain segment of time from your life is needlessly stolen!,1
9476,"Share function does not work on my s23+. Yes, I am on the latest everything.",1
9477,"it's the best app ever,it's amazing,you can find anything at great prices.",5
9478,Complete trash don't understand how so many people sell or buy stuff with this app it always crashes and takes forever to load anything i warn others not to use this app.,1
9479,Continues to constantly send notifications about old searches I've done months ago that I don't care about anymore despite turning off every single notification setting except for chat responses.,2
9480,Hard to use the truyou thing on here and I try to verified and confirm my email address not working for some reasonü§î.,1
9481,Awesome,5
9482,kinda hard to use.,3
9483,Good,5
9484,the ads suck,2
9485,"I'm not understanding why. I have to put my phone number in all the setting. And now it's not working, it's telling me too many phone numbers. Being ui, don't understand it.",5
9486,i keep receiving emails thanking me for selling in the site and congrats with a 30 gift card but there is no way to use it you can't even see the card just keeps telling me the site isn't there what a joke,3
9487,Completely filled with stupid annoying ads now. They increased the number to get people to pay for the premium service to get rid of them. Total BS. And the app randomly starts playing background music that you can't get rid of without closing the app.,1
9488,Always full of good deals from cars to toys and the list goes onüëå,5
9489,Slow and hang up all the time,1
9490,decent app they have alot of sheet on here some of the people are kinda xtra-chromosomed out. other than that you can purchase a hooker or buy drugs if you search for the right things. not for me though but it's an option,3
9491,"Comparing to my review in 2021, it's even worse. Downgrade from 2 stars to 1 . [My 2021 revie:] new version is much slower. takes forever to load. i just use web page directly now",1

9495,"I literally cannot upload photos to post, I am using a Samsung S20 FE on a very fast network yet they simply do not upload. FIX YOUR APP",1
9496,Won't open,1
9497,App hates Vpn. Refuses to connect with one. - I won't turn off vpn for anyone. Unusable. Worthless app.,1
9498,"Please add titles in the search results. This is not the great app that it could be, with a few small changes.",1
9499,This app does NOT have customer service! I've been waiting for days trying to get my issue resolved and nothing till this day,1
9500,blessed,5
9501,great place for music equipment,5
9502,good app. thank you so much üíì,5
9503,alot of delays and ring alerts that dont hear or ring,3
9504,it works for me.,5
9505,"There are too many bogus and business listings. this service should do a better job of removing the bogus listings (probably not easy to do, but at least allow users to flag them for review) and a way to filter out business listings (and a way for users to flag those as well). I wish there was a way to put the listing on 'hold' so others cannot see it while someone might be coming by to review an item for sale. I don't like getting a dozen messages when someone's on their way to see the product.",3
9506,Great app for buying and selling stuff.,5
9507,Too much ads. Recently implemented even more where you can no longer avoid as it fills the whole screen.,2
9508,Great app and very easy to use.,5
9509,"It was good when it started, but now nothing sells on here",1
9510,"A reputable article said that letgo and offer up are a great place to find free to affordable furniture from ""people."" All I saw was advertisement for items through Amazon and other big businesses. Not to mention that they want your credit card number for a free account right off the bat. I uninstalled within 2 minutes.",1
9511,very happy with it. I have sold most of what I've posted here. I have a couple of items for sale now come get them.,5
9512,used to be great..takes too long to load freezes and customers are lowballers,2
9513,laggy and now you have to pay for many options that were once free....and then the addition of ads anytime you communicate with someone.,3
9514,"App is great, but offerup loves to ban my account every month or so, with no warning or explanation. Incredibly frustrating.",2
9515,Pretty good app but with one major design flaw. I can not see the price of an item when browsing. What is the first thing you want to know about an item for sale??? Almost always I go to Facebook marketplace for this simple feature.,3
9516,I used to LOVE this app when it was actually private sellers selling things now it's just full of stores spamming adds 24/7 and essentially useless may as well just shop on Amazon.,2
9517,Ads in this app makes me want to sit on knifes!!,1
9518,Very good for buying things local or through shipping,5
9519,"my favorite app to get good deals yes sir, üòÉ",5
9520,Please add option to renew postings!. And the option to post items on computer! Thanks,3
9521,"If my listing's aren't instantly archived l, they're shadow banned, and I've followed the rules to the letter from the moment I signed up.",1
9522,Still no price overview. I searched for bass guitar reveals a banjo of all things and a plethora of six strings. Also that I can receive a notification letting me know that the person who listed something that I didn't even search for reduce the price because I had to look at it. Now I remember why I uninstalled this 2 years ago,1
9523,can be a lot better,3
9524,"Offer Up suck, anti 2A and full of cheap people.",1
9525,I understand you need to make money as well. But a $1.99 service fee on a $5.00 sale means i get $3.01. Its utterly pointless even remotely with your added 12.9% service fee on shipped items. Talk about gouging your customers.,2
9526,"seller was ready with the item, and gave a better deal, than listed.",5
9527,"Too many ads, too many old post, unable to share an item...the share button is there on two different locations on a post but they don't do anything once I tap on it. I see lots of interesting items being sold that I would like to share it with my wife but the share feature just does not work at all. My wife has the same exact problem.",1
9528,"Got a great deal came expected and it leaked a little bit. But that's okay, I didn't lose much of the product! beautiful colors !!!",4
9529,Taking to long to pop up,1
9530,This is the place like to sell my colitions,5
9531,they removed the search functions from my listings in latest update. who thought that would be a good idea??? it's almost impossible to find my items to mark them sold (I have to scroll for hours). THE APP IS SOOOOO SLOW AND GLITCHY.,1
9532,Lots of scammers and app does not work!,2
9533,I've sold and bought many things on here. Great app!,5
9534,Not effective at all.......,1
9535,good,5
9536,EXCELENTE APP.ISGREAT.,5
9537,upon a lot of good stuff that I needed,5
9538,Excel in all ur HUSTLE,5
9539,It won't sort by recent at all. My first listing is months old and the rest are random. There's no point seeing items that are months old. Very poor app experience.,2
9540,"The app no longer works! I've tried everything, when I open it enter my information the page is blank nothing there. Try to restore, try to reinstall app. No luck",1
9541,awesome,5
9542,so far its been great!!,5
9543,Good stuff,5
9544,Iv been band for years i demand offer up allow me back now,1
9545,I listed two items and one listing keeps disappearing the moment I posted it. Nothing special in that post that could violate their policy. No feedback whatsoever like their support article says. Contacted their support email and no response. The app doesn't have a support portal. You'll have to dig deep on their website to find it. Very disappointed. We bought many items from OfferUp but this selling experience sucks. Will uninstall the app if it doesn't get resolved.,1
9546,the best app and easier to buy or sale stuff .thanks,5
9547,be nice if the buyer actually shows up and sticks to there word,5
9548,wish the messaging system was better,5
9549,Smh canceling the subscription is a pain you will have to watch a youtube video to figure it out. The app need work after updates before it worked flawlessly touch scammers and once your subscription cancels you get unlimited pop ups and ads get worst than before. What a shame.,1
9550,They don't let your items get views unless u pay use market place or Craigslist,1
9551,"Super simple to use. take a picture(s), give a description, price it, post it and you are done! i have had a great responses",5
9552,"Always slow , notifications of new messages always late and slows down other running apps at the same time .",3
9553,amazing app to find and sell stuff,5
9554,this application really helps to give us the opportunity to get financial income to pay home bills and food in my table Thank you to all,5
9555,"This app doesn't live up to its name. It's CALLED OFFER UP. Most accounts selling aren't even taking offers they are COMPANY'S & STORES selling their merch at full price. They should have their own app to sell on. It should be OFFER ups job to filter through these accounts! OFFER UP PEOPLE IT'S IN THE NAME! Also, why aren't inactive accounts reviewed and deleted, and users made to clean up theire page stuff still on here for years, When you make an offer, you get ohh sorry item not for sale smh!",1
9556,This app USED 2 b FANTASTIC!! Since about a month ago Ive listed items for sale as I've done for years but THEYRE NOT BEING POSTED!! This has happened 2 several fellow sellers I know... SOMEBODY PLEASE FIX,1

9560,It's Allright,4
9561,"Used too much space, data, and lot of stuff was not available, and rarely had reliable info.",3
9562,"Beware of deception and false Advertising. We would were led by your app to underhanded car salesmen and got a lemon. we searched your entire site to get answers about this seller before we got there. Your lack of information left us unprepared and vulnerable. Maybe you should flag offers above $1,000 to make sure the seller is reputable.",3
9563,Some of the ads on here that are over three years old. why don't they purge any ads over 90 days old? I suspect it's because that would reveal this market place has very few actual daily users.,1
9564,"Support blocks people and even bans without reason. I've had an account here that wasn't doing ANYTHING wrong and the next day, they ban me for no reason and the email they use to ban you PREVENTS you from emailing back. Report this business to BBB.

I am not fake like others that will give a fake good report just to look good ot to see if I get something fee.",1
9568,"Ever since Letgo joined OfferUp, the OfferUp up app is horrible. Extremely SLOW & Crashes all the time. Way too many Ads now & the layout is now like how Letgo was. Note to OfferUp people. Nobody liked Letgo's layout. The latest update is so bad as well, I can't even get it to work on either one of my phones now. What has happened to this app? There is a reason Letgo went belly up. Now there cancer is affecting OfferUp. So SAD ! I don't even do business here anymore cause of this......",1

Every time you click on a post, it takes a while to pull up and takes forever to go back to the search page. Honestly, OfferUp has ruined the app with whatever changes they've been making. So frustrating to shop around on now.",1

9576,"OfferUp staff members keep removing my ads because your team of employees don't know your own rules and you are not attentive to the details of my ads. Example 1: Selling a gun holster. Not selling a gun. Example 2: Selling an authentic handbag. I have the certificate and receipt from the original purchase, but nobody requested to check the serial numbers or anything before removing my ads repeatedly.",2
9577,I hate this app. It keeps telling me that I'm not me and wrong fingerprints lol.guess I have someone else's prints bahaha. I would rank zero if it were possible,1

9580,Great selling app!!!,5
9581,TERRIBLE. App wont even load now. This app used to be amazing. Before it combined with Lego. Now its garbage.,1
9582,slow when viewing/responding to messages. hard to follow ads.,3
9583,Please add a feature to block accounts so that you can weed out people who have hundreds of posts that you don't wanna see,3
9584,"I put in a complaint days ago about a racist, cussing disrespectful person and I have not heard from anyone fro offerup.",1
9585,They take my posts Down. After I purchased them. Wont give me a refund. They're acting like Facebook government,1
9586,This app is clearly a joke. Year old listings are left up not many items actually available. Offer up has always been a terrible app sadly they bought letgo and did away with that app and just put the name in there garbage app .,1
9587,When I post something for sale I don't get views and I leave it up for a week still no views and when I ask people about a item for sale I don't get a response but the are active,1
9588,Wish there was a system to rate the flake no shows Overall I have been successful at sellimg. Easy to post items. Also have issues of not getting notifications when I receive a message.,4
9589,App is really slow. Just to look at a post over 120 seconds. Just to get of that post about another 120 seconds. I can scroll perfect but as soon as I press any item it takes over 2 minutes just to load. Anytime I try opening a message it takes somewhere from 1-3 minutes just to open it.,1
9590,This app is horrible now there are too many ads,1
9591,Difficult some times to sell things on here.,3
9592,My exspearreances were always good to me.,4
9593,Good app but there's so many bugs trying to message people. Many times it just crashes or an error appears,1
9594,Moderately functional. The UI is better than Craigslist but the UX is worse. Hardly any items and every seller I've tried to purchase from flaked on me. Probably becuase there are items still listed from YEARS ago and no accountability process to update listings. You're better off using Ebay. However they did refund my money so I'm happy about that. The app isn't great but they do make sure you don't get scammed.,2
9595,It sucks now..going back to craigslist alot easier,1
9596,good app,5
9597,The offer up is charging me for premium 21$ dollars but I don't have anything on my app,1
9598,"Free account and immediately attempted to charge me for a dating service, not acceptable",1

9601,was to use have both sold and bought on the app and always pleased with results.,5
9602,Not all that good.,3
9603,Unacceptable and deplorable stance on firearms.,1
9604,good,4
9605,This is terrible. let the app use my location...I see things from CA FL. Put my zip and radius pick up only same thing every other state other than mine. this app is garbage. I wouldn't recommend it to someone I don't like. So here we are some time later and still the same thing. They have done nothing to fix this. And it's not just me a couple in a Walmart parking lot installed it and the same thing. CA..NV...I gave this app a fair chance. But no doubt it's garbage. Move to CA.,1

9619,the seller was outstanding kind and very reasonable with pricing..,5
9620,App no longer filters posts for local pickup versus the whole nation. At this point I am only being served five year old listings from the other side of the United States.,1
9621,great,5
9622,I like offer up as the items are of good quality and thankfully the app is user friendly.,5
9623,adds suck,2
9624,The app is fine as far as I could see. I looked around at a lot of things and there are some good deals. I get really annoyed when apps start blowing my phone up with notifications. Rather than play around with settings I just uninstalled it.,3
9625,easy to post and sell,5
9626,"Remove the ""is this still available"" auto message! If it's not available we will just decline the offer! The app is crazy slow and it takes 30 seconds just to say ""yes"" and most people disappear anyway. We also need to be able to review anyone we've interacted with as many people set up meets then disappear.",2
9627,"They charge you to list with hardly any results. P.O.S. Use Facebook Market Place, it's free and more results",1
9628,It aint free,1
9629,Pretty good success,4

9631,"It has gotten better over time. There has been incidents that had happened even myself with fraudulent people selling Phantom items that do not exist... I had gotten refund it back my money from my bank. Because I had used my debit card to make a payment for an item. What time believe that they had tightened up their cyber security? So people can freely buy and sell on ""OFFER UP"" , Previously (LET IT it GO)... SINCERELY MR.ROBERT VILLANOVA",3

9637,I've used offer up for years. found many good deals. also have sold items. offer up is a good place to do business.,4
9638,found 2 cars at a very reasonable price that I am interested in getting,5
9639,this app sucks!,1
9640,good place to pay for sale items... and to find things for sale... BUT this app is extremely SLOW all the time and frustrating to use,1
9641,Good,5
9642,Not sure what happened but I hardly see any local listing now. The app has Definitely gone hill.,1
9643,it's not that great,1
9644,I had someone sell me something under false pretenses. The proof & information about this was on our messages on this app. When I logged in to get the information to file in small claims court OfferUp had deleted all messages & his information. When I wrote customer service an email said they would contact me within 24 hours. That never happened. Deleting my account & you would be smart to avoid OfferUp,1
9645,I don't have a phone number.,1
9646,Good,5
9647,too many people spam page with same dam items you message them and they want to sell you something else more expensive they should have a limit on same item post or name,3
9648,Horrible app. The interface doesn't update or doesn't provide proper feedback after sending a request to the server.,2
9649,This isn't working on my Galaxy S7 since the updates,1
9650,Credit card was compromised immediately. Stay away!,1
9651,I need living room furniture and aking üëë size bed,5
9652,m ....,2
9653,The shipping portion a bit too convoluted with little ways to adjust as needed. Local sales are wonderful.,4
9654,Aggressive automated banning and nobody to help. Typical cost cutting ruining the product.,1
9655,Horrible,1
9656,offerup needs a way to check on buyers and sellers who are not serious.,3
9657,very informative and patient all around Good guy thanks üôèüëçüíØ buddy,5
9658,to much advertising and runs very slow,1
9659,I like this site. I have had good success selling my items with zero problems. Much better than craigslist.,5
9660,"Nice market place, thanks!",5
9661,to many commercials. and now they charge for just about anything.,3
9662,I'd give it half a star if I could... 90 percent of the time it's lagging HORRIBLY I use many apps and none lag. For some reason I'm here touching stuff I want to buy and it doesn't happen for at least a minute and if I try to go back or tough anything it spazzes out..,1

9670,location is completely wrong not even correct city,1
9671,"there should be a deletion option for posted ads for the poster versus just an ""archive"" option.",1

9675,Used to be a nice app now it's full of ads and is super glitchy. Facebook marketplace is where it's at now. Craigslist and offerup are dead.,1

9681,Great way to get your stuff out there.,5
9682,Sucks,1
9683,APP IS VERY SLOW. CLICKING BUTTONS AND WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IS ALL YOU'LL DO HERE. SOMEWHAT GOOD TRAFFIC AS FAR AS RESPONDS TO ADS.,3

9687,Good,5
9688,Love it great for buying used item s,5
9689,Tried to post listing twice. Listing showed posted then was immediately delisted. Twice. What a useless app and platform. FB Marketplace way better than this junk.,1
9690,OfferUp is my favorite online market place to buy and sell.,5
9691,Terrible app will ban you for no reason Did nothing wrong but got banned Contacted support team but doesn't give me answers Better to get other selling apps,1
9692,It's not even used stuff any more. It's all store ads.,1
9693,"Absolutely the worst! Why would Offer Up keep items listed that have posted as long as TWO YEARS AGO on the app? Do you really think we are going to contact a person with an add that outdated. Smarten up Offer Up and have them deleted doing us all a favor! Updated July 20, 2023 Still the worst. More adds that items for sale! Searches bring up items over THREE years old! Check your rating's OfferUp and smarten up!",1

9698,Nice App to sell your items on!,5
9699,Wish there was entirely different app for people selling from stores I dont like having to browse through the 100's of the same item because some one with a lame shop doesn't want to pay for advertising its irritating when trying to find something you really want from someone that really wants to get rid of. Store owners should be banned from advertising and selling things on here and get an actual website,1
9700,"Incredibly slow app. No option to hide any sellers. Some sellers have hundreds of listings with duplicates, making it very difficult to sort through the results",1
9701,OfferUp I'll be using them again,5
9702,great app love it,5
9703,I haven't had any problem buying or selling,5

9713,"TONS of scams. Shares your data with 3rd parties, Beware!! Haven't touched the app in years, zero contact from Offerup. New phone. I installed OfferUp and searched for desks. My email that was clean is suddenly blowing up with ads and email from GoNift saying OfferUp gave me a $30 gift. I checked into that and it is a series of 3rd party websites asking for your Name+ZipCode+Email Address+Area of Interest.. Then those redirect to other sites. Also OfferUp filled with fake ""filler"" item listings.",1
9714,Didn't have what I wanted. I tried to delete the apt but it reinstalls it's self.,1
9715,"great, clean app for selling and buying",5

9719,"Once a listing is made the post CAN'T be deleted. Emails should be skidded to be deleted as of now you can't delete entire emails, or the ad but can only ""archive"" them. The Buying and Selling star Ratings should be separated. And, the ratings should be shown who gave the rating just like ebay's rating system. Furthermore, it would crack down on FAKE accounts quicker. I had a ""seller"" say I bought something when I didn't so he could get a rating. What's up with that?",3
9720,Best app iv used in years better than any app on the market I've made lots of sales:-) and the community is very friendly. You do have to watch out for some scammers but that's with every app two thumbs upüòá,5
9721,awaome!!!!,5
9722,Horrible very slow and full of scammers I was given fake money on some very expensive shoes I'll never use this app again,1
9723,Doesn't let me post,1

9725,all good,4

9727,"I don't understand how this app can be so bad after many years. Have they ever tried to fix any bugs? It's the slowest app I've ever used...it always crashes...it takes ages to load...it leaves text cursors on the page for no reason... if you return to it from another app, it has to reboot and you lose your page...it is full of ancient, dormant listings and accounts...I gave you a break at first but now years later it seems worse than ever. Get with the program!",1
9728,"Barely any real items here. They are filled with scammers, and they never accept payments through the app.",1

9730,Good transaction and On Time and Respectful. Thank you!,5
9731,This app sucks so bad now! It's slow and always freezing no matter what device I use it on. So frustrating!,1
9732,Irenehorace,5
9733,"Cool app, has reviews for every transaction made. Thank you.",5
9734,Great app and good features. Been a seller for a while and made so good money on the app. But probably one of the worst optimized apps. I've seen. App is over all super slow and clunky unlike Facebook marketplace. The worst part is that it's only slow on Android devices. It works just fine on apple devices,2
9735,"It's an okay app for selling things and jobs, but everytime you try making reports on possible scammers it doesn't allow you and keeps saying something went wrong, what good is the app though if you can't report certain morons! Especially to law enforcement, just a heads up people never meet at anyone's house, only meet in a public place always for your own safety! Trust what I say coming from an ex Security officer",3
9736,"Terrible application, no option to post from computer, demands personal information. What a nonsense app. Frequent demands to make in app purchases. Hard to see if you even posted.",1
9737,Dont use this app. Its all a scam full of bots who want to steal your information,1
9738,thank you very much,5
9739,Offer was good all these sellers have active mode then they Wana take off active that's some bs then they don't even put they notifications on the owner of this site need to fix these issues asap,1
9740,Easy to edit posts,5
9741,After sale of my magazines.give a rating.good luck selling.,3
9742,App stole $19 for a subscription I didn't authorize. I have never had any decent buyers on this app either.,1
9743,"App keeps giving me a blank screen, hope this gets fixed.",1
9744,Excellent,5
9745,It used to be easy to use now its cluttered with ads that have to be skipped and avoided. I guess if it keeps up I'll start using Craig's list more often.,1
9746,sold ebike in 3 hours!,5
9747,need pricing on under pics so I don't have to click on it.,3
9748,New updated included more invasive ads,1

I'm trying to open the app because I have 2 messages and it will not load. But when I click on create a post, oh, that seems to be working just fine. Cannot go to home and cannot open messages. Why? I've troubleshooted and everything. Just Will. Not. Work.",1
9757,"Since they've tried to monetize this thing, I now get screen freezes which look like they are tied to in app ads. Some ads have no clear way to move out of them - causing me to have to shut down the app n restart. If you want to monetize ads - at least make a clear exit ad 'X' or whatever. Some ads seem to bog down the app to the point I can't easily browse things. This is a bit ridiculous - and clearly poor coding and software quality. Goodbye OfferUp - I'm on a Galaxy S10+ ...",1
9758,Was very active in Oregon; but not in Pennsylvania.,2
9759,This app is purposely keeping certain things you sell hidden from potential buyers to try and get you to pay for premium or double advertising. Truly some scammy bs,1
9760,great app.,5
9761,Awesome app!,5
9762,"I've been using offer up for a decade. Never has it lagged or had any bugs like it does now. When I tap a message it takes forever to respond, it'll also prompt to delete the message as if I long pressed it. You guys should have not been greedy and acquired letgo. Instead used the money to invest in better app development. What's the point in getting ad revenue when your app is sub par. There's literally apps with less traffic like Varage sale that runs more smoothly than this ""Flagship"" app.",1
9763,nothing I have ever is inquired on or sold.,1
9764,ads on OfferUp makes zero sense. ZERO. app is terribly slow. Don't buy promote plus! It'll be almost impossible to find the link to cancel promote plus. They make you exit the app and go into play store which makes zero sense! It's been half an hour I'm still looking for the cancel option. Ads on OfferUp take away from sellers ability to sell efficiently and timely. mini commercials between searches! App has gone downhill by design to deter ppl from selling&give data to Walmart etc,1
9765,muy bueno,5
9766,$7.99 A MONTH! to remove adds..lmao I think not. Quite a ridiculous price for what is being offered. There is so much useless and repetitive listing you are pressed to find actual deals.,2
9767,"Stay away from this app. Sale posts don't show on feed or profile, non-existent customer support, glitchy app, lots of scammers.",1
9768,Cannot scan my card. Check the fb marketplace instead and save on 1000 worth of purchases.,1

9771,Very awesome deals and findings. Beats dumpster diving!,4
9772,I'm do not use the app to buy much. Mostly selling and the app has slow and been buggy.,2
9773,"Very useful, I use it daily. Too many old listing, clutters the ap, it would better if old listings automatically deleted. The last few months there is such a slow lag on everything when tapping anything such as - post, message, archive, sold - its so slow to advance.",4

9776,"The app is Filled with Pop-up Ads! I was fine with the ads that they would mix in with some of the feed results but they had to go and make things infinitely worse. In addition to the Horrendous Pop-up Ads, the app freezes so much that it's almost to the point of being unusable. I hardly ever update this app because of this same reason. It glitches way to much. The app used to be in so much better shape about 2 years ago. Fix Your Damn App and Remove the Pop-Up Ads that literally EVERYONE HATES!",1

9783,"You have ruined this app. I have purchased many things in the past from good, kind people. But each page is 50% ads now. It is so frustrating. Now it is just another app that went from being wonderful and helpful for the community to an ad filled mess. Hopefully, it was worth it for you.",1
9784,App became extremely slow. Have been a member since 2015 and have already stopped using it. FB marketplace has been a better experience now.,1

Warning to all offer up has turned into a huge scam!!!! I say don't download this app !! If you do download be safe and never give out your personal info unless you know the sorce is safe !!!!,1
9787,"I don't understand the notification system. I hit the bell to be notified of new posts of my search and it keeps sending me notifications throughout the day, daily of the same posts. It's annoying. Not being able to delete multiple saved posts blows my mind how that hasn't been added after all of these years. UPDATE. 7-17-23 still can't delete multiple posts and after you delete 1 it sends you back up forcing you to scroll back to the point you were.",2
9788,The other sites I use can be listed through their web sites so use the PC to sell. OfferUp only uploads through their App so I have to move photos onto an Android platform just for OfferUp and check the app now and then for messages. It sucks so I don't bother with Offerup unless it's a higher dollar item. You don't compete with Facebook Marketplace where I sell about 95% of my stuff through.,1
9789,"App is too slow. Keeps freezing when I try to post items. Tried using the pc version and they don't allow posting. What a joke. Switching to Facebook Marketplace, Poshmark, and Mercari. I'm tired of simple things getting difficult all the time.",1

9791,excellent,5
9792,Terrible experience we should all start the OfferUp boycott Purge I start using something else because OfferUp going to be dead in a year go back to Craigslist do you have to be kind of smart to use Craigslist be less idiots they want your ID so they can report you to the IRS and plus I'm trying to make you pay for to see premium ads or so your message makes it their first is unfair business practices in itself but then again look at where that base is at I thinks in Washington St,1
9793,"I WILL NEVER USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN. I WOULD RATE THIS ZERO IF I COULD. First I was cheated out of 250 by offer up then then a second time within 6 months due to slow customer service, which is the other problem it take them an upwards of 24 hours to even get in touch with you, also no automated service to at lease know they got emails. there is no service number (bloody stupid if you ask me) I would rather be on the phone with someone and wait on hold then this system they have.",1
9794,I can't hide posts from accounts. I want to hide these spam posts & not have to see them every time I'm browsing a simple fix is let me hide their posts. Blocking an account only stops communication with the account but I have to see them oversaturating all categories every time I browse.,1
9795,OfferUp isn't what it used to be.. me and my husband both posted things separately and have gotten zero views. You only get views if you put money into it?? No thanks back to craigslist we go,1

9799,It's a joke of an app. Can't ever get anybody to reply to you when they say they're interested half the time it's a scam. I tried it twice I listed 20 items and never had one person follow through and purchase a single item. Don't waste your time,1
9800,"DO NOT SHIP SOLD ITEMS THROUGH THIS APP. As a seller I've been scammed multiple times through fraudulent claims. I was never given any human interaction or appeal opportunities.

9828,I don't know what happened with this update but it definitely sucks two of my account got deleted without even a warning and can't even open a new account I don't recommend it to be honest,1
9829,This app doesn't even deserve a star!!!!! It only got the star is because I have to. This app is absolutely useless without being able to verify your phone number. I'm not able to post anything for sale or contact anyone who had items I was interested in. Customer Support either can't or won't resolve this after emails back and forth. This issue isn't something that the new app update resolved because I still can't verify my phone number. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS APP DUE TO THIS ISSUE ALONE!!!!,1
9830,As of yesterday I tried posting an item but it wouldn't post and once it let me before long after that it deleted it for no apparent reason. Very disappointed...,1
9831,"There's no way to rate sellers or buyers who don't show up, so user ratings are useless. Your personal info is given to third parties. Now they require that you give them your phone number. Ads are deceptive and you have to be careful and find where to touch on screen to get past them. No ability to ignore spam posts or spam users. No enforcement of stopping users who frequently break the posting rules. Slow loading. You have to click into an item before you can see asking price.",1
9832,wost app. no where can you cancel subscriptions,1
9833,this is the best and easiest app,5
9834,offer up is great help me Lot,5
9835,"I personally reported a Member Sending Sexual Emojis & texts Via this offerup site. I SENT ACTUAL TEXTS TO OFFERUP WITH COMPLAINT to look into this members account. I then shut down MY OWN ACCOUNT as OFFERUP DID ZERO about situation, leaving the pervert account up. HERES THE KICKER. 5 days later, I try to reinstate My Account. The account I PERSONALLY CLOSED. OFFERUP RESPONDED with a ""CODE"" that I, ""ME"" had BROKEN COMMUNITY GUIDELINES LINES & THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT. GO ELSEWHERE TO SHOP!!",1
9836,terrible,1
9837,This app could be better slot of the people on here like to say they want to buy whet you have but they don't like to show up and that's not very good for business,5
9838,Lags quite often app is very demanding for the RAM,3
9839,Cool app. It's helped me find some needed equipment and meet a few interesting people. Would have gave 5 stars but I just uninstalled it because I couldn't get past the second scroll without the app crashing and shutting down.,3
9840,"Am on total disability and sales helps me to survive. Not an easy job. Would like to know why i only made 50 cents, from a $4 item? Why it is so hard to cancel an order? I can't always do transaction in 3 days. Is 116 degrees an i have to walk to the Post Office. Have 2 orders on hold now. Also when I Post my email address, I know what I am doing",3
9841,Easy to use and easy to communicate with buyers.,5
9842,"""The Abominable SLOOOOWman"" is the only way I can describe the horribly SLOW (huge latency) responsiveness of the OfferUp app. One of its competitors, CL, runs circles around the OfferUp app. OfferUp needs to augment it's IT staff, and also beef up it's server environment.",2
9843,OfferUp used to be an awesome app. You must pay for premium now or else your search is flooded with Ads. I'm assuming they weren't making enough money.,1
9844,"I was way excited to download this app and check it out because we've been looking at a lot of used items and classifieds but I found out you absolutely have to have a debit or credit card and you absolutely have to give them your information just to browse or interact. So no! what a bunch of BS, won't be back here going to delete it off of my tablet as well.",1
9845,love offer up!!!!,5
9846,It could be nice to want to buy something and the listing is 5 months old..why look at the app,3
9847,I recommend you to use,5
9848,It's good. don't know if it's because they have no other app competitors. some of the features don't work the same as before. Don't like all the ad's and the pop up that are coming up now. But it's an ok app until something better comes up,3
9849,ads. scams. that's it,1
9850,"lots of thieves Passing fake money no customer service , .No filters 1 day over 10 ads for live pets snakes , Rabbits , Update slowed down everything some people probably can't access app due to Older Phones , this app and the people on here are Criminals and Thug Wake up Google Offer up is not sorry about anything . Google remove this app from play store",1
9851,nice site,5
9852,"Filled with scammers, no shows, and absolutely atrocious customer service. They charged me 20 bucks for a month of premium and didn't even promote my item. When I went to contact them about my predicament, they gave me a runaround. Would not use it again.",2
9853,no support. a nightmare if you have an issue. otherwise its good I've sold a few things. lots of no shows and low ball offers but there are some really great people mixed in with all the losers. Finally got tech support and now it's fine. So I updated to 5 stars af far as the app goes. The rest of my review stands. I've sold a few things and all the salles went well. Must use extreme caution. There's a lot of thieves and scumbags out there trying to rip you off. Make the transaction at the PD.,5
9854,best,5
9855,i wish it alerted you to messages but great besides,4
9856,if u people showed videos of the things people are selling you would be untouchable 50 % of the items don't work or false advertising we want to see what we're buying inactio I,1
9857,Man this app is so slow I've lost all kind of cells because of how long it takes just for me to open up a conversation. Also it doesn't update me whenever somebody messages me or offers me something and I have it on the settings for it to do so and it's not just because of the phones it's happening every single phone that I have this app sucks,2
9858,No option to silence message notifications. No way to message pictures in app. No way to acknowledge and turn off warnings about money in message threads.,2
9859,Like,5
9860,Slow and doesn't work. Just crashes. Reinstalled over 10 times. Nothing but contempt. Make an app that works good then try and make money. Time to go back to craigslist.,1
9861,I don't notices when someone messages me would also be nice to get email as well.,2
9862,Awesome,5
9863,"App worked fine for a long tiime , but recently the app will not fully load and hangs and never completely loads .",3
9864,I think it's awesome becsuse,4
9865,No one here is really active. Additionally there are way too many ads.,2
9866,Good,5
9867,Didn't use the app after all,1
9868,Needs pricetags on everything hopefully it updated üî•,5
9869,I do not recommend OfferUp at all I've been fighting for a whole week to get a refund on an online shipping order that the seller refused to ship and then stopped responding to me all together. Then when I put in a customer claim they said I had to wait for five days for a full refund which I had to wait 6 and after they gave my money back OfferUp decided not to answer my questions. I had to deal with so much BS just because the seller didn't want to ship and OfferUp didn't want to refund me.,1
9870,New interface has a hideous amount of ads. Terrible!,2
9871,I find deals on there Theres a lot of good items there,5
9872,"Invasive app, uninstall",1
9873,"I was using Offerup for a while to buy and sell, but today, I suddenly was locked out of my account. When I tried to log back in, it said my account has been disabled. This app allows scammers free access, but blocks genuine users. Highly disappointed.",1
9874,"Do real people work for this company? Twice I've tried to contact with technical issues and twice got canned responses with no help. It's as if they don't read the tickets at all. Also, they discriminate against people with disabilities.",1
9875,offer up has helped out a lot especially the sellers fast and quick and always respondent towards all matters,5
9876,Good,1
9877,This is by far the worst app. I installed verified account and posted item.it then tells me thtat i have to verify phone number .verified still no post now it tells me iam out of the free post even though it never posted my post .i pay for the additional post still not posted .now im unable to reach customer service even though it aeema like it was a bot answering my email. By for the worst......i want a refund,1
9878,They will randomly block your account without telling you. The only way you will know is that your posts are not getting any views. They will not respond to request to know why the account is blocked. Only resort is to create a new account with a new email and cell phone number.,2
9879,Why am I getting ads.. this is why I use Facebook market place,1
9880,Why ads?,1
9881,last update doesn't work with VPN and rhe new layout is confusing,1
9882,"this app shut down my husbands page for no reason when he tried to contact them they wouldn't give him a reason, he couldn't call and talk to anyone terrible customer service.....",2
9883,Latest update caused me to delete app. Locks up. Good bye,1
9884,OfferUp doesn't work good any more like before Or people don't want to buy,1
9885,too many inactive accounts.,3
9886,Like most apps Ads take over.. Extremely annoying. This one has fallen victim to ads,2
9887,"Nothing but pop up ads now, hate this app now",1
9888,Excellent app find everything. Your looking for..thanks offer up,1
9889,Love Offerup! But can you fix the zooming in on the pictures?,3
9890,bought a lot of things sold a lot of things grade app,5
9891,This app is randomly playing music. I had to remove it.,1
9892,Great items for everyone,5
9893,really slow,1
9894,Great sales man.,5
9895,people don't respond on there items for sale.,3
9896,"Used to be a nice app to shop used stuff, then they recently added adds so I'm out",1
9897,They deleted my account for no reason worst app ever.,1
9898,I hate the update but also I have tried to pay which I think is too high of a price for sub promote plus to sell things on this app and it tells me to re-subscribe which I have never subscribed and I have received zero help that's ridiculous and I will be going elsewhere!,1
9899,this is the worst selling app ..it's slow and not good picture of products are not good.....,1
9900,"What did you guys do??? The app is slow, too many ads, inbox messages are not clear. You guys are killing it. 2 months ago, the app was perfect",2
9901,Terrible app. They will shadow ban you!,1
9902,great app easy way to make money,5
9903,new adds are a pain.,2
9904,great experience quick response throughout the sales process very happy : ),5
9905,"slow to load, share button doesn't work. One year later: App is even slower and share buttons still doesn't work! Also another huge shortcoming is app profile info is screwed up and does not allow you to update email and phone number, app is becoming trash fast, we need a competitor to step into the space asap!",1
9906,too many expired or old ads. clean this stuff up,3
9907,this is a great place to sell and buy,5
9908,"free, huge following, well known brand.this is the place to buy n sell your items !!!",4
9909,It was an interesting experience. Time I spent taking pictures and filling out the information for the ads. Answering people's questions and getting excited when they wanted to buy something was good. Having people back out of a deal before they're supposed to arrive to pick up what they already agreed to buy is no fun!!,4
9910,"New update is even slower than previous builds; every tap takes 3-5 seconds to respond on a mid-range phone, 8-15 seconds on older phones. Resource-hungry app won't allow other apps to run in the background, and trying to switch between apps freezes/crashes the switching service. Overall poorly designed app, which is a shame considering what a great service it is sometimes able to provide. On the positive side, I love the new ability to pin messages to the top. I would pay $0.99/mo if it worked.",1
9911,most of the app works great. what is lacking is customer support. it's very hard to get in touch with someone for help.,3
9912,The app was overrun with ads before the recent changes. App is basically useless now and I've moved onto Facebook marketplace. Suggest that others do the same.,1
9913,"If I could lave a negative star I certainly would. These scam artists stole $20 bucks from me. I decided I would try their 3 day promotion, I did not produce results. I canceled on the 2nd day but they still charged my bank account. BUYERS BEWARE, OFFER UP IS AVERY SHADY COMPANY. DO NOT TRUST THEM, THEY WILL STEAL YOUR HARD EARNED CASH TOO!!!",1
9914,the app is great & when people who post stay active I have found some great deals. stay active peeps.,4
9915,Very good,5
9916,it's cool checking things you might actually like.,4
9917,amazing,5
9918,it said my coupon was active 30 days but when I click on it it said that the link is not exist,1
9919,The service is great. people using it need to be considerate of others and only make an offer if they intend to purchase if that offer is accepted.,5
9920,"This app is so slow on Android it's almost impossible to use. I have 3 phones and it's by far the slowest app I've ever used, on any phone or OS. It literally takes 5-7 seconds to follow a click through to the next menu. As a seller, trying to manage multiple items and messages? Forget about it.",1
9921,Offer Up. IS THE MARKETPLACE OF ALL MARKETPLACES,5
9922,I love offerup. With offerup I'm slowly filling my apartment with furniture.,5
9923,App is glitchy and difficult to use. It took 7 days and several complaints before they sent me the notification where I could confirm receiving the item and rate my seller. Offer Up is full of fake accounts with postings copied off of eBay so beware. In the future I'm sticking with Mercari. Never a problem with them.,1
9924,"to many adds, not enough results. Not at all like letgo was.",1
9925,App is broken. Can't scan credit card. Garbage,1
9926,"too difficult to cancel. I don't appreciate how easy it is to bill me for a subscription, but how difficult you make it to cancel a subscription. will never install it again.",1
9927,"I've always enjoyed using this app,"" but I'm disappointed in the way they have reconfigured the front page."" You now only have one-quarter of the screen dedicated to the products that your searching for and you practically need a magnifying glass to see it on a 22 inch computer screen."" Who ever designed this needs fix this if they want anyone to shop here. There logo and front page is right up in your face! 3/4 of the page is covered 100 percent of the time with there interface...",1
9928,"I give 5 stars ,but I don't know what happens to this site,it's not the same no more,u can tell when a company change owners",5
9929,extremely conducive,5
9930,Was once 5 stars but now its become a bit of a backup resort. No competition when there are more reliable sites to sell on,3
9931,B.S. is this,1
9932,"I added my debit card for purchases within 11 minutes I had over 3k $ drained from my bank account. The bank was able to get all of my money back. This company is currently under investigation, by the FBI and FTC. Just thought you should all know let go/ offer up joined up then it was purchased. Beware!!!!",1
9933,Ads don't show up even if you pay to have it promoted. shadowban people if you post something they don't like or agree with. worse than Twitter.,1
9934,"This app is a Joke, very fraudulent.",1
9935,"Well i went from getting hundreds of views to 0. I am finding that items I post for sell aren't in the feed. I have even had friends search for the item and tell me they can't find it. This used to be a great app, but it quickly going to a 1 star. They have a long way to go to get back up. Edit: one star. My account was deleted for supposedly violating community guidelines. Was not notified or anything, until I contacted them. Will never use them again.",1
9936,can't get on to sell 1 star,1
9937,It's sucked so bad because it makes you go to your email but don't save your stuff,1
9938,You have to pay to post something now this app sucks and barely gets any views on posts,1
9939,WORST APP üí© I get NO SALES. I purchased to boost my sales and STILL NOTHING. Typical scam being runned by broke wanna be rich people. NO LUCK AT ALL!!!!!,1
9940,"I like the interface. It is easy to post, easy to shop. I wish there weren't so many ads. I use it more than Marketplace.",5
9941,"Adds,adds,adds. I miss the old OfferUp. Who ever took control recently needs to be demoted this experience is by far worst of any selling app. You are better off using any app but this one tbh.",1
9942,Mlaspk,4
9943,"Even though I paid to have my item get more views, I was not able to sell it. And now cancelling my subscription is becoming way more of a hassle than it needs to be.",1
9944,"This app used to be great now its just ""ad machine"" way to many ads all the time and now you can't just ignore them they force you to see them whether you like it or not ill be closing my shop and deleting the app",1
9945,Can't even use the app anymore I am connected to wifi and the new version says I can't have a VPN or anything they really just want to monitor everything we do don't they? Bad part is I used to have it before and loved it now not so much.,1
9946,awesome,5
9947,"offer up robbed me of my much needed second income without warning or provocation. Then because I was never aware of my infraction or notified of the decision to stonewall my account, I wasted countless hours trying to understand how I went from selling 200 plus items and getting messages from interested parties all the time -to all messages and sales stopping completely. I guess my 4.5 star rating didn't account for anything either.",1
9948,great place to buy not so good to sell,3
9949,"I think the app runs to slow, I liked it better when it was just Letgo.",2
9950,The app is awesome it's fast and it's direct so use it and be safe,5
9951,Ads,1
9952,"I'm straight up addicted to this app! I love to haggle, wheel & deal!",5
9953,I cannot unsubscribe I keep trying and get sent back to Google play you guys make it hard for us it's impossible to unsubscribe from promote plus you are stealing from the people making it hard to unsubscribe on purpoae,1
9954,Great transaction and great communication,5
9955,"I used this app for years I had 5 stars never had a problem then out of no where I get a notification saying my account has been terminated because I didn't follow community standards, they wouldn't say what it was and I couldn't even ask they said the decision was final, I have sold so many things on this app never had a complaint then they just terminate my account with explaining or giving me a chance worst Application ever I do not recommend it hate it",1
9956,"Great ap, always allows me to text with potential sellers and buyers while keeping my info secret. Has always worked well.",5
9957,"I love this app, and I've been using it for a while now. I would love to give it a five-star rating, but the ads are getting really annoying. One in five posts is an ad for the product you just looked up. I also don't understand how there are so many fake accounts selling cars for $100, leading users to another site. Is there ANY admin running this app?! Edit: July 11, 2023 I have completely stopped using this app to buy and sell. The bot accounts have been replaced by ads that pop up.",1
9958,"Overall setup is good, but app continues to crash when typing more than a few words in chat. Very frustrating to have to keep closing and reopening app to finish a message",3
9959,ITS wonderful way to get fit and stay in shape,4
9960,Its good,3
9961,I dislike having no choice to install yet another app while there is a website but you can't post stuff there. Some of my posting when I initially post them just dissapear so have to do it all over again.,2
9962,Format for posting is user friendly but old postings from over a year+ don't get deleted.,2
9963,"My beautiful loving oldest daughter ‚ù§Ô∏è when she had her first home for friends ‚ù§Ô∏è she had found the most beautiful resealable priced ,beautiful house üè† items for every room in her 1st new home and also found so many other really Nice other items too.

Have a Beautiful Blessed day and Besafe out there friends ‚ù§Ô∏è üëµ stormy Anglin and fur baby mr.L.t too. Love taft,ca",5
9964,"I guess OfferUp is dead now guys. Saw this coming, the old bait and switch. Bought all the competition to creat a monopoly. The app is unusable now with the amount of ads and private data it mines. OfferUp killed itself. Uninstalling.",1
9965,Keep try to post my Louis Vuitton Purses and bags and keeps taking it down saying it's fake this app use to be great but now it sucks.,1
9966,Not user friendly.,2
9967,not working for galaxy s7 active on home page inbox etc only when u click on item recommendation from notifications offer up please fix this and I will update my review,1
9968,"It would be nice if offer up promoted my sale items more frequently without paying. Maybe putting more advertising on the app would provide a better selling field? I had a guy ask me about a sale item I had posted 2 years ago and wasn't even sure if I still had it available for him. Besides that issue, my experience has been very nice!",5
9969,"worthless, app hangs up. people are fake with no real contact info there is no accountability for unscrupulous sellers buyers beware",1
9970,Offer Up is an amazing place to find that awesome just the right thing for just the right price!,5
9971,Constant emails and notifications even after one turns them all off. They'll continue to send you notifications a day after....,1
9972,"Absolute joke of an app. Full of stationary ads while scrolling, pop up ads when you tap on a posting, and when posting an listing it wont show up for half an hour to an hour to the public to promote the ""premium"" listing option. It didnt use to be like this, Id rather go back to Craigslist.",1
9973,"I was offered a 3 day FREE day trial but when I tried to cancel, was charged $21.71.",1
9974,NOT A RELIABLE SITE!,1
9975,Great app,5
9976,"OfferUp deleted my friend's account because he asked someone if they can not read a listing how would they be able to make the necessary repairs to the thing in question next thing you know, Karen at OfferUp deleted his account. now info like OfferUp criminals who are in camera burglarizing his home and others stealing things in his place on warden cam. and of course the folks wanting to come buy things. OfferUp seems to be looking out for the wrong folks. we will explain on TikTok soon.",1
9977,Nice for selling and buying,4
9978,don't get respond or have axes to message going through,1
9979,so far it's the best app I have tried for buying/selling stuff online.,5
9980,Loving this app!,5
9981,"It's great for filtering spammers and has a safer feel to it. I have come across quite a few professional/honest people since joining. However, there is less foot traffic (if you don't pay to boost your post) and I DID pay for something, got the receipt, post never showed. Emailed customer support. They gave me a list of suggestions, I tried them, nothing changed and they just sort of did nothing from there. I believe that if you buy/sell A LOT this a good app. Otherwise, not so much.",4
9982,Would make zero stars but can't. Same complaints as others. Even paid for relisting an item that was accidentally marked sold and asked customer service for a refund of 7.99 dollars. Told flat out that it's not possible. Going back to Craigslist,1
9983,"I can no longer sign into the app. It literally just sits there with a loading circle spinning for 10 minutes and then goes back to the sign in screen. This used to be my go to selling app because I could sell locally but after my items were stolen and customer service did absolutely nothing to help me get my items or money back and now how slow and laggy it's become, I think I'll go to FB Marketplace. I can't even post anything anyway! I can't log in to do so!!!!!!!!",1
9984,don't like all the extra text on stuff I look at or related to what I'm looking for,3
9985,Used to be a great app. I've been using it since 2015 and Bought and sold many things. But recently it has been horrible. It has been on a downward spiral ever since it merged with letgo. They have also gotten very greedy and plaster intrusive ads all over the place. And it looks like most people have moved on to Facebook Marketplace. Edit: They added more ads. It only gets worse overtime,1
9986,OfferUp is not letting me sign in and is super lagging,1
9987,Not getting any verification codes. Unable to contact anyone regarding purchases. Retard devs.,1
9988,"I find FB Marketplace has too many scammers, this app is much betyer.",5
9989,full of ads and soooo slow!,1
9990,Downloaded ap and don't have a Visa card so couldn't even get on. Looked for contact to see why no other cards - no contact avail.,1
9991,I really like a bargain and the priceling.üíïüíïüíïüíïüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüíØüíØüíØüíØ,5
9992,no one reply,1
9993,"Terrible. Don't download this app. It directed me to fill out my credit card info for ""verification only"" and they tried charging me 39.99. Luckily, my bank flagged it as fraud.",1
9994,"Would be fine but more ads among search results over time, no setting to exclude shipped items forever, and now full page ads that you have to wait to close (2 in a row was the last straw). I'm trying to buy items from people near me, have some respect for your users, won't be using again Oh yeah, other reviews reminded me you still can't see prices on items in search results. Unserious company, just just CL (screw FB)",2
9995,smooth operations,5
9996,"Was (mostly) working just fine for years. Began acting a little sluggish lately, so I did an update. HUGE MISTAKE! Now super glitchy, freezes on initial screen upon opening and won't run. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice now to no avail. OfferUp, you need to fix these defects a.s.a.p. !",2
9997,love it,5
9998,too many ads for items I've looked at make it confusing,3
9999,too many ads and people don't respond,1
10000,"Too many ads. I didn't mind the sponsored ads that would pop up in my feed. In fact I bought some of the items. But the locking out and playing a game add is too much. I really liked letgo, I've used it a lot. The integrated chat is a great feature. but if this is the way they are going with ads I'll just use marketplace or craigslist",1
10001,Cannot install,3
10002,"This is a terrible app. I hate that they bought out Letgo. Letgo wss the superior app in every way. Offer up spams you with ads. It is very hard to navigate local sells without them advertising products NOT related to your search. You have to manually set the search function to be local only, otherwise you're viewing sales from all over the states. I'm working too hard to find stuff. You can't delete anything you're selling if you change your mind. You archive only. I uninstalled. Worthless.",1
10003,Why are there ads? Just makes no sense and feels jarring when you're casually looking at interested items and suddenly hit with a video or ad. I'll just use the browser version from now on.,2
10004,Great,5
10005,easy to set up you just have to remember to conventional check so when potential buyers make contact you can give a quick response.,5
10006,love how easy this site is,5
10007,Return Letgo interface! Offer up interface is terrible!,1
10008,"I used to love scrolling through OfferUp rather than social media, was just passing my free time here, now it's frustrating, annoying and I don't like it This Ads are in every scroll down, some take the entire Screen!? Why!? Why!! Craigslist sees me there more often now ‚úåüèº",1
10009,it soo good,5
10010,"I need to reset my password but, it never sends me the link.",3
10011,OfferUp sucks big time. Period.,1
10012,I love how they don't tax you on your sells,5
10013,"Horrible.i share account with husband. We get logged out and can't log back into any of our accounts, if we forget the password (which we did) gives you like 3 attempts then it disables. We had to recreate other accounts and this last one was the last straw, had trouble even resetting the password. Just gonna Uninstall forever. Keep having bad technical problems. Also now they wanna charge you more to ""promote"" and now for ""ad free""-confusing & waste of money",1
10014,Please update this app. It's literal garbage on my phone. All it does is freeze. LetGo Was waaaaaaayyy better but then y'all merged and ruined it. #offerupsucks,1
10015,Today OfferUp randomly took $13 from my PayPal account and signed me up for some kind of meta services. I never approve this. FB can just pound sand. I hate everything about meta services. They're all garbage. I deleted my account and uninstalled the stupid app. See you later Facebook,1
10016,Messages stopped working after last update on samsung s21ultra. No ability to communicate with buyers or sellers anymore ruins the app worse than the obnoxious ads do.,1
10017,Its not easy to open the app and find deals in mu area in Harrisburg Pa.,2
10018,"I have the basic version, no legitimate inquiries on my posts yet.. seems pretty shady, like a bunch of hobo-ish cyber criminals lurking around fighting for any scrap on the post market",2
10019,"great seller, super nice",5
10020,Terribly laggy. Takes forever to post and multiple tapa to get any kind of function.,2
10021,It used to be a solid app. Great app before the merge. Has become too commercial. Used to be great for local sales but now not so much. Far too many ads as well,1
10022,very friendly and helpful! everything in good condition!,5
10023,verry helpfull app,5
10024,great place to find everything.,5
10025,So many transaction do not get responded to and the offer expires. very unreliable purchasing app.,2
10026,"Easy to list and sell things locally. I have never searched for anything or bought anything but I have listed skateboards, video games, a basketball hoop and a microwave. I get a random daily notification that just says ""OfferUp Yukon Denali items for you"" while I do own a Chevy truck interchangeable with GMC parts. I have never looked them up on this app but continue to get the same ad notification everyday at weird times. Really bugs me. Easy enough to disable but why does it have to exist.",3
10027,Pretty sure no one is even seeing my items for sale. Lame,1
10028,"Flags my posts constantly for absolutely no reason-- I follow community guidelines and posts match the dozens already posted. My posts will be essentially a copy of those already appearing on the app (with my items) and I will get flagged. Support is absolutely no help and doesn't actually care-- they simply snidely respond with ""make sure you're following community guidelines"" (I literally am. If I'm not, then hundreds of other users aren't yet are still posting).",2
10029,Horrible customer service. Because there is none. Only an email that can take up too two days to respond. I purchased an item. The seller had 3 days to ship it I get my money back. Didn't ship. Didn't receive my money.,1
10030,"Offer Up is awesome! In a way this app. is a scavenger who unites the end of the life of something with you to a new life elsewhere. Recycleing at it's best . This is a great idea and all who participate give a little ""pat to your back, "" your a part of a good experience, and an example of life evolving into positive trends of behavior, that work for the whole picture. When initiative goes in the right direction our green planet benefits from it now and in the future. Stop waste when you can!",5
10031,To much ads. Charges to post 2nd car for sale.,1
10032,"App keeps getting worse and worse with each update! Plus, the moderators are terrible, that's why I would never ever pay to sell on there!",1
10033,Was good 2 years ago now Advertisement slow I will uninstall it soon Advertisement piss me off.,1
10034,"I just signed up to sell a table and paid extra to promote the sale, and I had a 3 day trial. I received 6 inquiries over the next few days all asking if it was still available, to which I responded yes it's still available. I never heard back from anyone. I even sent messages to all of them, but all I received was nothing. if I was into conspiracies, I would think that OfferUp was playing out the 3 day trial to get my full payment for the upgrade. just saying!",3
10035,I am new to this.but I did received the diaper 3,5
10036,very slow to respond,2
10037,New ad experience is ridiculous. Worst than youtube. I rather get the ad in the beginning rather than during my search.. After years and buying out let go. They still don't remove old listings which take up your server space geniuses.,2
10038,reliable to get rid of stuff that you don't need anymore an on top of that you make some money.,5
10039,"Superior UI for posting used items but after days I had zero takers, even for free stuff! On CL items were gone in a few hours.",1
10040,I have recently been experiencing issues with managing posts and changing information on posts. Reporting scammers also hasn't helped much! I had so much more going on with Letgo and made so many transactions on a daily basis! Now I merely make a half dozen of sales per month. I wonder if the app has glitches that restrict our listings to be seen. I made more money when it was a local app with Letgo than it is nationwide with OfferUp. I lost so much when they dissolved the Letgo app.,1
10041,So many ads its not even funny.. .in my opinion good products sell themselves.,2
10042,Get good deals.,5
10043,When I write a rate about some one I cannot submit my rating and they will think I didn't give them 5 stars,1
10044,people don't respond,1
10045,Good app and secure,4
10046,awesome awesome awesome,5
10047,unable to promote. reached out to support but still havent heard back.,1
10048,You get ad notifications constantly when you turn on notification. When you turn off notifications you don't know when anyone messages you. This app used to be a good place go sell stuff. It is terrible now. Go use FB marketplace.,1
10049,Good,4
10050,Used to be a great app until they added the invasion of pop-up adds and try to get you to pay for premium. Definitely not using as often. Will turn to FB marketplace more.,3
10051,Connected met sold my product.,5
10052,Mostly scams and to many ads.,1
10053,"Pickup filter is useless, nothing locally",2
10054,This is a very good place to put your stuff up for sale.,5
10055,Best app for selling stuff locally. Good use of notifications.,5
10056,"This is the worst app for selling, letgo was way better.",1
10057,"Simply the worst. This app has gone from bad to horrible. I wish they had never acquired Letgo; now, that was a great selling app. OfferUp is simply trash, and their customer service...oof, pure garbage. Do not download this app, at all!",1
10058,"Very laggy, even after buying a super fast 2023 current phone. OfferUp told me, ""It's your old phone, not our website"" Yeah.... riiiiight.",3
10059,Update killed app now has too much ads,2
10060,Crashes randomly and the update includes full-screen unskippable ads.,2
10061,to many ads and bs,1
10062,to many old posts,2
10063,Very quick and easy to post an ad.,5
10064,"I never get a response back from anyone. Also, not to mention all the adds they have now. I also find out my account is disabled after reporting someone for never meeting up. Offer up has become garbage.",1
10065,"Rip off. Used let's go for many purchases. Was a great app. Bought out by offer up, sucks completely. No longer local, which was the whole point. But tried buying 4 things anyways. 3 rejected, 1 stole my money. Ebay and other sites are dependable, never had a problem there. I'll never use the site again. A den of thieves.",1
10066,"App is great. It used to be easier to navigate, not sure what changed.",3
10067,easy and helpful,5
10068,"This app is garbage. I downloaded it specifically to sell a television and a PlayStation but was never actually able to post the items. The post would be up for a few seconds but would then be removed without any explanation. It was a simple posed with a picture of the items, nothing illegal, nothing lascivious, nothing inappropriate. I tried multiple times and always followed their rules, but it never worked .Just a glitchy, useless app.",1
10069,Such a POS app on Android tbh. Absolutely useless and so slow that you literally can't do Anything on the app. Dev team are a bunch of losers,1
10070,I miss letgo,1
10071,UPDATE - YOU HAVE KILLED THE APP FOR ME. THE SLOW LAG TIME WAS BAD ENOUGH. BUT NOW YOU COVER THE SCREEN WITH ADS AND SAVE THIS SEARCH AND FIND A JOB THAT I CAN ONLY VIEW A SMALL AMOUNT OF ONE ROW OF POSTS. NOT EVEN A FULL IMAGE. THIS APP HAS BEEN RUN LIKE THIS COUNTRY. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO RUN IT INTO THE GROUND AND DESTROY IT WHILE TELLING US ITS BETTER. NOT LEAVING MY HOMELAND JUST YET BUT ADIOS TO OFFER UP.,1
10072,"The app used to be good. Now it's slow, and the ads are everywhere.",3
10073,I need my money back,1
10074,Was good but now it has to many ads and it charges you to sell vehicles. Will be going back to craigslist.,2
10075,"In the app, why don't you guys show the prices on the item's window before clicking on them?",2
10076,"ads, ads, and more ads makes finding real sellers challenging. also, navigating app sucks",3
10077,App used to be great. Ads are annoying and whatever updates they are doing are making it super slow and its driving this app into the ground. Scammers are also rampant now on here.,2
10078,"Out of date non working posts mostly. Tons of cross links to other platforms like eBay and Amazon and mercari etc. Littered with fraudulent vehicle ads! Worse than Craig's list for fraudulent ads. No one policing the site, ads never expire so 3/4 of the whole site is non working or forgotten ads",1
10079,needs to be a deadline to remove dead old ads some are 2-3years old no one even responds. Craigslist deletes after a certain period if not renewed.. need more attention when user reports scammer many just stay on site going on to scam people even after reporting them .no response most of time from offer up. I myself had scammer using my pics and acting like it was their item for sale turns out it is a local PAWN shop doing this.,2
10080,Can't search for recliner,1
10081,"The app seems good, but the amount of stores posting here is insane. You can't block seller from showing their post. It feels like all I get is ads.",2
10082,"got scammed, offerup Saif they would give money back in 2 days, then 5 days, 8 days later I'm still waiting",1
10083,"This app is busted. I clicked on it and the whole app is blank. Literally. I have a message that i can't access to. I tried to uninstall and reopen it, issue is still the same.",1
10084,Great,5
10085,worse ever u will not last,1
10086,this app used to be a magnific app a wonderful but üò¢ not anymore is really complicated!! so sadnesses something so good is not anymore.,1
10087,actual individuals are overwhelmed by commercial ads. I could not even find the ad I placed. very few inquiries even after major price drops.,2
10088,"This App and company are junk and needs to be shut down. They want too much personal information, its uncomfortable. Hopefully they are being investigated.",1
10089,"Still after many updates. The listings do not show a price until you click on the item. FB marketplace, Mercari, CL and every other local selling app does. Update: My original review was from 2/2021. It's now 2023 and there's still no price unless you click on the listing. In addition... As a seller you can't search for the item(s) listed to update. This can be a pain if you have a ton of items listed. OfferUp is still primarily mobile dependent with no updates over the years.",1
10090,sold my diner table real quick,5
10091,"Such a waste of time! Many won't answer your requests and the app is flooded with ads. What is the use of ""premium"" paid services? I got it assuming it would help with responding and no. Just got rid of ads which guess was okay but that all. No idea what a badge is doing cause no one cares. Mailing stuff they take a 12.9% cut along with fee and another payout fee. Guess it could be good but nothing but air all day and night.",1
10092,"Downhill since ads came into play I use this app a lot, I like to look through local listings wherever I go and have made several purchases of great items. BUT ever since ""for you"" separation happened it has changed a lot of how the back end works and I miss a lot of things now that aren't ""me"". I have to go to specific categories or exact match the name of what I'm looking for. I've learned to ignore ad post but now after a message or item view there's an ad. And now random music plays w/o ad",1
10093,Listings still only utilizes 40% of the screen,1
10094,"So far it's working good. I like it. Technically no problems. Functionally, it's very good. I give this one a 5 star when compared to other apps.",4
10095,Don't go on here they are a bogus merch sales place that kept disabling my account for no reason I never sold anything there I never was disrespectful to anyone I'm always polite and kind I never use profanity the only thing I did was ask people to pay their asking price within a weeks time that's it literally. I even verified my identity üÜî and whatever else they've asked this is a very bad place to buy and sell.,1
10096,Buy and sell,4
10097,good,5
10098,They ruined this app.,1
10099,great way to make side money,5
10100,It's improved,5
10101,nothing change,2
10102,wery slow,3
10103,Going to uninstall. Your app is slow and the annoying to navigate. Now with the pop up ads that is the last straw.,1
10104,best app out!,5
10105,"Used to be good, the ads are too intrusive now and the layout is bad.",1
10106,Putting together buyers and sellers is a nice idea...and the rating aspect is nice too..however the app has alot of failings.. Needs some work Functions of the app do not work.. Dated 7/62023 ...their response was for me to bother myself to fix their problems..that was two years ago...app is still crapp... A- you set search to pickup..and they still give you advertising for delivery B- you can't simply delete a posting C- why should I bother myself with more of it's flaws.....,1
10107,awesome deals,4
10108,Good,5
10109,They just introduced unskippable ads,1
10110,App does not open I have tried all week.,1
10111,Can't filter search results anymore. That's the most basic search function. Every time I use the app they make it worse.,1
10112,Gives you ads that are unable to close out and open tabs in your brower.,1
10113,Super bad customer service,1
10114,really good app,5
10115,"There is little to no way to contact them or cancel a subscription. If you want proof google contact offer up and go on their website, you'll notice where it says contact us they simply have links to guides on how to. Oh yeah follow those directions and get basically to where you started in their app üòÖ what a horrendous time I've had, I still don't know if I'll be able to opt out. I'll likely take legal action and report this to the better business bureau.",1
10116,"Service is great, app and website are awful. Loading times and response times are dreadful. App is horribly unresponsive and crashes frequently. Archive system is lame, just let us delete posts. The app bogs down phone processors unnecessarily as well. Needs a lot of work and tidying up.",2
10117,nice,5
10118,"There are way too many old posts on offerup. They need to remove and clear all posting that are one year and more. I don't think those items are for sale anymore. Also, they should charge dealers and car Auctions for over posting the same car.",1
10119,"They track ur ip , and deactivate 5star accouns, years old accouns with hundreds of followers- any account without explanation. BIGGEST BULLY ON PLAY STORE! THEY LOOSING TO FB AND MAD - DEACTIVATE BULLY! AND DATA TRACKER !! Take them to court! Make them pay and compensate! For discrimination of small businesses!! Deactivate BULLY!!! ip tracker!",1
10120,Tells me my address cannot be found. Tried a po box which seemed to work and now it won't scan my card.,1
10121,"I can't really rate the sellers anymore since it doesn't show the rate bar in the end. I can't click on it anymore. Plus the advertising is annoying, and sometimes the app makes a buzzing sound.",3
10122,"App updated to New lock out system of charging for listings, tried to edit a 6 months old listing price, they thought I was probably trying to bypass the category listing, banned me, deleted my account, 2 months later of reporting the glitch I get the exact same generic answer from their outmated and useless customer support. Do not ever give offerup ANY valuable information, no banks, no ID nothing, there's not a single way to actually contact them if an eventuality happens, 0 customers suppor",1
10123,I Like OfferUp,5
10124,most easy app to sell and b safe and reliable,4
10125,Never sold anything.,1
10126,works well. I feel safe using it.,5
10127,"This app use to be a 5 star rating, now unfortunately, its only a 3 star, if that. Ever since this latest update with the new format/layout and partnered with LetGo, and added ads, this app has been so slow. It literally takes a minute to load any next page you decide to click on next. I might actually stop using this app. Hope it improves.",3
10128,Awsome,5
10129,"Ads definitely gotta go, adding video ads that you gotta wait to skip is definitely ruining this app. On top of that looking for an item while there's a bunch of ads gets in the way",1
10130,great place,5
10131,ABSOLUTE TRASH lately. Takes forever to load the search screen and now *full screen* unskippable adds? Back to fb marketplace and Craigslist. Way to ruin your own product. All downhill from when they bought the much worse letgo.,1
10132,F useless trash,1
10133,This app is a piece of junk!!!! Go to Facebook Marketplace!!!!,1
10134,letgo was better.,1
10135,It's really sad that what was at one time a great go to app has become overrun with ads why is it the people that create such a great app like this one a so many others feel the need to ruin them with ads stop being money hungry.,1

10140,"This is the absolute worst app, nothing but lags and has too many bugs to count. I absolutely hate it, definitely uninstalling and never using again.",1

10144,This app needs an update very glitchy,2
10145,Thank you!! Tires and rims worked out perfect!,5
10146,"Slow as molasses. Takes so long to list, load and edit items. It used to be decent but like everything else it gets worse with every change they make. Idiots...",1
10147,In an effort to charge for an app you might want to make sure it works. It won't load and show me anything anymore because it can't load an ad. Guess I'll go back to craigslist and ebay.,1
10148,"Waste of effort. I downloaded the app to sell a used car. They removed my post because it some how violated guidlines. Later the same day, my profile was suspended due to violations of those guilines. After reviewing their guilines and comparing them against my post, i found no violations. I dispute their action, and they informed me nothing can be done - nor can i make a new acct They do not care about their users. They do not solve problems. They just want subscriptions. Dont waste your time.",1
10149,Doesn't send messages when you get replies. Constantly sends you offers to pay to get 2x faster sales and tells you its a message. And then there's the constant related products message. I haven't searched for boat products but apparently I'm too stupid to know that. I guess I need boat products that I don't need because it repeatedly sends me boat related item. It's like Google giving you the exact three useless web results over and over and over. The internet and some apps used to be useful.,1
10150,They really need to have a feature like Facebook Marketplace where you can refresh your listings that they haven't sold in a specified period of time. Way too many posts that are 1to 2 years old. Way too many messages about stuff that you're searching on that have no new listings and ultimately waste your time.,1
10151,It's a great app to get rid of stuff and make some extra cash,5
10152,People flake to much. No call no show. Offer Up staff is awesome üëç.,5
10153,"Unfortunately, I got permanently banned from OfferUp again! They keep flagging all my accounts, and they won't allow me to post anything on OfferUp! If I do, it gets no views and no sales at all on OfferUp! It's completely terrible, and it's really awful!",1

10158,"I LOVE this app with the exception of TRYING TO CHANGE YOUR ADDRESS !!! It is extremely difficult to do. The only time you get to change it, is when you place an order. I do a lot of local shopping, so when I see something to buy that is out of the local area, I forget to change the old address. Then I have to message the buyer right away with my current mailing address. Otherwise, I am pretty happy with the app.",4
10159,Easy access,5
10160,"Scam app, can't even cancel subscription",1
10161,Works good most of the time but they won't let me post my motorcycle for sale. I've tried 3 times today but each time they delete it and try to say it's prohibited which is just ridiculous. I responded to support but no answer... I feel like it's some type of automated thing that keeps deleting it but who knows when you can't get a proper response from support. Overall still a decent app but I'm not a fan of the pop up ads that take over the screen.,4
10162,wish they had a 1800 number for info,5
10163,july 2023 update: this app will not work on any of my mobile devices now. Trash. So far I've made one purchase which was possible only after ignoring the pop-up warnings and giving the seller my phone number to communicate via SMS(text mssg.) But in the end the overall experience was satisfactory. I felt I got a good price for what I bought. Only complaint is all the non English posts that you have to click on the picture to find out. There should be a way to filter language preferences.,1
10164,I was loving this app up until recently. App freezes up after I respond to a message. Won't let me do anything except post a new listing. I've had to reinstall twice in the past week.,2
10165,The last purchase was so good love it!,5

10169,"Now with Full Screen ads! It's one thing the see ads in my listings, which I'm fine with and the eBay ads are actually helpful. But OfferUp is now pushing full screen ads as if it were some kind of bottom of the barrel game to try to get me to install a sketchy poker app? Say it ain't so?",1
10170,Unfortunately things are getting really sketchy with this app. A lot of scammers so be really careful and do everything thru the app.,2
10171,Just unonsyalled sorry but I do not need to ask something of convenience coupling from what I'm doing when I'm busy!% used to be better. too many ads. Intimidate dealers you can't find any personal people selling. Good riddance,1
10172,"Payment was accepted, but seller didn't send. I got a refund, but the item stayed listed. It's dead here. And there's ads, so they're incentivized to keep the dead listings up.",1

10181,"Worst app ever, I deleted it already.",1
10182,it is extremely good,5
10183,It's a joke now. I recieve views on my items to sell but unlike how I used to sell my furniture over the last two years it seems like no one can view my items anymore. Now if I really want to have people view my items for sale I have to pay now? Plus the app is now lagging? Idk what happened but I miss the old version.,1
10184,"great experience, love the ratings options for both purchasing and sellers. It gives a sense of safety within the app and community.",5

10197,I requested a refund on this app. They refuse to refund me when I didn't mean to purchase it in the first place. It a scam app the it's nothing but scammer on this app. I wouldn't recommend it for noone.,1
10198,"Google play wanted me to edit my original review, so here is my update. *Trash app! Soon to be bloatware on all android devices with all permissions mandatory. Offerup everyone! Whether you like it or not!",1
10199,these adds be old as hell,2
10200,The settings don't have a notification category so I can't shut you up! That only leaves me with a choice to block all notifications,1
10201,my only issue with the app is that ay times it loads beyond super slow & when im out of my WIFI range it sometimes doesnt let me see my msgs,4
10202,I don't want to select an item to see the price,2
10203,"Ok app, but could be great and completely replace Facebook Marketplace if OfferUp got rid of some of the scam/spam accounts and fixed their software so it doesn't auto-block some legit listings, block shipping when there's no legit reason to, and if the support team weren't completely useless when trying to resolve such issues, etc.",2
10204,Just is working,1
10205,"I like how it will alert me when an item that I am looking for is posted. And I can select local only, delivery only, or both. However, I had a big problem with a seller who scammed me and could I not get any customer service help. Nor was I able to leave a review for the seller to alert others to beware. There is a way set up to do it, but I could never get it to work.üò† And there is a feature that you can save posts to your favorites, but I can never find the favorites list to review my saves",2
10206,"Trying to unsubscribe from email blasts and you get ""Sorry, this page does not exist"" pretty convenient for you. . .",1
10207,No one responds or answers you back,1
10208,App sucks you need to purchase a promote plus now for your stuff to even get seenüëéüèæüñïüèæ,1
10209,"The developers really need to sit down and read these reviews, this app is completely useless, has been useless for quite some time now, and each update makes it even more useless, unfortunately there's not many other apps to buy local but this one sucks big time",1
10210,I am being mistreated and treated unjust! I am trying to use offerup but they supposedly banned my number and all my information. this is so unfair. CUSTOMER SERVICE WON'T EVEN REPLY BACK TO MY EMAILS WITH THIS ISSUE. IF SOMEONE DOESNT LIKE YOUR PRICES ON ITEMS YOU HAVE LISTED THEY CAN REPORT YOU AND YOUR AUTOMATICALLY BANNED,1
10211,Sad....app was working perfect. IF ITS NOT BROKE...DONT TRY TO FIX IT....THE UPDATES ARE KILLING YOUR BUSINESS AND APP. CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY!!!!!! Then with this so called new improvements update. YOU CANT DO ANYTHING AT ALL..THE APP IS POINT BLANK USELESS RIGHT NOW...I know there trying to fix it....But jeez how many weeks will it take to use the app again? Not very happy. Put a huge disconnect on buying and selling items..I'm trying to hang in there. But it has been a long wait for a fix!!,2
10212,good. not restrictive so far,5
10213,Now they have ads,2
10214,"Do not use this app to sell, no one buy just low ballers.",1
10215,A lot of people that just waste your time,4
10216,"I think I am finally fed up with this app and will be deleting my account as soon as I can find how to do it, I advise anyone do not waste your time, I can't even read my messages in my inbox or even see any items for sale, however I am able to post things to sell but can't respond since I don't access to my inbox So don't reply to this review asking me to email everything I just said, because I am done with this garbage app",1
10217,The app has some issue I must install it every time because it appears empty every time I open.,1
10218,I execute a sussessful sale only about 20% of the time. pretty much a waste of time.,1
10219,Let go was way better before the merger. I never make any sales on this app anymore. The filters dont work as far as shipping vs local and its littered with irrelevant ads and scam posts. It sucks the superior app just became part of the slogan for this inferior garbage.,1
10220,"Great til the inescapable ads showed up while browsing. I've had full-screen, seemingly inescapable ads appear while browsing listings. I'll hit my ""back"" button when done reading a listing and an ad for premium shows up that I can't get out of. It's really annoying, and gives me the vibe of ""these inconveniences we've introduced could be removed by paying us"", and I don't like it. So I'm deleting this app. Will bounce to fb marketplace and ebay/ mercari.",2
10221,so far so good. I received an offer within five minutes of my post. Incredible !,5
10222,"Very nice guy. On time, and the item is in perfect condition.",5
10223,It seems to work well if only people would delete posts when the items are sold.,5
10224,"I wish I could post a picture. It's impossible to use the app. You literally can't see anything that's being sold. All you can see are OfferUp's ""new jobs"", ""save your search"", and ads. Only a small space to see 3 listings at a time. It's so ridiculous.",1
10225,Awesome,4
10226,good selling platform,5
10227,"There is a local retail store that spams the app with hundreds or thousands of posts in certain categories (electronics). Makes it impossible to find any actual ""used"" items being sold by normal people because the list is completely polluted by this business. This feels extremely abusive by them. Please let us block /filter out certain sellers in our searches.",2
10228,I need to cancel my subscription and it makes it difficult to do so.,2
10229,"Created an account, verified and everything. 0 views after multiple days. Seems like only premium accounts work.",1
10230,"Never did well on this app. Received more scam messages, more than messages from actual buyers. Also, the pictures aren't that appealing to the buyers for anyone to be interested in a purchase. I browse but left disappointed at the effortless work the others put into their post. Instant deletion of my account, can't put up with this no longer. A waste of my phone usage and time.",1
10231,"This has to be the slowest app I've ever used! I have to hit each button two or three times to make them work and go to the next page. It makes me hate listing new items and makes editing my older listings a huge pain. I can't even see the prices I am selling my items for unless I click on the listing and wait for the page to load. Even then, there is no quick way to drop the prices. The only good things about the app are the relatively low shipping costs for items and they're free to list.",2
10232,Good app sold and bought from this app with great results,4
10233,people inquiry 90% low ball your price and they never show up or follow thru,1
10234,Excellent transaction! Seller was friendly and answered questions quickly! Highly recommend!,5
10235,let go was a lot better than this app,2
10236,This app is garbage now. Can't click on anything without an ad popping up. I say we delete the app until they get rid of the stupid ads. Has more ads than P**NHub. Unreal.,1
10237,"I absolutely hate this app, it is full of fake sellers and scammers!!!",1
10238,why start with the ads. do you want people to buy and sell on your platform or not? Just silly. I may go back to craigslist,1
10239,Too many intrusive ads. When I backed out of a listening it automatically started and unskippable phone game ad. Instantly turned off. So I decided to delete the app.,1
10240,"Terrible App, if somebody knows about other app to sell item, please left the link üîó here. Really bad experience.üò°ü§¨",1
10241,"App works well, no issues, minimal ads",4
10242,Too many sellers that don't reply with things still listed that they sold years ago and too many idiots from the streets with no money that either send low ball offers and waste everyone's time. I think I'm going to stick with eBay from now on.,1
10243,"There's a lot of postings and offerings... BUT... The ads have gotten out of control. Ads pop up in between things when you don't except it so you accidentally click on them. Also, promoted postings from outside of your area will show up in your search results even when you use the zip code filter.",2
10244,one of my favorite apps have met nothing but honest good people,5
10245,decent marketplace but lack of notification control is annoying,3
10246,"This app was great. Was. I updated to add another card, a process that apparently shares private information with a third party for advertising purposes. Instant regret. New version has many more ads and is nearly impossible to navigate with the crashes and freezing. It's constantly trying to load video ads, so it also uses more data...which makes it nearly impossible to use in a location with poor service. I wish I could go back. This is terrible.",2
10247,"I understand the need for ad revenue, but recently I've been getting full-screen ads that can't be closed or skipped. That level of attention-demanding is completely unacceptable. I won't be using OfferUp anymore üëé",1
10248,It's super laggy. It worked much better before it was acquired by letgo. It constantly freezes up.,1
10249,great people on here,4
10250,fairly easy to use,5
10251,I can no longer see anything in offerup. What happened?,1
10252,easy to use. fast results,5
10253,Terrible. I used to love offer up and it was my go to app for buying and selling! Now it's just trash. If you don't buy the premium your messages and posts go unseen by others.,1
10254,very friendly....and was on time ....Items were in amazing condition,5
10255,"easy, efficient site to sell and buy items",5
10256,Worst app ever after merging with letgo. I'm looking for used items...nor brand new.,1
10257,Its a good App to make money. Its better than garage selling.,5
10258,Non-fuctional,1
10259,app works when it wants too. and while I can view ads on my pc. I can not post for sale ads from my pc. mobile app based only. we need PC access.,2
10260,"Horrible. Ads everywhere, have to make an account just to browse. Also refuses to work unless you grant them your location data at all times. Really wish Craigslist would make a comeback, this sucks",1
10261,These ad's are killing this app I'm about to delete it and just stick with facebook market place which doesn't use ads!,1
10262,Way to many ad's way too Many !,2
10263,I had a very good experience with an offer up transaction the young man sold me a very good double bass pedal for a reasonable price .thanks to everyone involved,5
10264,freeze alot app is suck,1
10265,"They've ruined it with advertisers, car dealers, & scammers = worse then Craigslist now!",1
10266,Unban my account I did nothing wrong please. I had 115 reviews and you guys deleted me for no apparent reason,1
10267,obsolete ‚ÄºÔ∏è,1
10268,"Few minutes of searching and then a ad that takes the WHOLE screen up and hides the x to exit. I will not be forced to click ads so I have to close the app and restart over again. Aggravated this is now the experience I have to deal with. Ads locked under the search bar, ads in the search field and now whole screen ads.",2
10269,Cancel premium subscription,1
10270,"The Best Selling/Buying App there is!! Period!! To have the ability to buy things you want or need at the best price anywhere or, the ability to sell something that belongs to you that you don't necessarily want or need for a good, decent, and reasonable price. All other buy/sell apps are bootleg, wannabe, trash compared to OfferUp.",5
10271,Ads! Seriously! I'll wait until the interrupting ads go away and then I'll come back.,1
10272,I've been using offer up for many years now and have scored on a good number of items. It's pretty much my go to app for both selling and buying.,4
10273,it used to be a very good application but now it is garbage,1
10274,way to many pop up adds,2
10275,"This app is so slow from the start and the lastest recent update make it completely useless. Can't even see my posting, home screen just blank, inbox is blank, everything is blank but for to posting tab.",1
10276,I tried to do a free trial for the promotion plus and you guys still charged me 20$.,1
10277,my post never show up. i posted an item two weeks agoand it jas been seen 14 times. yea ok but that was me looking for it NOT potential buyets.,1
10278,"The app itself is very slow. When I want to edit a listing it makes me go through each step before I can save it. And I don't get most of my notifications when I get a message. Which has cost me sales. I've cleared my cache, kept the app updated and made sure my notification settings were set. So the app has some improvements to make.",2
10279,"People this is not a shop. Just sell and be gone, not top dollar.",2
10280,Terrible customer service... use Facebook marketplace way better!,1
10281,this is a great app I bought cars and I sold cars here as well as other items very good communication and very accurate location's.,4
10282,Notable able to turn off specific notifications,2
10283,"Slow, mostly unresponsive. Notifications are spotty, at best.",1
10284,The adds are way too intrusive. You're thinking a bit too much about yourself... dial down before is too late.,1
10285,"Wow, this app went downhill fast. Forcing loud ads like a free game made this an easy uninstall.",1
10286,"They deserve ZERO stars if it were possible. Extremely dishonest cowardly cockroaches run this buggy low class app. They will randomly block you with NO reason whatsoever and hide when you question them. I had a perfect 5 star rating, tons of followers and obeyed all posting rules. I logged in one day and they deleted my entire store AND blocked my account completely. STAY AWAY.",1
10287,"Great platform, still ads are okay but video ads are annoying",4
10288,Easy to use,5
10289,very accommodating fella. would most definitely recommend.,5
10290,"Garbage app, used to be good but now it's all irrelevant ads. Don't waste your time.",1
10291,letgo was a better setup,2
10292,"very nice man who went out of his way to help me out. Not many will do that, so he gets gets (5) at a boy's (man)! Really was or is a nice man.",5
10293,Fullscreen ads are bad. Harder to find liked items/boards. Dark mode is a weird blueish tone instead of black/grey. Ads still stay active after years. Implementing a system where habitual non-responders get ads disabled would work great. Advanced searching is difficult and clunky. Lots of fake ($1 $2 etc) priced items don't get removed.,2
10294,can't separate business and personal stuff. some things are still for sale from a year ago,2
10295,my stuff sells fast,5
10296,I am very upset. somehow I was automatically put in for some kind of promo boost and was charged 21 dollars that I did not want to do. still haven't heard anything when I emailed them...,1
10297,ever since let-go and OfferUp combined I never get notified when I get a message I have to actually open the app then I get them,1
10298,too slow,4
10299,Wayyyyy too many scammers,1
10300,I didn't sell anything. The only messages I got were from pervy dudes. Not a great app for selling things. Seems way better as a dating site for weirdos.,1
10301,Wasn't impressed. Too many businesses mixed in with individual items.,3
10302,Updated my app and now the entire a blank I see the home icon I see the messages icon to other icons and that's it nothing open awesome thank you,1
10303,suggestions are so far off base it's ridiculous,1
10304,"AM UNABLE TO RATE PEOPLE IVE PURCHASED FROM, APP DOESNT ALLOW ME TO SUBMIT. FIX THIS!!",1
10305,"Never gives options on what you search for. Too many out of area options, or online ads, and now after looking at a few posts you get hit with pop up ads videos?? Lmfao that's why this app has plummeted. Can't wait until it shuts down",1
10306,So I know it's not only me because other people in my social circle has reported the same thing before a certain time any post wether it be Jordans or something random. In atleast 2 days there would be. Minimum 50 views. Now I could post Jordan supreme 5s and 4 days later 0 views ? My other ad says it's being looked at nation wide 0 views. So offerup it's pay to get your listings views AT ALL now I see I bet I'm not the only one that notice this tell me I'm wrong I'll wait,1
10307,"I've had a very good experience with offer up; I've sold alot of items with success the only down side is if you no longer want to sell something you can't delete your item you can only archive it. When you archive it, it doesn't delete your messages with those people as well. Those individuals are still able to contact you RE the archived item which is so frustrating.",4
10308,best app,5
10309,I like the map it's really good people need to Stop putting junkers and asking top $$Dollars.,5
10310,great app,5
10311,"Update. The app has become even more annoying three years later. Went from 2 stars to one. The full screen apps are unimaginably annoying. Two HUGE issues with the user interface. 1. Price of an item is the most important information in trading, which is not shown when items are listed. 2. Categories are limited and searching/filtering the results is hopeless. Developers should learn from kijiji!",1
10312,Offer up sucks now. They make it so you have to pay to promote your items otherwise you don't get any views. Used to be better a couple years back. I barely even go in here to look at anything anymore honestly.,1
10313,What's with the random game popups?,1
10314,Half üåü if I could. Runs very slow. Ads everywhere trying to frustrate you into paying for premium. Lots of scams and junk listing. Avoid like the plague.,1
10315,great finds,5
10316,The excessive ads ruided it. I'm going back to craigslist,1
10317,Lot of adds,1
10318,"It has a decent amount of posts, but now they're charging for more than a certain amount of posts in a category, I just recently went to post a motorcycle for sale, u get one post per month in that category and then u have to pay. Didn't think it could get worse, then they force ads on you now, fantastic",1
10319,so easy to post,5
10320,Great app.,5
10321,Please make setting my location manually an option... I'd rather not disable my VPN settings,4
10322,"LET ME SPECIFY ""NO CATAGORY"" Update: can't post anything. Haven't been able to post anything for weeks. It's keeps erroring about the photos. I've tried different photos, different devices. Uninstall and reinstall. Nothing works",1
10323,Super Slow!!! The app tends to lag a hell of a lot. Its annoying especially if you uninstall the app and reinstall it many times just to get it to work right.,1
10324,"This was a great app to buy/sell but know with the Ads it's starting to be be annoying, and the algorithm doesn't for a search won't reset.. if u looked up an electronic it will only show u electronic to whole time.. I used to like to just see all the things ppl sold..",2
10325,"Bought and sold a lot, but high number of scammers reach out everytime I post. Reporting them doesn't seem to help. Also not always getting notified when someone responds, and suspect the same happens when I reach out to a seller, as many times they don't respond. Otherwise, it is what it is and I've gotten great deals.",3
10326,They added pop up ads and it's super annoying,1
10327,Video ads now? I'm fine with ads mixed in with the listings but now video ads. It's a bit much and makes me not want to use the app.,2
10328,Good response. Sellers need more pics and info.,4
10329,"Super sketchy, customer support non-existent. Despite touting their ""buyer protection,"" they have removed the option to file a claim through the site or app. The automated email links to a missing page and they closed my ticket without ever responding when I pointed out the broken link. Contacting customer support is almost impossible.",1
10330,too many fake add,1
10331,"Used to be free. Now $19.99/month to sell?! I'm sorry I'll sell things the old fashioned way. I used the free 3 day trial to ""promote"" my listing and I see zero value in paying a minimum of $20/month + paying even more if I'd like OfferUp to ""make my item stand out even more"". What kind of bribe nonsensical extortion crud is this? If I'm going to use a questionable app to advertise my own stuff for a monthly fee, I'll advertise my items MYSELF, FOR FREE. SORRY, NOT SORRY",2
10332,Great,5
10333,amazing,5
10334,Good,5
10335,easy to navigate and easy to contact the individuals for item wanted.,5
10336,Sold out garbage. Bye Felicia. Thanks.,1
10337,"Paid promo is straight up theft. Tried posting TWICE and the listing dissappeared along with the money I paid to promote the listing. Contacted support and was never contacted again by them 0/10, do not recommend.",1
10338,Nice app,5
10339,Pop ads out of nowhere sal of the sudden. Absolute trash user experience.,1
10340,"I have started using it today. Hopefully, I'll be able to sell a few things and buy some at good prices ü§û",4
10341,cop shop,4
10342,Much safer when it comes to spamming. Authentic.,5
10343,Trying to charge you now to post certain items like cell phones. They will try to respond with the most BS excuse on why they charge but no one is going to care. It's bull.,1
10344,the ads suck,2
10345,very good app for buying or selling.,5
10346,They just added FULL SCREEN ADS,1
10347,Nice cards and quick shipper!! Would definitely purchase from this seller again!!,5
10348,"Frustrating, slow and it kicks me out",1
10349,ADs pop up and can't be closed forcing you to spam!,1
10350,Flawless sales transaction and great person to conduct business with.,5
10351,app takes for ever. quite the delay,3
10352,"too many commercials add, no good, we need a option by owner , thank you",1
10353,bought a gently used baby walker.very cute,5
10354,"It's nice that it's pretty popular, but it's pretty slow and buggy",3
10355,Its Good I like the new i.d system but lessings the super deals to be found.,4
10356,Meh,2
10357,Terrible service. Purchased 3 items for the listed asking price and none of the sellers ever shipped the item. It then took numerous emails to get the transaction credited back to me. Sticking with Facebook marketplace.,1
10358,"I've met some real down to earth people on the OfferUp app. there's so many options to look from shoes, clothes, appliances etc.",5
10359,"Great app, deserves 5 stars in my opinion, but minus 2 stars since their in no link to unsubscribe from the numerous emails being sent to me! I turned off the unimportant app notifications (in app settings) but when I go to change email preferences it says that the link ""does not exist"" or even some emails just simply lack a link on the ""unsubscribe"" text.... It's ridiculous. I could easily switch to another selling app as my primary app if this isn't resolved.",3
10360,Awesome experience!,5
10361,it's a good but sometimes it's hard to enlarge the pictures,5
10362,"My account never worked, I downloaded the app made an account and my posts aren't visible to other accounts and other accounts are not reseving my messages.",1
10363,"I have been a long time seller even before the merger. I refuse to use this app as it's not user friendly, seller friendly and the overall experience is just awful in comparison to their competitors. Shake my head guys be better.",1
10364,This use to be a great app to use but lately quality in the app has decline. I had two separate post removed and was never Explain as to why they were removed. On ad was for a simple car part and the other was for a car. They proceed to take my add down and close my account with no explanation. Don't bother with this app plus lost of the people on here are spam now. You are better off using Craigslist or Facebook. Customer support is terrible and everything is done with a computer and not human,1
10365,Awesome App,5
10366,This app went from scamming. Now to a dead zone. The curse of Craigslist/ eBay. Even They. Are doing bad. T$OFjD,3
10367,Okay the reason why I gave it a 3 tOfferUp you need to get your thing together because if you're not going to check people who are scammers it's not fair because I already got scam I sell my own stuff on there as well but I'm not I'm smart enough to not know not to scam somebody cuz I know it's not fair to them and I know it's not fair to me so my point is get your thing up because it's not fair to people who are getting scammed especially me and I'm super super pissed off because it's not fair,2
10368,"Not even one star!!! This app use to be awesome, it is the worst app I have ever used now you can't get into your messages half the time it tells you that you don't have any more impact you do this app is completely useless now! This has to be the wors app I have ever used hands down. And no one is even attempting to fix the issue!!!! The 4.4 star rating is a total lie. Literally every single person that was in a review horrible review how the hell could it be 4 half Stars",1
10369,Love it!! Great finds! !,5
10370,This is a scam by the end of a trial the make it very difficult to cancel and Google is making it very difficult. I did not receive one single offer. Don't try this app is scam. I received my credit card bill and I am charged 99.99 despite having cancelled,1
10371,"I love this app, BUT. I would give 5 stars but I don't understand why offerup can't set time limits. If no action in 45 day that account should be deleted. Letgo did it, and now offerup owns letgo. I'm tried of seeing post that are 1, 2 & 3 years old. OfferUp is now a 1 star. 06/29/23 Now I have to watch commercials. Even after I give them 12.9% of every sale I ship. If we ship though OfferUp, we should get premium access for free.",1
10372,Blocks you from using the app if you're on a VPN. Constantly tried to shove notifications on you for things you're not looking for without any option to turn it off.,1
10373,I love offer. they sell everything for me,4
10374,"With their new ad system OfferUp is now going down, Facebook market is way better , can't even list cars now without having to pay. Developers must be hungry for money",1
10375,Ad sax,2
10376,"I never get anyone to respond to when they have a post for their items. I don't know what the situation is but, I've have answered for pickup trucks. I've answered for diving board. I've answered for tennis shoes that people have posted but nobody ever responds. I've asked for now exterior doors in Rialto for $40, no one ever responds.",1
10377,The worst app ever. Blocks account for no reason with no explanation and no way to unblock. Created another account with a different email address - posted items were not visible to the public.,1
10378,I am trying to sale my Xbox for 200$$,4
10379,OfferUp and Letgo combined to make an even worse product. Now with unskippable video ads that interrupt you while you browse. They also don't bother to verify their advertisers in any way so scam dropshipping sites are the most prolific advertisers,1
10380,payment system is broken app is useless,2
10381,"works well, I'm selling and buying. Wide variety of items for sale.",4
10382,It was great until you stop protecting your sellers and only protect the buyers you can sell something in a certain way and that's when it's returned they could be returned destroyed and is perfectly fine because you don't protect thrle sellers. Crazier than this is Everytime You Look online it keeps on saying that you protect the sellers,4
10383,"My stupidity hereof course, but I've received no updates from this company after filing a police report after being scammed locally. ""Buyer"" is attempting to resell and can't get any cooperation from OfferUp to either ban this user or get my item back -_-",1

10385,"App will not let me rate my buyers. Have installed/unistalled app, login/logout and emailed support with no response or help what so ever.",2

10388,"App functions ok, but shows great deals that are 50 miles too far, even if u filter by distance. eb.ay will make u 10X more. Items sell 5 times faster, for around twice the price. Here u have to constantly relist everything, to compete with every other seller, who relists daily. Then u get tons of ppl lowballing & asking if its still available. Offerup is great for finding local deals, from ppl who aren't savvy enough to use ebay. Or selling heavy items u cant ship & avoiding eb.ay fees",4
10389,too mutch ads and laggy since last update and it would be better to show price on cover pictures to mutch time openning each post,2
10390,Omg ads now. Haha ok.,1
10391,"Absurdly slow now. And absolutely packed to the gills with ads. Nice platform for buying and selling, but atrocious experience.",1

10393,It's been super slow to load. I don't know if they don't care or they don't know how to fix the problem. I hope they fix it fast because it's getting annoying.,2
10394,U made it worse! Not sure which update u made it lag so so much. Can't even view half the searches. Please fix.,2
10395,Sensation Super Satisfying,5
10396,When I go to the site I can't even see the icon that say offer up I have restarted my phone ever time to see responding to someone that want to buy something.,1

10410,"In the listing most of items have just a picture, no price To find the price you have to tap on the item. That's a lot of tapping and wasted time",1
10411,It has been fun and at times exciting,5

10423,Intrusive ads. Uninstalled.,1
10424,Good,5
10425,The ads are getting out of control. I don't know that there are really many options other than OfferUp. Maybe craigslist. It sucks that OfferUp bought letgo and made it worse. It's so slow. Notifications are inconsistent. You have to click into a posting to see the price. Plus the alerts for items you can set are garbage. Didn't notify me until 2 hours after what I've been looking for for months was posted and it was already sold by then.,1
10426,I love this app thank you,5
10427,OfferUp has been a reliable way to buy and sell things I need and things I don't need anymore. I have no complaints so far.,5

10434,works well easy to post items.,5
10435,Slow slow slow,1
10436,She's amazing!,5
10437,"Sucked before, even worse now. I hated offerup before they even bought letgo and since then they have just got worse. (Edit)It has been years and they still haven't fixed a thing. In fact the app is even more broken then when I posted my 1 star review over 3 years ago. They are never going to fix this app. They are only going to continue to shove more and more paid features into their broken app. I deleted my account, uninstalled the app, and am glad to never have to deal with this scam again.",1

10439,I would use this app more I hardly ever use it because the filters don't work. I'll put my area within 30 no shipping and I go to look and I got to scroll through all this stuff from California New Mexico all kinds of places that are thousands of miles from Kentucky. Please fix your filters to where they actually work. I want to shop locally and I don't want anything shipped.,2

They want to send ""verification texts"", but in reality it's a text they request on your behalf. They get your info and leave you waiting. No sale happens anymore, no real items posted. Accounts have fake record of sales and purchases now, they are getting around the account history and verification (able to have false history).",1

I'm giving it 24 hours longer to get it right or I'm permanently deleting app.",1
10452,App has become slow and pop ups have become out of control,1

10454,works good,5

10456,"App doesn't work anymore. It just shows the menu of Home, Inbox, Post, MyListings at the top of the screen and nothing else. I'm on Android 8.",1
10457,App moves so slow. I have been using offer up for years and it was always way quicker to navigate in. It's not just my phone or my service it is slow on all my friends phones and computers too. Plz update and fix these bugs,1
10458,I can't even use the app it keeps closing every time I try to open it,1
10459,Very slow and it freezes all the time.,1

10465,They make you scan your credit card to verify it and it doesn't work well. I never had to do that when I started buy things on eBay and Amazon. You can't talk to anyone over and they take forever to email you back when you have a problem. I keep getting something went wrong error. I will probably miss out on the item I wanted,1
10466,Good app,5
10467,Terrible lag on app,1
10468,The ads made an already finicky app worse to use,2
10469,"Trash bait, it lets you fake post items and wastes your time then hides your listings until you pay them money, f off",1

10478,App closes or won't open all the darn time. It is easier to use the website .,1
10479,great app to sell and buy,5
10480,not as good as let go but every thing evolves damb,3
10481,Can't review sellers. It won't scroll to allow me to hit enter or submit.,1
10482,Awesome experience!,5
10483,"Pretty horrible now; super unresponsive, spend lots of time waiting for slow animations, to finish. messages dont show up while your IN the inbox. They prioritized puttin in Ads over making the app good. Wasuch better when it was LetGo",1
10484,Not enough control over what you see. Spends so much time trying to market to you that it lags.,2
10485,I would give this a 0/5 but I cant. I've been on offer up for about 2 years now but recently the app has gotten glitchy and unable to sell things through it. Every time I post something and get messages about it the item gets archived by itself. I go to the tab wheir my listings are and it still does not want to unarchive. I went to google to see why this happens and they claim that the reason why this happened Is because the post can contain things against the guidelines but my posts are good.,1
10486,Stop trying to cram more BS ads in,1
10487,Not user Friendly. Good luck trying to get help from them trying to contact customer support. The instructions say to do things don't match what you see on the app and online (in my experience) I'm thinking about uninstalling and not using again.,1
10488,App was fine until it started pushing full screen ads.,1
10489,Ruin by ads....,1
10490,Bought some nice items here,5

I paid on time every payment than the last one was before payday and I couldn't move it and my balance went from 400 pre approved to 50 dollars. Now u tell me what can u buy for 50 dollars and the app is slow and freezes and kicks u out smh .,1
10493,"I agree with others. App isn't what it used to be. Very slow to a point of annoyance. The ads sprinkled in the items were fine, but now, when you click on an item, a full screen ad pops up. Too many items that were posted YEARS ago. All other apps like this take the post down after several weeks. I hardly use this one anymore. Craigslist removes old posts, let's me filter search better and hides duplicates. Even FB Marketplace removes old posts!",1

10599,The ads on this got worse where they force you to watch them. The promotion ad for thier app always shows up. I can't use this app without ad after ad after ad. Than there's no price when scrooling. This app going down hill,2
10600,App always glitches or gets stuck it says try again with some code shown. Terrible never works and super slow to say try again,1
10601,"Terrible experience with customer service. Bought a video game that didn't work. Shipped it back to the seller. The seller received the game. But according to Offer up, I didn't ship it back in time. Dropped it into a blue usps box on a Saturday. A day before their deadline. Didn't ship out until Monday. I was told that even though it's not required that I should have shipped it with a USPS employee. I'm sorry, I work 7-5 Monday through Friday. Post office is open 9-5.",1
10602,A lot of flakes out there,3
10603,Solid app but local selling is trend based .,4
10604,Keeps freezing up and crashing. Not to mention the fact that you have to pay to sell things and still end up with spam accounts contacting you and still have scamers.,1
10605,fluid,5
10606,Why is this app so slow. Never used to be,1
10607,I used offerup for my business (a brick and mortar store) for 6 years. I got a new phone and setup a new account with a new email in order to let my employees handle it instead of me. They immediately banned me and won't let me setup a new account or reinstate any of my old ones. All contact is just a cut and paste form when I email and there is no way to call them. This is ridiculous that they'd ban a seller and buyer via their system that had perfect feedback and shipped items through them.,1
10608,"It lags when I start to look at almost all my post I have , sometimes it lags soo much when I try to change some details or fix some details if they can fix the lag everything will be good.",3
10609,"Have had some good look with this, but when searching for items by distance there are too many items that were listed too long ago.",1

10612,"Won't let me offer anything up? For literally no reason every item I try and sell on this platform either gets removed, or despite saying has been offered up, will not show up in my listings. I've looked at all of the policies and I am not violating a single one with any of my items. Why in the hell would I pay for a premium version of something I'm not even able to use.",1
10613,"Hard to find a local add, just use Amazon, this is all adds and shipping items now even when you select local and chose your distance, loved this app when you could find local deals, time to delete this app",1
10614,NOW IT SUCKS STOP WITH AD'S,1
10615,Great,5
10616,Use to be a good app but now it's flooded with post from professional businesses like car dealerships making it time consuming and annoying to try and find items by private sellers. Need to have separate categories for private seller and buisness seller. And stop with the constant updates that stop the app from working. Plus the app is now super slow to respond to searches and slow when clicking on an item or alerts.,3
10617,"Slow and laggy I don't know what's wrong with it but it needs to be fixed asap this app suck now ""SLOW AS HELL""",1
10618,"Keeps getting worse. Big fan of Offerup and I was willing to put up with the glitchiness and slow performance of late, these last few months...but now it's starting to show me ads that fill the screen. WOW. This will be the end of the app for me. I'm so disappointed.",2
10619,"I was hoping offerup would be a good alternative to eBay, Nope! Only use offerup to sell locally. Too many flakes, ridiculous lowballers, no buyer/seller support, etc.. Their definition of customer service is articles for you to read and thats it. If you do not read it in the article, do not expect to get an answer. HORRIBLE ! Only positive is local pickup. People flake 75% of the time so it really isnt even positive. I had 2 stars at first but i can only offer up one star. :)",1
10620,There doesn't seem to be many high-end buyers. I have a few high ticket items that no one wants.,3
10621,works half the time. its amazing I sell anything. very frustrating,2
10622,Great,5
10623,I love it,5
10624,"Tons of scammer, flakey people, thief's trying to offload their loot, rude, dishonest people. Reporting them does nothing. Wrote original review in 2020. In 2022, still the same poor app. Ridiculous. Be better. 3/2023 They added annoying full page ads. And added Jobs tabs. App is going downhill. 4/2023 Broke keyword notifications 6/2023 very slow to load",1
10625,Was just removed from the platform without any explanation. Only said I violated the terms and conditions. I most definitely did not. When I inquired asking for the specific violation I committed I received a reply with a generic explanation that Offerup reserves the right to remove anyone for any reason. Ok...F you too..meanwhile I'm still waiting to receive my money from a previous sale after the item was delivered last week. This app is going downhill fast...,1
10626,How do you get back to what you like?,2
10627,Great,5
10628,"What ever you did. I no longer get offer up. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it 5 times, and nothing",1
10629,Great app to find most of what you are looking for. Safer than most other similar sites,5
10630,very nice thank you,5
10631,"Doesn't show your listings. App is a social media scam now. Pushes ppl who ""post often"".. (???) Its terrible.",1
10632,Very good app,5
10633,great app,5
10634,very nice,5
10635,Not sure why you have to enter a credit card to set up account...dumb,1
10636,Good,5
10637,Great service but a terrible app. Seemingly infinite bugs that are extremely annoying. Things such as notifications randomly not making any sounds even though no settings have been changed and extremely delayed navigation through the app.,2
10638,The app is great for selling however you must remember ship on the first day because if you end up shipping on third day there's a good chance you're not going to get paid and you can complain all you want nobody's ever going to respond do not sell an item if you are not able to ship on the first day,5
10639,love the bargains.,5
10640,"App slows down and freezes up now that it has been changed to advertisements. If you are selling a lot of items, this app slows down even more. If people who use this app a lot speak up maybe they will do something about it!",1
10641,I'm impressed and love this app it makes it convenient for me to have a side hustle and to communicate with people with like interests,4
10642,"it's a work in progress. it's missing tons of obvious things, is inaccurate, hard to use, and on and on. However, it gets the job done and fills an empty niche.",3
10643,very good to buy things locally. haven't had any problems since I started.,5
10644,6/20/23 said free then charged $1üëé,1
10645,App sucks and they disabled my account without any explanation after only posting once,1
10646,so many real good items,5
10647,I don't think my stuff is being seen I have no views,1
10648,Love it,5
10649,"Website says you can only list items with the mobile app. Mobile app doesn't seem to accept my listings. I filled out all the listing info twice and confirmed, but my item doesn't show up in my For Sale tab.",1
10650,Offer up sucks!!! I can't let it go.,1
10651,Does show listing near you when you search which is the only reason people use this trash app,1
10652,"Garbage tier app full screen ad's and they sell your personal data. Don't expect to post anything for sale either because your post will just be auto deleted by a bot as soon as you make a new offer and there is no reason given, not by email or in app error.",1
10653,Very nice,5
10654,Terrible app. Slow. Kept deleting my listings.,1
10655,I'm ready to use a different app since you guys started these dam ads.,1
10656,Terrible,1
10657,"completely cluttered, clunky and slow...i loved it when it was letgo. The ads are horrible and shipping sucks. Make it local again, this is garbage imo. Also cant rate anyone now because after you give the star review the 'submit review' button blows off the screen and you cant advance or scroll to submit the review...dumb. Keep it simple. See ya'll on FB Marketplace",1
10658,I can never send a message it never responds to me,1
10659,when I post something it goes on so fast get hits on my item within seconds. thankful to offer up,5
10660,üëç,5
10661,"This app is HORRIBLE! Most ""sellers"" are unresponsive. This app is super slow. It constantly freezes & crashes. And the cherry on top is that there is adds in the app! You will go to message someone, & an add will pop up. This all is horrible!",1
10662,Love this app always on it üòÄ,5
10663,really difficult to get ahold of sellers sometimes. Things stay posted for yrs and sellers dont respond nor do the posts get removed when reported.,3
10664,I cannot message anyone with this app,1
10665,The app was already running slow and now with ads just terrible.,1
10666,"OfferUp tries to force you to pay to sell items on a daily basis, they force ads in your face, if someone tries to scam you or bully you, they don't do enough to protect you from others who try to scam you or bully you. people I know told me this! OfferUp needs to grow up",1
10667,paid for to have my ad promoted. another ad that I did not promote recieved more views and it was posted 15 minutes after the promoted ad.,1
10668,easy to use and I have not had a bad sale yet,5
10669,"I dot banned for no reason Just stopped working I'm going to have to find a different place to sell my stuff I'm editing my review, because this app sucks!!! Every time I use it, it's just frustrating and annoying to use I wish I could give it negative stars or even 0 start Don't bother use cregslist or Facebook marketplace",1
10670,No longer works with VPN. VPNs keeps me safe and not you. Quit selling my location data! Now deleting the app for something else.,1
10671,disabled my account without telling me exactly why!,1
10672,too many ads,3
10673,"Keep political views and ""stand with ukraine"" out of here, it has no place in a buying/selling app. Don't support anything or anyone and you won't have to worry about being like bud light or Target.",3
10674,Great tool,5

10676,excellent app,5
10677,An alo around great experience üëç,5
10678,Keeps deleting my stuff,2
10679,"Ever since they started advertising to sell you directly and now they're trying to send you to websites instead of letting you complete your transactions with another customer is now beyond annoying. Just like alot of apps, it started out great and is gradually becaming a advertising and link up disruption app. This app was designed to communicate with other customers that's why it was so cool, now with having to ""go premium"" to avoid it the designers are blowing it and ruining this app.....fast",1
10680,Ajveiz. Roomdh. Surah. Star. Cslejf. Chefuru chknovrs,4
10681,they take a large fee for selling. use craigslist for local things,3
10682,Love all the options it provides when trying to buy something,4
10683,Nobody offers up on price they offer you down ironic,2
10684,"So I punched in Eugene Oregon, within 10 miles, and I ended up getting ads from Florida and Arizona and all over the nation! What garbage .",1

10687,good deals secure nice people,5
10688,"Clunky, slow, and lots of unnecessary stuff. There is a premium version? What a joke. Great app to buy sell trade and such however it's got to go! Like booting a windows 95 computer, wake up turn it on, bathroom, coffee, cigarette come back n almost ready to use it.",1
10689,This update is horrible it takes 30 seconds after you push one button for it to register.,5
10690,The app Is slow asf,1
10691,to many different items show up in search,3
10692,Too many No show NOT verified people. Ever since the Update you Cant even see items trying to buy or Interested in. Archive areas are GONE. ADS Making the Location of my items in different areas then Where I Am Really? LOUD AF ADS SOUNDS WHEN TRYING TO GET TO AD OR MSGS LOUDER THEN MY DAMN PHONE LETS ME PLAY MUSIC OR PHONE AREA LIKE DAM SO LOUD MAKE IT STOP WE DONT NEED THAT! AND THE ADS NOT SHOWING IT JUST PLAYS LOUD AF WHILE TRYING TO LOOK! TOO MANY OLD ADS TOO JUST CLOGS THE FEED WHEN LOOK,1
10693,EXCELENT!!!!!,5
10694,The app does not show prices up front. You need to open each item to see the price. Aggressive advertising in free mode.,2
10695,Too many ad's,1
10696,"I really love this App. Yes, all reviewers complaints are justified. Iam wondering, is anyone going to fix these issues? The repetitive adds, ( so sick of TEMU) putting the price of each item on the cover pic of the actual item, etc,? So many users have the same issues. Anyone trying to fix them? I go on OFFER UP daily. These complaints are legit, but a big Thank You. To me it is worth the aggravation",5
10697,kinda clunky but pretty much to the point,3
10698,"Why must I always choose no shipping and change my distance for local pickup. Why won't it save? Is this a joke? And the adds that look like seller items when you click opens a new web link window is privacy intrusive! Please fix these issues, please.",1
10699,"App is buggy. It says there is a conversation or a reply to a posting, but when you go to Inbox or a specific listing its not there(yet the listings says there is one). Keep getting annoying ads even if i pay for promoting items. No idea why.",3
10700,They did not allow to post my new UNOPENED supplements that i bougjr and will not be able to use them. Very disappointed.,1
10701,great app,5
10702,Redoing my original review because the app has become very slow. Pages take a long time to load. Very easy to use. App is pretty straight forward. Ive sold and bough a lot of things through this app with no issues. They do a lot to ensure safety as well.,3
10703,easy too sell stuff,5
10704,Slowest app I have ever encountered. Years ago it was Great! Now it takes 5min literally to load each page. Time to say good bye offer up! ‚òπÔ∏è,1
10705,great app,5
10706,"Ok, let me start off by saying. We're living in some troubling times. I've been on offerup for a while now. Never had any problems until this pass week. Sure the post I post never get any traction. And I was cool with that. But what thing they're not gonna do is patronize me. I sent a seller a message that never responded. A harmless message calling him out on it. And it was deleted? Because it ""Violated community guidelines"". Really? No cursing or anything. I deactivated my account I'm done",1
10707,They allow scammer on board. Many of the posts include fake people selling things. I reported multiple times nothing happened. Therefore offerup allows for scammers to arise. Beware. BEWARE OF SCAMMERS. THEY ARE AWAKING AND OFFERUP ISNT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE SELLERS WANTS OTHER PAYMENT OYTSIDE OF OFFERUP BECAUSE THEIR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS CAN NOT BE LINKED. BEING HARRASSED BY THE SELLER.,1
10708,"Used to be an awesome app, forcing verification with truyou as opposed to more inclusive services sucks. The reputation system is easily manipulated, you meet you buy, seller knows the products not good, they dont mark as sold you cant leave a bad review. Somehow the website functionality is all jacked up too cant create lists. on some phones cant leave ratings on some items via app, cant rate on website. They take administrative action without communication.",1

10723,"most of the furniture are nice and cheap I pay $200 for couch and sofa that worth more than 2 to 3 thousand in a very good condition, nice job offer up",5
10724,This is a scam app. The there are many buyers who ask if the product is available and when they agree to buy they don't show up at all.,1
10725,EXTREMELY CONVENIENT üíØ,5
10726,"Decent app to sell stuff through, however the app has a lot of glitches and you can't really express yourself when reporting bad behavior from other users, or the app management will quickly remove your account. I've made great sales using Offer up but now I'm enjoying Mercari.",1
10727,App is extremely slow and the response time when you tap on something in app is beyond horrible! Update. I have updated the app and it's still extremely slow and the response time when you tap on something is very bad. Most of the time I have to tap the same button twice and some times 3 times to get it to respond,1
10728,It feels like a very good garage sale,5
10729,Cool,5
10730,"Seller was very reasonable and patient, we made the transaction in a concise manner.",5
10731,"I used to love this app, it was the best in everything. I used to sell every single day locally and through shipping and now I can't even hear the sound notification. The app is not the same any more, it became SO slow. I can't rate the buyers and more and more bad reasons to be desappointed. Offerup fix the app or you are going to kill it!!! Learn from Mercari. We can find our own listing in search, you can see prices in pictures, easy edit, more first class shipping options, vacation mode etc!",5
10732,"Offerup is misrepresenting the amount of clicks that it's reporting by inputting a bunch of clicks on the advertisements when you're swiping. Avoid this by not starting your swipe ON the ad, but start swiping on the listings and skip the ad as it comes.",2
10733,"App doesn't send out my messages so that others can see I'm interested in buying. I've heard other people have this issue as well and there's no way to fix this. So if you've been trying to buy something and no one ever replies, it's the app that doesn't work properly.",1
10734,"Scammers galore, the platform actively facilitates scamming. Rams ads down your throat on top of it. Never ever use this garbage app. Customer service is non-existent, especially if you try to sell something. They don't care about sellers in the slightest.",1
10735,Good finds. Nice app. Friendly atmosphere.,5
10736,love this app,5
10737,"Personally I prefer OfferUp, because it's easy to navigate and there's always something new and old, different from what u usually see on apps that have u pay some type of fee or something of the sort or they're saying 1 thing n the app is something else totally different.. I'll recommend OfferUp everytime, without a doubt..... üëçüíØ",5
10738,Great app,5
10739,"Pretty good overall. But when trying to rate a buyer, I'm unable to scroll down to hit submit. I even tried on the smallest display settings. The submit button is accessible until I choose how many stars to give. Other apps have done the same, and I am able to rotate the screen, and this allows me to scroll down, but offer up has decided to ignore my phone preferences, and be oriented in 1vdirection. I'm on a Motorola Z3 with the latest app installed.",4

10748,Not effective,1
10749,"Back when I started using ""Letgo"" and ""OfferUp"", I chose to drop the OfferUp app because it was so slow, and I really like the Letgo app so much more than OfferUp. Since OfferUp bought out Letgo, the app has become so much more annoying. It's the slowest app on my phone. The majority of those still posting are using it more as a full fledged garage sale than a marketplace for convenience. (Nobody want to buy used socks or broken tools.)",1
10750,Wow. This app went downhill fast.,1
10751,freezes everytime i open it even after updates and wont let me submit bug reports,1

10770,"I've have been trolled by people on this site. I have reported these users, but It was not easy figuring out how to do so. A dedicated button to report responders to ads would be helpful.

10771,Awesome App and very effective. Got very good response for the items that I sold!!! All Thumbs Up!,5
10772,So far so good,5
10773,The application does not let me archive items I do not want to purchase. Once this bug is fixed then I will change my rating to a 5 star review. EDIT: I can now delete and archive items I do not want to purchase. Great job!,5
10774,Is fast easy and reliable never had a problem,5
10775,"Useful app but needs UX improvements. The community is friendly, the menus are easy to navigate (good UX design), and I have had no issues with the actual buying or selling of items. That said it's just slow. The UX *implementation* is wanting. Ads laggily get inserted into whatever screen they're included in, meaning you might hit the wrong item or it'll take forever to load. It shouldn't be so jank for how straightforward this app is on paper.",4
10776,If you like to be insulted by being asked to upload your id and selfie to a strange vender so that they can sell that information then go ahead,2
10777,no responses on post,3

10780,Underrated marketplace. Check out out.,5
10781,I used this app with no problem a couple years back but now it's just aggravation trying to sell anything. It seems like immediately I get interested buyers only to find they just created there account this month or last and want my phone number. I'm wondering if it's to try and hack me or sell my number to telemarketer. I had turn off my notifications but check my listings a few times daily only to see I have messages then click on messages to find it's not a message at all but instead a notifi,1
10782,"Used to be good, now you get spammed with ads every time you try to message someone. There desperately needs to be a way to hide sellers. Also they took away useful search features and it's ripe with scam listings/ accounts.",1

10784,Meh,2
10785,Sold a lot bought a lot. Stay away from electronics buy them in store on sales. Other than that this is a pretty cool app.,5

10788,You might be able to find a good deal here and there but it appears to be unmoderated by any humans and is rittled with scammers. The app crashes in the middle of typing responses ALL the time. Use this marketplace as a last resort.,2
10789,Very Helpful and Educational The buyer's are very knowledgeable...thank you...,5
10790,"They hard-sell you into buying ""promotion"" or prioritization of your ad, and then they make you divulge your Gmail password to complete the transaction. Worse, they trap you into a monthly payment, rather than a one-time charge. They say cancellation is easy, but it requires access to something I've never used. I complained to OfferUp and asked if I could just give them a credit card for a one-time charge. They sent a non-answer, then sent a ""How did we do?"" and didn't respond to that either.",2
10791,Offerup website is better then Offerup apps,4
10792,notifications dont work,2
10793,They delete your ads with no context and don't have a clue as to what's deemed dangerous. Bunch of soft workers at Offerup.,1
10794,Very good app. I hope it stays the same.,5
10795,Adding advertising commercials to this app was a pure money grab and I'll no longer be using it.,1
10796,good way to buy and sell love this app,5
10797,very user friendly,5
10798,This is a nice app if you like making extra money or income on the side you can always put your stuff on here the OfferUp it's fast and easy to do. (Come on: try it for yourself! Don't take my word for it . ) Never hurt to have a blessing coming back your way just sitting around the house doing nothing.,5

10932,Not very user friendly. I like the easy scrolling on the home page but it would be better if the price is visible on the cover pictures. It's hard to find the best cost when I have to click into every picture then back out and scroll down again. Also changing the prices is a hassle. I have to click Next a couple of times just to change 1 thing. It would be better if all details were on 1 page.,3

People come on here to find good deals/bargains because of what not being able to just go out and afford what it is new in the stores and it be something of needing or trying to make some money because they need help too and helping someone else at the same time. Not to see these companies like auto places for one selling cars at what people aren't looking for and can't do and seeing all their pics of cars rather than individualsüò§,1

Sadly I'm not sure they can fix this in time before everyone leaves for good, me included...",1

Now they're forcing ads we can go premium...I totally understand that they need to make money. But that's what I paid to have my listing boost. Is it boost automatically if I go premium?,1

11032,I tried to list something multiple times and it was removed everytime. I read all the posting rules. I then tried to make it as simple as possible and it was still removed. Its aggravating because they don't even tell you that its removed or why.,1
11033,I have good experience with OfferUp buying,4
11034,They stop ur message even if they dont violate their terms and I can prove it. They discriminate. You'll might make some money IF THEY ALLOW U TO but two more things they allow other people to post stuff that they don't let you post and I can prove that and also they got one of the slowest systems. I got a good phones I don't know why it takes literally 5 to 10 seconds when u push an option for any action to happen so sometimes you push the stuff twice and it goes back too far,1
11035,Horrible. I asked a guy if the item was still available and he said yes i then said great ill take it and within 5 minutes made the purchase then hear nothing from him for a week then he cancels the order and puts it right back up for sale. It was coming from California. Made a complaint to offerup and they did nothing. Bad very bad,1

11209,"After several years of offer up i saw the rise a d the slow fall out is having, no one buys anything in that app i had made an experiment and seen the change it has i deleted two accounts in execution co dition. I guss is time to move forward",1
11210,How do I cancel this subscription,1
11211,Doesn't load. Ads crash py phone. Says I received messages but can't view. Listing gets reported for no response can't communicate outside of the app because the warning crashes my app. All around garbage. Spend way too much time trying to get you to buy drop ship bs every other post is an ad.,1
11212,My account was closed without a reason. I had over 130 reviews 4 years with it and they just closed it like nothing. And they don't give u a response as to why it was closed. Pathetic. I didn't violate any guidelines. I didn't post anything bad or nothing. I can't even open a new account because they don't respond to me. Why???!?,1
11213,great way of finding specific items near you!,5
11214,Its Greatüòä,5
11215,Awesome,5
11216,Love how easy it is to use this app to sell things I no longer need.,5
11217,too expensive,1
11218,"The amount of ads you are forcing onto users is becoming unbearable. It seems like corporate greed is becoming a priority at OfferUp as the base grows. Don't forget, Facebook marketplace and Craigslist are free without imposing themselves onto the user. Do better!",2
11219,"Got an email saying unusual activity on my account, would need to reset password. I've clicked the reset password now several times over the past 12 hours only from within the app, checked all my mail folders, nothing comes in. Can't sign into the account Update: all support said was we are aware of issue, no resolutin. F Update 3/23: this app is still useless, I created a new account with phone number have, 0 views. My old account I was a paying member, won't ever give this company money again",1
11220,it's not letting me post my offers received message been having this issue for a long time üòû,2
11221,The hell is this?!?! Youtube?? A free game on the store?? Why the ads???,1
11222,They delete accouts when they feel like it,1
11223,"After finding out about this Site/App being something of a Classified's. I opted to open an account via Facebook login, then went to the App on my phone. I started the process of trying to put a vehicle I have for sale onto the site. The one listing you get per month is used and my listing is not up. it's been two day's thus far and I still don't see my listing in the ""My Items' tab or the Main Site Listing using either the PC and Phone App. Personally I don't know how people can post anything.",1
11224,app is so slow,1
11225,"it's not enough their fees are already pretty high, and item search results are littered with ads, but now they've introduced full page ads that you can't back out of. you have to carefully scan the ad and look for a ""close"" or an ""X"". offerup managed to go from ""meh"" to absolute trash. i can't wait to finalize my last transaction on here and delete my acct and app.",1
11226,"Within having this app for 1 hour, I was receiving messages from people whose items I had never looked at. I ""supposedly"" had messaged many people asking for their address. These were items I would NEVER look at. I contacted OfferUp and all they told me was that the messages came from my account. No help at all. I quickly deleted the app and kept getting these notifications through email. I unsubscribed from emails and kept receiving the emails.",1
11227,"Great app! Faster at uploading pictures than letgo. I believe there should be more sections to choose from when selling an item, like craigslist. Update: Why didn't you guys remove the saved section? I see it's a glitch because I see the save button but there's no section to view your saved items that you would want to buy in the future when you get the money. Please fix soon! Thanks!",4
11228,"Most of the things are scams, and the real sellers are very few",2
11229,can't use it,1
11230,H.no hits want to cancel and you took out another payment,1
11231,"very safe, simple way to buy & sale.",5
11232,The app and the web page will not sync together. Tried posting items multiple times and they do not show or after I post something it will disappear if I post something new. I even uninstalled and installed the app on the phone. Tried posting items for sale multiple times and they never show up under my items.,1
11233,Rude buyers,1
11234,I got banned for having 2 accounts. Can you believe that.,1
11235,Great,5
11236,"Really easy to use, love the new updates everything seems so new and refreshed look! Thanks for a wonderfull app!",5
11237,too many low balling jerks.,1
11238,I like it but it's a bit more work,3
11239,"Customer support sucks and help pages are useless. You get wrung through automated email hell when just trying to ask a simple question. There is no customer support number either, which is a HUGE red flag for an app that handles financial transactions!",1
11240,"This is app is easy to use but I rarely manage to sell anything. And if I'm buying, I'll find 2-year-old ads and the sellers don't respond. Posts need to expire. That part is really frustrating.",3
11241,"The search feature is horrible. There are many results that do not match the search criteria. Also, listing do not show the price until you click on them. Not a good app.",1
11242,"This app has devolved, it's pretty bad now. So many scammers, it has become so hard to sell anything, let a lone browse for things you want to buy. They had something good, not sure how they managed to ruin it.",1
11243,"Horribly optimized, possibly one of the worst optimized apps on my phone, i cant do anything without waiting for around 5 seconds flr it to register my input",2
11244,Downloaded the app for the first time and went to sign up only to find that an account was already made and banned using my email address. I've never used OfferUp before but the only way to get in contact with customer service is twitter. I never got an email from them saying an account had been made or banned.,1
11245,great place for great stuff,5
11246,Great App but It be nice add a renew option at least every week like Letgo had. So we dont have to go thru DELETING & Reposting process all over again with the old posts...,4
11247,nobody can see my messages,1
11248,"Be careful of scammers there all over these items. Especially the vehicles ""If it's to good to be true it probably is."". And there's no buyers protection that really protects your purchase. I had ordered a Chanel sunglass for $200 for and another Miu Miu for 100 and even though I could track my order the infomation on USPS said my package was delivered. So when I go to check my mail there's no package. I filed a claim contacted offer up but I got nowhere with it and lost $300",1
11249,It's ok. the whole promotion thing is ridiculous but hey get your money I guess,4
11250,"Used to love it, now it's nothing but ads. It's impossible to navigate and It's saturated with advertising.",3
11251,"Keeps on kicking me off while im trying to post the items im selling , not sure why",1
11252,need update sucks I can't see my old messages past 2 months,1
11253,They suck!! They took me down and I lost alot of business.,1
11254,awesome appüëå,5
11255,Slow and buggy,1
11256,exactly as described. great seller. fast honest fair market price. quick communicated back when queried.,5
11257,well I used to like it but anymore they shut my account off for me saying things I don't even know what I said wrong and then when you ask him what you did wrong and how you can get your account back up they don't answer you they don't say anything it's been three weeks since I've had my account shut off for a reason I have no idea why I have six kids and I support these kids they selling stuff on OfferUp well I'm about to starve because my account is shut off. thanks OfferUp,4
11258,my items get very little visibility,1
11259,worse app ever,1
11260,This app became tragic. From good idea it is right know just commercial app for Amazon and Walmart. And when they start with the commercials for games and other app I uninstall it. It has nothing to do with the original idea.,1
11261,easy to use. free. Awesome!!,5
11262,App can lag at times,3
11263,very nice family feel environment. thank you. for your purchase,5
11264,why adds,1
11265,Scam artist only this app.,1
11266,Ads? Lol.,2
11267,app is trash no one is buying or selling anything just a scam don't waste ur time or money,1
11268,"All of a sudden there's adds now.. pretty annoying üôÑ üòí üòë this never use to happen. Why? Is offerup heading for ""premium"" where you buy for $2.99 to take off ads.. really? Cmon..",1
11269,"It got ""better"" with ads you can't close out of.",2
11270,"fast easy,and the web site always right on time",5
11271,"UPDATE 5/23 APP NOW HAS VIDEO ADS YOU CANT SKIP! GARBAGE App is filled with adds that appear to be listings if you don't look carefully. App is slow, won't show prices unless you click on each item (terrible design as most people are shopping based on price). They take 12%+ for selling outside your local area and it seems sketchy at best for anything over $20. Good luck out there...chat functions are terrible. The keyboard covers the chat and you can't even see what you're typing. Trash app!",1
11272,Good,5
11273,UPGRADE. NEEDS A LOT OF UPGRADES. TOO MANY FEES JUST TO KEEP YOUR ADVERTISEMENT REPETITIVE AFTER BEING LISTED. THIS APP ALWAYS FREEZES OR CRASHES.,5
11274,Welll,1
11275,"Great place to sell the things you no longer want or need. You can get good deals on here but not from every seller, of course.",5
11276,I somehow think they restrict your ad to only show a little bit of it or something to that effect because I used to get many lots more views of my products than I do now I'd be lucky to get one or two a day on popular items something weird going on with this app now . but now that he wants you to pay to get more views what's up with that,1
11277,"Don't bother subscribing to the promote plus. Total scam, they won't refund you the second it charges your card even if it was only 2 days into your annual subscription and you realized that's not what you want. Save your money and don't give it to them.",1
11278,Sellers should be REQUIRED to log-in and confirm items are still offered. I'm tired of items I have hunted for years keep popping up on my search when the seller has not even opened messages inquiring about them.,2
11279,I can sell my stuff,5
11280,Is great app,5
11281,Excellent,5
11282,Alot of the listings are years old. They obviously either sold the item already or don't really care about selling it. They need a time limit for listings,1
11283,"Was trying to leave a 3 star review. Offer up app didn't let me. Website says to use app to use the feature. Therefore, the app now gets the 1 star. Don't manipulate the reviews. If a seller isn't trust worthy, you're putting people in danger.",1
11284,This ap is a rip off trying to sell items. Do not recommend any subscription with them.,1
11285,"Horrible website, very complex to use. Good luck trying to figure out how to post an item for sale. Why not a simple link which reads, ""Sell and Item."" Instead, you get sent to a confusing app page. Horrible site design.",1
11286,Midroll ads in the app are horrible. I'll use another app instead.,1
11287,buena app.,5
11288,Nice,3
11289,Has a serious bot problem they all for your phone number,1
11290,Sooooooo slow!,2
11291,Best online sellers app,5
11292,Good app but has a full screen add pop-up,3
11293,Loaded with scammers.,1
11294,OfferUp sucks I can't log on to look for anything!!!,1
11295,After signing up for promote plus my views stopped. I had another user try to search for my items for sale and couldn't find it at all. I need my money back for promote plus.,1
11296,"Giving this app a 4 star Because of the lack of management. This app use to get a lot of attention sells were booming! nowadays, I feel like we are attracting the wrong people. app keeps freezing. Noone buying. Im not making any more money on this app. I am using Facebook market and it is booming. Please update your app",4
11297,awesome guy very friendly,5
11298,For my experience offer up being good to me thank you,5
11299,Years later and OfferUp still has not fixed the location default error. Please fix. It defaults to location i don't even use or lived or visited. User feedback submitted.,3
11300,Got robbed trying to send someone something through the mail thanks offer up for being useless.,1
11301,Love the hammock! Relaxing poolside now. Thanks Ben!,5
11302,"I literally get more people contacting me via Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace than through this app. **Edit:** As of 5/28/2023, I've been notified that my account was banned despite interacting with ZERO people. Somehow, despite having no activity, I'm flagged for ""violating community guidelines"". This app is a SCAM. **Edit2:** As of 5/29/2023, OfferUp has the gall to continue to spam my inbox with offers after banning my account. AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!",1
11303,"Be prepared to be EXTREMELY patient. This app is so slow and sluggish, regardless of what phone you use. EVERYTHING is slow: messages, posting items, marking items sold. Their support staff is also useless. They'll cancel your account without warning even though you have an 800+ 5-Star rating. When you email them pleading to reactivate your account, they'll simply respond with a generic copy and paste message.",1
11304,don't like the new ads sucks,3
11305,Great,5
11306,Just please explain to me why this app is so damn slow????,2
11307,no one ever replies to my messages,1
11308,More and more ads on this app!,1
11309,not enough people to sell or buy from,3
11310,it's so slow,3
11311,GLITCHES LIKE CRAZY. I read the reviews but didn't think it was as bad as all that. It took me 19 mins to get through the terms page because the screen kept going back to the main page. Entering my zip code took another 5 mins because the system was stalled. Finally at the submission part & I was brought back to the beginning. Can you get it together??? UPDATE After 20 mins... my first post still wasn't processed. Uninstalled... who has time for that??,1
11312,Super shady business ethics. They will black list you for a number of reasons and not tell you. So you waste time posting things that no one sees. To boot they will even let you pay for promotion listing and still charge your card $99 even tho you have posted nothing. If there is something more scandalous please do tell.,1
11313,It used to be a pretty enjoyable app until the pop-up ads. I can understand the picture ads but the video ads that pop-up when I back out of looking at someones stuff they posted is really F√ª√ßl(ƒ´√±& LAME...I WONT HAVE THIS APP INSTALLED MUCH LONGER IF I HAVE TO WATCH ADS THAT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN!!!!!! DROP THE VIDEO ADS OR I DROP THIS APP!!!!,2
11314,Sucks horrible slow to many scammers! üëé üëé üëé üëé!!,1
11315,Ads interrupt and slow this app down a great deal. They need to really streamline this app.,1
11316,for some reason everytime i make an offer or i message someone i nvr get a reply back idk if they're not receiving my messages but it has been happening since i downloaded the app.,1
11317,üëç,5
11318,"I think that off up is ok, I like it very much",4
11319,great application,5
11320,good way to find obscure stuff,5
11321,When you try to cancel monthly payment subscription for promote plus it makes it impossible.,1
11322,Has no idea what local or radius means ... Suggest impossible local items up for sale,2
11323,I've been using OfferUp since 2017 it has not failed to be an excellent platform for both buying and selling new and used items.,5
11324,"This app has gone way downhill. Slow and full of ads. I used to only use offerup. Now I just use Mercari and occasionally use offerup. Not only do you have sponsored ads in the search, but now you have video ads when you look at an item and back out or send a message. Also, they have listing that are years old thar they don't ever clear out. Do yourself a favor and check out Mercari or Facebook Marketplace. Or you could even go back to Craigslist. This app just isn't worth it anymore.",1
11325,very kind seller. and worked with me till I could get there.,5
11326,"There is only 1 word that best describes this app and that is, ""AWESOME""",5
11327,"Trash company. They can terminate your account without notice or warnings even with high ratings. When you are using the app it's slow, laggy and delayed(see other reviews). I can watch HD videos on my phone but can't navigate the app menu in a smooth manner? Msgs are delayed in the app. Ads have increased cause they want you to pay for their services. Trash company.",1
11328,ONE OF THE GREATEST APPS FOR ENTREPRENEUR'S! I'VE MADE OVER 2K ON THIS APP. ALWAYS RELIABLE IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL TO SELL.,5
11329,"Ahhh this app. is really starting to get annoying! Ads,Ads,Ads.... unnecessary will tolerate a little longer before unistalling..SMH",1
11330,good app. update old listings,5
11331,The ADS needs to stop. I'll start using the Facebook marketplace,1
11332,"Horrific experience! If you search for an item near you, the results are 50% ads for unrelated items and won't tell you if it's in another state until you click on each individual one and scroll all the way to the bottom! Not only that, but the app spams you every day with its own promotional and annoying notifications, making having them on for chats unbearable!!",2
11333,Slow slow SLOW! Hangs up constantly. And it baffles me that you cannot create or edit posts online! So you're stuck using this pathetic app for posting.,1
11334,App deletes listing and doesn't say why.,1
11335,Slow üêå,1
11336,so far it has been a great experience,5
11337,Not enough offers to justify keeping it on my phone. Really gone down over years.,2
11338,This app needs to go back to basics. Incorporated a job finding slows down this app. Keep it simple.!!,1
11339,amazing,5
11340,"There are some major criticisms i have with Offerup. This app lacks basic functions, like blocking people without having to report them. You cant purchase things in multiple quantities to make shipping easier and combined like ebay can. Look at the description for every update. They never go into detail as to what they changed in the app! Ive had items be taken down for no reason, and the ""support"" email NEVER specifies why an item gets taken down for breach of ToS. Do better.",3
11341,Heard about the app and I've likd it so far,5
11342,great,5
11343,customer failed to respond,1

11346,Great deals.,5
11347,"The app used to be fast and snappy. But in recent months (or even years) it becomes so slow. Each page switch would take 5 to 10 seconds, if not even more.",2
11348,Good,5
11349,This app is so slow ü¶•,2
11350,"I appreciate the platform as a whole, but the app is absolute dog t *ur ds. IT needs to be fired and adequate app developers need to be hired. The number of times this app force stops, lags, buffers, or overall glitches is ANNOYING AS H E LL. Maybe if you hire better mobile app developers, you'll get more traffic to your app = more revenue for you. I hate using the app bc of how slow it moves. In the age of technology, such poor performance is unacceptable. Like we're still in 2009. Unbelievable",2
11351,Full page unskippable ads take over your phone now. Yikes! As others stated constantly sending junk notifications and no way to turn them off without turning off all notifications. Was nice while it lasted.,1
11352,"I used to love OfferUp, and now I dont",3
11353,It ok,5
11354,good app to buy and sell,5
11355,"Waist of time. Ghost buyers with offers that never respond. Most likely all these offers are from fake buyers or fake accounts. Way to go ""offerup""",1
11356,Hot trash of an app,1
11357,"so far so good, I would love more sales though",5
11358,Excellent,5
11359,used be to be good. but now full or ads.,1
11360,I never rate apps. OfferUp was great until they started forcing unskippable ads on you. The short ones were bearable but now they're upwards of 30 seconds.,1
11361,Offer dosent let me post or i cant buy nothing,1
11362,Why are there adds?? It's a selling platform not a social media website. It's pretty trash there are adds.,1
11363,"This new ad system they implemented is utter garbage. This once ""go to"" app is now unbearable to use. Whoever and/or whatever team thought this was a good idea should reconsider their role in ui/ux. As soon as a competitor creates an app that rivals this, you're going to see a massive exodus of users if this isn't remedied.",1
11364,Deleted my account after I bought an item with no reason given. I would give less stars if possible,1
11365,The app is slow and I haven't sold anything on it yet we will see what happens in the future.,2
11366,Please I need my offerup,5
11367,Garbage. Technical problems w no one to assist. Always something wrong when trying to post new item.,1
11368,Too many ads as seller items. Doest feel like a solid serious place to sell or buy. Mostly new items pop up. Craigslist is better.,3

11374,"Pop ups are going to make people leave this app alone. I personally don't need offer up it's a novelty that I may have used to buy 3 or 4 items in the last five years. It's fun, but now they are pushing premium access for a fee?!? Your devs are burnt if you think this is a good move. Keep your ad revenue and leave the users out of it. POP UPS GOTTA GO. If offer gets worse it will be deleted from my phone.",3
11375,"The new update keeps croping my pictures when I post it. It doesn't show my full items. The old version was much better. If it isn't broke, dont fix it. Now they are charging per post. Ridiculous, ill just start posting on Marketplace instead. I'm definitely uninstalling the app!!",1
11376,good,5
11377,"I've met some awesome people, and have bought alot of nice furniture.",5
11378,Was very useful. Now there are non-skipable ads every 2/3 minutes. Huge waste of time now. Which really sucks for people trying to sell.,1
11379,your items do sell on this app. tip: figure out the right price.,5
11380,Just started today,5
11381,I wanna try this again but now is asking for credit card. I don't plan to use my credit card for anything. I pay cash for my stuff. facebook markplace dont ask for credit cards or Craigslist. I guess I am not using this.,1
11382,"Good Concept, but unresponsive sellers. I got this app as an alternative to eBay, Amazon, Craig's List, etc. Lots of listings... however, all the sellers I have encountered are unresponsive or slow, and listings are months old, meaning they lost interest in selling. I want a marketplace where all the listings are responded to quickly (or at all). Now OfferUp is badgering us to use it for job postings. Uninstalling. Tired of getting excited over listings then no response to my efforts to buy.",2

11391,I don't like the way you can't easily delete your items whether they sold or didn't sell. You should be able to delete And re list without an act of Congress,1
11392,"I changed my mind, especially seeing how hated you guys are on Reddit, Facebook, and pretty much everywhere else, ONE STAR! I swear to God I would give you zero or negative if I could. IT'S SO BLEH!! I miss Let Go so freakin' much. This app is extremely clunky and slower than Ivan The Boneless in a foot race. I use this out of necessity.

Then there was; it's already sold (tho showing still available...); they decided to keep it (after days of bk & forth...); or let's deal outside the app space (which sounds shady...). Six fails I8r, I decided to stick to eBay. Higher cost but lower risk. Not a digg at OU. It's just not a good fit for me.",3

11412,"I haven't used it a whole lot ,but so far it seems to be ok,time will tell how good they are.",4
11413,This app hardly works now nothing but a bunch of Spam ads Wish I could give it negative stars. Was my favorite site.,1
11414,"This app was the best one, but now is annoying basically they push you to get the Premium whatever they call, every single moved you do it's one ad you go back another ad, don't like it anymore...",1
11415,nice,4
11416,Works well enough. Has a habit of showing that you have new messages in your inbox when really it's just notification from OfferUp that you access from a different screen.,5
11417,This new update made things so laggy and takes long to load.. i think its adds and as well all the lag made my phone reset and reboot over and over,1
11418,"Terrible support for non-mobile. I understand mobile-first development, but this is insane. You can't create or edit posts on the desktop website at all. . . . EDIT: I don't know how more specific I can be. Please add the ability to add and edit posts via the desktop web and not just the app.",1
11419,"Done, was already on the fence of deleting but after the update with the annoying pop up ads definitely deleting.",1
11420,been using offer up for years and haven't had a bad experience yet. sold a lot of items and bought plenty as well.,5
11421,Ok,5
11422,on time very helpful,5
11423,"Bring back let go! This is full of ads or shows me stuff from across the country. Disappointing. Gave two stars because one just felt mean. 9/18/20 Update: 3 years later, and it's 100% worse. Now full screen ads if I want to send a message?! Nah. Trash.",1
11424,Wouldn't Accept my email..says invalid..I checked and checked and it's used exact same way in all my accounts!! I know it's valid..nothing more frustrating so I deleted app and anyone else asks Me about offer up I can't wait to tell them how it's a total waste of time..you can't even log in!!!!!‚òπÔ∏è,1
11425,You should really set a length of how long a post is available before it auto deletes my area is filled with thousands of posts that are 2 to 3 years old which it is highly unlikely that the seller still has that item,1
11426,Now we have forced pop up ads. Too many ads. Every 5th or so ad is an online retailer and most aren't screened so they can be fake. Ads should expire after 60 days but they have ads from years ago with sellers that dont even check messages.,1
11427,"Seriously?? Worst Catch of them ALL!! You have to sell your items individually. It wasn't stated in the post when I took multiple pictures for a garage sale. Claimed it was ""for a business"" then a second bs email about ""can't have multiple items for sale in one post"". Figure it out. Using a different app and Facebook. Not worth the time. Glad I canceled the premium services as well. Keep your MONEY!!!",1
11428,quick easy and effective,5
11429,great app for bartering and making a quick buck üëè üëç üëå üòÄ üôå,5
11430,Excellent transaction,5
11431,Great app for finding local sellers!,5
11432,this app is changing to ebay and mercari great to trash dumb ddevelopers,1
11433,"Update 5/25/23. Still a buggy app. Now the app won't allow me to submit a buyer rating. Once you tap on the stars, the submit button disappears and you can't scroll up to view and click it. Constantly crashing or freezing. Always having to relaunch.",4
11434,Really wish they would follow up on prohibited items. So many people selling animals. Why bother giving us an option to report things if nothing is ever done. Update 5/25/23 - Ads??? Really? That was the best part of this app.,2
11435,Have yet to advertise,3
11436,"Great place to sell things, horrible app. You have to click every thing 5 times for it to respond. They never purge any ad's. So there are old cars that where posted 6 or more years ago. Unluck trying to see the closest stuff, you will just see all the old ad's that have never been purged.",2
11437,"yeah.. well, frankly, I guess I WILL BE a whole lot HAPPIER when I Am Making Actual Money On This App! but seriously it's a pretty good, although, ya know... it's No ""LetGo"" app! I'll remember that that website or that app back then when they first started out I was making hand-over-fist money man and then all the sudden one day I get back on here and boom is gone is very shocking I'm very surprised I mean I realize this is supposedly both ""offerup""/""letgo"" but you know what I mean",5
11438,They got everything,5
11439,"Sold a couple items, however I'm not confident in how much visibility my items are getting.",3
11440,"I decided to uninstall the app after the incredible amount of ads. They were already all over the listings and would cause accidental clicks to links. But, to make it interrupt and completely cover the screen is just too much.",1
11441,rarely upload my photos on the 10+ attempt to post,3
11442,"Horrible app. Constantly freezes, constantly lags, and constantly crashes. Paid the fee for a one-day add boost and the ad was never posted but they sure took my money. This app is not user-friendly whatsoever.",1
11443,"This used to be a great board app. But now i have to watch 3 ads per minute, it really destroys my experience. A lot of times i spend an hour or more just scrolling. But now, half that time is watching ads. Offer Up, your days are numbered.",1
11444,Messaging is sluggish and it crashes often.,3
11445,Ads are too much. You get bombarded with emails and now you have to wait for some ads to close before returning to the app.,1
11446,No option to delete item or repost same item that did not get sold after sell being cancelled,1
11447,"Cut the garbage with the ads, or fade into obscurity",1
11448,"Well, I just took the time and applied for work but mainly I tried to download offer up",5
11449,for now I real give this i really like it can be better .,4
11450,"Super slow, like 1995 slow",1
11451,"I've always enjoyed using this app and it's always been very useful. Would be 5 stars, but having the ads like it does now knocks it from 5 to 4 stars",4
11452,This app has obvious scammers with fake profiles constantly messaging people trying to get your information. The app is horrible for the purpose it's supposed to serve and just opens you up to a whole load of scammers. Deleting!,1
11453,"Good app, unreliable sellers and scams. Make it not an option to back out of deals and terminate accounts that do. Plus once you save a search, good luck ever getting rid of it..",2
11454,There are ads now that take up the whole screen unless you pay for premium. It really hinders the experience to the point of having to open and close the app just to skip the ads.,1
11455,I love making money thank you offerup,5
11456,Things sell faster than ebay even though I love ebay. This is for people who are always on their phones I guess. 5/24/23 These ads are the worst. Take it off. The app is already slow enough.,1
11457,If I could give this no stars I would I can't even see my messages,1
11458,People get kicked out with no explanation.,1
11459,it keeps deleting my posts when I try to post and onhave to keep redoing some of them.,3
11460,I love this app ans platform. I have been very successful finding items for my home at deep discounts and most sellers are super kind.,5
11461,exc ap,5
11462,"There should be filters for store and private listings. The business listings completely flood out the private ones and it becomes a chore to sift through the sea of stores listing their prices as their ""down payment"" which can be misleading. Update: It's been over a year and a half and the business listings have gotten even worse. I tried blocking those users, but it doesn't hide their listings, just prevents communication. Will reduce rating over time.",3
11463,The gteatest,5
11464,Most things posted here are used and priced higher than brand new. Disappointing.,1
11465,It never let the algorithm of the application take your add the manipulate the advertisement the advertisement you are the crook,1
11466,I've sold a couple things 75% of the time alot of people bs but still good app,5
11467,"All sponsored items, horrible app",1
11468,"This app is getting buggier. Locks up, delays, cant enter purchase feedback because the screen won't let you scroll down to enter.",3
11469,I've been getting this Money baby!!!!! Thx OfferUp!!!!,5
11470,Trash! Dysfunctional garbage of an app. Continually removes my sell posts after only a few minutes.,1
11471,So far I have had no problems with any transactions and the app is very simple to use,5
11472,Dion. Reno,5
11473,No apparent means or explanation for operation of app. Total blank regarding HOW TO USE.,1
11474,Can you please go back to the previous version? I am lost . The app shows that I have 5 messages that I can't find inside ??,2
11475,it's a good app to buy and sell,5
11476,I love offer up,5
11477,"People on here aren't really serious at all. It's like they message you for fun. Y'all need to have it to where people are penalized for playing with people time. So many ads, they try to force you to promote it or go premium or it seems your page will slow down in traction. It really sucks now. I had a page with over 200 sales & deleted it because so many people are jokes on here. started this page & I see it's just y'all don't have a lot of serious people on here. I'm for sure about to delete",1
11478,I have not been able to open app for the last 3 days.,1
11479,"Very bad are search, and too many unrelated items in specific search",1
11480,"Full screen ads make this app so annoying to use. Before this last update, we only saw the ad squares as you're scrolling through, l but now they're in your face at random times--when scrolling or clicking around. Quality of life consistently dwindles away with this app. It is also very slow and a nuisance to navigate throughout as a result.",2
11481,Love that you can find great things at a great price. Love the app,5
11482,not helpful.,2
11483,The full page ads that pop up and cannot be closed make this app unusable. Get rid of the pop-up ads! Or you will lose your entire customer base.,2
11484,Ads are too intrusive. Just use Facebook marketplace instead,1
11485,great app !,5
11486,It's good but not nearly as good as Letgo was.. Letgo was awesome and I wish it were still around.. OfferUp blows bubbles for quarters. Lol,4
11487,Great,5
11488,"The slowest APP I have ever owned. It used to be great over 6 months ago, but now its unusable. Plus now it has terrible ads everywhere and taking 5 to 10 seconds to react to touching any buttons, it's just bad. Bring back the original APP that worked great. This new updates is not working, you are losing users.",1
11489,it doesn't show the prices until you open the post,1
11490,12/20/20: Uninstalled after the update. The app was better before the merger with letgo. 5/23/23: I've come to be more accepting of this app. It's ok but could be better. I have also noticed ads are nonchalantly accumulating... This might signal end of life for offerup. üçª,3
11491,Great app. Never had any issues using it. Great job.,5
11492,Has Fullscreen popup ads. Very lame.,1
11493,Notifications are excessive and no way to turn off notifications aside from in-app messaging.,2
11494,"can't post on desk top can't delete post, complicated",3
11495,"Useful app with overall great design, but it suffers from lag that makes navigating the app frustrating at times.",4
11496,"I love this app, they usually have what I'm looking for, I would definitely recommend this app for everyone",5
11497,My account is band for no reason because of a seller who wasn't clear about his items. And for along time I can't buy or sell any thing,1
11498,Great selling app,5
11499,"Beware: ONLY BUY / SELL LOCALLY. DO NOT SHIP. OfferUp routinely disables accounts in error with no warning or explanation. This means no 2-day buyer protection, screwing anyone who buys / sells via the mail. Customer service does not help when this happens. Accounts get erroneously locked for ""violating a community guideline"" with no warning or explanation as to why.",1
11500,"Great app, however there's so many issues with the messaging on their app. It takes a long time to load an item. And messaging doesn't send out half of the time. Please fix!",2
11501,Wow. Now there are non skipable add while you are browsing. Guess this is the end of being able to use this app. Shame,1
11502,Don't like the advertisements and not booting out the retailers that sell mattresses. Need better eyes on car scammers as well,2
11503,New pop-up ads are horrible.,3
11504,it's ok,3
11505,Cash un,5
11506,"Unable to leave reviews for buyer because that part has no scroll. Even at the smallest possible font size, the sibmit button disappears below where I can click. Fix the damn UI.",3
11507,Very helpful and easy,5
11508,The app kept closing down!!,4
11509,"when to pick it up the item and they tried to sell a different one, really bad experience",1
11510,"I'm trying to post um I don't stuff to sell on an app designed to sell stuff, and it keeps removing my post. and then proceeded to ban my account",1
11511,this app is charging for everything now,2
11512,not enough enforcement on scammers that are selling things.,1
11513,Great page,5
11514,very helpful selling your items,5
11515,love it,5
11516,App was cool at first. With the addition of ads or a paid version. 2 ‚≠ê demotion.,3
11517,to many adds,2
11518,"great app, for selling & buying items.",4
11519,I think I am up to about 15 sales on this site. So it does work just a little slow. It's best to have a wide range of items for sale.,4
11520,my profile was deleted had to create a new one,5
11521,Has become very laggy and slow. Rolled back to an older version and problem solved.,1
11522,i was in the hospital an someone hacked into my account i been telling OfferUp this for a long time so when i try to post anything that said my account was removed so now i cant post or buy anything on OfferUp this app sucks,1
11523,Does not work at all on my Galaxy phone,5
11524,you can find some good deals,5
11525,"I wish I could give OfferUp a higher rating. However, my account keeps getting blocked for having ""multiple accounts"" even though that's not the case. There seems to be a problem with the system that links my account with my wife's (and possibly even my parents'). Support isn't very helpful in resolving the issues as it's a reoccurring problem. It's very frustrating, especially when it happens when I'm in the middle of a transaction.",1
11526,it's pretty neat,5
11527,Great app,4
11528,"it's almost perfect, but it freezes and can only update on the app, not on the website, and now I have been noticing a lot of pop-ups of games I don't want",3
11529,"Don't download this app! Apparently they would rather have someone on their app trying to scam people into buying a product that they are claiming is another product, with the literal value being 25¬¢ but claiming it's something else that they are charging $214 for but reporting that ad before someone gets scammed violates their terms of service for ""being disrespectful""!! This app is the definition for liberal America and safe spaces!! Protecting the crooks and not the normal citizens!!! üò§üò°üñï",1
11530,I've sold a lot of items here and bought even more. I love this app,5
11531,"Sad and greedy!!! Ads after everything I touch. I have been buying and selling happily for years on this app. Now not only is it littered with commercial companies marketing their junk, but we are subjected to ads for nonsense. It's sad corporate greed ruins things that are... Were great.",1
11532,"I would not trust this app, they do not stand behind their buyer protection and it's so difficult to even get any help when needed with a faulty transaction. I'll stick with better places like eBay.",1
11533,"Apparently, anything that you try to sell ""violates"" their community guidelines. I tried listing my TV and sound bar for sale, and they immediately removed it and claimed that it violates their rules for supposed advertising. I've sold multiple items in the past and have never had an issue up until now. You're better off using the Facebook Marketplace to sell stuff since this app has gone downhill.",1
11534,Good,4
11535,"cheerful, on time and polite!",5
11536,"It's good but not being able to post from a computer is a big drawback. You can only post from your phone, which is a huge pain in the neck when it comes to organizing several photos and writing long text descriptions.",3
11537,love the app,5
11538,many phishing attempts,3
11539,yep I've been telling people about you,3
11540,LetGo was better. No one responds!,2
11541,quick sales very nice !,5
11542,Ooo la la,5
11543,The concept of this app is a good one but what ruins it is all the users who don't use it as it was intended. The need for managing it is very obvious.,1
11544,"Listings NEVER expire. I have absolutely no idea why the app is built like that, because a simple search ""toolbox"" reveals only TWO listings made in the past 4 months, everything else is listed literal YEARS ago. its really absurd as it makes finding legitimate listings difficult. There are VERY few people in my area that use this app, so FB Marketplace is worlds better, however that might vary on area.",1
11545,Poor user experience.,2
11546,"Really, ads",1
11547,Recent addition of unblockable or closable ads is a nuisance. Ruining the experience.,2

11550,Not that good. App always shutting down,2

11552,"What used to be a great app is utterly useless now. Price gouging for premium listings, fodder listings that never expire, algorithms ruining free user posts, and ads at every turn. I just can't justify wasting space on my phone for this piss poor app. Recent updates borked everything even more. I can't even get into the app anymore. I've cleared the cache, cleared the data, toggled between WiFi and cellular, reset my phone, and reinstalled the app to no avail. I guess it's back to Craigslist.",1
11553,What's up with these news adds!? If they aren't gone soon I'm deleting the app,1
11554,Hate the ad pop ups now,2
11555,Trying to delete my subscription but it's way to difficult,1

11559,Did this for some Cars & Trucks I would like to Buy One.All Price's are so Blown Up There is NO Way They Will Sell Way Over Priced!!! There is one or two that are Right. 97% are over 25% to High Wast of Time for That.,1

11567,"This app was great until it merged with letgo. Now it's so slow, super slow to the point it makes you restart the app. Can't message without watching an a video ad. If you don't want ads, go ahead and pay for premium but speed remains horrible. Go ahead and pay that way you have more than one reason to be angry. Use marketplace you have better luck.",1
11568,The new app makes searching weird looking.,1
11569,this app is really bad I usually post rose's and keeps telling me is bad what I post bad really bad app,1
11570,"Love this app. Can't say I'm happy about the ads, but I understand the need.",5
11571,there are a lot of ads on this app and working speed on my Android is very slow,3
11572,This app is selling ur info to scammers,1
11573,horrible cant sell anything here,1
11574,Used to be a solid app. Full of scammers and flakes these days. Report a flake to OfferUp and they don't seem to care. Full of ads these days too,1
11575,The ads just dropped this great app to 2 stars. And that's being kind. Super annoyed right now after looking at products.,2
11576,I really don't like that I can't get my post back to the top without relisting it.,3
11577,"I miss let go, now the ads are more annoying.",1

11580,"Used to be a local thing. Now I'm seeing 6 year old posts from Illinois and such places also, the thing I wanted was on an ad from eBay. 5 mile search in LA reveals items from Phoenix They bought the competition and now have ads (pay to remove) How about I just remove the app and never come back to it? Scummy, scammy, untrustworthy behavior designed only to separate you from your time and money.",1
11581,"Way too many anoying promoted adds, scammers everywhere. I also had my credit card number stolen from their own shady payment processor, I know this because it was a new card that I never used anywhere else, and a week later fraudulent charges appeared. Scammers with fake ratings posting stuff and say they ship, however they never shipped or respond to messages. Was difficult to get a refund, yet the scammer was still posting fake adds weeks later and still had a 5 star rating.",1
11582,So now we're supposed to watch ads on offer up? Just trying to ask if something's still for sale and have to watch a15 second ad. Deleting my account in all probability. What bs. Craigslist has sold more of my items than anything.,1
11583,I love this app*****,5
11584,Still too many scammers on here. An algorithm could easily be made to spot them. Hope to see your next upgrade.,3
11585,"Worst Ap Ever, I had it for 2 days and it wont load or it drags something awful. Its one of the worst I have dealt with. I Uninstaller it already I will go back to EBAY or Craigslist no issues with them at all besides scammers..",1
11586,Good,5
11587,all it has is stuff to ship. Not much local . Took it off my phone .,1
11588,This app is a waste of time. Nobody ever buys anything here. The app only allows people too see your post if you boost it and even then you still can't sell. This app is a total scam,1
11589,Good,5
11590,"Offers Up is the best app I have ever used not only for making money but for meeting interesting and fun people. The administration is always available to answer questions and if you have a problem with anything, they are quick to step in and help you solve it.

11591,Sorriest app I ever used other than Facebook. Tried to sell custom knives and leather and they refused to post. Said knives are against policy . Then they started sending me emails trying to sell stuff to me and I open the page and there's a dozen different knives being sold. This happened several times so I pointed it out to their so called support team and asked why so many are allowed to sell knives when so many of us aren't. That's been two months ago and I haven't heard a word from them t,1
11592,Dosent let me post idk they do it on purpose they block you it's a scam!!!!,1
11593,Good deal.,5
11594,thaku,5
11595,Unusable. App randomly becomes very slow. Almost like a memory overflow or leak.,1
11596,Easy to use,5
11597,Recently added full size popup ads. No thanks,1
11598,I knew this selling platform was too good to be true. Too many pop up ads now. And app wants you to upgrade and start paying to remove ads. That was not an option when I originally downloaded.,1
11599,Worst app ever. Ow there are adds that pop up after clicking on an listing. I'll be deleting my account. Your a sell out OfferUp,1
11600,"Don't trust the promote plus free trial. They make it impossible to cancel until after the billing date starts. Then, you're automatically on the hook for $20. That ""free trial"" is abosulute B.S.",1

11602,"I have been a user for many years now (a paying member for almost two years) and love it, but the past year it lags so much every time I open it and try and click on anything in the app. Is anyone else experiencing this?

11603,"Got banned for something i posted over a year ago, atleast tell me before i waste my time taking pics and adding a good description on the product im posting to notice later that im still blocked and items got 0 views. Offerup sucks, unblock me i wont post any 420 nomore lol i promise",1
11604,Ads are you guys joking you know your competing with facebook marketplace and craigslist and eBay none of which have intrusive ads whichever higher up approved this needs to freshen up his resume,1
11605,If you're going to force me to scan my id then make the system be able to scan it. It's trash.,1
11606,the app doesn't work half the time and when it doesn't it is really slow. very hard to do any business with this app. would not recommend it to others.,1
11607,"Keeps pestering me to post stuff. The ONLY notifications should be people contacting me regarding my existing posts. I don't need an app that nags me to post stuff when I don't have anything new to post. I'll post items when I am good and ready, not when the app thinks I should.",3
11608,this app has lot of scammers. be wary of who you are communicating with,2

11610,Great site. Sold. It. Rite away. No problems,5
11611,App is extremely slow to open to close to post to even search. Im sticking with marketplace. Even when you are in contact with someone the messages are not being deliver on time or notified properly. And now a bunch of adds??? Slowering the app even more. It used be good not anymore.,1
11612,good,5
11613,This app is really slow now - feels purposely so. The ads make it nearly unusable and just to message someone you get a video ad pushed to you before you can message. It's really getting out of control. This app used to be my go-to app even over Facebook Marketplace but now it's on its way to deletion and I'll be back to Facebook and Craigslist. I'm glad I'm not the only one that's noticed. Judging from these reviews OfferUp may be a thing of the past soon.,1
11614,they locked my account for telling a seller my phone number. don't recommend this app,1
11615,It was ok until they started doing ads...now its just trash.,1

This was not a good move! Now, I'm scared to click on anything when I'm on this app, because I'm scared to click on the ads that just randomly pop up.

A momentart lapse in judgement and I updated for security reasons little did i know the new version WAS THE VIRUS!!! This new format is udder GARBAGE, I think I'll just quit using OU. and probably go back to craigslist. The pay to get rid of ads is inexcusable. If these people cant figure out how to make money without destroying their own product, should we really trust these idiots to keep out phones safe?",1

Answer from them. The Purchaser got everything on time And I'm sure offer up got paid on time because otherwise they wouldn't have Send me the postage.

Seller refused to ship & immediately sent a message stating ""I'm not comfortable shipping item until it is paid"" & later: ""we just need to figure out how this is supposed to work"". I emailed ""help"" section of which showed absolutely no concern. The whole experience has made me decide to delete this app as soon as my credit card is refunded.

11680,Ads everywhere. Even intrusive ones when you click out of a listing. App is becoming real slow. Becoming worse.,2
11681,the fact that you only get some notifications is awful and the fact you cant contact sellers directly makes it very undesirable to use... and sellers don't remove items that are sold so its a real time waster.... maybe should be 2 stars,3
11682,Good so far.,5

11689,To many ads!,2
11690,Subscribed and listed 3 simple items. App kept removing the listing. Got an email that it violated their standards. Clearly an error as the listings were extremely simple and I even reviewed the possible violations against their policy.

11730,I liked it better when the price was listed with the image. It saved a lot of time when I didn't have to open each ad.,3

I emailed to ask what I was doing wrong and the reply was... we have now shut down your account due to violations. Ask for clarification multiple times and they gave me none.",1
11735,Auto-subscribed me to their email list with no way to unsubscribe. The unsubscribe button in the email takes me to a broken webpage. The app doesn't have the option to turn off email notifications. Few things are more offensive for an app to do and this alone is why I'm giving them 1 star.,1
11736,easy to use and works great,5
11737,love it the best app,5
11738,it's good and safe reel people doing reel business,5
11739,it's a great app I just wish the prices were the same as they used to be.in the beginning of this app everything was a good deal and the people using it turned it into high price everything and of course none of that is the the apps fault I would give it 5 stars if the prices were regulated,3

11747,awesome üíØ,5
11748,I'm not impressed with the priorities of this establishment. Had an item for a while now has not yet been offered for purchase. Lowered price twice very expensive equipment. Hardly used two or three weeks use total.,3

11751,cool app but slow,5
11752,"WTH is with Play Ads now! Suddenly I get a Google Play Ad after every message I send?! It'd also make sense to have aged selling posts to drop after a certain amount of time. It is pretty straightforward as far as posting anything goes. I don't like that I'm forced to use the in-app shipping in order to promote it more nationwide, especially if my package is larger than the app's available sizes. I should also be asked about getting notices for items rather than just collecting my search habit",3
11753,No hassle,5
11754,It could be better,4
11755,"Used to love this app. Now it works so slow and always struggles to open messages. Now with the ads it's so annoying to do anything on this app. I have had issues about not being able to offer shipping on items, and have received zero help. Terrible help center",2

11757,perfect,5
11758,it's a good app and I'm barely getting started on selling but it's going good,5
11759,IS IT LEGAL FOR OFFERUP TO TRACK IP ADRESS OF PERSONAL DEVISES THAT PPL USE TO ASSESS OFFERUP? BAN EVERY ACCOUT ASESSED FROM PARTICULAR DEVISES OR FLAG IT TO KEEP CHARGES ON EVERY POST POSSIBLE THAT PARTICULAR DEVICE POST. COULD THAT BE ILLIGAL ? PRIVACY LAWS VIOLATION THAT GOOGLE APROOVES IN THERE APP STORE SINCE GOOGLE AGAINST THIS KINDA BEHAVIOR ???,1
11760,"DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING ON YHE APP. Anything that says free trial is a scam and you will pay for the month. They have a ""no refund policy"" even if the service was unclear and unwanted. Customer service is horrible",1

Even though the package didn't start tracking until it was almost there. I just lost out on $180.00. Because honestly, no one is honest anymore. I'm not going to receive the payment. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé",1
11762,Horribly glitchy after update. Freezing and taking forever to load after they did an update. Requires regular restarting to work. Messages have been disappearing and not able to retrieve. And now they added spontaneous video ads which is ridiculous cause this is a buy&sell app and not YouTube. Will be decreasing my use of this trashy app slowly and getting rid of it.,1
11763,"Very easy to work with, communication was on point throughout. Will definitely purchase with again.",5
11764,This app is absolutely garbage everyone on here things what they have is worth more than what they bought it for and in order to post more than one item that sell I need to verify my phone number which I don't trust them to have as much as I can push an elephant which I can't I think they're owned by Facebook which is even worse,1
11765,Ahh!,3
11766,It's a scam.,1
11767,"First time user, thought I'd give it a shot to sell some items I no longer needed. The app crashed after I took the photos and wrote the description. I lost all my work. Disappointed, and will look for other platforms to sell on.",1

11772,"Notifications has NO settings. It's very loud and over rides the ""do not disturb"" setting on my phone. So at 4am, Cha-ching, Cha-ching, Cha-ching. If I could turn off the audio but still had the screen Notifications, that would solve the issue.",1
11773,"Awful. The app used to be great now they have so many unskippable ads. Stuff takes so long to load. It's become a dumpster fire of an app, went back to using Facebook and craigslist and uninstalled this.",1
11774,It's okay to use. Random ads now but it doesn't make it unusable.,3
11775,"The cardscan service does not work. I tried several times and even deleted my card to reenter it. Now it won't even let me enter a card number due to too many attempts. In addition, the service won't let you enter a virtual card number (for enhanced security) because of the same stupid card verification service. I can't even use the web site because it forces me to use the phone app. This is just dumb.",1
11776,Whether you're selling or buying it's a great tool to have in your internet toolbox.,4
11777,at times a pretty good app,4
11778,"From reading the Reviews, it appears this app has gotten unbearably worse. I recall some of issues such as the inability to delete items from your history, so it becomes a cluster fu*k, people POSTING multiple times-hoarding space for others to get out their products on the readable market, items not put in categories intended, hard to correct misspelled words, to add pictures that were suppose to be there... I'm sure I will be reminded of others when I begin using it again. May b short lived",1

I had to find another way to receive my items and have it shipped and protected. Honestly if they were able to ship anything over 20lbs people would actually buy the stuff on here.",1

11803,"Even if you give them all of your information to verify your account, they will not show your listings in their marketplace. It will get 0 views to incentivize you to pay for their promotion service where they will bump your listing in search results for a fee, in addition to charging a 12% ""service fee"" if you want to ship anything out. They don't tell you any of this on sign up though, when you give them all of your data and your zip code. So I'm sure they're selling your data too. Beware!!",1

11817,The app is somewhat slow and I'm not able to rate/review a seller because the page will not scroll up.,3
11818,This used to be a good app. 2nd phone in a row that literally can't even with this app.,2
11819,a good place to buy and sell things cheaply. However only cheaply. Bad place to sell new product and many people don't take the app seriously.,4
11820,Like every update is designed to make it work a little worse. K.i.s.s.,1
11821,it's good. please let the app have notifications,5
11822,OfferUp is terrible. Push notifications and messaging rarely work. They also use the ban hammer despite not breaking any policies and there's no appeal process and they provide no explanation. Wish there was a better alternative. The bar is super low.,1
11823,Terrible no customer service,1
11824,a great way to get rid of unused household items.,5
11825,This app used to be good. Haven't been able to buy/sell anything in multiple years because my account was shadowbanned without any notice. I was able to message and list while the app pretended to work. None actually went through. Years later I finally send a link to family and they are unable to message me because of an error my account was blocked. This makes sense now why no one ever messaged back. Beware of this app. It might not even be working for you and you might never know! It's a shame,1
11826,full page ads now? really?,1
11827,"Since the merger, it has turned into a garbage app. Can't find any real sellers. Only new seller accounts that are obviously scams. Avoid this app!!! Edit-2nd try- Want to waste an hour of your time? Use this app. Sellers constantly no show. I just had a seller message me after I waited 30 mins for them. Seller never intended to show up. I have a record of the conversation from the app and submitted it. OfferUp will let this seller keep setting up fake meetings and waste people's time.",1
11828,awesome app. wish there were less ads. like OfferUp used to be ...,5
11829,You guys need to purge old listings it would make things go smoother.,3
11830,glitches at best,2
11831,"My biggest complaint is the way this app truncates the borders of my items' pictures. Many times, some details about the item are cropped out. Frustrating. Positives are, relatively easy to set up, and app keeps track of the number of views each of my posted items have. Nothing sold yet, but I only posted stuff for about a week. But I did have good success with OfferUp about six years ago, down in Florida. But the app has changed much since then.",3
11832,slow and hard to manage posts. also not many things I have sold through this app,4
11833,Doesn't play nice with VPNs,2

11837,after update it automatically switches you to different page and you can't back out of it. WHY,1
11838,This is the worst of all the Bad apps put together. I try to stay local in my search app on my PC but it has me all over the world. This app used to be good....now it Stinks!! Giving one star so I could voice my opinion,1
11839,a large amount of people who are selling items never responded,3
11840,love it ..thank you =),5

11854,super easy to use. I have sold lots of stuff BUT also bought lots of stuff!,5
11855,Too many retailers on the platform and not enough everyday people! better off going to Best Buy's app for retail sales if that's what you are looking for.,1
11856,This app now if slow asf,1
11857,Great app overall. makes it easy to post things for sale and find things when you are searching. The UI can be confusing at times. especially when you want to edit a post.,4
11858,"I miss letgo was a better app. This app only targets the people actually not selling things just posting. I've been trying to get some riding gear for awhile and everyone that has something in my price range will not answer or respond. I've sent messages to the help desk people, they don't care if it's stayed up. So you trying to sell items is a waste of time on this app.",1
11859,I just wish that the ads that have been in the site for months even years would be deleted and those who have sold their items delete their ads. if sold no use for continuing the ad.,3

11867,Fraudulent app,1
11868,"I just wanted to give another update since my last review.... UNFORTUNATELY, Offer Up has not made any improvements. It takes entirely to long to do the following on Offer Up: -Post a listing -Check/reply to incoming messages -edit photos/edit listings -basically everything you can do on Offer Up is a VERY SLOW process. So again in short basically everything you can do on OfferUp is a slow and painstaking process... It's been bad for months it's not getting better. Why??",1
11869,Great app,5
11870,my go to place to find what I am looking for,5
11871,This app is literal garbage. It immediately closes upon opening no matter what phone. Screw you,1
11872,Have purchased a few items. Easy to use.,5
11873,"How do I clear my search history on OfferUp, and do I need to clear my beta?",5
11874,Never had a problem with the app. It was always smooth and fast. Now recently they started doing ads and the app is sooo slow and crashes half the time.,1
11875,"Non existent customer support, banned for no reason. My account had over 700 complete transactions (all purchasing) and offerup removed my account claiming I attempted to sell drugs on their platform. Reaching out they repeatedly send me the same boilerplate customer service message saying the account can not be reinstated. However they will allow scammers to post expensive electronics under hundreds of accounts without banning them.",1
11876,"Good app, but fee when selling an item is too high.",3
11877,I opted for no notifications and the app continued to send me ads,1
11878,too many business's advertising,3
11879,I had trouble posting items,3
11880,the best,5
11881,"So, offer up seems to think that discrimination is ok. I'm sure, because of a few complaints I tried to get them to address they have decided that I should no longer have an account. I supposedly violated their posting policies. I know of two. I posted two knives. After getting notified of the removal of the ads I went in and searched for the same type of product. And there were hundreds of postings selling the same kind if item. I don't know what I did to tick them off but I'm done.",1
11882,Got banned for no reason,1
11883,Fine at first I mean I got a lot of reveiw never got sell anything. Talk to one person that ask a question you better about the size of pair of shoes I had that's it then the next thing I know I've been band from. I've tried numerous times to contact them they won't respond to me.ive ask around to people about them. And before I say anything they would say u got band .I said yes they said they did them too .,1

11887,"your app is so slow and sluggish now. some messages take a long time to get clicked on and seen. some messages have disappeared? I've updated the app and still slow, lagging, freezing for seconds at a time. I use to enjoy this app but now the excessive ads are frustrating",1

11904,Doesn't set for your location. Just nation wide.,1
11905,too many low-ball offers. going back to Craigslist.,1
11906,good resorse,3
11907,OfferUp is the absolute worst! It is so slow and not even worth the time needed to do simple actions like check a message. Nevermind looking for something specific you want to buy. The app is poorly designed and more headache than helpful. What a joke.,1
11908,"Community is completely toxic, first client was straight up disrespectful and I was locked out of my account and told to join ""TRUYOU"" because of their misconduct, shouldn't be surprised I guess lol. Edit: I tried reinstalling the app to see if I would have better luck selling some other items, pretty much the same experience, people leading you on then dropping the conversation out of nowhere, so I'm just left with a bunch of mundane conversations with asses who don't show and leave hanging.",1
11909,"After a year on this site. I have bought many things and sold very few. This site sucks. Nobody wants to barter, its a website where if you want something, MAKE AN OFFER. But no one does. I love bartering. Wish more people had a little more ""gumption"" to want to. Everybody loves the back n forth on PawnStars but in real life... Not so much. Lol UPDATE. After upgrading the app it SUCKS EVEN MORE. NOW, when you go to search for anything... 2/3 of the screen has Offer Up's banners on it. üëéüëéüëé",1
11910,Has listings that are months old. Too many ads,2
11911,This app is slow as F#$* thought it was my wifi or phone service but my other apps run as they should,2
11912,It's terrible,1
11913,This app was for regular people to sale their stuff now you got dealers posting not 1's but 3-5 times the same picture that any other saller was not allowed to do but they don't check the page they only care of the money.,1
11914,good app for buying things,5
11915,Horrible try sell things and all I'm getting is scams left and right,1
11916,Very slow UI cluttered with jobs I don't care about. I only want to buy things and it's very difficult to do.,1

11923,Worst experience ever met up with the buyer and he ends up robbing us took the item without even paying for it then tried following them but due to rainy weather we couldn't keep up with him definitely don't recommend offerup,1
11924,Awesome Finds!,5
11925,Waste of time. Every seller either ignores my purchase requests or tries to scam me. Literally not one thing purchased in 3 months using this. Its obvious the owners just want ad revenue and do not care that we would like to actually purchase things here. Back to Ebay I go. Rather pay $10 more for shipping and ACTUALLY PURCHASE SOMETHING!,1
11926,"App. Won't let me post anything to sell or buy it worked okay for a couple weeks then shut right down. Support said they fixed the problem 4 or 5 times nothing was fixed. Update they still haven't fixed the problem.May10, 2023",2

11930,Says 3 day free trial but go to try won't do it because there is no money on my card but why does there haft to be money on it if it is a 3 day free trial means I don't have to pay today so there don't need to be money on it today,1
11931,when you post something to sell you put in your location so why is it that almost every single person who inquires about a product you are selling asks where you are located and then either says its too far or they flake? location should be highlighted or people should not be able to look outside an area they consider is too far.,2
11932,"I used to love this app, but have since canceled my account and removed it from my phone. I don't feel safe using an app that allows satanists to sell and promote devil worshipping items. I repeatedly reported those users only to be ignored. The sad thing is people unknowingly sell or give away their pets to said satanists. We all know what satanists do with animals and it's not keeping them as loving pets. People aren't supposed to sell animals on there, but they find ways to skirt the rules.",1
11933,"Don't buy anything off the ads. I tried to buy some gym equipment for cheap (my own stupid fault), totally garbage. Took me for $300. Bank couldn't do anything, and the site was non-existent. Beware. If you can't control your ads....how can you control your site? Suck it.",1
11934,sellers are very unresponsive and rarely respond to questions. very difficult to make purchases,1

11959,I like offers up all kinds stuff out there,4
11960,I mean it's OfferUp..overall a great app for people looking for something to buy or sell. But definitely needs a renewal schedule. Items listed that are unresponsive and not selling within a certain time frame should be remove unless manually updated by the user.. having to see things for sale from 1- 5 years ago is kind of b*******. Especially when it's that thing you really need and no one responds.... And no businesses strict rule just personal items and not 2 post Free items unless they are,5

""Dealers"" post the same item 10 times drowning out the regular user who is only posting one item. If Listing would expire after 60 or 90 days or so, that would clear out extraneous items, greatly improving search results. Since the items stay fresh, results will be relevant.",3

As a buyer, sellers do not respond. They always blame it that they didn't get a notification. I end up selling elsewhere.

It seems some sort of mentally ill retards who need medical attention do this type of crazy things.",1
11994,No matter what you do you can't delete your account. It sends you in circles. Scam! All the app does is flood me with ads and stuff for sale from other apps. Don't waste your time... Update. Still has no option to deactivate. Deceptive app. Be aware.,1

12005,"Update: I emailed OfferUp and got a response quickly. I got absolutely nowhere and no help. The app still tells me I don't live in the U.S, I need to remove VPN/proxy and I don't have any of that. Waste of time... I can't even access the app because it keeps telling me that it's only available in the U.S. I LIVE IN THE U.S!!! I also do not have a ""proxy"" or ""VPN"" running... Absolutely ridiculous, guess I'll stick with FB marketplace",1
12006,"Over all fairly easy to use but the cost of making a single item you are selling premium (so it becomes easily viewed by buyers) is per item and too expensive! If you do not utilize their per item premium service, I've noticed your entire selling account goes ""stale"" after a while and I stop getting responses from all buyers! It seems as if their algorithm catches on to the fact that you have not paid for the premium service and basically makes your items invisible to buyers!",2

The majority of things i see are well over a year old which i doubt are still being offered, but I'll try to message people and see what happens, though i don't think I'll ever get a reply.Go craigslist or Facebook marketplace not this.",1
12017,After having an item removed for really no good reason I'm might just stop using the app. If I can't sell a set of pistol sights on here because of the pistol part of it then that tells me this app isn't worth the storage space on my phone.,1

12023,"Auto deletes every ad instantly. I have quite a bit of networking / server gear to sell. I spent all the time taking pics and detailed descriptions. As soon as I post the ads - instantly removed. No explanation. I wasted a couple hours trying to post. Worthless and frustrating because of the over reaching and over reacting automatic filtering. No option to dispute, no option to contact support. Waste of time.",1
12024,Good but not consistent,3
12025,My listing was dissappearing seconds after posting. I paid for promotion & the post never went live - but I was still charged.,1
12026,"I definitely haven't become happier with the app as time has gone on. With the recent addition of pop up adds after every action, I can say my user experience has reached an all time low.

12052,"If I turn off all the notifications, I expect them to be off. Why is the app still spamming me with ""see what local sellers are selling in your area"", pop-ups.

I can't even message a person without watching a 1 minute ad! Yes, 1 minute !?!?! It used to be 5 seconds. But not anymore. They need to fix that ASAP! Besides the ads, the user experience used to be good and smooth. Sometimes, when I'm zooming into photos, it glitches and doesn't let me zoom 90% of the time. Fix this app",2

12070,the app sometimes takes a long time to load,3
12071,"It's all scammers they will post items in your location but then they claim they aren't local but can ship the item. 8 out of 10 listings I tried to buy were fake, all electronics are almost all scams. Hundreds of fake flipper zero listings. Reporting them ends up with your own account being banned for a ""community violation"" because these scammers are paying for promoted listings so OfferUp is making money on each of these scam postings. Buying anything not local on OfferUp is not safe.",1

12081,Bias.,1
12082,"too many intrusive ads make this really annoying to browse on. The biggest problem, though, is the rampant amount of scalpers and especially scammers on this app. no matter how many times I block or report them I still see them.

12085,"Offer up is so much better than Ebay! easy to use website, no scam attempts I had 5 on Ebay and the still. charged a promote it fee after my post was removed by them due to a scam attempt. Offer up you are doing a great job!",5

12094,The texting within the app worked very well. I kept in contact with the buyer and ultimately bought the product. Great experience,5
12095,Why does it always feel like I'm on dial up with this app it's slower than my pet snail,2
12096,Ads have ruined this app. It was ok now it's super slow and buggy,1
12097,Great place to find great deals.,5
12098,the site worked better before the adds now its just another billboard and waste of time. Facebook market place has more use at this point!,1
12099,very convenient,5
12100,best,5
12101,It's a waste of time every time I post something it gets deleted then I have to contact them to post it back up. It's impossible to sell anything cause it doesn't work right. They have no concern of fixing this bug cause this is like the 4th item and still have to go thru this circus. Never had this problem before.,2

12114,Just made an account about a month ago with this company and got banned for no reason. They disabled my account from my email to my facebook due to community issues. Was in the works of purchasing a few car products and selling an exhaust. Well now I'm going to have to use Facebook market place. Never again will I recommend Offerup to my friends and family!,1
12115,charging to post more then 15 posts per month in certain categories. garbage leads.,1

12118,Never used this app üíÄ üòá,5
12119,Great quality well taken care of,4
12120,it never recalls my location. it never recalls the set options of how i want to search. they don't ban or allow you to not see spam listings. they don't respond to lost password emails. you have to make a different account. they spam you with a job market. why would I trust them with my info when they can't do the offer portion correctly. several times I bought items on here but it wouldn't allow me to leave feed back for the person or allow me to say i bought the item. i only have 500 letters.,1
12121,I love this app. OfferUp allows me to make extra money during the week right when i need it. God is goodüôèAll the time.,5

12139,I can't post anything without always being asked if I want to pay to promote my item,1
12140,"OfferUp is now forcing me to sign up with Truyou after years of purchases and sales. I refuse to do so, and now it no longer allows me to contact sellers because of this. It's ridiculous. I shouldn't have to give them all my personal information to buy/sell items",2
12141,This was a great app when this first came out. Purchased everything for my first place on this and sold everything even within a day of posting. It was so fast and effective. Now it posts the same thing too many times and you don't know if something is retail spam. It costs to push your item to be seen above the rest. Haven't been successful in selling anything now for a few years. It's not what it used to be. Very disappointing!,1

12148,It would be nice that after it's been posted for over a year that the posts be removed,5
12149,ever since they merged with Let Go its gown down hill. I got verified and can't even post or receive messages. There are way too many adds! Too many businesses trying to sell stuff. I'm here for a bargain not to waste my time.,1

12157,Great Application!!,5
12158,"Waste of time. Here's my question. Why would you give the seller an option to have an item appraised, for a price that their asking for specifically, and have the option to make an offer on top of it all????? Do you know how many damn times I purchased an item for a specific price that the seller was asking for, but apparently my order was canceled because that particular seller wasn't interested in the price I paid,that he/she specifically asked for?? DUMB IDEAüëéüëéüëé",1
12159,basically I love the idea of offerup and I've had a lot of good experiences. so if I'm rating the idea I'd give it a 3 or 4. I think there's lots of room for improvement. if I'm rating the app itself I'm giving 2. it's sooooo slow. it's quite annoying in other ways also. I don't know where to start. just very bad app design. really needs improvement. if it weren't for the bad app design I'd use offerup all the time. one time my account got deleted and I had no idea why. I lost my history.,2

12180,This is a free app and publicly offered and I have been removed from offerup. I have a high customer of over 100+ rating of 5 stars. Offer up decided to ban me without any explanation. I have been discriminated and racially banned from using this app.,1
12181,I never got the app to open up I sent back their code and it never went through even after,1
12182,Very helpful app,5
12183,I had a nasty woman calling me vile names who blew off our appt and no way to leave her negative feedback with the way the app is set up. It needs some modifications.,2
12184,Two weeks ago I started an account and posted up two items for sell. I received nothing but adds and junk mail. Today my account was closed in violation of terms and conditions with no explanation. I don't understand what went wrong. Offerup was a bad app experience for me.,1

12186,pretty coolim liking it tyvm,5
12187,It used to be fine but now it's bombarded by ads. Searches are often linked to sites amazon and temu. If I wanted to buy from Amazon and temu I'd be on Amazon and temu. Not offer up. Give me a reason to upgrade to premium that doesn't involve the sole purpose of muting ads.,3
12188,"Had an account and was completely verified through all possible channels including Tru you. I had excellent ratings and never talked down on anyone.

I'm going to uninstall. What a shame. Didn't even get to use the app. And after reading some negative reviews about other features and scammers, I don't think i need this kind of app on my phone.",1
12213,"decent enough,I guess. I haven't made many sales,if any,but the promise is there,and it seems to work well for others,so just because my experience sucks doesn't mean it's a bad platform.",4
12214,"dozens of recent offers and ""ask"" messages recently unanswered. Then I noticed a premium monthly subscription offer to get to the top of everyone's inbox. OfferUp filters to persuade users into a paid premium advantage probably is the death of the platform.",1
12215,It was okay until they started putting ads and now I get an ad for every single little thing you watch is annoying and sucks offer of sucks now because of dumb ads,1
12216,my #1 used goods go to app,5
12217,Great,5
12218,The app is a little slow and the only problem isn't even the app it's the people on the app who don't respond to the items when you are VERY interested in the item,3
12219,I really enjoy being able to get back to work with ease and comfort,5
12220,Photos won't load. I installed most recent updates also cleared the data on the app. Pretty much did everything. If I could give negative star rating I would (: So take my one star with honor,1
12221,some sellers picture/description not really what they are selling,2
12222,I don't like the adds,3
12223,all good,5
12224,Great,5
12225,I got one person to respond early on but I haven't heard this thing as much as making noise and days,5
12226,Worst app to sell on,1
12227,Use to be a useful app. Now no traffic. I guess you get the upgraded pay version?,2
12228,This app is being sabotaged. App speed has decreased so significantly that everything takes twice as long. That's just the start. They keep adding ads and notifications that can't be toggled off. Using the search notifications you actually want is a feature so slow that it might as well be broken. This app is a great tool. Hopefully the sabotage ends,1
12229,"Another app ruined by ads that wants you to purchase the premium version. There once was no ads and the app was great, took away the guess work from Craigslist. But now you can't even message a seller without an ad shoved in your face, full screen ad too.",3
12230,a lot of scammers,3
12231,They display adds full screen every time I contact a new person and they lock back button so I can't close it. Desperate move...,1
12232,"Trying to find out which products are ads or not is made intentionally difficult. To see the price of an item you must click on it and lose your place in your scroll. Can't unsubscribe from email spam, clicking unsubscribe takes you an error, ""page not found screen."" Sellers can mislead you about faulty or non woring products and emailing support they will tell you it's your fault the seller lied. Happened to me with my van that ended up having thousands with of issues. BE CAREFUL ON HERE!",1
12233,"App started to fall off a bit. It's loading twice , at times it just doesn't response. Starting to have alot a fakes",2

12235,Too many Ads now. More than in the past. The ads are really annoying.,1
12236,This ised to be an amazing app but now is trash..I uses to make soo much money on the app but now all I get is spammers and people who want me to pay them for meeting me for my item that they wanted ..So basically they want me to pay them for buying my item lmao ..I haven't made any money off the app or had any buyers in over 3 months nows..The app is useless piece of trash now ..,1
12237,not kept up to date most are sold or available but the seller doesn't see a message or doesn't respond,3

12243,Absolutely love it I constantly use this app it is the best thing I the people Iinteract with are awesome always safe trust worthy and transluscent it just works.,5
12244,The share function is not working,2
12245,"The ui is terrible. Littered with weaved into your search, and the display of listings doesnt even display the price unless you click into each one individually. Use eBay, craigslist, or facebook marketplace, it doesnt have intrusive ads and has easily parsable user interface.",1
12246,it's great.. however wish there were notifications when one gets messages,4
12247,Awesome,5
12248,I would say it's serviceable. There are some issues with the app but all in all it has allowed me to turn unwanted items into money so they get my recommendation. It's some of the users on the platform that have lowered the star count from 4 to 3. That's not exactly on Offerup but there it is,3
12249,This app took a turn for the worst. Now they make you pay to post. It's ridiculous. Thank God for Facebook Market! It's free and unlike this app free of scammers.,1
12250,love it,5
12251,Offer Up is a great way to buy and sell items and reaches a lot of people. Only works with smart phones. Wish I could list items with my computer. Works great.,5
12252,"Reviewed it at 3 stars in 2020 and still keeping it at 3 stars. So I continue to do pretty well with buying & selling. The new yearly promotion option is a very reasonable price as I use this app a lot and promoting does help sell harder items. Recently I've found that trying to rate a user at 3 stars or lower is impossible because the way the options for WHY your rating block out the ""submit review"" button. This is a much needed fix that needs to be addressed. Car dealers are also annoying",3
12253,4-29-23 update... Do not download this update! Advertisements take up half the screen unless you pay $8 a MONTH !!! for premium service. REDICULOUS! For an app that doesn't load half the time because of all the intrusive ads. Negative -3 stars... This app just keeps getting worse with each new update! Update: The new app erased all my searches and history. 2-26-22 Update -- The app is now able to delete saved messages! I am revoking privlidges and deleting this ... -2 stars !,1
12254,this guy was very respectful friendly n trust worthy description on item was the same as stated thank you,5
12255,I been having problems with this app shutting down after a few minutes use. It would just shut down and go to the all app sight. What can I do to solve this problem?.,2

12267,very helpful.,5
12268,"You need two categories for cars, a) dealers, b) by owner. Don't allow dealers to list themselves on the by owner category. It's almost impossible to find a by owner car with so many dealers.",2
12269,Over and ocOh o,4
12270,You can find almost anything your looking for.. .as well as decent prices.,4
12271,Decent,1
12272,There is no option to let people know if you are looking for something... And there is no way to boost your items without paying for the service... With lack luster results... And many posts are outdated by years!,3
12273,I can't share items with others,2
12274,find great deals and make some $ selling too,5
12275,Love it,5
12276,I've sold many things on offer up and have only had one bad experience (and that was because I failed to check the person out better before I went and sold something to him)....,5
12277,The ads ruined this app,1
12278,love this app!,5
12279,The app has false flag on my account twice for violating what? Buying and making offer? I thought that's part of the app and I'm 100% buyer. No one looking into my issue. I don't think someone looking into the ticket and looking into the problem. The team need to be proactive providing solutions.,2
12280,Very ship merchandise,4
12281,"The app itself isn't too bad, however there is very little activity and is not updated on what's actually being sold. I reached out to multiple people and never got a response and my messages weren't even seen. Then the only response I got was from a posted item the same day I was on and the person was very responsive, however they were trying to scam me. It blew my mind that they could post things for sale without having an actual card on file that is verified.",1
12282,honest and reliable!,5
12283,"I would recommend this app to everyone üíØ just be careful, with who you're trying to do your deal with. Do your research, to try not to be scamed. But it is a good idea app.üòé",5

12287,ease of use. superb products!,5
12288,bot asking for phone numbers,4
12289,OfferUp is a simple and straight forward app . People unfortunately overthink it's use and operational abilities. ITS ONLY A APP... NOT AN A.I. CHATBOT ! LOL,5
12290,I wish I had an option to delete sold items instead of archiving them,4
12291,"A complete wast of time i tried selling my items on here never made a sale didnt get any views at all.

12294,Can't sort by owners. Too much cars from dealers. No way to sort by owners or private sales. Too much scammers and fraudsters. This app used to be good before but now it's jus as bad as craigslist. Don't deal with fraud by EMAILS. ANY TOO GOOD TO B TRUE IS FRAUD. ESPECIALLY BY EMAILS. & OFFER UP DON'T DO ANYTHING TO ELIMINATE THESE FRAUD. OR PAY U FOR UR LOSTS. SO BEWARE OF SALES FROM EMAILS. OR LISTINGS ON OTHER STATE Everyone we need to find another app. No more offer up for me. Uninstalled.,1

12305,people don't reply,1
12306,This new nonsense of adds is totally beyond stupid. I hope you get the point these adds surpass stupid on every level. Totally destroyed this app. I wish I could leave 0 stars. ABSOLUTELY TRASH! Despise this app now. It used to be pretty cool & I liked it. I have nothing but disdain for this foolishness now.,1
12307,I encourage everyone to stop using this useless app full of ads and bot accounts with no intention of buying or selling anything. Chose Craigslist and or Facebook Marketplace. RIP Offerup.,1
12308,I've had a very good experience with offer up I got jobs and sold my old things on here would recommend,5
12309,80% of the sellers never respond. items are left for sale for years.,1
12310,amazing app a bit slow at time but layout and opportunities are better than other apps the only things I really see wrong with the app are some of the people within it,5
12311,this app CONSTANTLY freezes,1
12312,Didn't even get to post anything before my new account got removed. Shame on you offer up since you have the power to unremoved it but choose not to. I've asked for help but to no avail. I guess it's back to craigslist.,1
12313,Always having problems with the app Always freezing when I want to send messages,1
12314,"too many idle times throughout the day, when checking messages lately it says 0 but takes a awhile to view, overall very slow application.",4

12335,"the app it self is great, surprisingly even most all the people that I have delt with face to face have been great.",5
12336,"Offerup was good but unfortunately it's dead. Can't sell anything anymore, sellers don't respond to messages. Hopefully they can fix it but after waiting for over two years for a fix only to see thing get worse I'm done with this site.",1
12337,There's no point if sellers don't receive notifications when you send an offer so most of them never respond,1
12338,Great place to sell almost anything.,5
12339,"I cant post a single picture without my post being taken down for violating the guidelines. I keep trying to take pictures of electronics (tvs, laptops etc,) and they all get immediately taken down for a violation that doesn't exist.",1
12340,"This app have been around yet it is still clunky and buggy. It will not remember your settings. It keeps going back to 30mile + delivery and no sort. It is a pain to go over and over again to change the settings. Then, it crushes! TERRIBLE!!! Using the other services and apps like Craigslist a lot more just because this app is so bad.",2
12341,it's nice app for thrifty shopping just need take time to find rite buy,4

12343,awesome üëç,5
12344,Glad to finally have a version for my devices but as there are improvements which is good . I will also add that reaching messages or notifications it clearly has issues and nothing seems to speed this up if it makes it at all . This should be considered a huge problem and be dealt with,2
12345,Decent app. lots of items for sale.,4

12350,"Nothing g but scammers trying to get your personal info and address so they can try to come rob you. Every time I post something for sale on this app, all i get is people without photos and without phone numbers on their profile making stupid comments and asking dumb questions about the product I am selling. An hour later, I receive spam calls from several different phone numbers without message left on voice-mail. This has been my experience on Offer Up for the past year. DELETE THIS APP!!",1
12351,Tell people about my laptop,5
12352,I'm traveling to us tomorrow why I can't use the app,1
12353,The app is simple and easy-to-use.,4
12354,reliable!,5
12355,"Whenever there is a problem with an item they don't help to resolve issues. They why do they offer the option for sellers to have ""certified"" items.

12356,Nothing but scammers and bots.,1
12357,You sign up to for a trail subscription but you Dont see it in your app store to cancel. but then you get charge for it anyway and it's nowhere to be found to cancel..reporting to consumers services. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR FREE THE premium TRAIL YOU WILL STILL BE CHARGED EVEN IF ITS NOT IN YOUR APP STORE TO CANCEL BEFORE TRAIL ENDS ..SCAM,1
12358,"I used to love this app. I've used it a bunch. I actually liked the item ads mixed in my search result. But recently there is pop up ads after every item you look at. And you have the wait to exit the first screen and then click x again, this comes up after EVERY item. Now I get if these pop ups were displayed after every 5-10 min being on the app. But it was so annoying and time consuming I didn't want to click on items anymore. If this changes I'd love to use it again.",1
12359,"They added ads. Now an ad pops up after looking at 4-5 posts. They never had ads before, I feel like Offerup is now a cheap mobile game! Super annoying",3

12365,Will not launch. Uninstalled/installed multiple times. Using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.,1
12366,no hassle seller..no run around with pricing or directions,5
12367,hassle to sell and item,1
12368,Asking for my picture and state identification when my friends have the app and never did any of that. Time to delete this tyrannical trash. I like that maybe it's to deter bots and scammers but this is too much asking the honest people to do things because you guys are unwilling or unable to fix the scammers on your app.,1
12369,Don't waste your time. If you don't pay to promote your listing you won't sell it. I had items up and they all had 0 views...it's been many weeks. How did my listing reach 0 people? Garbage app.,1

12374,still a really good app to find stuff . the app still works really good overall no problems with it,3

12382,some of the vehicle for sale are still listed but are more than 5 years old still posted . why are they not removed?,3

I click on it, it opens the app and goes to messages. Now you have to click on the bell to see the notifications but it doesnt work. It says they will appear here and check back later. Too many spam ads where people list an item but tag everything under the sun to get exposure.",1

12421,"New version shows notifications on bell in upper right corner, and it totally sucks. Half the time the notifications don't open and it appears you don't have any. Needs to go back to the way it was, all under inbox, next to messages.",3

12423,"The ads are ridiculous, I shouldn't have to pay to look at this site - and after anytime I send someone a message!",2
12424,Good but too many adds for non-private party items.,4
12425,love it,5
12426,The app is OK. I wish more people use it,4
12427,The April 2023 update is awful! The relocated Notification area is not intuitive and the notifications themselves keep disappearing. Why have search alerts if those alerts don't even work?,1
12428,Used Be awesome now its dullsome,1
12429,I haven't had a problem thus far. You can buy quality used items at a nice price.,5
12430,the search aspect of the app seems to have gotten worse.,4
12431,The best app to buy wherever you want,5
12432,ask for too much private info but it is government not you,4
12433,Now my biggest complaint till date what's up with all the ads you can't even send a message without getting a ad to block the whole screen. I know you need to make money but I'm pretty sure you already get a lot from all the fees and bloody premium version you offer.,1
12434,"App was great forever new download made my phone unstable and crash. Ruined my phone! *** update 4/23/23 they tried to ""fix"" something that isn't broken and now the notifications don't work or show up. Stop fixing what isn't broke your making the app worse. I'm 300+ 5 star seller and can't use the app. Figure it out!",1
12435,where is my refund,1
12436,"It used to be easy to sell items on this app until they started selling ads and charging to boost posts. Now, you barely get views unless you pay to boost.",1
12437,Messages should be available at all times and not dependent on internet connectivity. App is very glitchy. Often have to go to the website to communicate with sellers.,3
12438,This app will help you when your down to stay focused on what matters. Your wallet will thank you later. As a user of both names. In their original app. It has brought blessings through the cheaper deals I've made. Especially during covid. When it really made a difference. Their for. Phenomenal option for your clutter.,5

Edit: now laggy and unusable.",1
12441,"App is complete garbage after the last update. Huge cash grab attempt. There's no way I'd ever pay for OfferUp. Facebook market place and Craigslist are far better now. What a shame, offer up had such promise...",1
12442,great communication,5
12443,"Getting worse. Notifications for saved searches are now screwed up. They appear to be listed under the bell. But if you click on a notification it says that this is where the notification will be- when you get one. And just to piss us off as we try to find our notifications, now they're playing video ads. And offering me the opportunity to pay to not see the ads. As I search for the notifications to buy things on their platform. Not much point in using the app until they fix it.",1
12444,Ads are ruining this app,1
12445,"Last update has seriously torpedoed this app. When you get notifications, a pop window tells you that the notifications will be here but you can't actually see the notifications..just their PSA. You exit out od the PSA and you are back to the hime page....rinse and repeat.",2
12446,I love this place,5
12447,I love the easy transactions and the returns,5
12448,Great place to find things you need a lot of people are pretty honest details on what they have to sale and that is very important these days .,5
12449,near impossible to sell anything. almost everything being sold re-directs you to a corporate store. the older version was people selling to other people.,1
12450,"I cannot send or receive any messages. the app says sent, but it's not. I obviously cannot buy or sell anything on here.",1
12451,"All saved searches are listed under Notifications. Recent update moved Notifications under a bell icon. When I click on the bell, my list of Notifications do not always appear. I either have to keep clicking the bell or restart the app. It's so frustrating. I will delete this review when the issue is fixed.",1
12452,Checked back after 2 years. This app is still a snoozefest. Ghost town old Listings from 4 years ago still up. No buyers or sellers ever answer messages. Ads making it impossible to tell what to buy. What kind of App is so garbage it has ads to buy items elsewhere?? This one that's what.,1
12453,This site sucks moose turds. More scammers than any other sales site I have been on. Would not recommend if they gave gold bars for free.,1
12454,Love this app!,5
12455,First I went to add posts via website. Forced to use the app. Downloaded reluctantly knowing that it sends your info to 3rd party apps. I just spent 45 minutes adding posts. Went in to view them. None were there. What a complete waste of time. DON'T BOTHER USING THIS APP.,1
12456,nothing but positive experience this app I LOVE IT!,5
12457,"Helpful for selling things, of course, the app itself is a little slow.",3
12458,. **Edit to original your review which was also 1 star ‚≠ê. App is worse than ever. The changes you have made in April 2023 make it harder to navigate. Especially in the inbox. Are you trying to make people buy your Premium by screwing up the free app?,1
12459,Easy,5
12460,I cant find any customer service links. I sold an item and shipped it they have received it almost a week ago and still my money says for me to attach a deposit account. I have one attached and have had one for quote some time now. Can you please tell me where my money is it still says pending and i dont know why?,3
12461,I hate the new update. Can't see my old notifications,1
12462,not as much exposure as FB marketplace or eBay,2
12463,"Went from great to zero so quick. Messaging before transaction is offer ups real business model, and they hit s self goal by adding friction/30 sec ads after every message. Uninstalled, get rid of the decision maker before you go down the drain fools.",1
12464,Cool,5

12469,very good experience üëå,5
12470,Photo upload sucks. No cropping fratures,1
12471,Morning,5

12474,Just opened the site so give me a few then ill comment ok!,5
12475,"After providing all information to sell items and posting them, nothing is posted and I have to restart everything.",1
12476,it stops working after a while and won't let you message back. you have to get out completely and then back in the app to finish the conversation,1
12477,"Ya buy something and its NOT AT ALL what your paying for. i bought some silver coins and received PLASTIC chips That read ""SILVER COIN"" on it Talk about being scammed. Good luck getting your money back too. Other things were Either broken or an EMPTY shell .",1
12478,I haven't had any bad experience with this app. and I do recommend it for selling and buying.,4
12479,"This app sucks when it comes to pushing your items. If you post an iPhone for example and someone searches for an iPhone, it will show vendors from Amazon selling the same device for the same or less (refurbished tho). For buyers, great BUT for seller; sucks.",1

12482,Everything's a scammer fake vehicles they don't have the same price as they were asking,1
12483,I do like this app except it looks like you can only rate people who buy and sell.... so you never get a chance to rate the no shows who wasted your time. I wish you were able to rate for that as well.,4
12484,Lame,1
12485,it's awesome,5
12486,It was soooo useful! Recent update makes it way more difficult. Its glitchy now. Ill keep it for a few more weeks and will probably move on if the problems continue.,3
12487,"Garbage app now, it used to work fine until they started updating it and putting in video ads, now I can't even look at any notifications Good job ruining what used to be a good app",1
12488,Slow. Glitchy. Enough to not wanna use anymore.,1
12489,"Remove super old listing. New notification bell is horrible. Put it back next to messages. Sellers barely reply, hidden prices until u click on items are trash.",2

12496,Easy to sell but wish you can search other than zip code I don't know every zip code in the States .....Should make it to where we can write in a city starting to use this app less never can get anything other than that dumb auto-reply And now the updates are even worse can even look at my notification unless there's new ones so when I want to check an address to something I bought I can't open it I now get no new notifications and I will be alerted,1
12497,Last update bone notifications,1
12498,"keeps freezing up, no matter how .any times I restart the phone or app",1
12499,Well the app is great for the most part but then it slowly started lagging a little to now lagging every single time you get on the app .I've rated it before and the app is still slow and lagging as usual. Something really should be done and as far as update the app ALREADY DID THAT . AND ITS NOT MY PHONE ITS NEW AND UNLIMITED DATA PLEASE FIX,2
12500,I'm in love with this app I wish other apps would be more like this one,5
12501,Great,5
12502,"The personalized algorithms prohibit people from seeing newly posted items and the AI misplaces the location of items and when contacting ""customer service"" to ask questions about these issues, their automated response is to permanently ban users that realize these counter-productive controls, claiming a violation of community guidelines, with absolutely no violations of community guidelines. I do not understand why this app operates this way. It's wrong and I've lost dozens of hours&sales",1
12503,This app was pretty cool at the beginning then it got stink. First they charge more to post car for sale and fb marketplace is free. Now everytime I do a search an error come up. And my save search notifications won't show up. I've contacted them regarding the issue numerous of time. And even Uninstall and reinstall. Same problem. I'm going to delete this app for now until the problem is resolved.,1

12515,Stop trying to improve things that don't need it. Like why are we separating the notifications. Just leave it where it was. Why won't it open half the time now too. These last few updates have me using market place more.,2

Shipping on this platform was a new experience for me, as I usually do meetups locally. I was a bit leary in our world filled with nefarious people whom take advantage of everything and everyone. Yet the whole process was smooth and easy, the shipping label was easy to find, print and stick to the carefully packaged painting, arrived two days later, and was paid next day!",5
12536,great app!!,5

12566,Love the app however there should be one improvement made. Ads should expire after 2 weeks with the option to renew it every 2 weeks. This app is filled with old ads that should be deleted by OfferUp since many of the people who posted them are too lazy to do it themselves.,4

12623,This by far the worst app. Use craigslist instead and save yourself from lots of headache.too many adds and bias toward certain groups of people.,1
12624,"Lately I'm not able to rate buyers or sellers. Is any one else having this problem? I got in touch with support, but haven't get a solution yet üòï Besides that, the App is Very Very Slow, looks like didn't get the first push so I try again, then opens a different window. Very frustratingüôÑ",3
12625,Terrible customer service! I purchased The 3 day boost to try to sell my vehicle 3 times and they keep removing my post or the post doesn't show up at all. I tried calling And they don't have a number! I also tried to email them and they haven't got back to me it's already been over two weeks!,1
12626,"WANT ALL ITEMS IN ARCHIVED DELETE ALLl ARCHIVED items GONE, REMOVED!!!!!",1
12627,You illegally let people post on there saying that they have jobs and it's not it's just fishing for information I filled it out multiple times for my husband. And all he gets his crank calls from people saying from other companies trying to dig for his personal information to sell it and make more money no one ever contacting about giving him a job. Don't bother even trying to fill out any of the information for the jobs on this app. They probably get a commission for a person that does this.,1
12628,ooooook,5
12629,I think this is great way to sell things. Although some if the people aren't always serious about purchasing things. But other then that I like the app,5
12630,"nothing ever sells, and I have good items that sell everywhare else. not a single sale from here.",1
12631,great app great way to reduce reuse and recycle,4
12632,UfferUp Easy to use. Set your own time for sales and buying. Gets notifications. New 2023: Crashes and it is slow. Instead of modified for better got slower. Hope they fix it cause it was great when working good.,5
12633,i love this store!! its everyones store,5
12634,The inability to post items via desktop will always keep OfferUp low on my list of preferred platforms.,2
12635,"3rd time not a charm. We signed up, Posted an item and bombarded with ""available"" replies within 1 minute. nothing has changed at offer up.",1

12641,it's great,5
12642,it's been a wonderful experience you alright with me five-stars upper,5
12643,Site doesn't make any sense. You will get kicked off for listing that are not against community guidelines while at the same time seeing items that are clearly against community guidelines stay posted.,1
12644,you can't get any customer service.,2
12645,Would give it zero star items I have don't sell people selling don't answer don't know if it's legit,1

12651,"Terrible for sellers. You need to compete with bot accounts that spam thousands of posts per hour, which results in your posts being washed out to the bottom of the feed. This is not only annoying to sellers, but for buyers who want to look at other items, but can't because of all the spam posts.",1

12669,very good,5
12670,"I have perfect ratings and have used the app for years. Recently I've been shadow banned without any notice or explanation. I figured it out because I don't get any messages from buyers and no one sees messages I sent to them. Why the passive aggressive approach? OfferUp should be more transparent about its shadowbanning policy. Users should be notified if they have been banned, and they should be given an explanation for the ban.",1
12671,"It's decent, but I find Facebook marketplace much more effective at getting valid responses. I have had items sit on here for months as opposed to hours being sold on Facebook market place, without haggling. all in all, it's good but needs improvement.",3

Update: Now they've decided that people NEED TO WATCH ADS TO USE THE APP, which barely works, notifications are hit and miss. A lot of times you actually need to open the app and go to notifications to get your messages from people. Hot stinky garbo",1
12673,it's for sure a better way to put $$ in my pocket then what I used to do!!,4
12674,app is slow,3

12676,Fabulous app I have met some wonderful people through this app and was able to eliminate a lot of clutter.Thanks offer up.,5
12677,not enough traffic takes forever to sell things,2
12678,Don't use this app. I sold an item and shipped it according to their policies. The buyer received it and was happy. They cancelled the order anyway and told me it wasn't their problem. They ripped me off. Don't use it,1
12679,Too many ads freezes a lot. Notifications are slow. Too many fake users / profiles I deleted it didn't like it .,2
12680,Love this app.,5
12681,Scum bags buying out there competition then switching to a paid platform way to go monopolizing at all scales,1

12686,"No expiration date on posts. Most of what's on this app is a year or more old. Useless. The app is great as long as you don't need any help with anything. Their customer service / help system is completely automated, and emails are canned responses that don't read or address anything you send to them. I was trying to tell them about a technical flaw in their system but all I get is a canned response to restart my phone.",1
12687,EASY USE... GREAT JOB OF BLOCKING SCAMMERS!,5

12691,Can't acces I have VPN can't shut it down! Horrible!,1
12692,"This app is garbage. It seems like alot of cars being sold with ""no titles"" here. When you finally do find what seems to be a real seller they never message you back. I could build a car faster than I could buy one on this app. My advice? Look on Craigslist like everyone else",1
12693,"App will allow ads that play sound out of my phone speaker. This is a MASSIVE breach of trust. Disrupting silence in a library or meeting means I get called out for BS I didn't even click on! Just scrolling past the ad will blast music. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Going to Facebook marketplace. How bad is your crapp when Zuckerberg gets my eyes with a zero dollar acquisition cost!?

12699,great app,5
12700,so far this has been the easiest site to post stuff that I've ever been on. When they did an update about a year ago now it's fine but don't fix something that isn't broke.,5
12701,App laggy today. Button pushes not responding!!!,1
12702,great site easy to use,4
12703,"starting to be to many bogus ads, and sellers",2
12704,great place to sell stuff in town,5
12705,My issue with this is local pickup is just like Facebook marketplace with face to face contact. This isn't an option with 3rd shift schedule. Which is why ive left it. Why don't they have delivery? Or payment thru the app for porch pickup.... ???? Won't be using this either with these limited options. Haven't sold a single thing and uninstalling it.,1
12706,When I go to enter in my payment method it asks for a code that is txt to u and before I can type it all in it goes off.,3
12707,"Can't sell whatever you want. They block people from selling certain items, these items are legal to sell. What's the point of this turd of an app?",1
12708,Banned my account and didn't say why. I only had two fish tanks posted for sale. I hadn't even messaged anyone on my account. I really don't understand why my account was removed or why they can't tell me what I did wrong.,1
12709,2 3.3.3,5

12713,"Riddled with scammers that are able to verify their account emails and phone numbers fooling this app. The support is absolutely wretched, they will take a week to respond to you outside of the automated email response. Use at your own risk, I strongly recommend avoiding this situation",1

12719,"I have had an offer up for so long, but some of my messages don't go through, and the ads are outrageous.",3
12720,Very nice app with the only exception that some items are very old dating from 1 yr to 5 yrs. It should have an expiration on the items for sale and a reminder to renew them. Also is frustrating that you can't see the price unless you click on the picture.,2
12721,I bought a brand new for cheep it was easy,5
12722,Exceptional app!,5

12730,"FIRST TIME USERS BEWARE!!! They have ads that look like legit pages for the app that lead you to fraudulent and scam pages that compromise your card information.

12731,You pay $7 for promotion and they don't promote it after my purchase of a promotion I figured I would get more views total opposite I can't even find my car anymore I searched with three different phones I went through the filters I can't see my car before I paid I saw my car 799 for a promotion and I only got one view in 24 hours and 111 views before I purchase that promotion so let's play games here with these guys I will not buy a promotion again don't buy a promotion it's a scam,2
12732,"App is good and does what is intended, but notifications suck.

12739,Very much professional. And guides you perfectly. Even answers questions.,5
12740,very great. alot of great things for a good deal.,5
12741,this app has made me some good money in such a short period of time! I was using a different app it does not even compare!! Fast forward to the present. When you stuff a greedy pig till it explodes! Do the owners and programmers who run this s...show actually go on and pretend to be the average schmuck that uses it? Seriously selling your soul publicly is hardly an upgrade. Thanks for stealing our info selling us as a product and then asking us to pay you for it! Want to be seen? More$$$! Done.,1
12742,"It's a shame. I used to love this app, but every since they merged, it's made me realize I have to let it go. DEVELOPERS - TOO MANY ADS! Let me repeat TOO MANY ADS.

I'm giving the app 1 more month before I uninstall it.",1

12745,I think buying off of offer up is great. It's my favorite place to shop.,5
12746,Is it just me or does anyone get ads that take over the entire screen where you have to wait a few seconds for the 'close' option to appear? I didn't get this before. Perhaps it's the new update? I like the app but a bit slow and lags.,3
12747,Haven't been able to sell anything. Even with the 3day free trial,3

12759,"This is a very valuable resource for me. Been actively using it for more than a year. Do see some improvements overtime, like the frequently freezing issue.

12760,working cooling room/ I recommend the seller.,5
12761,There is no customer service to help you when the app adds pictures to your post and then refused to upload your listing due to that extra photo it adds. Limit of 12 photos but yet it is uploading 13?? Sent numerous messages to OfferUp with no response. There wide is to check the FAQ WITH VERY LIMITED QUESTIONS. No answer there. Really FRUSTRATING when posting or if any at all will even upload. I just get upset after WASTING my time taking pictures editing etc. And then it refused to add.,1
12762,great App but they are about to start charging people for listing items. Guess it's back to Craigslist for me if that happens,5

12769,Ok,5
12770,"My beef is that I should be paid as soon as I mailed off the product. I now understand it will get paid 2 days after the person gets the item. As far as I'm concerned, I will not be using this app again for anything. I'm the one taking all the risks. I had to put out money to have this item packed. It is going 3000 miles across the continent. When I sell something, I usually want my money first before I let anything go. Then, if he had any problems, then we could take care of them. CHOW!",1
12771,Awesome app,5
12772,I miss letgo. You guys ruined a great thing. The ADS ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS!?!? also how come the prices aren't on top of the photos anymore? And JOBS!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME. AND THE ADS ALL OF THE ADS WHAT ON THE IN THE ACTUAL (trying not to swear so my opinion doesn't get silenced for being vulgar) but seriously and the notifications aw geez seriously somehow you guys absorbed a very cool ap every possible comparable ap and made a nightmare of ads notifications and impossible to navigate settings,1

12787,it works.,4
12788,Great App. It's very frustrating when people are allowed to post something and it's out of date or they no longer respond to possible interested buyers. Offer up needs to check in with sellers to even see if they are still selling item. Also there are Car Sale companies that are advertising with drones on here. They act like they are actual private owners when they are Not. It's a waste of time. And Time = Money.,3
12789,good deals,5
12790,Great.,5
12791,Dead. No one uses this app anymore and it's mostly paid services. Just use Facebook marketplace.,1
12792,Almost every person trying to sell their Playstation 5 at a reasonable price is a scam artist on this app. Don't trust those who have suddenly moved out of the area they claim to live in. Or those who suddenly want extra shipping money to buy one from them. I have yet to meet an honest person on this app. Why are the scam posts not taken down?,1

12794,"1. Spam, scam, spam, scam infested. 2. Stores put misleading prices. Only then you realize its down-payment.

Listings should be automatically DELETED after a week like CL does.",3
12800,This is an awesome app,5
12801,love it,5
12802,I love OfferUp I think it's a great way for people to get rid of old items I never use or do not need any longer and it's a great way for the buyer to find hard to find item or that are inconvenient or that the store don't have in stock so great job offer up I appreciate this service and it's wonderful in my opinion I did have an item or two taken down due to using the word vintage but to me anything over 10 years old is vintage LOL but other than that I'm totally satisfied with OfferUp,5
12803,Have been a paying customer for years and now all of a sudden being hit with constant ads. Just to send or open a new message I have to watch a 30 second ad. That along with all the ads I have to scroll through when making a search for an item. Seriously considering just deleting ap and forgetting about it.,1
12804,Not good as it use to be.,2
12805,Good,5

I sold an item threw offer up ( my first time selling) I shipped the item they got it and they paid for it. However I never got the money for it. Offer up kept my money. And are doing nothing to fix it. Should should be ashamed of yourselfs for stealing from honest hard working people! U deserve negative Starz!!!,1

Also, out of all the selling apps I have used, Etsy, Mercari, etc., this Offer UP App has the rudest women on there. Three times I was cussed at and accused of being a scammer. I had to report one lady and block her. She wouldn't stop. Then she started threatening me over and over. I have never had any harassment on the other apps. So...........? I, also, have not sold one thing on Offer Up. Fix your APP!",1
12827,Love it,5
12828,nobody messages back about the stuff forsale,1
12829,Good  Good,5
12830,This ain't letgo.,2
12831,"For a used item, I am impressed.Seller is honest.And this app made me feel safe in terms of paying online.",5
12832,No real offers yet. you have to pay for more exposure.,2
12833,"Won't let you zoom. Doesn't show prices unless you open a listing. Wants to spam you with push messages all the time. Recommends stuff you're not interested in as ""messages"". Has paid ads for places like Walmart instead of just listings from people like you're expecting. Overall it's okay, but they've made some really annoying decisions. Why would you disable zoom on pictures for a site that sells products? What a ridiculous decision!",2
12834,Always a problem,2
12835,"i LOVED ""OFFER UP"" but now you have to pay taxes for items sold between individuals!!! The beauty and idea behind the app was to sell things you don't use but want to ""offer up"" because they have worth to other people for some cash! YOU RUINED IT! looking for the next app that gets it and keeps it right!",2
12836,"Great app and usually works. 5 stars - 1 But I'm unsure it's fair to make users pay for ""real estate"" or priority in searches instead of free relevant searches like most other third party seller apps.",4
12837,"Horrible App, and the people behind it. Deleted my account for no reason specified. BEWARE OF THIS APP!",1
12838,Clunky search function and too many ads,3
12839,I can't even sell a kidney or part of my liver on here? My organs. My choice.,5
12840,Nothing but spam so far. poorly translated bids for less than half of the asking price ext. The app requested a review.,2
12841,Don't use em for shipping they don't protect your package if you use their system unlike mercari which guarantees delivery they Basically stole the package and didn't do nothing about it mercari would have opened a investigation and got my money back now I'm out 170 I even stop selling on here NOT A TRUSTED APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD DO NOT USE THEY DON'T PROTECT THE BUYERS OR THE SELLERS Go to mercari they're much safer,1
12842,My god what trash. Takes WAY too long to post something and then this garbage won't let you edit the post. Don't bother,1
12843,I use the app often but its very glitchy laggy and slow i will still use but just wish they would fix it,3
12844,What once was a really good app has been turned into a nearly unusable ad-filled slow running disaster. On the verge of deleting this garbage fire from my phone and never using the mobile version again it's so painful to use. I don't understand how something that was so good before can be reduced to being something so horrible,1
12845,the rubber gloves I purchased are very cheap. I go through altleast 6 pairs a day or more ü§®,3
12846,"Pointless and unhelpful. Never a single hit, but fb works just fine... waste of space.",1
12847,Worst selling experience of all methods,1
12848,Worst buying service out there. Seller didn't ship item and there is no way to get service help through offer up. Stay far away.,1
12849,"This app has been trash lately. I contacted support and they seemed like they were about to address the issues I'd contacted them about, and then they just went into silent mode. I'll give this app 1 more month to get it together. After 1 month, and I still see no changes, then I regrettably will have to delete the app and move on. I used to like this app, so having to delete it would suck. But, oh well, it is what it is. And now forcefully loudly playing stupid adds too? Goodbye offerup.",1
12850,I love this app,5
12851,What has happened to this app? It is no longer works well. It keeps stopping and closing. I now rate it a no star. Why am I force to rate this before I can post it.,1
12852,Great,5
12853,"Had not touched it in weeks, then suddenly I was kicked off the platform, with no explanation or way to contact them. The contact link in the email telling me I was somehow violating the service was a web hook that opened the app that I am locked out of, super brilliant. No explanation, no way to contact and a rude email telling me off, no thanks. The app has issues with messaging and the ads were overwhelming.",1
12854,I shouldn't have to pay to get my ireams seen.,1
12855,Good,5
12856,it's April now OfferUp is even weaker I got one view of the stuff I posted and like 10 hours before I used to get hundreds of use on all my stuff OfferUp sucks your best bet is go to the flea market,1
12857,old posts should be removed,4
12858,Everything works now except new annoying update message every time I make an offer,1
12859,buries your items,1
12860,get my house fix from offerup stay connected,4
12861,Need much better protection for buyers . Offer up has too many scammer. Really left a bad taste .....poor support as well. Many not use this app again due to these problems.,1
12862,Like a personalized garage sale! love it üòÄ,5
12863,Hated it.,1
12864,Cool app very much,5
12865,my only thing is I hate when someone puts something for free on here and it's not.,5
12866,Make money!,5
12867,too many people on here trying to scam you. Offer up doesn't do a very good job at trying to get rid of these people. The app is really only good if you buy something local. I don't recommend buying anything that has to be shipped. it's more than likely someone trying to scam you.,1
12868,awesome,5
12869,it worked great,5
12870,"Can't shop for items heavier than 20 lbs through OfferUp shipping. Not sure why they even allow those items to be listed, but when you buy it/put in an offer, the seller ""can't"" send you the item, and ask you to pay outside the app, removing the buyer protections.",2
12871,Need for media sharing in messaging so we don't have to give our personal numbers to shared needed videos or pictures.,3
12872,Can't get on to offer up ap,1
12873,I don't know why but it doesn't show me new posts its always posts that are a week or 2 old sometimes even months .,3
12874,"I have good business from this app, I like offerup instead of Facebook marketplace. I sell a good amount of items weekly, but the only thing I don't like is there is so many cheap asses on here that hound you for even lower price whenim already selling new tools for half the price retailers so it gets old when people send straight disrespectful offers. I had a pressure washer that was new in the box and had it priced at $220, it retailed for $529 and people are sending me $100 offers",4
12875,"Used to be good, but they let all sorts of scammers post stuff. Too many ads too. And now you have to hire a lawyer to figure out what they demand you agree to.",1
12876,"A good, easy to use platform.",5
12877,"Very slow on my device, Galaxy A7 lite. Also Has too many ads",1
12878,This is the best app to sell and buy stuff. A+,5
12879,"It is the best way to buy and sell great, new and used items!",5
12880,Killer,4
12881,"What can I say but the facts ,when looking to buy or seal its quick and easy to get a seal or purchase",5
12882,the application some tolimes stop working and can not get to the replys from sellers,4
12883,i keep having accepted offers canceled for non shipments,1
12884,"9/1/20- Missing 2 main features. 1st quick save is easy to save but several clicks to bring up. There should be an option to promote to main menu ribbon. Notifications on recommended items are also buried within the app with no option to turn off. 4/6/23- way too many ads now combined with freezes while messaging make this app virtually unusable. Oh well, app was good while it lasted.",1
12885,"works gr8, smooth app all around",5
12886,the best,5
12887,So far so good !,5
12888,Too many young people screwing up the whole app they will not tell the truth about what they have what they don't have they run you around all day they make you wait for phone calls they don't text you back it's ridiculous this happens to be very good I used to really really really enjoy it not anymore,2
12889,"customer support is zero from me, while it is also a problem to make promotion for my listed item despite adding my card as default on the app, and also for my Google play/pay.",1
12890,alot of items are still posted when they are sold and never deleted some items were posted anywhere between 3 months to a year ago the app should have a period of time to when old items should be deleted,3
12891,Ok,1
12892,Worst lagg on this update then ever before,1
12893,this app used to be very good but when they merged with letgo this app is horrible.,1
12894,Good place to sell unwanted stuff & purchase stuff.,4
12895,"Full of scammers.... I reported 1 person for suspicious activity, then I got banned from the app lol. Don't buy here",1
12896,aqu√≠ no encuentras ofertas,1
12897,"As a seller, it's pretty easy to use. The one major issue, is the customers. They're always low-balling and or flaking out after agreement was made.",3
12898,Good.,5
12899,"love the app. but would like it if the items were listed by the age of posting always, not just with a specific searched item.",4
12900,I really enjoy this app I always find what I need,5
12901,"Time to uninstall this app they are now charging 99 cents per post, this used to be an amazing Marketplace now it's flooded with the ads and corporate greed, you only get three free posts per category, and they want $0.99 per post after that what a joke, Facebook Marketplace is a much better and free experience",1
12902,"I'm getting spam emails saying I'm getting a prize. The prize is an item I've viewed here. So either OfferUp is selling my browsing information to spammers, or they're not properly vetting their partners.",1
12903,Too many scams on this sight. I posted one item and have had nothing but BS,1
12904,easier than ebay !,5
12905,Still trash,1
12906,It's so glitchy & slow. Delayed messages have cost me sales üôÅ...this app needs an update asap!,2
12907,great deals,5
12908,The worst for sale app you can't verify to save your life,1
12909,Not good anymore now I am constantly trying avoid hitting a add,1
12910,Ok .,5
12911,It's gone down hill. Can't get any help when needed. To many bogus sellers.,5
12912,"Once I receive the code, I get to enter the first two numbers then the closes, and I have to start all over again, so I can never sign in to save anything. Please fix it!",1
12913,regularly closes and or freezes unexpectedly ...and customer service is lacking,3
12914,"App almost always says ""sorry, something went wrong"".",1
12915,"it's been good, can't find somethings sometimes",4
12916,so far so good.,4
12917,Free offer became $39.95 a month...,1
12918,I like that it's still free to list your products to sell,5
12919,its nice for buying and selling but the app itself is poorly designed and runs very slowly in my experience.,3
12920,Get local stuff for cheap.,5
12921,lots of annoying people and messages. no one buys. it's a weird app. continuous spam. I shut notifications off . cha ching constantly for an old spammer,1
12922,$39.99 ?? Not happening.. read the fine print before you agree. Luckily I didn't accept and deleted app,1
12923,I have been on offer-up 10 years and have sold thousands of items all across the world. It is a great app for small businesses .,5
12924,Won't open any thing for sell up.,1
12925,"The app is useful for local buying and selling. It has potential to grow. Inability to do listings for selling using a computer is a very very serious limitation. Not easy to effectively navigate and edit item description using the mobile interface. Also, messages seem to clog up very often and other party don't receive it for days, even if the App says ""Delivered""....this has been the most frustrating part for me. Please fix the message delivery delay and support selling using computer.",2
12926,"Seller was dishonest and Offerup washed its hands of it. No action taken to stop seller and could not rate seller since they did not post sale. not able to warn other buyers of seller dishonest behavior. offerup not acting ethically. Will not use this platform again, deactivated my account.",1
12927,O l,5
12928,I HAVENT sold one thing on here 0ver 100 looks but no messages ya right,1
12929,Excellent,5
12930,These things work real good,5
12931,Sux stupidest way to sell stuff people don't respond and stuff is been up forever just forgotten about by seller . People don't care on this site waste of your time,1
12932,responses seem to be fewer since OfferUp has joined with letgo it seems. one downfall in my opinion is the failure of the site to allow direct phone numbers to be added to your posting details.,5
12933,"OfferUp's okay, it would be better if items that have been for sale for over 6 months were taken off automatically",4
12934,"I actually like the app, except somewhere recently they now include ads for gaming, etc. Even worse, they lock you in until the close x posts. What do AZ waste of my a good be app. I will be uninstalling.",1
12935,"Since one cannot post ads on OfferUp from a PC, I am forced to give this app a one star vote. Sad...really sad.",1
12936,Great source for bargains,5
12937,"Offer up is almost non existent here on the east coast, Delaware, Maryland. And now they want to charge listing fees like their eBay or something. Ebay's nonsense is justified by the larger audience. Can't really justify paying a nonexistent app to advertise my stuff to nobody....besides this, you can't even edit listings on a computer after like 5 years of using this. Everyone trying to squeeze out the money but don't offer nothing in return.",1
12938,worked out very well for both of us.,5
12939,I like offerup. it is a nice app,5
12940,Letgo was better.,2
12941,After 2022 is slowest app in my phone. Can push a link and have my breakfast until it open,1
12942,RIP OFFERUP IT WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED MY POSTINGS DON'T POP UP WHEN I SEARCH FOR THEM TO SEE IF THEY'RE POSTED. I'M GUESSING THIS IS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO TRY THE PREMIUM OPTION OR PROMOTE OPTION,1
12943,Great app to buy and sale ltems easy to Use.,5
12944,My OfferUp is not letting me post anything,1
12945,It sucks because in the end it only gives you the option to say where/who you sold the item. It doesn't let you say if you donated it since it was on here for over a year or that you finally tossed it. Things don't sell very well even when priced cheap.,2
12946,App is slow and glitches. I have used OfferUp for years but I can't even archive a item. It just reappears. When meeting up with people it often says oops somthing went wrong. That's not good when you are in the middle of a sale. Seems like they gave up on fixing this app or making it better.,1
12947,I hate being forced to search an 80 mile radius in cars and trucks. Either it's 25 miles which isn't far enough or it's 80 miles which is too far. I'm not trying to drive 80 damn miles for a vehicle. Especially when I don't have one. Also a lot of the postings are years old. Why can't you get rid of the old ones and keep it freshly updated. It's worse than marketplace.,1
12948,Nice,5
12949,"This app has been crashing on my phone for over a year now. And it's a shame that they are monopolizing the online sales market platforms alongside FB marketplace and eBay, which are all going downhill.",2
12950,Super,5
12951,"Easy way to impulse shop!! Just wish navigating was like it was on Letgo. Click, click, swipe Good to go...",5
12952,Fun and very easy to use!,5
12953,"There's little buyer protection, which is a BIG factor in these types of online shopping apps. I had sent the team an email, under 3 days like they had asked, and it's been months without any sort of reply. I wish they'd tell me they have at least received my email. Be very careful with this app. I hope they help you with any issues because they sure haven't helped me.",3
12954,app is slow and crashes often,1
12955,appears that k9's are being posted as a cage or dog toy often,4
12956,"definitely not a great platform, still useful though",1
12957,"the ads are annoying. there are so so so many scammers. there also very few users, so you can't reach many people for your sales. letgo was so much better. I was shocked when they merged and kept OfferUp system.",1
12958,The man came & showed me the Neon sign....paid him cash...brought it home....worked like a charm! brilliant üí°,4
12959,"It's definitely bad idea to limit free listings for the sellers. Instead of this, you should focus on older postings that were listed several months - or even years- ago.",1
12960,"Way too many ads there are more ads per screen than product for sale. Let go should have never sold out, it was much Superior then garbage OfferUp",1
12961,"Really nice, went above and beyond to help me understand how to work this pump.",5
12962,"I have never successfully bought something on here. Every time they just, never ship it, and you cant leave negative feedback because the transaction gets cancelled. Just awful, all around.",1
12963,"some glitches and tons of stores and company's posting their inventory at low $100 prices, but when u call its really $900+... little annoying",4
12964,"There have been changes to the app that makes it slower. It's not easy to delete old items easily (basicallynot at all), just archive or unarchive them. Accounts become cluttered with old stuff.",2
12965,Messaging Not Working,3
12966,"Worst app ever. It's really slow. It takes a long time for it to switch from screen to screen. Forget trying to edit your post, make sure you have 30min to waste to fight with the app's snail speed.",1
12967,they dont need Access to all your pictures to make a post to sell something it's a 0 for me,1
12968,Worth it,5
12969,I love offer up to buy and trade all my surfing nececities.,5
12970,Offer up is now trash. What used to be a great app to buy and sell has now turned into an ad infested scam downloading virus infecting land fill,1
12971,Constantly freezing,1
12972,üëç,5
12973,Yass,5
12974,Great üëç,5
12975,Great example of love my way of rrrrrd honest value of life in general,5
12976,I have made a couple of purchases on this app. Seems to be legitimate and very user friendly. love it.,5
12977,great site to sale.item,5
12978,Fake adds & Scammersü§® are taking over.,3
12979,it just makes anything to sell s I much easier,5
12980,My account has been removed from Offerup for supposedly violating Community guidelines and posting rules but when I asked what I did to violate them I was given no answer just another email saying it was removed. The only thing I've done is lower the price on an item I was selling.....Do not use this app customer service is of no help,1
12981,"It used to be a great app until they added the premium version. Now, i am forced to listen to ads while i look through the app, and it cuts my music on the background. I think it's time to delete the app from my devices and close my account.",1
12982,Great app to help sell your stuff.,5
12983,garbage,1
12984,I love this up for individuals who sales items but lately there are so many other corporations smelling stuff that I don't like it. üòû I thought that it was for individuals like me to sell not corporations or businesses and I got a little disappointed or discouraged to get in the app and look for items to buy... just my opinion,3
12985,My old account was deleted. I reached out numerous times and nobody was able to resolve the issue. Offerup was once a good app to use; not anymore.,1
12986,because it's simple and works,5
12987,Nobody actually runs this site?? 60 to 70% of the sellers are too lazy to respond and follow through on a transaction and there's no repercussions from the administration of the site? This is way way worse than eBay. Buyer beware. You have a very high percentage of not even being able to communicate with a seller let alone get the item for the price the seller is asking. Plus over half the items on here never sell for years and even when it does the seller is too lazy to unlisted it. What a joke,1
12988,fast and friendly,5
12989,Great!!!!!!!.,5
12990,LOVE TO SELL AN BUY...,5
12991,"Items 3 years old. The worst part of this as a buyer or seller is that post DONT EXPIRE. How does it make sense for post to be online for more than 2 weeks, or more than even a month? Half those users aren't even active anymore and yet their item is still online. This is what will be the downfall of those app, it makes it completely useless and frustrating for both buyers and sellers. But go ahead and keep trying to make money with promotions costing almost what the item is worth.",1
12992,"Glitchy and constantly crashes. Takes forever to load each page and preferences. You'd figure as long as the app has been out they could have gotten it working better. Still has ads posted from years ago. Clean up the mess, free some space and it might be better. It's as if they don't care whether it works or not.",2
12993,"just had my first e-commerce experience with them, and i must admit it was made so much easier and simple than i expected it to be and in a less then week period sold off what i thought had no marketing value for more than expected",4
12994,Keeps crashing,1
12995,"Worst app ever. Blocked 2 times from the account because of violation guidelines, but they don't explain what was the problem. I could not make the purchase. Wish I could put minus 5 stars",2
12996,to many ads,3
12997,"It used to be a very good app. It seems it's no longer friendly user. You type in truck's for sale and it sends you nothing but dealerships and cars. I want truck's sold by people. Not used tires, dealerships, or scammers. Kept the app on my phone a few months longer. I will be deleting it. No longer user friendly for regular people.",1
12998,Junk. Posts stay around for months to years. You will be contacted by about 100-200 scammers before you get a real person wanting to by your items..,1
12999,wonderfull,5
13000,awesome,5
13001,really quick and easy,5
13002,"this is a great website, you can find anything you want with a good price and you can even make friends. I like it.",5
13003,I sold something on offerup and it has been more than a week and I still have not received my payment. The whole system is so effed.,2
13004,It's an ok app. Rules about drugs and weapons are pretty sketchy. Dietary supplements get taken down and some being ok for example. Then the app owes you money and gives you a boot instead. This is the only way I can get the message to you. My money was not deposited today and I can't access my account.,1
13005,cool app. Dont never have to use ebay ever again,5
13006,not easy to use and .. I have nor been able to sell anything there.. it seems everything has to be super cheap I see alot of people having things for sell there but it's like garage sell..,1
13007,i like it alot because family gets rose up- being put higher than nothing,5
13008,They said I'd get 15 free post's for cellphones and accessories this month and guest what? It still says I have to pay to post. DO NOT INSTALL THEY ARE LIARS AND THE APP IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.,1
13009,thank for u 4the app,4
13010,I've been using offer up for over 5 years in the last 2 months it barely even works so so so so slow did i mention how slow this app is now it's almost impossible to post a bunch of stuff at one time won't upload pics says oops error all sorts of issues I've literally tried uninstalling an reinstalling thought it was my phone reset a bunch of time nothing worked also the ads take over the app it's almost not worth it to use this platform anymore offer up please please fix,1
13011,Add a feature where I can renew my listing plz..,1
13012,"Downloaded for faster notifications. Now I'm bombarded with constant ads, many are from scam sites! Having to reset my search parameters every time I go in to search is absurd, not to mention 5+ year old ads still existing. If I were interested in shipping, I'd be on Amazon. If I wanted to see constant ads, I'd be on Facebook. Huge letdown. Update 3/23 - it's managed to get worse, and they think $10/month is reasonable for the ad free version. Thanks for the laugh, but no. Uninstalled.",1
13013,All posts are deleted within seconds with no reason. No emails came to explain why or what to do. Wasted much time posting different ways and all rejected. Didn't work for me.,1
13014,Great App,5
13015,it's Awesome.,5
13016,I can't see how just a description of a vehicle could go against guidelines and be removed. Not to mention while trying to create one it jumps around. I loved the app in the beginning. Has been disappointing the last year or so. I delete an ad and still get a ping. 1 star.,1
13017,I like the app but a little to many commercial links,4
13018,Good,5
13019,"Mort products are ads instead of actual items sold through offer up. And thanks to that, the buying and selling experience is the worst I have experienced.",1
13020,"After update today, messaging system glitch, double responding to more than one conversation at a time resulting in both people coming to get the same item. Caused major issues. Please fix app's messaging system.",1

13023,easy to use!,5
13024,"nice place to buy, sell, browse, and consider. and now the jobs posting category! you can do local, or shipping. I have used both. no problems. actually meet new people too. give it a try!",5
13025,It has its glitches and message is delivered slower.,3
13026,offer up should perform seller item checks quarterly. some people post & forgot then don't answer if item is still available or not.,3
13027,App wont open,1
13028,"Buying something on this garbage app is like pulling teeth. Sellers will routinely ignore offers or just straight-up cancel them, even if it's a full price offer. OfferUp doesn't even bother removing listings that are YEARS old. Don't waste your time. Edit: Finally had someone accept my offer. They didn't ship the item after 6 days, so the transaction was auto canceled. Zero accountability for terrible behavior. I've never had so much trouble trying to give someone my money.",1
13029,Making money.,5
13030,nice,5
13031,Great!!!!,5
13032,"I used this app daily but today it logged me out and closed my account for violating community guidelines? Not sure how posting shoes and bathing suits did that. No email, no way to contact, no background. Just cancelled.",1
13033,Groovy,4
13034,I like this app,5
13035,Love it everything about it GREAT APP.,5
13036,lots of adds,3
13037,"I love the app, but oneajor down fall to the whole app, is how slow and unresponsive the app is, noatter which phone I use or which carrier I have, I always seem to be touching the se buttons again and again before I get a response from the system, or for a page to load, it drives me crazy!",2
13038,You are restricting items to be sold. Unless people pay you extra. So items can be viewed by more people. If they don't pay you. You're kinda put a hold on items so people cannot see them. Unless they pay you. You are deceiving the public. It looks like offer up is owned by foreigners. They are nothing but bunch of crooks ripping off people.. OfferUp has fake accounts those fake accounts will try to buy your listed items showing that there are people interested . Later the fakes disappear.,1
13039,"These full page ads out of nowhere are RIDICULOUS. Make money sure, add in banners somewhere. There were already ads that were placed like item listings, there but unobtrusive. This style of advertising though?? Completely ruins the app and you WILL lose users. $8 a month or use a ruined app? I'll use Facebook marketplace first.",1
13040,Never have sold anything. I have brand new electronics cheaper than walmart and bestbuy. Still nothing. Sometimes get a message weeks after I already sold on ebay. Seems like a waste of time.,1
13041,super user friendly,5
13042,Opera makes it very easy to advertise your asset,4
13043,I like the convenience of the surch however people don't remove their items and are on for months or 2 years still coming up in the surch. I like Let Go better too bad they merged,3
13044,It keeps glitching or freezing on the load pg. It's the only app on my phone that does this,2
13045,Click on something and it stays in a small box on your screen.,2
13046,New user Agreement is total trash. Can open messages without upgrade $$$ back to Craigslist. Do not recommend offer up anymore.,1
13047,the best way to find out what you want,5
13048,Love it.,5
13049,Sucked won't let me sign in have not used app in years,1
13050,Always a good app,5
13051,"Doesn't allow a person to delete one's account. Person / persons has no control of personal account, offerup has the ability to steal identities.",1
13052,I have been waiting for a refund for months. Offer up does not honor their 2 day purchase protection claim.,1
13053,"I keep getting error message saying my words aren't acceptable to post in response to lady selling the multiple gas cans, even if I ONLY type hello, OfferUp says it's inappropriate language!! I've closed and reopened the app six times and now it's saying that for any ad I try to get information on, ask a question about their items or even try to buy their items!!! So some of you who lost selling your item to me, make sure you thank OfferUp for chasing off your buyer with deep pockets!!",1
13054,SUPER SLOW FULL OF GLITCHES. OfferUp ONCE WAS the best app to buy and sell in my honest opinion. NOT anymore. This app is so frustrating. It constantly lags and glitches. I wish they would fix these problems. It's been terrible like this for a while now. It makes buying and selling stuff a NIGHTMARE IMHO. I have been having way less stress and better luck on Marketplace. It was good while it lasted Offer up...,1
13055,you can find whatever you looking for here,5

13059,"Spam. Cannot unsunscribe, page doesn't exist. Don't bother.",1
13060,Highly unstable. Keeps popping up a message asking to accept updated ToS every few seconds. Extremely poor software skills by the entire development and QA team that allowed a bug like this to be released to production code.,1

13066,its a great app. I can find deals on everything n anything.,5
13067,needs to be updated nore. people leave items on site and never respond. frustrating,2

13080,Sad garbage app I wish letgo would come back,1
13081,people sale business and you can't really find things your looking for because of it,1
13082,useless app...completely over run with business listings ....like hundreds of the same listing over and over...also moderaters share listings with buyers they are working with to snatch up any good deal before anyone can buy it....,5
13083,This app has gone down hill. Have to watch an ad before sending a message to inquire buying a product. Ads in the thread were crowding the market already. Very slow app. Messages sent or received are delayed and makes buyers and sellers look like they aren't responding in the timely manner that they are. Delete the app!,1
13084,Awesomeness,5
13085,I deleted and I still get mail it a scam,1
13086,Required app for online purchases (used app to confirm my credit card I entered on the PC. Did not even prompt me for additional info),1
13087,I like the service..BUT HUGE disappointment lately. Glitchy and says unable to process try again later ALL THE TIME NOW. Also will not ever take my seller rating WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE. Iralre them give them all the stars and input and then it says thanks and saysl I DIDNT BUY THE DAMN ITEM. And that is it..set in stone?? Can't change it? WTH?,1

13094,Awesome app,3
13095,"I have had this app for years and have always loved it. Now it's so hard to sell due to the market being flooded with local businesses. They should NOT be allowed to advertise their businesses on this platform. This is supposed to be a community for regular citizens to buy, sell, and trade. I'm afraid the integrity of this app went from being a public swapmeet to free advertising of businesses. It's a shame. If I wanted to find a retailer, I would have Googled one. I'm looking to OfferUp!",1
13096,Great App,5
13097,i suck that you have to pay now to post something you want to sell,3

13101,The pop-up ads make it unusable,1
13102,love this place.,5
13103,This app is sooooo slow!,3
13104,Easy to use.,5
13105,I feel as though items you post just fall into oblivion (which they shouldn't). Posts should be continuously circulated. And I've noticed you cannot DELETE posts/items. Only archive. Why???,2
13106,OfferUp still does NOT remove inactive users' posts. Years of old posts to see in search results with nobody that will ever reply. Misleading marketplace until inactive posts are auto-deleted (say after 30 days with no activity).,2
13107,It's has opened up a lot of opportunities and benefited everyone in the transaction. It's been extra money at clutch time when it was really needed. Thanks offer up for giving me options.,5
13108,5th 5,5
13109,"App deliberately hides your posts so they hardly get seen by anyone (and gradually not seen at all) unless you pay a bunch of money to ""sell them faster"" which is a rip off. App is very buggy and crashes often, always crashing everytime I try to type into certain text fields. Inbox icon frequently tells me I have new messages when I don't. Their customer support is abysmal, incompetent, laggy, and by email only. Can't even delete your own items, they're stored forever even after sold!",1
13110,Seriously is anyone else not able to receive responses?? Not made for Androids anymore. I use to use this app alot but now nobody receives my message but I tell my daughter to put the app on her iPhone & all the same people I messaged messaged her back. Then I login to her account on my phone & they stopped getting my messages again.,1

13117,"This may sound harsh and if so I apologize, this app needs to get its act together. When you have an app that handles thousands of users bank cards that do money transactions through the site, you shouldn't have as many flaws and lags. Even the shipping process is screwy. At one point it never showed the item was shipped at all . I received the item and then received my money back automatically, because it wasn't showing the item as shipped, so I wasn't able to claim I received it . But I had.",1
13118,I keep receiving junk emails that I didn't ask for or need.,1
13119,They dont get rid of old posts. Seen a truck that was posted 5 freakin years ago. Its like they made the app and thats it. This app is frustrating when you see a post thats 5 years old,1

Very disappointing Hopefully my craigslist ads will get it sold by the time I get these offer UPS added back . Very frustrating,1
13124,Super buggy and constantly crashes.,1

13126,"What used to be a good app has devolved to a buggy, slow shadow of what it was. Every page is laggy, uploading pictures practically crashes the app every time and it's been like this through every update. Disappointed",2
13127,"Set a time limit on post. It's frustrating when you're scrolling and find an item that's two or even one year old. If an item doesn't sell in a designated time, allow the poster to repost. My goto online sites are FB Marketplace and Craigslist for that reason.",3

13130,"Update Mar 2023: Overall good app. Would be a better app if there was a ""renew listing"" button. Finally there's a search bar for our own listings... but its not showing up for me anymore.

13157,shipping this item was very easy to do.,5
13158,It works when it wants to and when it fails it's super hard for them to fix it! Plus you have to email them for help with proof of the apps failure. And they take weeks to fix it. Most of the time they blame your service providers internet or your phones app download and usually just ask you to uninstall their app and redownload it again that's their way of fixing things I suppose üëªyour # one truth setter,1
13159,Great App,5
13160,On the app there isn't an option to cancel the order if you can't fulfill. How stupid. eBay and mercari have it so why doesn't offer up have that feature?,1
13161,Unable to update,1
13162,the best market place ever,5

13205,"l find my interest on offer up and great security,",5
13206,I'm rating it three stars because I hate how LetGo did this partnership thing... On OfferUp you can't see prices nor a title unless you click on the thing. Although it's nice to find a lot of stuff but that's the big problem.,3
13207,Easy does it,5
13208,takes long to load,3

13213,I like the app. It gets pieces of the last item i looked at stuck in the list of pics of all of what im looking at . And freezes up every now and then. Other than that i like looking. Buying and selling with it.,3
13214,Not sure what happened but the update turned the app into garbage. I cant even open the app. Just dont try to download cause its just gonna freeze or take 6 million years to load,1

13230,awesome,5
13231,Messaging in the app is almost unusable. Constantly freezes and crashes app.,2
13232,I love this thing helps me get rid of my stuff and make me some money,5
13233,OfferUp was once a great app. Letgo is horrible. OfferUp is slowly turning into Letgo with so many ads it's becoming difficult to use. Effectively it's like trying to navigate Yahoo Mail. I understand they're trying to make money but this isn't sustainable.,3
13234,another good buying and selling app ;),5
13235,Extremely spammy notifications. In app notification settings are useless. The app will still send you promotional notifications even if you turn off all notifications within the app. The only way to truly stop notifications and promotions are to manually go into system settings and cut it off.,1
13236,"Better than marketplace in my opinion, except for the scammers when trying to buy cars.",5
13237,The Ads are just horrible on here! This app was probably my favorite to even look at things for used stuff but what the heck. I don't enjoy seeing ads every few blocks I can deal with with the recommendation tiny ads but adding a huge one between is a no for me sad to say this app just went to a 0.,1
13238,love this app.....you can find just about anything for great prices...‚ù§Ô∏èüëç,5
13239,too many ads and difficult o navigate. Old items that are no longer available and sellers that don't respond. Hardly worth the effort of searching.,2

13242,very good,5

13245,Ad filled nightmare now! Can't even see what you search for due to the ad crazy showdown! Used to be a great app until they got greedy. People will be lost when electrical devices are a thing of the past .,1
13246,Awful. I should not have to provide a phone number for my local sales. Point is to sell locally for a quick transaction. My phone number isn't required to simply have access to messages with potential buyers. Offerup began with a shadow ban and then totally disabled my account. Nothing was being sold that was illegal but apparently the platform doesn't like boats with no title. An item that can be perfectly sold for parts and repair on other platforms. What this app does love is scams and bots.,1
13247,this app is awesome it's a real easy way to make some money.,5
13248,This app blows. You'd be better off posting your ad on a dog turd.,1
13249,I watched a video of a girl saying that offer up don't live up to their buyer's protection policy,1
13250,"love this app, for some reason I can't edit an item I already sold, and I don't want to delete either. maybe is just me not knowing? other than that I love this app",4
13251,great app.,5
13252,The app quit working about a week ago. update offerup tech department got the app up and running. Though I never did figure out what caused it to stop working in the first place,1
13253,Great,5
13254,i find most things i look for have been on here for a year or more. noone deletes their ads. also it takes a long time for answers,2
13255,"Joined this week and see no reason to stay. If Offerup is a mobile-based competitor to Craigslist, Etsy and Ebay (the Big 3), why is its app worse? 1. No push notifications for new messages. You have to keep checking. (Worse than Big 3.) 2. Default location is (here) + 30 miles + shipping. You can change it for only one search at a time, but not as a preference. (Same as Big 3.) 3. ""Previous searches"" is bogus. I didn't search for tires, clothing or tennis balls. (Worse than Big 3.)",1
13256,Over priced vehicle's and dealer's promotion only. Not much of any good sales in app. I don't know if it's a good contact because didn't find it resource of use.,1
13257,It's ok,3
13258,They banned me for nothing. My purchase didn't go through and when I opened the app again they disabled my account.,1
13259,love it,4
13260,pretty easy to use,4
13261,"meh, not horrible not great either",2
13262,Would be great is you leave a review of someone you could see publicly the good or bad about the person. So the next person cause know what makes them a good person to buy from or a reason to just not purchase from them at all.,1

13264,Good app,5
13265,"Update.. problem between notification and messages populating,....... What's going on with email ad scams??? Previous updates had the same placed ads boxes links within searches of items. From 5 down to 2 :(. Until some other service challenges offer up with less ads and scams?",2

13267,"Make it so I can block people that waste my time. It can't be that hard, stop with all the bots and ads.",1

13271,it's good,4
13272,Nice web site. No sales yet,4
13273,I sold an item on OfferUp on Monday. The buyer has had his merchandise since Wednesday according to USPS tracking. I still haven't gotten paid for the sale and OfferUp says it could be several more days before I get paid. Selling items on this app that require shipping is not worth it. Seller pays for shipping and then apparently has to wait weeks to be paid even after buyer has the items in their possession. Zero stars,1
13274,Great way to make extra money people are always looking to buy with you're selling it's great Love it,5
13275,Offer up is filled with scammers and low lifes trying to scam innocent buyers off their hard earned cash. Offer Up does nothing to solve this problem and I hope the app gets in trouble,1
13276,I do not understand why you took yeah that direction it was pp backwards I bought so many thousands of dollars on OfferUp it was symbol and pleasurable for most people to use this right now you have is out of sorts you may be smarter but I spend more money I don't care how much you have I just paid more your platform is atrocious the way it was get it together and girls back the way it was there was no doubt. Now you are just all over the place so what you want I will delete the app .,2
13277,lots of technical problems,1
13278,Too many ads.,2
13279,"The new forces ADs after the new update are really pushing me to uninstall this app. There where ads already built into it, now it changes the screen to forcefully see an ad. It's bogus!",2
13280,Great place to sell the things you don't need anymore!!,5
13281,this app is having major trouble today,1
13282,"Honestly it could be better. Overall it's slightly above average, just need to block out fake sellers and make them verify themselves by ID maybe",3
13283,scandalous corporate thieves. DO NOT SELL THROUGH THESE PEOPLE. They'll use every trick they can find to keep the money you earn by selling your stuff. They keep the payment and when it's time to cash out there will suddenly be a million problems keeping you from getting your money.,1
13284,"I would love to use the app, but I can't see the price until I click on the item, which takes way to long to compare items. It may be a feature already, but it isn't clear how to do it. Update March 2023, had to downgrade from 2 stars to 1 star, because every time I try to post and item, and change the item category, the app crashes. Thought I would try to list the item from my computer, and I guess that's not even an option?!",1
13285,awesome app...I always find what I need and buy what I don't.,5
13286,The mobile app doesn't work on VPN. I'm not willing to sacrifice my privacy to use it.,1
13287,"Cannot post items they deem unfit, yet they have ad space trying to sell the same types of items they won't let you post due to community guidelines. ü§î",1
13288,"LetGo was the better app and user experience in every way. OfferUp is and always has been a subpar platform for any sort of local/garage sales. Any normal person would use Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or mercari as it becomes more popular. I have never sold a single item using OfferUp though I used to receive excellent business via LetGo and significantly fewer bots and scams. Delist yourself.",1
13289,"Great place to sell your stuff, and the app is super easy to navigate and use. Terrible place to make purchases. You're better off buying brand new or supporting a local business. People ask top dollar for their items, and you're competing with resellers for any kind of good deal that does pop up.",5
13290,good way to make a buck on items You dont need,5
13291,A search function of my active listings would be helpful. It is quite time consuming to scroll through all of my listings just to find the one I need to edit.,3
13292,Cannot login,1

13294,"they have a 3 day clause that of the seller doesn't send you the item you bought they (OfferUp) shall cancel the transaction and return your money to your account. it's been 5 days, no return of money, no cancelation of item and no contact from support.",1

13340,Absolute trash. Can't even be on the app for more than 30 seconds before it crashes. And I have the most up-to-date software on my phone and plenty of storage so it sounds like something the software engineers need to fix,1

13344,The new update is a garbage. It was very nice before the current update. Wish I could roll back.,1
13345,Yeah offer up as great if there was a way to refresh everyday your sales that would be even better because to get on it every day and have to refresh it bring it back to the front page is kinda hard you know if you're not real big on computers so anyway that doesn't matter it's cool,5
13346,"Susan was a joy, polite, items presented beautifully. don't miss her treasures.",5
13347,"They refuse to remove scammers that send links to steal your account. No matter how many times you report something, the scammers accounts stay on. Big waste of time. Avoid this app and use Marketplace or Craigslist instead.",1
13348,"love the less hassle to post, to buy verses other selling / buying platforms",5
13349,I would give it a 0 star if I could simply because their app is trash üóë. How u gonna give people a category such as feeding then subcategories being formula . When I go to sell brand new formula . This app goes its against their app . So basically they should be sued for having it but not allowing u to use the category set up to sell .,1

13352,Not working perfectly,1
13353,Getting worse and worse! Horrible programmers. LetGo was superior. These haters killed it and used this garbage. Anyone ever QA this turd on Android yet? Zero notifications on my galaxy. So i installed it on new fon. Even worse! Old fon at minimum showed notification without audio even though it's on. New install shows nothing till you open the slow as S app to view new messages! Total garbage. Always miss texts from buyers so they think I'm not serious. Probably have to use Facebook now to sell,1

13359,"This app gets your hopes up with post that are up to 5 years old in some cases and no longer for sale. Old post need to be deleted once sold, instead they stay on the app making you believe items are still for sale, very disappointing",1

13365,Wish I could give it negative stars. This app sucks. Did nothing but cause me to lose money and time. Don't waste your time trying to sell thru this app. You'll ship your stuff and never get payed for it.,1

13371,Bad,1
13372,This app has been great to me. I bought a car and a trailer on it. You'll be seeing alot from me in the future.,5
13373,Newest update now forces ads on you when you want to ask someone about an item. No I will never use WhatsApp so stop forcing the ad on me. You are trying to put Craigslist back on top again by doing this. Free means free and no forced anything. I will use WhatsApp when Microsoft makes a new Windows phone to replace my recently lost HP Elite X3.,1
13374,I am not in Dallas,1
13375,I like the old offer up when it was just stuff. I don't like the commercialization of the app,3

13378,Doesn't work yet,1
13379,"Pros 1. Great way to get rid of item for some extra cash. Cons 1. The app is SLOW. Very, very, very SLOW. Navigating the app in any way is very, frustratingly slow. Posting an item takes way longer than it should. 2. If you want to change one small thing for a post, you have to tap on the ""Next"" button 4 times, which again is very, very slow. There should be a way to hit ""Save"" in the top right corner so that you don't have to go all the way to where it says ""Add Location."" Needs to be faster",2
13380,Notifications don't work.,1
13381,I look at this app most days. It is like finding a yard sale that has most everything you are looking for. I have bought and sold many times with the Offer up app. I love it.,5

13392,it is an okay site it sucks that by the time I was ready to sell something then they tell me that I can have to pay You don't have to but if you want your program to run smoother you have to pay what two bucks for the cheap one and then four or five bucks for the expensive one I don't know it's up to you if you want to put more money into it then what's you're probably going to get out of it and don't forget the packaging that means you have to ship and sell everything yourself thank you,2
13393,The Offer Up App is very user-friendly. It's easy to search for items and easy to post an item or items for sale. Since Offer Up merged with (Let it Go) I never use Craigslist anymore. It's safe to say I really enjoy using this App. It gets 5*****stars!!!,5

13407,Offer up no longer work for over a month or more. It does not allow my messages to reach the seller. This needs to be resolved a.s.a.p At one time I had log in issues as well. This is turning to be a bad app now. *Update It is 3-19-23 this app has not been fixed and also does not allow me to log me in. It also says I am no longer able to log in. There is no support here.

13491,I've been able to make lots of money here since the app first became available. I've been a longer so far. Has wide audiences.,5
13492,I've tried it on Samsung pixel and iphone. Iphone being the best performing android is real glitchy slow. Clicks on randoms things sometimes. Got. Rid of my note 20 thinking it was having issues but. Pretty sure it's the app 3/17/23 still glitchy as ever and now ads? Please fix it before u spam us,1
13493,"Offer up Is a scam Morning to everybody, know that by posting anything for sale on OfferUp or let-go. You're just inviting con artist and scams. Very few of the profiles are actually real. Precaution anybody selling anything to anybody who just created their profile. Offer up doesn't have any precautions against this or filters in any way shape or form I would advise you against using this site",1
13494,"overall good app,i have problems uploading photos,now i just upload 1 after about 3 or 4 attempts itll upload afterwords ,i'll edit and add the rest of the photos.",3
13495,protects the scammers more than the buyers. on top of leaving old and outdated postings the guy put sold to someone else to avoid getting a review. the car wasn't as described more problems than he said nothing but shady cons on this app they can't even give you the decency to give honest reviews from all that bot reviews you will see,1
13496,Too much fraudulent activity. This app doesn't feel safe!,1
13497,It'd be a great app but nobody ever hits on items EVER. The scammers that want you to use a code or try to get your number. There are so many items from months to years ago. Not really a good app for sales. Letgo before offer up was WAYYYY better. It also takes 5-15 minutes to load. I NEVER get notifications.,2
13498,Horrible,1
13499,"In 2017 I issued it five stars because it was a fantastic app but in 2021 it slowed down to a crawl, now in 2023, after numerous app updates it is no faster -- I give up, I've uninstalled.",1
13500,This app has gotten unbearably slow. Particularly with loading messages. It's just been steady downhill with each release.,3
13501,"Update: Somehow, this app got even worse. It takes roughly 1 minute for each page to load. Several seconds for the app to acknowledge a button touch. SUPER SLOW BEEN THIS WAY FOR A YEAR NOW!! Nobody is doing anything to fix it. Developers dont do anything about scammer accounts and doesnt require any form of verification that you are a real person so people get robbed on this app extremely easy and frequently. This app is trash you're better off using Facebook marketplace or craigslist.",1
13502,"I've been using the app for years and have never seen anything this bad. I regret updating my app to the new versions. Back then, search results showed up within seconds, now it takes roughly a decade for results to show up. What's the point of the new versions if they suck this badly, bring back the old ones",5
13503,you allow to many business in this so it's no longer a place where people can trade and sell their stuff it's just another ebay,1
13504,Really slow and messages don't go throught to people anyone know of any other apps better than this where I can sell my valuable merchandise!!! Greatly appreciated!!,1
13505,Got banned for posting sum air suspension bags and they wont reactivate my account. It makes no sense. How can those items violate community health guidelines. I tried to contact the main people and they all say they cant reinstate my profile. This is absurd and it makes no sense. They pretty much blocked me. I used to love this app. I would like my account unblocked,1
13506,I just replaced my phone because my notifications didn‚Äôt work ‚Äì and they still don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve reset the phone settings numerus times. I‚Äôve done factory reset two times as well. I‚Äôve played with the settings and nothing helps. I believe that the offer-up doesn‚Äôt work properly. Please help.,1
13507,It was amazing until recently. Your app needs to be optimized. Running on s22ultra on high performance mode should not be lagging like this. 300mbs is more than enough for data. Besides that people are still trying to make it work but slowly you can see people moving to market place.,2
13508,"I dont get notifications anymore, its terrible, this needs to be fix asap.. im not responding in a timely manner, its affecting my business. please fix",1
13509,Edit: changed to 1 star because you can't tell ads apart from real posts eg ebay . Good app but notificatios are annoying. Can you please update your app so I can toggle off marketing notifications? For example I get notified of 'things matching your searches available' despite having every single toggle in the app for notifications turned off. The last step would be disabling app notifications in general in my phone because it doesn't give the option to selectively mute marketing. Thanks,1
13510,"Full of scammers trying to take you off the app, personally has not been the greatest experience. Apps really gone down hill. Sad!",1
13511,Good,5
13512,It's hard to get somebody to reply back,4
13513,Awesome,5
13514,you can find some good deals on here. it's a little clunky to use having to message each other back and forth to get a deal. lots of things have been there for years and should have either been sold or probably not for sale anymore.,4
13515,Great selling app!,5
13516,"Me desespera que tiendas est√°n vendiendo aqu√≠, por lo menos deber√≠an agregar una opci√≥n de Due√±o/Compa√±√≠a ..√∫ltimamente muchas muebler√≠as est√°n anunciando sus muebles. se supone que esta app es para personas que quieren vender sus cosas y para gente que por cualquier raz√≥n no pueden comprar nuevo.",1
13517,Great,5
13518,"Used to be a great app, then it got swarmed by scammers and now it's just a bunch of ads.",1
13519,Spammy trash of an app,1
13520,Good app but it's really hard to reach out to support.,3
13521,it's the and only place to get cheap cars,5
13522,app has been very slow for the past year,3
13523,great online shopping center,4
13524,Buggy full of fake accounts and almost all the time messaging does not work,1
13525,Sucks unfortunately Facebook monopolies dominate this sector,1
13526,it kicked me off the app you disable to set up violated guidelines which I didn't I've been a member for 7 years... please contact me,1
13527,allowing holsters and mag pouches to be sold but then deleting an ad for a scope is profoundly stupid. I'm telling all of my customers to delete your app and go to Craigslist,2
13528,03-16-2023 Not getting notifications Didn't give notifications with the new update. Doesn't have the option to delete your stored credit card information.,3
13529,Great app for advertising just wish the stuff people were trying to sell would upgrade like when this app first came out ü•áü•áü•á,5
13530,"No exposure if you don't purchase the promote package. 400 times less exposure! Facebook Marketplace will have at least 10 times, sometime 400 times views for the same time period with exact same item info listed.",1
13531,"too many glitches, not enough options to customize, and messages not always working",3
13532,not easy to sell items on here,3
13533,I'm missing cash back from a couple of transactions and customer support does not respond! I referred my daughter and she didn't get cash back from her first purchase and I didn't get my $15 cash back for referring her!,2
13534,Not getting notifications anymore. I just got my S23 Ultra. Notification from OfferUp still work on my old phone. This is the only app with this issue. I've been missing messages from potential buyers because of this. Fix asap!!,1
13535,"Nobody ships, items are 2 years old, if you can make it where if items don't sell after a period of time the item will be removed.",3
13536,"I love the concept of a virtual yard sale. It's poorly managed with inconsistent allowances. Since adding advertisers (Ebay in the middle of searches), it's VERY slow. Slow to load searches in specific regions. Resets to a big random search requiring me to re-enter my search filters, everytime that I log in, annoying! Lastly, it annoyingly sends me search updates when I have purposefully never slid the option to ever solicit me for my searched items. They must get money for every log in.",1
13537,app is very slow to load,2
13538,"Large & active marketplace, but the notifications work sporatically so I either have to open the app all the time or end up missing sales opportunities (like this weekend). My notifications are enabled, I'm guessing it's related to OfferUp wanting that stupid custom ""Cha ching"" notification sound being the weak link. I've given up updating the app, since this has been happening for a while. 3/2023 Reduced to 1 star since the notifications stopped working again after working for a while...",1
13539,Very good.,5
13540,"Horrible seller, setup time with me and sold the item while I was on my way to pick. I drove 45 minutes to get to his home to learn that he sold the paintings 10 minutes I got there.",1
13541,Good,5
13542,non responsive sellers,1
13543,Does not work with VPNs,2
13544,Great,5
13545,"I seriously don't understand why there are so many sellers on OfferUp that simply never respond when you buy something or make an offer. This is a chronic problem and apparently the minds at OfferUp have been completely unable to find a solution. In order to be happy with OfferUp, one needs to be super patient and not really care whether or not you receive something you purchase. It's the worst online marketplace for secondary market items.",1
13546,Like the app,4
13547,Great,5
13548,too many no shows,3
13549,Offer Up is a great tool to use in selling items that others want to pay yard sale prices. If selling antiques or other valuable items. You're in the right place. Thank you Offer Up staff and personnel üôÇ,4
13550,like the app,5
13551,Its easy to sell buy trade very good realiable app,5
13552,App freezes up and some posts are 7 years old.,1
13553,"I had this app since 2018 and I've sold and bought few things here. Now, they try to get personal information from me ""in order to keep my account open"". They're asking for ID and selfies, etc. in an email. It doesn't make any sense. I have verified my phone number and email already. Shame on you guys for trying to scam people to get all their personal information in this way!!!! This app should be taken down by google for this reason. Besides the app never worked properly but I see why now.",1
13554,Ever since last 2 updates I don't receive notifications for new messages from buyers. Have missed many potential sales because of this.,1
13555,Great app,5
13556,Can't post items. Every post is deleted in less that a minute. Items and listings do not violate terms of service.,1
13557,app is slow and glitchy. enough to be irritating and cause me to prefer to use another app.,3
13558,"Used this app for years, tired of getting ripped off. They do nothing about scammers and loss prevention. Sone with it",1
13559,quick & easy,5
13560,"this app is a lot of fun, sometimes you get a good deal, and sometimes you see how crazy some people can be, but either way, it's a lot off fun",5
13561,been using for a year now and like browsing items. that app is set up efficiently and easy interface for use.,5
13562,Mehüòï,2
13563,Update 3/1423 Nothing's changed. Uninstalling it a second time This app is a big time waster. When searching consistently get posts that are 2 to 5 years old. There has to be a way to keep search results current.,1
13564,"This is my 2023 Review of OfferUp after using the app for a few years now...I love using the app for selling stuff I don't need. However the app still has laginess when using it. And now the App is being overflowed with so many vehicles. I think OfferUp should make a separate app for vehicle's only! So imagine your browsing for deals on different things and all your seeing is cars, trucks, vans, SUV's! I'll still continue to use the app since I'm still able to sell things consistently.",4
13565,Awesome üëå site...,5
13566,üëç,5
13567,"Buggy af. I have notifications set to ON yet there os no specific notification for messages, and so i dont get ANY message notifications. I even have the app set to not optimize or restrict for battery. So now people end up messaging and i get no indication outside the app. Losing sales because of this.",1
13568,"Leaving this 1 star untill I'm able to block profiles from showing up on my search results. Adding the option to exclude certain keywords will be a great change as well. Example if I'm looking for a computer let me exclude the word ""laptop"" from my search results.",1
13569,"Honestly felt like it was a waste of time to try buying things on here. Most people dont update the selling status or even reply.I paid for Offer Up Premium to try to get some responses on some things I really needed. Instead OfferUP put a ban on my account for ""Not following community guidelines""? So where does my money go now if I paid for your premium subscription and I am not allowed access account? All I did was offer the seller exactly what they wanted for items and still no one replies.",1
13570,Don't waste your time with this app..it' lags like crazy.,1
13571,such an easy app to navigate,5
13572,Very SLOW TAKES ME 10 MINS TO POST 1 THING,1
13573,Destin was a gentleman and very helpful thank you Destin,5
13574,"OfferUp is a very easy to use, and very effective app if ya gots something to sell or if ur looking to buy something. 5 STARS!! HIGHLY RECOMEND",5
13575,app is too slow and very difficult to navigate through,2
13576,awesome selling app,5
13577,Uploaded in a foreign language when I switch it goes back when I go to next page,1
13578,The App keep closing out after login in after 1 min,2
13579,I completely stopped using them because they are now requiring you to use TruYou. I don't think it is safe to provide TruYou a copy of my driver's license with all the identity theft going on.,1
13580,I wish letgo was back just don't like offer up it never work and never had replied back,1
13581,"Ok app, but when searching for cars and trucks, you can't filter by fuel type. Big downfall in my opinion. Makes it a lot harder to filter through results.",4
13582,"Such a buggy and terrible app, with even worse customer service. My listings and messages disappeared overnight, and customer service tells me they had a ""technical glitch,"" and ""good luck buying and selling!"" You'll definitely need luck if you want to use this app -- they can't even guarantee your listings and messages won't disappear.",1
13583,Clumbsy,3
13584,I love this app. it just all depends on the shipping cost really..,5
13585,Turned off push notifications. Still getting them. Terrible,1
13586,Had this app for years and all of the suddent this year the app just doesnt work its slow and glitchy and it knocks me off it.,1
13587,good,5
13588,Great bought lots of nice items use it all the time,5
13589,Okay 2 Stars I like the app but I hate the fact that there's so many scams on here you need to make us some filters we can filter like people star ratings true you how many items they have sold how reliable they are stuff like that would help filter out some of these scam accounts on here which tons of them I hate typing to sit here for hours skimming through all this garbage just to get to something that is actually real,2
13590,Good,5
13591,Really a great experience in buying this lamp from her!,5
13592,"User friendly, lots of real buyers.They play my favorite sound Cha-Ching!",5

13594,item is not as described. would like a refund,1
13595,Doesn't work. Stays having technical issues these days.,2
13596,"app constantly freezes, especially when creating an ad.",2
13597,on time and excellent purchase,5
13598,the app works ok. it would be better if it allowed swipe texting and pictures in the messaging.,4
13599,"I made 2 purchases between 2 days, the sellers never shipped the items and my money was taken out of my bank account & after 5 days when offer up messages me saying that my money was refunded because it didn't get shipped, I never ever received my money & there's nobody to talk to on offer up about any of it cause they are a bunch of cowards & don't have a hotline to call for customer support. So, Basically 100%, Offer up robbed me & it's been week's now & you can't get ahold of nobody.GREAT !!",1
13600,"Had Letgo and Offerup. Loved Letgo, found Offerup frustrating. When they merged, I felt all the things I liked where dropped- deleted both.",2
13601,I need a truck GMC,5
13602,excellent,5
13603,Made 2 offers The offers were accepted and 1 seller admitted that the item was not as pictured. The 2nd seller would not respond to messages and offferup canceled and returned money,1
13604,Has always been a great experience for me finding great deals,5
13605,Kicks me out all the time,2
13606,It's not a bad site per say but it does CRASH A LOT OF TIMES,2
13607,Just when I think you can't get any more pushy with your ads you find a way you suck offer up,1
13608,I do use this free app along with Craigslist to buy and sell. This app is slow and non responsive. The app doesn't send user msg notifications regularly. Updating and reinstalling does not help. lts not my phone. They need to auto delete ads older than 30 days because offerup is totally cluttered with years old listings.,2
13609,This app really lags when trying to type things out.,3
13610,Good app,5
13611,So many fake accounts! It's crazy the different tactics these accounts use. I have posted 4 things for sale. I have gotten 5 accounts message me and they have been shady. Do not use!,1
13612,people should be screened & not allow scams or people who do not ever reply. why post 4 sale & never reply?,3

13642,"So far the shipping is too high, people keep offering way lower than I want to sell for, and items just don't move. Some of the items I have been selling are brand new and people expect to pay yard sale prices. Facebook Marketplace is more successful.",1

13656,Horrible Horrible experience. Connected Facebook to this app. Facebook as usual on the nonsense. Now I can't log into I offer. Yall tripping. Users beware. Do not cross link these apps. They are doing backhanded things that users of their apps and site didn't agree to. They are combining biometric data which is unnecessary for how they run their apps.

13694,good app,5
13695,"Search is awful. No category for free anymore, also unless its well hidden, there's no minimum/maximum on prices when searching for stuff. Also there's no more filtering by newest/oldest or price high/low. It's so basic and pointless now I'm about to uninstall it because it's usess.",1
13696,üëç,5
13697,great easy and easy to use,5
13698,you need to have a camera to send people pictures you don't have one so I had to turn around and open up another page that I was selling completely ridiculous,3
13699,"Just like Craigslist. Every time I search for anything vehicle related, or I'm looking for a specific model, I will always get flooded with random dealerships advertising their random cars that I'm not looking for. I'm looking for wheels for my truck, not a 2007 dodge durango or a 99' Tacoma with 350k milea for 30k. They need better filtering for annoying dealerships advertising their POS cars. Besides that, the app works fine overall. Anything vehicle related, I'm sticking to Facebook.",2
13700,keep looking...you'll find it! üßê,5
13701,Horrible app,2
13702,"push notification comes for new items in my search, then won't load the new items.",1
13703,I bought an item and the seller didn't have it. He told me to cancel and I wasn't able to do it. The seller then told me off and kept my money. There's no buyer protection and the app is full of scammers.,1
13704,"I redownloaded this app after not having it for a few years. It used to be filled with actual people selling things they no longer wanted/needed and I loved it. It was like treasure hunting, scrolling the page looking for that perfect item. I just opened it for the first time and the entire page is just businesses selling their stuff, not a single thing posted by regular people. Glad I didn't pay for it, uninstalling immediately.",1
13705,Good app,5
13706,Horrible,1
13707,Scam,1
13708,"it was a very good experience he came through with what he said he did didn't get no issues at all ,15 stars",5
13709,Great place to do business. And sell amazing things!,5
13710,a lot of glitches in the messaging board. why did they get rid of the folders on the home screen?,3
13711,excelent service,5
13712,Love this app and use it often. Save me thousands of dollars.,5
13713,quick and easy thank you offer up,5
13714,Love it,5
13715,Nothing but scams. No one is actually selling anything its just scam after scam very disappointing!,1
13716,"Slower than slow. Update after update, still slower than molasses in the winter time. Takes upwards of 15 or more minutes just to post an item. It's a simple process, the app is just ridiculously slow and unresponsive. My phone is not to blame, offerup. It's in top operating condition as always. I am very close to ditching offerup simply because it's so frustrating to use. I've tried using the website, but not all features are available on the website. Please fix your app. I want to like it.",1
13717,Good,4
13718,very useful app and interesting,5
13719,Ads! Ads! Ads! I cant take it anymore! This app is garbage now! Everytime you click on something you now get an ad. Was not like this before. Long time user and now looking for new app.,1
13720,"Really bad app. The ui keeps freezing when I try to message a potential buyer on my pixel 6 pro. I have to remove the app from background and start it again if I wish to message. Clearing cache, uninstall reinstall, and clearing data do not make this app responsive. Either hire someone who can actually fix this garage response time for a message system or use your current staff to fix this issue. This is not a 4-5 star app. This is a 1-2 star app.",1
13721,"I loved ""Let Go"". I used to sell all things. I hate OfferUp.. all scammers and not serious. haven't sold NOT ONE THING THROUGH THIS APP SINCE THE MERGE.",1
13722,perfect,5
13723,Great,5
13724,So far it‚Äôs amazing!,5
13725,"Worst customer service and they are slow to respond, beware of scams on their platform, still waiting for my refund been more than a month no response from their Customer service and there is no phone number to contact them, reported on BBB no response there as well , still waiting for my refund",3
13726,nothing else like it and it helps me get great deals on everything I want and need I love this app helps me make lots of new Friends and sales,5
13727,great app,5
13728,easy to use just type and search and click,5
13729,"It's no longer what it used to be. Now, you have lots of spam posts from stores and businesses that overcharge for items.",2
13730,"The layout is not visually appealing and there is no ""Free"" category to browse anymore. Lame. Update: wish I could give zero stars because now Offerup is requesting a driver's license to post items or even message sellers. Not going to do that, Facebook marketplace is the way to go.",1
13731,Painfully slow on different new popular devices.,2
13732,it works great,5
13733,"When you are scammed and ask for their help, they disable your account forever. You are basically left stranded. I got scammed because the person sold an icloud locked iphone to me. First, the seller blocked me, and then when I took the phone to him to unlock it, he threatened me with his gun and didn't refund my money. Sharing my experience with offerup got me kicked out.",1
13734,"1 year,2 years,3 years posts come up when you search .. no one clean up old posts",1
13735,is good,5
13736,This update does not work. Anything I post is not appearing at all. It worked fine until this update now there's no veiws or anything. Need new update this sucks when your moving and can't even use,1
13737,"Doesn't allow me to search all of the US for a specific item or Vehicle, and When I put in the search for a specific item it keeps saying 0 items found, but if I spend 2 hours just searching starting over I will find some of those items even though it might have too many miles on it, or it would be the wrong color, so why didn't it show up in the search??? Fix it so we can put in exactly what we want and see if it is available anywhere in the United States!! And Then Show Us All of Them!!",2
13738,it's wow üëå üëè üòç üëç ü•∞.,5
13739,Could use an update on things that are no longer for sale. That would help with clutter and the lag in the program's response time when clicked on or browsed thru,3
13740,It was okay but I don't have the app anymore,5
13741,Ruined a good thing. Now the app just recommends items you might be interested in instead of showing you all the newest listings,1
13742,"Used to be a good place for individuals to sell things lying around the house. But business's have taken over the app. If you do not pay a riduculous amount of money to advertise what you list, your items will not be shown. Advertising has ruined the app and the experience for individuals selling anything here.",2
13743,you guys do a great job thank you,5
13744,"The app is rather slow, long load times. Wish you could upload more photos and select more than 1 category. Also would be nice if we could renew our listings like on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace instead of having to archive it and repost all over again.",3
13745,To many scammers this page is not safe don't send money to people for phone u wil be scam and put u life in dager stay oh way from this page in to they fix it and take every single info from sellers.,1
13746,Woww this app is really good I've been using it for the past 3 years and I got a free PS4 and a bunch of other stuff,5
13747,I'm install the app but I do a offer up account and I used for few min _ i can't send msg and post it something so I'm not comfortable with that,1
13748,Excellent,5
13749,Horrible!!! When i went l to go log on to my account and I see that I've been locked out. So I then tried to log back in and every time I do I get a pop-up message that says my account has been disabled because it violated community guidelines. I've messaged OfferUp about it numerous times and have never gotten a response,1
13750,OfferUp buying letgo was world changing. No one uses this any more a search that yielded a hundred results on letgo yields 7 results on offerup also a bunch of garbage and ads and amazon redurects or resells etc.,2
13751,Noone on offer up can get my payments,5
13752,Merely average,3
13753,Great,5
13754,"Great App, Just Needs Better Communication Between The People Who Use The App!",4
13755,"Item was as described, and great communication to coordinate meeting and transaction.",5
13756,I have not been disappointed by my purchases on their offer up. Or let go.,5
13757,This is a pretty good app for buying and selling. My one criticism so far after using it for maybe 6 months is that zooming in/out on pictures and scrolling pictures is really hard and is super annoying when trying to get a better look at something. Would love of you guys could do a fix for this. Maybe double tap to zoom in/out?,3
13758,"Need the block feature to remove listings from being seen from those you block. When I block someone, I don't want to continue seeing their listings........",3
13759,"the messaging part can be laggy at times, which is why I gave it 4 stars.",4
13760,"I reported a scam seller with one hundred percent proof of their scam, at this moment their profile remains untainted and able to scam more people. Makes you wonder, does offerup run the scams themselves?",1
13761,Not responding to location,1
13762,This is a joke,1
13763,just love this app,5
13764,Aso wonderful and easy to find the items we need. Thankyou..,5
13765,Great,5
13766,"Had to deduct a couple star's now that you get locked into an annoying pop-up add every time you send or receive a message. Huge turn off OfferUp, please fix it!",3
13767,I would love to say I like this app but.. I contacted them about my phone # not being able to be verified after a few emails going back and forth of asking me questions and me answering them all. I go into my account to see if it was fixed to find THEY DELETED MY ACCOUNT! Supposedly I violated community guidelines. I do not sell on the app I only shop and was in the middle of trying to purchase of few things. I'm not so happy with them.,2
13768,The app sometimes is extremely slow or messages and pop-ups up hours or days later on my Moto G phone. The no show and flakiness of buyers seems to have increased since offer-up merged with the Letgo app.,3
13769,"Update: Why am I unable to login while I am trying to communicate with a buyer?? Terrible! Keeps freezing, and I'm losing photos that I've painstakingly taken, and the descriptions I'm typing in, are getting lost as well... this is infuriating!",1
13770,"Buggy Trash!! I've had the app for almost a year now and there were absolutely no issues! Now suddenly, when I go to see listings or my messages it says ""oops! Something went wrong! Please try again later."" With a bear in bandages. I tried resetting my phone and also uninstalling and reinstalling the app and nothing has helped. It's been about a day and so resolution, which really pisses me off because I was actively messaging someone about purchasing something and now I won't be able to get it.",1
13771,Garbage app. I miss letgo.,1
13772,Got banned for asking customer support to help with not getting answers back from messages and got banned for harassment?,1
13773,"Great app .. there is a scope to improve the search algorithm. Update: didn't work on galaxy s20+, waiting for support.",2
13774,Great for selling!,5
13775,Garbage....drove an hour to meet someone and the app goes down,1
13776,"Absolutely sucks, I can never even log in. It constantly says cannot log in try again later. Trash. Don't install.",1
13777,App failing after update. Won't open. My account cannot be opened.,1
13778,Doesn't load,1
13779,ADS!!!! used to be good. Now theres ads everywhere. Ads pop up at all times now. So annoying! They make you click on the ad just to continue. TRAAAASH!!! Blocks you out if you dont click on ads or freezes phone.,1
13780,Cannot even post an offer because the app freezes and is so unbearably slow.,1
13781,Way too much commercial business in private web site...,5
13782,"to much influence from app, should be able to search without any automatic suggestions etc. It is obnoxious it's so bad.",2
13783,"I enjoy this app and all it offers, but the app seems a bit slower than using the website on a desk top. I still think it is great overall.",4
13784,Ads are not monitored. Too many are YEARS old!,1
13785,"great app, just takes a while for the process to get paid.",4

13792,Too many scammers,1
13793,"Really nice place to buy, and sale.",5
13794,Gotta put this app at the top with the best of the best!,5
13795,I really have enjoyed Offer up it's very easy to sale things you want to sale so thank you very much you have helped me a lot of times,5
13796,This app sucks no matter how many times you download it or do whatever with all the new ads that it has in it the app freezes or shuts off and you have to start again I now see why everybody uses Facebook marketplace instead this app is junk matter what device I try the app freezes and shuts off and you have to start from the beginning thanks to all these new ads that they put into it so now I will no longer recommend this app or use it I will stick to eBay and Facebook marketplace,1
13797,great app!,5
13798,Nice and thank u L me,5
13799,just lovet it,4
13800,you can find any and everything on OfferUp rims and tires anything from a-z anything from furniture the you-name-it you can find it on OfferUp.,5
13801,Ecxelente,5
13802,"not working properly right now. will not actually post anything once submitted. very baffled by this. I have tried from both my girlfriend's phone and my own phone to post items and have not been successful. Only one thing has been posted in that was from my friend's phone, very odd. When you submit the listing, it never appears and once in awhile you will get an email confirmation for a post but the listing still never shows up, almost as if it doesn't exist.",2
13803,One man's trash is another man's treasure.,5
13804,works great so far,5
13805,There's absolutely no reason why this app is should be as slow and unoptimized as it is. It's an absolute joke. Load times take forever and it constantly crashes for no reason. Terrible app. They really need to fix this.,1
13806,So slow.,1
13807,They have whatever I need!,4
13808,very helpful,5
13809,Bought some great stuff on here,4
13810,What a piece of junk app.. Needs a ton of work. The service is good but the app itself is hottibly coded. Fire and hire new coders.,1
13811,no one has responded in 2 days to 15 of my offers,2
13812,grate and easy to use,5

13820,I compare this to Ebay. Bikes and tv's I get locally here too.,5
13821,I thoroughly enjoy this app is self-explanatory easy to work with I never had any issues with it. I honestly can't say anything negative about it. <,5
13822,I have used this app the last 8 years and it has been absolutely amazing until the last few months . There's glitches . It won't notify me when people respond . It's slow . I am so bummed . This app helped get me through hard financial times but not anymore,2
13823,"Deleted my account for no reason. Decided it was okay to delete my account right after I posted clothes (which didn't go against rules) and told me it did. Lied and said I got multiple warnings when I haven't gotten one and just deleted. Won't elaborate, doesn't look into the issue, very lazy and unprofessional. Find a different app.",1
13824,"Less laggy on pixel 7 pro, still buggy as all get out, and a huge battery drain during minimal use. Super full of ads as well",1
13825,Yeah you see good post for vehicles on here and that's good but no one replys back to you and there profile says responds within the hour try more like just straight up ignores you,1
13826,I love this app I sell everything here and it's awesome sometimes you get stood up but that's nothing offer up can do unless they find something that will lock in and guarantee the transaction between the two people I think that would be awesome other than that I recommend this app to sell anything.,4
13827,I love this app,5
13828,Very good communicator. Super Adorable!,5
13829,wonky ans slow,2
13830,"Great app to buy and sell quick objects if your in a bind or in need of some quick cash to help with bills, rent, or just about anything you could need to be happier üòä",5
13831,SLLLLOOOOWWWW on a flagship phone. The worst part of this app is how slow and unresponsive the interface is. Not being able to see prices unless you tap on the item also exacerbates its slowness.,1
13832,Effective marketplace and straightforward experience that encourages safe transactions. But why install native app when web works as well?,5
13833,great app Thank you James I ...E,5
13834,great app,5
13835,Latest update won't allow me to view my saved searches.,2
13836,awesome app with great Local Deals,5
13837,This app is garbage- it takes forever to load. I cant even scroll left and right on the pictures. Stop sending me notifications if it's not a buyer for my stuff. Update this app is still slower than a constipated poop even on the wifi -5 stars,1
13838,Pathetic. App is trash,2
13839,Good,3
13840,"Pretty good app overall. Pros: 1. Good listing numbers with a lot of users 2. Easy to use Cons: 1. Numerous old post still listed. Many over a year old to over 4+ years in age. 2. Extended search distance noted as within 30 miles and/or ""Maximum"" no clue of what the maximum distance is. 50, 75, 100-200+ miles would be great. 3. No ""List Closest First"" & No ""List Most Recent First"" 4. No Pricing listed with thumbnails. you have to click on each to view post and get pricing.",4
13841,"Never using this again. With over 800+ sales you would think I would be taken care of with ""seller protection"". Nope! Because my post office didn't scan a shipment in the time frame of offer up. They cancelled my sale. But left the shipping label scannable. Due to weather conditions I would think the ""support team"" would have been more helpful and accommodating. No! So because this buyer got a free expensive rare item. I'm done with this scam filled app. Always gave em the benefit of the doubt.",1
13842,Great way to find item of interest in your local area,5
13843,I always have great luck with selling items local - people are excited to get what they want. I've bought great deals local also - really great finds. I am just now venturing to the shipping part of this app - yet to buy or ship anything yet.,5
13844,"Got the app, listed sports equipment, got no offers. Then OfferUp sent me an email that I violated some policy, no idea what. I could contest them kicking me off the app and apparently blacklisting me as well, but that seemed ridiculous use of my time. Will not be using this again after this experience, I rather donate.",1
13845,"I put some stuff up for sale before a trip overseas and got rid of anything that didn't sell before I left. Planned to mark it all as sold once I got here, but turns out account access is blocked outside of the US. Both from the app and web. I just want to stop the 4-5 notifications per day asking about my stuff. But I can't even reach their customer support because that information is listed on a support page which is also blocked. App worked well when I was actually able to use it.",1
13846,great quality and communication,5
13847,The best place to sell something that you really don't need anymore.,5
13848,Complete garbage. I enable location but still getting stuff listed all the way across the country! Pretty sure that's not local or PICK UP!,1
13849,"vary simple to use, alway find different treasure.",5
13850,Offer Up in my opinion sucks. It's not worth the download. I wasted my time downloading this. I am going to explore other options.,1
13851,great for browsing good deals,5
13852,I was scammed on this site someone stole my TV sexually assaulted me I will never use this site again there are too many scammers and if you are elderly like myself don't use this site,1
13853,Good place to sell stuff.,5
13854,Good apps but has it ups and downs like sometimes it doesn't let me post so hopefully they fix that issue.,3
13855,reliable,5
13856,I am in here looking to purchase a car from a private owner.Both were scams.,1
13857,"This app...is trash. Listings from 5 years ago that never come down, spam and duplicate listings everywhere, and the messaging system is broken. There is often a delayed receipt of messages, or no notification of the message at all. And then you have to explain the miscommunication to the other person and hope they understand. Makes for bad interactions and bad communication. Overall, I've had some success buying and selling on OfferUp, but all things considered...this app suuuucks.",2
13858,Good Great,5
13859,easy.,5
13860,So unresponsive even with this new update..on Samsung galaxy note 9 Whe I trying to zooming the pictures for better references won't work and now it lagging alot with this new updates it seems after the adds they have between every add and they keep adding more things and separate electronic gardens tools it's getting worse on note 9 and the developers don't care !!!

13873,es Buenos good,5
13874,Your app sucks,1
13875,Nothing is organized. Sold items from a year ago show up. It's a chaotic feeling just looking at the way items show up.,2
13876,I love shopping made easy...,5
13877,Offerup was a great app making extra income but if your account is hacked and all your information and passwords are stolen and your internet is being used with permission offerup automatically closes account which without contacting and and asking questions this is what happened 2018 it was opened some else close two days later it was opened again February 27 explained there is only one account I ever used it same one for my Facebook it closed it again,2
13878,This is actually the first time I've used Offer Up. I can tell that I like it. Awesome app for selling random items. I can see this is only the beginning of my experience with Offer Up.,5

13901,"When offerup absorbed letgo they didn't migrate the option to find free stuff; so that eliminates the only thing that made letgo unique and brings nothing to the table for OfferUp. Notifications are a mess too, they simply don't follow the settings and they have people who should be able to identify and fix these problems. On a good note, they now have job search. Thanks for that, you guys are helping out many people going through tough times.",3

13908,I bought 2 different gaming chairs and neither of the ppl responded after I purchased them and didn't ship the items either it's been 5 days today so I'm hoping I can get my money back for the first one so I can buy from someone serious. ***USE EBAY***,1
13909,üëç,5
13910,Used to be easy. Buy and sell period. Now its so scattered with ads I can't tell what's what. So SLOW and laggy. Such a mess!,1
13911,"This app sucks. People leave you messages like they want to buy something, but they only want you to respond back because they want to know if you're still on the app.",1
13912,"I can't stand that you went from a 'neighbor from neighbor' selling platform to repeated commercial business sells. If I chose 'pick up', I expect for it to be in the area of my chosen city, not across the state. I am frutrated that I choose something to look at one time, and then more of the same pops up. If I want to look at all cars or all tables, I would look under that category on my own. Usually, when things choose to be new, the words 'and improved' follow. Not in your case. Boo",2
13913,"everybody either doesn't respond, or asks you to pay through means outside of the app.",1
13914,great service,5
13915,"A good option to sell stuff sitting in my house. However, 1)after exchanges multiple messages, I should be allowed to rate buyers. It's frustrating seeing these 5 star rated buyers who ghost you last minute. It's biased, skewed ratings when you only rate if they actually show up and buy the stuff. 2)turned the notifications off, but I still get purchase suggestions though I don't buy 3)the app loads slowly bc the 1st page it opens to is items being sold in my area, which isn't relevant to me",4
13916,"NEEDS UPDATING, LOTS OF FLAWS!",3
13917,I was scammed on this app when I contacted offer up said they could not do anything I don't believe that when I bought the item they sent me a Fake video and and Fake pictures when I took the item home realized it was broken the previous owner knew it was broken offer up will not to take countablty,1
13918,great app just make sure sellers product are authentic and be safe when meeting people you don't know with big purchases,5

13924,"Shipping confusion...No one to talk to for correction. I underesimated shipping. I pulled the package, post office voided transaction, buyer no longer wants, but OU doesn't know that. They keep wanting me to ship. Should I let it cancel on its own? First time in 2 yrs this happened.",3

13926,All downhill after letgo merge.,1
13927,The forced ad are super annoying,1
13928,This is the S..L..O..W..E..S..T app. It is also the largest app which might explain why it's the slowest. I don't like the fact that you cannot renew your items. also I do not like that items do not self-delete after 6 months or so. There are items for sale that are years old. I would like to be able to search my own listings with a keyword. It takes forever to scroll looking through my own items.,2
13929,Your only allowed to sell one item at a time,1
13930,It doesn't have everything but it's a good app.,4
13931,"whether I'm selling or buying, I ALWAYS find what I'm looking for. People respond very fast. I'm grateful for this free app.üëçüòâ",5

13935,Hard to switch through the items keeps locking up on screens have tokeeprebooting,3
13936,You're really going to charge people 15% of their sale then give everyone else an ad for sending a message? Absolute garbage,1
13937,very effective,5
13938,Horrible app,1
13939,"app itself works ok. The cons are: the amount of sponsored ads blended in; the length of time people can leave their ad up without it disappearing...no point in expressing interest on anything older than a month. ...then there's the users (not really OfferUp's fault) who just don't respond, which seem to be a majority of my interactions",3
13940,was never able to sell anything on that full of low ballers,2
13941,always great buys,5
13942,I got my iphone 13 for a decent prize happy with it honest person thank you,5
13943,only things I don't like about app is your filters are not saved even after you just go to another part of app or leave app and come rite back in a few minutes. your filters are gone where you saved or put certain way goes back to default beginning and the app don't make old cars that are sold takin off or cars been on there for a year or more and you can tell the car was sold or parts car was long gone but yet it still on app.,4
13944,"Super easy, convenient",5
13945,need more ads,5
13946,you can find everything!!!!!,5
13947,"They fixed the about issue now but it let someone in another state log on and delete my account now they are saying that's permanent and can't be reversed. Seems like there would be some verification on a permanent account deletion especially when it's a login from a new device in a state the account has never logged in from. The predictive suggestion emails are garbage. I get offered a tank top, a fishing boat, and gas can after searching for ""fish tank""",3
13948,This app is too slow can't get anything done on it have made some money but it is too much of a hassle they need to fix it keeps on freezing and acting up if it was not for that it would be 5 starts and the notifications don't pop up.,2
13949,Update: I would recommend using a different app. The pop-up ads with this app are ridiculous. They're all different so it's extremely hard to exit out of them and it's done intentionally in a way where it intervenes with what you're trying to do. Original post: Great place to buy and sell used items.,1
13950,the best,5
13951,The app is so laggy and has a mind of it's own. Please add the option to post and edit stuff on computer. It will be so much better.,2
13952,Bad app My account got deleted for posting something legit! I wasn't trying to get around the rules LKKE MOST PEOPLE ON THIS APP and I got deleted. I tried to contact customer support and I got no answer. FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE Is the way to go!,1
13953,"Don't even bother with this app. Craigslist app is great!! Doesn't crash, works with minimal cell service, often you can text seller which is way faster than the app messenger, They have more filter options, prices/deals seem to be better, no ""shipping"" option. OfferUp - you have a ways to go to compete with the OG buy/sell site. If crusty ol craigslist can come up with a useable app, what are you doing???",1
13954,love this app use it every time I need something,5
13955,Yep,5
13956,ease of use mostly very friendly acquaintances,5
13957,"Very Good, met onto every friendlyüëç",5
13958,The app keeps glitching over and over and I am having a hard time sending messages. It literally made my screen show a screen within a screen multiple times and ONLY after using your app. I have NEVER experienced this issue prior to using your app a couple of days ago. i powered off and on my phone multiple times. I even uninstalled and reinstalled your app and I still experienced the same problem. Not sure what happened to your app. No real issues until now.,1
13959,offer up app is a great app it not only helps you get rid of stuff but helps the people who need. what your selling,5
13960,"overall, it was a very good experience",5

13963,Non serious people should be penalized. So many people have messaged me only for them to A. Leave me on read and B. They never get back to me Edit: had to drop my review down to a 1 star because now i feel like ive been shadowed banned. Been posting popular items at a decent price and only been getting a view or 2,1
13964,very helpfull app.easy to use the best offers in the earth,5

13966,Perfect,5

13968,Excellent,5
13969,"Video ads now??? Literally have to watch an ad so I can send a message, this isn't even worth it anymore. Craigslist here I come!!!",1
13970,"Give me back letgo this app sucks in comparison, it's slow, crashes often, and is overall a drag to use",1
13971,"This app has an Archive feature that can unlist what you're trying to sell at will. This renders the overall service unusable at a point. It's basically a data collection app pretending to help you sell stuff. Just go to eBay, this isn't the new version of that, it's the exploitative fake version of that.",1
13972,My account was disabled for reporting a fraudulent listing. Never bought or sold anything. I'd recommend avoiding OfferUp and using Facebook Marketplace or craigslist.,1
13973,I don't think there are any buyers on this app. Four items posted for 10 hours and not a single message. This app is dead. UPDATE: 28 FEB 2023. Four items still posted weeks later with not a single message. This app appears to exist solely due to advertisement revenue from all the garbage retail advertising. This app is not connecting buyers and sellers. It should be removed from the Google App Store.,1
13974,"Samsung s21 Ultra Can't even post a listing . It let's me put in info but on the last step of posting the ""Post"" button is dead and does not respond even after loging in/out and also reseting the device and uninstalling the app.",1
13975,sellers are not reliable,2
13976,If I wanted to shop at a retail store for items I would either go to the store or search their website. All this app has become is a free bulletin board for businesses and ads. It's a shame. At least figure out a filter to screen buying from individuals or businesses. Aggravating and completely useless it seems. Other apps are doing much better now.,1
13977,always impressed with what I can find,5
13978,Banned for no apparent reason. I cannot interact with buys nor sellers.,1
13979,"it's an easy app to use, but because of that I feel that it's the reason that a lot of people don't come through when buying or selling items. I think that if people had to do more to create a post, then they wouldn't flake all the time",3
13980,Experience is outstanding!!!! Keep up the great work!!!,5
13981,Excellent,5
13982,"This app is terrible. I have tried numerous times to install on my laptop and it absolutely will not do it. It says ""no compatible device found."" What? Only phones work? I prefer to work off my laptop, not make an ad through a tiny screen. I give up on this app. It's not usable, in my opinion.",1

There is no place to add sellers profile, just a name. Loading mutiple pictures sometimes works. Doesn't compare to the ease of Letgo which is really hard to Letgo of comparing.",1
13991,Goog to smoll bisnes,5
13992,One of the slowest apps in the world. If I press on an item at 6am by 756 it'll barely show the item.it took 2 days for me to have a conversation about buying something.usually by the time my message sends people have already purchased it,1

Offer up then said my offer was declined, with no explanation as to why??? I think Offer Up should be paying attention. Every bunkbed listed was over 3 months old and most likely already sold!",2
13995,Nothing is persistent. Absolutely hate That I have to fix location and search type every single time And every new page or tab,2

Unfortunately nows these ads are always randomly popping up and it's super irritating and inconvenient! Would rate 5 starts but the pop up ads really brings the joy out of using the app!",3
14003,Terrible. I had like 10 things for sell and couldn't get any views or sell anything. Letgo was so much better. I'll will never use this app again. Don't waste your time.,1

14005,"free Hummel's not only were they a delightful surprise, but they were also of such high quality. I am so appreciated,thank you for everything.",5
14006,Keeps crashing every 30 seconds. The best is now it won't let you list an item for sale.,1
14007,"I've been using this app for not even 24 hours & I'm already over it. The first item I posted was a breeze. The items after, as soon as I post it....it gets removed. I've sent emails about my issue. I was sent an automatic reply about have to log out of my NEW account, restart my phone, & then log back in. That worked ONE time. Not really having high hopes for this app. I'm wondering why I even have to have the app to post stuff for sale. If this continues, I will deleting it and going elsewhere",1

14029,it's a good app,4

14042,so many messages asking if still available. or I want to buy it. then you never hear from them again. not to mention the totally insulting offers to asking price. I think offer up has people contacting sellers with still available or I want to buy so you think your add is at least getting some attention but like fake news these are fake inquiries.,2
14043,"Horrible app, I been banned from app but they give no explanation or email regarding to my banned. In addition, I'm also risking someone else phone to log in resulting for there banned too. What terms and conditions have to do with them to be banned? Just because I'm banned doesn't mean you have to banned the other. Til this day I don't even know what I did to deserve this banned.

Well except it didn't have big fish money... Letgo was hands down in every aspect a million times better platform! So why wouldn't OfferUp just put the bigass name over letgos but keep the app exactly how it was? I would on average buy and sell items on letgo at the very least 2-3 times a week! On OfferUp not one....",1
14046,EXCELLENT DEALS! LOVE IT!,5
14047,when texting other people the app free es up just about every time.it clears up after a minute or two,3
14048,Needs better filter improvement. I cannot even find the items I listed to sale anywhere on this platform. For example. The CD recorder studio. I looked everywhere for 30 minutes on this site and found nothing pertaining to my listing. There are all sorts of items mixed in. It is like the filters don't even work.,2
14049,It's archiveing my posts and like I just spent all the time listing it now it's not gonna be posted anymore try to un archive it nothing happens,1
14050,"what sells, I don't know",4
14051,I really like this app. I always find good deals on here.,5
14052,Too much Spam! It's become impossible to find legitimate sellers and products. So many scammers. Some stuff for sale has been on there for months or years and between those two It's just congested with too much nonsense.,1
14053,Needs better filters for spam/overposts and Offerup is way too invasive with privacy practices. Prefer CL because of that.,3
14054,the lady was the best. thank you again. good luck to you.,5
14055,"the app will tell that it has found items related to a recent search. unfortunately it doesn't highlight a few items. No, it brings up anything remotely related to the item. a real waste of time.",3
14056,no sales,1
14057,Its good to buy stuff but the app blocks me from selling! Ive tried new accounts. I think its a fatal error. Even tried on iPhone and same result. I see people selling actual junk. Not cool.,1
14058,easy to use and post items for sale. also easy to communicate with interested parties,5
14059,Don't waste your time on this app the cost of living is so high even products on this app is expensive please explain to me how in the world used stuff cost more than going to actually store and getting the same product for the same price (( BRAND-NEW )) here's the fun part when you buy that product at a store the owner willing to give you discount but not the sellers on here forgetting that they're stuff are used,1
14060,easy to use and fast selling app lots of choices on things to buy huge community as well,5
14061,works as intended no real issues so far.,5
14062,i can not add any more apps to my phone. i need to go back to being able to post from my computer. it started out as a really good site but it gradually gotten worse starting with not being able to post pictures of what i am selling and now cannot post from compjuter at all. not everyone lives on their phone.,1
14063,Good üëç for me Sabrina.,4
14064,Very slow app. Takes forever to launch. Zooming in on photos is very difficult. Easier to screenshot and then zooming from native photos app. Also messages notifications for suggestions is not cool. Otherwise a good app.,2
14065,"By far the simplest and most user friendly app I have tried thus far. From sign up, to selling products online,it's done according to your ideas and decisions...And you decide how detailed you want to be, or to keep it simple...

14066,"I get that the app needs to make money. However, not allowing sellers to repost products basically forces them to use the paid promote feature if they make the mistake of posting at a low traffic time. This feels scummy. Also, users can rate sellers but not buyers. I'd like to be able to rate people who say they are going to show up to buy and never do, or just stop communicating without saying anything. It would help other sellers avoid people like this.",1

14071,"I definitely think there should be kind of a comment section of someone's post or section of whatever is trying to be sold. Obviously the seller should have a choice on whether or not he/she wants it to be allowed, but I think it it would benefit both parties. Let's say someone is selling a Rolex, and let's say it's fake. they have pictures of it up but the seller legitimately has no idea it's fake...someone's comment of it being fake could help save the potential buyer aka victim.",4
14072,really good deals,5

14081,"This app is terrible, it shows old posts constantly, from 4-5 years ago. You would think they would expire but they don't. Never see new ads",1

It goes against the guidelines and they'll delete both your accounts lmao what tf? I guess I'm not allowed to have a tablet lmao waste of time. Don't install.

14097,Great items on this app,5
14098,"As a seller: If you want to attempt to write the same sentence agonizingly slow over and over after the app crashes again, very little engagement, & people trying to scam you by sending them money through PayPal then go for it. Just don't expect to be selling to anyone you can't meet in person because offerup won't even think about initiating the payment until days after you've mailed the item to the buyer and they then (after a time) chose to buy it. If not, pray they get it back to you thesame",1
14099,"it used to be on top of my top apps for buying local items. Now, when I look for something most of the items are from stores, wholesales, warehouses adds. almost at the original price. Facebook market place way much better.",2
14100,Honestly OfferUp is about 80% people trying to scam 10% people just messaging once and then never replying again other 10% are good people who use this ap as intended. Now you get spammed with full screen adds every 5 minutes. Uninstall useing Facebook instead.,1
14101,Many Services & Great items for Sale,5
14102,"Gives you one free post but when I posted it never ended up getting posted, then I tried to repost and it wants money now. It's a scam.",1
14103,Great site. Sellers are reasonable.,5
14104,Ok,3

14109,"it's a hit or miss sometimes, definitely found some good deals and alot of overpriced and mislabeled items.",4
14110,Very easy and quick way to sell stuff for extra money,5
14111,"app sucks on Android and crashes every few minutes, and now it has the audacity to keep asking me if ""I love"" OfferUp, well enough is enough, no I don't love this app on Android it's borderline unusable but guess what, I have no other convenient way of using it. I have to often force close the app multiple times just to be able to use it for a few minutes before it crashes again and the process repeats. I'm giving it 2 stars and not 1 because the platform is good the all for Android isnt",2
14112,I was just told about this up here where my medical appointments are thankyou I'm hoping to find some sorta cheap vehicle so I'm ot having to be on my ankle so much I fell with my oldest daughter it's way too difficult walking out there exapecially having to go back and forth downtown someone stole my vehicle after I paid them to put a altinator now I don't have a way around,5
14113,it could be better. surprised it's even still around.,1
14114,Everything in this app is more expensive then Ebay and to sell u don't really sell much here so if u plan to sell get ready for the waiting game u may sell stuff when it's like 5 years latter if ur lucky,1
14115,Top üëå Best,5
14116,People keep selling me broken stuff all the time and I accept the stuff before I realize it's broken üíî so then it can not be returned,1
14117,Great finds. Easy to sell on also.,5
14118,I tried to text people I wanted to by from and it kept saying I have to do a Tru something like that and I don't have a ID to do that so how am I going to do that it also freeze alot and lags or sometimes crashes,1
14119,always takes care of our Ned's special intimesof need,5
14120,I like this app so far. I find it easy to upload my items. The layout is user friendly as well. I absolutely love the job search feature. It really pulls up a serious number of job opportunities for my local area! Excellent app! I highly recommend it!,5
14121,"App is so slow. People never show up. Very annoying having everyone ask if the item is still available, people only want to pay stolen prices.",1
14122,still a reliable source for buying items,5
14123,Site allows scammers on it.,1
14124,I live this shirt. I'm certain I'll be asked where I got it from. Wearing it in Chicago in July.,5
14125,Not user friendly üòî terrible,1
14126,This annoying app has an inbox that keeps sending me notifications about related items for a car that I search for one time and I haven't owned in over 10 years. No matter what I look for as far as turning it off everything is off on notifications and items and things and I still get this stupid search result for a car that I don't own anymore. It makes me not look at the app for things I'm selling because I'm sure it's just this stupid inbox junk and I can't get it to turn off.,1
14127,to many posts of BS / fraud a long with people who post then do not respond..,2
14128,So many rules and restrictions. I can't use my VPN while I lunch this app. I have asked them about it no answer.,1
14129,Doesn't work on Motorola G5+,1
14130,I like it!!!,5
14131,No one is getting my offers,2
14132,Works well,5
14133,Been using it for awhile after they fixed a bunch of bugs... Now it just crashes every 30 seconds... Seems to be related to when you're scrolling,1
14134,Was great helps selling almost everything,5
14135,"The app is constantly crashing and closing out whenever I'm really far down the list of items, then I have to re open the app and re type what in looking for and try to scroll back down to find it. It's happening constantly and it's not my internet connection.",1
14136,I don't know why you can't make it to where you can use your computer as well as the phone in order to do anything with your selling items or buying items you are limiting what your customers or clients can do which makes no sense,1
14137,ads. ads ads seems your headed down craigslist's path,3

14141,"Can this app be any slower?? Its not my internet nor my devices I have it on multiple devices as well & its still slow on every single one... it takes about 2-3 mins just to open the app. (Yes, I timed it) about 4-5 mins to open & or to send msg. Besides the bugs, randomly freezing its a decent app.....sometimes.",1
14142,Funk your adds! You're ruining your app!!,1
14143,I really like how easy it is to sale something or buy something,5
14144,Nobody is buying from this app it seems,3
14145,There customer service still has not responded to a billing issue from 2 months ago,1
14146,Gets back to you and has nice quality products.,5
14147,So much good stuff üò¢,4
14148,Message don't works and very slow.,3
14149,App isn't allowing me to share items posted by sellers,1
14150,"Slow, very slow. Oppressive; you cannot share your location but they'll suggest a safe little meetup spot, gaf.",1
14151,"all plants is amazing, thank you very much",5
14152,I like offer up because it has a lot of good things on there and the people that are on their call you right away they really take care of business they really take care of you ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
14153,You can't type more than 20 characters before app completely freezes up and closes,1
14154,Excellent,5
14155,Very bad experience. Kept hanging and froze. It was good once upon a time.,1
14156,Pixel 7 Pro Very buggy and laggy a lot of times but its a good app to sell and buy when it lets you,2
14157,Great,5
14158,Very good app for both buying and selling. Used it for about 2 years now and never had an issue.,5
14159,"I posted an item for sale, and it doesn't show up in search results at all, even when I pinpoint the search to the exact text of the item's title and location. I contacted OfferUp help multiple times about this and have gotten no response or action. They probably do this to get you to upgrade and pay for boosting visibility, but getting zero visibility for not paying for the upgrade is quite the shady practice.",1
14160,Totally useless. Shows me ads that were posted YEARS ago! Filtering by date changes nothing.,1
14161,awesome app,5
14162,This app keep charging me 2 months for $21 something I never authorized When you contact customer service they saying they will refund my money but still charging me I think others gotta deal with this,1
14163,"The user interface is sleek and intuitive. I greatly dislike that I can't prevent unwanted push notifications. I only want notifications for messages from buyers, but regardless of settings, this does not seem possible. When I see a notification and it turns out to be ""New items posted kind of like that thing you no longer care about,"" it makes me dislike having the app on my device. Let me make this change at the system level, because the toggles inside the app do nothing.",2
14164,Very friendly item as described highly recommend,5
14165,"Used to be a great app when it first launched. Since then, The app has been taken over by slimy dealerships, criminals/crime, fake/spam accounts, and low ballers. Customer support is also hard to access as it is only through the app (no call center). Also notice the interface of the app more slow and not as much features as it's competitors.",1
14166,better than ebay selling nationwide and its cheaper.. unfortunately not as popular or used so things don't sell as fast but hopefully people will notice in the near future because I'm sick and tired of losing 1/4 or a 1/3 of my $ to ebay & PayPal.,4
14167,really good for selling things and very accurate,5
14168,I don't understand why offerup decides to continually lock my account for absolutely no reason at all. I do nothing but sell items as listed and buy items as listed. Offerup fix the issue üò° Update: Still randomly shadow bans me for no reason at all. I believe offerup is the worst app ever made Edit: 2 been using it still for years the lack of care of people and the sheer amount dealer posts make the app unusable. I wish someone can make a better app,1
14169,Waste of time and money to many scammers.,1
14170,so far many fake or flaky people.,2
14171,There should be an option for more pics of items for sale.,2
14172,Always have something I'm interested in or want here,4
14173,What's going on with OfferUp I made a sale a few days ago it arrived at its location on Tuesday the buyer rated the sale the same day now the app is not showing me where the money is only that its pending why is it so complicated if you can charge me a small fee and have my money the same day then you can at least tell me when I'm getting my money I have not received one notice from OfferUp as to where my money is or when I will receive it?,1
14174,great üëç,5
14175,"Freezes up after update. Used to work great. Now it freezes up very frequently. I tried clearing the memory, reinstalling it. Nothing helps. It's really frustrating to see one of my favorite apps have this type of issue.",1
14176,They can't tell the difference between wheels from a car for sale and a car for sale,1
14177,great app for selling and buying,5
14178,awesome üòé,5
14179,Slow crashing app,1
14180,Stop to much,2
14181,App is useless on Android. Crashes within seconds.,1
14182,great app,5
14183,the app is great until you get to your meeting destination. then there are major lags and delays in the app sending messages in order to find out where someone is parked or the color of their car. it happens every time,3
14184,I love selling iit is so easy no hassle.,5
14185,Now I'm going to start selling my all my stuff on OfferUp after tomorrow cuz I'm broke as a joke,5
14186,Good bargains some time,4
14187,App on iOS is so good but the android version is a piece of trash. Stop responding 5 out of 6 times and have bugs everywhere.,1
14188,app runs real slow,2
14189,takes forever to load,4
14190,"was polite,and on time",5
14191,waaaaay too many ads and just as many duplicate furniture store ads.,3

14194,items in great shape and and quick response,5
14195,Great app.. easy too use,5
14196,Unlimited postings gives an onramp to businesses/individuals to test the market potential of their merchandise.,5
14197,Report feature really does something and I feel more safe knowing they're vigilant in reducing sketchy people.,5
14198,simply easy to use and dosen't cost a thing.,5
14199,App sux balls now. Always freezing while I'm scrolling and shutting down,1
14200,"I just downloaded and listed my first item. First I had to write my description in my phones notepad and copy and paste to my listing because app kept crashing in the middle of typing description in app. Then I posted item, got an email confirming I posted it yet I can't find it and it is not listed under my selling tab. I sent a message to support with nothing but automated responses as of yet. If this is not rectified in the next day or two I will delete app and move on never to return",1
14201,whatever you need OfferUp will help you out,5
14202,"ok let's get started because OfferUp blocked my account because another user was reporting my posts for no reason. and I did the same, report his posts BUT OfferUp never blocked that other user's account. something unfair !! I asked the OfferUp workers to at least remove my cell phone number and account ID that they took from me and THEY DON'T WANT TO. I cannot open another account because they ask for a cell phone number and I do NOT have another number. unlink my number from that account üôÑ",1

14209,it's always freezing up and delayed,3
14210,Cool,5
14211,üëç¬≤,4
14212,it's an ok app would be better if the posts were updated and cleaned out after a while they have posts from 2+ years ago and I hate how you have to click on each item to see the price and you can't swipe through the items you have to go back each time it's really time consuming and irritating letgo was so much better it's ashame they merged and screwed it up terribly.,3
14213,"Great, easy way to sell items.",5
14214,"This review is based on how many commercial establishments and businesses are using this app for free advertising. This is no longer local people selling items they don't need from local neighborhoods. Now is car dealerships in cars for sale with multiple annoying ads. Almost in every selling category, there are more businesses than private sellers. From furniture to electronics. I would rather an app with neighbors and private sellers and not full of greedy business.",1
14215,Offer up you are a AWESOME buy and sell stuff app easy and fast to post an item on your website thank you very much,5
14216,Easy to use,5
14217,All I experienced on here was a bunch of fake buyers. Don't use this app if you're trying to honestly and legitimately sell something.,1
14218,It's slow sometimes. Kicks me from the app. Won't let me post sometimes.,2
14219,"This app started out as a cheaper way to buy and sell. Now people lowball,don't show up,lie flat out and I've been with them since the beginning. It's just sad to see things going down hill and now if u ship anything u have to pay taxes on it. Just sad",3
14220,Awesome,5
14221,aweome,5
14222,very good,5
14223,Super slow with new layout,1
14224,Horrible the period bought a gaming laptop said everything was good then I got it and the battery dies fast and it does not have the space he claim to say I payed 420 for the computer. And the seller won't respond to me. Worst experience ever,1
14225,easy installation and simple profile set up,5
14226,"it's great! Best local selling app. while it may not offer as much as Craiglist, at least you can feel more secure about who you're meeting and it is very visual and user friendly. I downloaded it 2 weeks ago and have gotten 2 free items and met 2 other people for paid products and have people interested in something I'm selling also. It's great!",5
14227,"My whole family got banned its been 3 or 4 years now :/ from different devices or accounts, just because we wouldn't text back. Sometimes because we weren't interested or we forgot to answer back that we are not interested. My mom has been upset about it since she can't use the app. Even tho she did nothing wrong just ask questions about the items and if it wasn't something she was interested In she would go back to searching not realizing she didn't respond back. caused for her dms to not send.",1
14228,An amazing experience,5
14229,very flakey,2
14230,My uncle cares about you.,5
14231,"I still get push notifications and item recommendations despite having no item recommendations or push notifications. Ship option automatically turns on at the end of creating a listing and sometimes I have to turn it off twice because it automatically turns back on for no reason. App is still slow since merging with letgo. Years later and no one has fixed it. Plenty of ads, inability to determine distance properly, dumb and cheap buyers, greedy sellers.",1
14232,VERY VERY VERY GOOD,5
14233,I look at this but haven't bought yet!,4

14239,awesome product and great customer service üëç.,5
14240,Literally everything I put up people ask me for my phone number why is that The only interactions I've had trying to sell anything have been people asking me for my number which clearly they say don't give out your phone number so why?,1
14241,"In my opinion when letgo was its own thing I used it a lot more. I don't use this app anymore, sorry not sorry",2
14242,"Horrible customer service. Ive been trying to access my account for a month now. After 20 emails back and forward explaining that I no longer have access to my old email and number. Verified my old information to validate it is my account, I still cant access it. No phone number to speak to someone. They ask for settings on my phone that have nothing to do with me login into my account, and they do not explain how to find the info they asked for. Thank you for nothing.",1
14243,"So far, so good.",5

14256,make money easy üí∞,5
14257,They get one star. This is my third attempt at offer up. Iv sold and I've bought but the biggest issue is. There are constantly scammers posting false items. A lot of post are a year old or longer and should be taken down or need to be taken down. Nothing's ever new because most post are 3 months or older. Multiple duplicate post. An there's a bunch of liars getting away with falsely advertising stuff.,1
14258,You literally can't buy or sell anything anymore this app is basically done for it was a cool app while it lasted,1
14259,I really like it is fast to sell & buy.,5
14260,"Offer up keeps dropping, i had this app for a long time, and it worked fine, but for the last couple of months it's been dropping within the first minute or two and i placed a mail order for the first time yesterday night, and today someone was trying to buy something with my credit card coincidence not sure.",1
14261,products older than 1 year should not exist unless the owner reports it each year as available,4
14262,It's a great app but every time I tried listing up an item and I hit refresh my item that is posted is gone,2
14263,I do not like this app I can't find how to delete items I get a cash register sound like someone is interested and then there is no message I do not like how this works,1
14264,The more I try to get on this app the more I get frustrated. I wish it would have more selection of items always the same like it never changes and items are listed from 2 to 5 years ago.,2
14265,great offerings,5
14266,"keeps hanging up, and I'm not sure if my replylies are getting through. may be my settings somehow.",3

14272,It's cool that I can make money on here but I think there needs to be a delete messages feature because I've messed up some sells by text something on complete accident and I loose profit on something because it was a message that I couldn't delete.,4
14273,can't add details to your ad because the app freezes. does not send notifications regularly üòï,3
14274,easy to use,5
14275,To complicated,3
14276,I wish old posts had an automated deletion process to save a buyer the wasted time.,4
14277,Works ok but not a lot of helpful features to filter what you want to find. It's a dump of everything you want and a whole lot more of what you don't. Sharing links is useless as it just opens to the home page. You can't actually share a specific item since it won't find/display what's from the link.,3
14278,"Constantly frozen and crash on Pixel 7 Pro It happens when Ads appear, please fix it. The problem makes the app unuserable.",1
14279,People don't respond!!! Or won't say if the item has been sold.,3

Original Post: They sent an email saying that my account was deleted because I violated community guidelines. I messaged customer support and asked them what I did wrong.

14301,"Update 2/19/2023: I was terrified by the sound of an android ad appearing just above where the seller location map is. They should make sure the ads are muted by default at least.

14324,As soon as tried to use it. It crashed. So disappointing.,1
14325,"good app, only prob is it freezes up when I'm trying to text others and it becomes frustrating to always close the app only to lose your text and start over again. you think it's fixable?",4
14326,App has gotten really really slow! Takes minutes to load!,1
14327,Can't download my pictures,1
14328,runs slow on Android,3
14329,"Offerup banned me when I did nothing wrong. I have asked why and NO RESPONSE. I asked for a review since I did nothing wrong, again NO RESPONSE. I used to love this app, but after they wrongly banned me, I will have nothing good to say until this problem is fixed.",1

14331,Can't sign in via Google. Gives an error that something went wrong. Very frustrating.,1
14332,This app is not reliable...is there a changelog that shows what is being worked on or perhaps a festure list of upcoming changes they will be working towards? It was working prior to the UI update...can we get a rollback to a previous working version? I'd help with Beta but you're full...hopefully we can get some answers soon.... Your search could use work....I search for oboes and only get obo...,1
14333,"App has changed for the worse. If you pay (promote) your post goes first and into the correct catagory. Overwhelmed by robo ads. The Free posts are last and generalized...oven was in household, not appliances. App is up to date, so don't bother with your robo reply 2/18/23 messages from buyers won't load in email....click back to OfferUp and messages won't load. Send reply with phone# and ask them to text.. so much for OfferUp's security.",1

14336,love this place,5
14337,"This application would very useful it didn't freeze or kick you out of it. The idea is there. It is highly frustrated to use it. ""Other applications are very easy to use and navigate. I think the one start this rating service is asking to give; it's not worth even that one star.",1
14338,it's a nice helpful app.,5
14339,always had good luck with sellers. feel secure giving people thank you,5
14340,love it,5
14341,"I had all notifications turned off, and would constantly get push notes for deals in my area and other spammy garbage. This spamware type trash is infuriating to me. The app mostly works fine, which gets it an extra star, but forced notifications is a no-go for me.",2
14342,Overall a good app but it frequently bugs out when you are typing the description of the items and crashes. Also their messenger interface doesn't let you see your whole message you've typed sometimes which can be confusing/annoying.,2
14343,you won't it they got it and if not,5

14356,Garbage not one item sold,1
14357,"Don't even waste your time. Banned my account account for no reason other than they just don't like you even after building up tons of positive reviews. out of nowhere they started to claim that I was selling marijuana, which is completely not true and I tried contacting customers to report which is all just a bunch of robots. No one even works here anymore, stick to another alternate selling app",1

14363,"I like OfferUp but the app is literally the worst. If you try to do anything beyond the front page, it will freeze or just close in a matter of minutes. In the middle of listing something? It will close without even saving a draft.",1
14364,always a good deal to find!,5
14365,If you need to ship more than one Box they only give you 1 shipping label according to USPS you need to have each Box us to have its own tracking number,3

14390,thank you,5
14391,Constant problems. OfferUp has canceled orders.on me in the past and not allowed me to sell items that somebody purchased. More recently the last 3 months they havent been sending me my payments. OfferUp owes me over $400 and will not pay out money that the buyer already had debited from their account months ago! No response on any of the tickets I have started the last few months. OfferUp is a joke! I will be hiring a lawyer if I don't hear back soon! OfferUp SUCKS!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!,1
14392,I can't buy or sell or send messages please reach out,1
14393,people scam,1
14394,giving me trouble getting on the app,3
14395,To expensive,1
14396,If you can get it to work its not bad but. To get it to work is a whole nother story it keeps crashing freezing it takes a hour or more to put something on it to sell I don't really have a dam thing to say good about it sorry,1
14397,If you plan on selling. 9 times out of 10 This app is not it. Purchased. Letgo now this app hasn't been working for over a year.,1

14399,my family is very grateful for this service.,5
14400,really helpful,5
14401,"This should be called ""ad up"" because it's loaded with irrelevant ads.",1
14402,It's a great app for selling locally,4
14403,Randomly freezes mid-use. Absolutely frustrating!,1
14404,Not great. Still waiting for the payment from my first sale and there is no customer service to physically talk to so getting help with problems is the worst experience possible will never recommend this app to anyone..,1
14405,easy to post and sell.,5
14406,Can not sell anything here. To many glitches and account gets deleted after not logging in enough.,1
14407,great,5
14408,"Wonderful App. to have! Great idea, Kudo's to the Developers of this App! Thanks, Leon Maxwell....",5
14409,App has been freezing up and crashing for the last 4 months. None of the updates have fixed it. The app is useless at this point since it won't stay open.,2
14410,"Not very good for selling items, too many lookers and swindlers.",2
14411,Great service and listings,5
14412,item was exactly as described.,5

14418,"Be careful when using this app. Within 5 minutes of using it, I had 16,860 tracking attempts. That is absolutely ridiculous and extremely disturbing. I have the screenshots to prove it but I can't post it here.. I will NEVER EVER EVER use this app again. Use at your own risk. ‚ö†Ô∏è",1
14419,very nice purchase. seller was helpful in every way. product was as described. both thumbs up.,5
14420,can't sell nothing on here,2
14421,nice way to sell,5
14422,"great ,but very hard to zoom pictures",4

14425,Awesome app,5
14426,"The entire operating model for this app is flawed and leads to folks continually saying they are coming to purchase what you are selling, only to never show up. Not only does the lack of accountability encourage rudeness towards the sellers, but is unfair to anyone else who may be interested in purchasing your items. If they want to improve the app experience they need to require down payments for folks saying they are interested in purchasing which they can lose if they don't actually show.",2
14427,Awesome so far,5
14428,"Not liking this app on my new Google pixel 7. Crashes every couple of minutes, freezes all the time, tried trouble shooting and same issue still arise.",1
14429,The app is terrible it force closes every 3 minutes or so completely unusable,1
14430,it seems to work. people here are nice.,5
14431,"I can install on my cell but not on my laptop. As a typist who additionally is having vision loss, this is frustrating. If forced to use my phone I can't type as quickly and I have to constantly check to see if I am mis-typing the tiny letters. Its beyond frustrating. These days people use multiple access styles so why lock out anyone with a laptop?",2
14432,Easily the worst app to use. If they were to get rid of all the listing older than 6 months (let's be real most people tried the app out and the bailed leaving these ghost listings) this app would be completely empty. Instead everytime you try to buy something the seller will never respond. Good luck getting a hold of the non-existent support if payment isn't auto refunded. They tell you to restart your phone. Absolutely useless app.,1
14433,I find great deals and I sell a lot you can find things in your budget and make extra cash,5
14434,great apps for personal selling. I never have any issue using it's shipping label and payment system. Very Safe!,5
14435,very convenient to use,4
14436,Notification and suggestions do not relent even when all alerts are off,1
14437,Found exactly what I've been looking for with a great price,5
14438,Crashes freezes up,1
14439,I was able to sell several items by using this app. It is easy to use.,4
14440,Let go was a great app. Offer up is terrible!,1
14441,the price is cheated,1
14442,What an easy way to sell stuff . Great way to shop and the app is easy to use.,5
14443,Really nice guy,5
14444,Offer up sucks now ...way too many ads ..it's ridiculous.. every 8 post have a ad and when you hit it your rerouted to another site ..I think I have a bad virus... horrible üëé,1
14445,not good for selling just view,1
14446,The app definitely works and offers a lot of options for selling. but the major issue I have is how long it takes for someone to actually take notice in your product.,2
14447,Liked THANKYOU,5
14448,app slow and clunky,3
14449,Always freezes unless you write description in notepad then copy and paste also hate how you have to use the app to post and can no longer use a computer to post.,1
14450,I bin using offer up but when i made a new account its bin over 4 months no one has contacted me to help me why i cant chat with no one or ask for a product or post anything it says an error when i trh to read the message you get when you first post a product so this app is terriable they dont even contact me back to help me i think LETGO is a WAY BETER APP Edit 2/14/23 it got worse now i cant access my account i have over 100 sells and 5 star ratings. Im about just done with this app. Trash!,1
14451,"Told I violated community guidelines but not which one or how. All I've done is listed one item for sale which I later marked as sold because I sold it on craigslist. It's been real I guess, bye.",1
14452,Keeps crashing,1
14453,Good,5
14454,Finally fixed many issues.,4
14455,"DO NOT USE THIS APP!! Use Ebay, sure they may charge you a bit more but you will not have near the amount of frustration that using OfferUp causes. The last five things I posted they removed for ""violating"" their terms, however a search of the same item brings up multiple posts of identical items as well as paid ads for identical and similar items. Do they reply when I question the removal? No they do not. Hell even Craigslist is better!",1
14456,"Other than I have too often uninstall and reinstall because it won't notify me, overall it's a good app for selling",5
14457,üëç,5
14458,A bunch of scammers,1
14459,Freeze up while writing descriptions!!!,1
14460,I've sold stuff on other apps before and it took very little time to get a response from when I posted the item... I havent received much of anything on this app.,1
14461,love this site for sure,5
14462,Euclid unified states,5
14463,"I've had success selling a few items on here and am currently looking for another vehicle, and the people I've reached out to seem genuine, not so many scammers like Facebook Marketplace. The website runs slow sometimes and you can't delete items you post, only archive them. If not for these 2 minor things I'd give a 5Star rating. Consider this a 4.5",4
14464,"My listings were archived for no reason and taken down. Got an email stating the acct needed to be verified, yet no instructions... Fuqq OfferUp",1

14466,"Since you don't show the price with the picture, then I'm not interested. I also read your reviews and realized that you basically suck. Uninstall!",1
14467,Wonderful site for connecting buyers & sellers!,5
14468,Works good but so many ads and this app needs a delete option on the listing other than sold if item does not sell,4
14469,"So far.. I find the OfferUp app easy to browse, find answers, also answers to questions I hadn't thought of yet. Post ya'll in a few weeks, after I've had opportunity to put app in motion : )",4
14470,Kind of annoying because I can never understand or see or get in touch with the people who would like to purchase an item I posted,1
14471,Hehe your app broke the 1st time I made a sale how in the heck is it making me money if it's broken slow lags and the links don't work I haven't seen a site or app that terrible today!??,1

14473,super easy üëå,5
14474,Edit: What is going on with this app? It has been really glitchy/laggy. I love the app but something is up. Update: 2023 This app is extremely buggy and shuts down. Tons of spam is now flooded on this app. It's almost un useable.,2
14475,Constant freezing,1
14476,"Terrible app, keeps freezing. Too many adds.",1
14477,good app,5

14480,easy to use,5
14481,excellent,5
14482,good,5
14483,"Edit: Fast forward 2 years from my original review, and things haven't gotten any better. They actually seem to have only gotten worse. This app no longer seems to be for the small time individual seller type. The majority of the vendors on here now are car dealers, appliance stores, and people selling their merchandise that has been stolen from the big box brick & mortar retail locations. In my opinion those vendors are ruining the platform by absolutely flooding the sales postings.",1
14484,Used this site for years since middle school or better. Early birds you'll love it. Been a lot of thanks to craigslist helping society bring people together sale buy trade blah blah blah. 110%,5
14485,its good for the first day then pay if you want even an honorable mention. it sucks thats what i think of your service.,1
14486,Great app to buy and sell new and used stuff!!!,5
14487,Absolute Trash. Doesn't let me select the photos in my Google Photos with all permissions already granted. And there is not web feature to post them.,1
14488,"Counterfeit items all over the app, especially from this seller: (only reply on ig:duxbelt)",1
14489,it help me get what I need for cheap or for stuff I don't use,5
14490,There is no reason to lock me ot when I arising my VPN on a public network to protect my identity and information as all people should do in public or open wifi connections. Makes the app unusable. Long time user.. no more. I have to try MarketPlace I guess...,1
14491,"Awesome, resourceful app to buy or sell items",5
14492,üëç,5
14493,Very kind and professional.,5

14496,"It was fine until I signed in. Now it takes about 4 minutes for every page to load. Tried to sell something and everytime you go to list the app just freezes, which explains the lack of for sale postings no matter where you area.",1
14497,"Good app, but FBI has DIRECT access to ban you. Offer Up uses Amazon Web Services, which is run by Amazon. Amazon gave the FBI, CIA, and other government agencies servers and access to AWS. Not only does FBI track keywords and people, but they can ban you from the app just because you use it. FBI targets political enemies, which include Libertarians and Conservatives. I was banned for simply trying to sell computers.",2
14498,great price even bought a tail hitch rack. very fast and friendly,5
14499,"I like the transactions and communication, but it locks up my phone from time to time",4
14500,great place to find treasure,5
14501,"Runs awfully slow, and is privacy invasive. It's not enough to have a well-reviewed account, no - it requires, at a certain point, a photo of your ID and face. I was in the middle of messaging a seller and suddenly i had to jump thru these hoops before i could send another message. God knows if they actually use that data responsibly. The built-in program that ""helps"" you take the ID photo is god awful, and barely works. It's got a populated marketplace, though. ugh.",3
14502,Seems to just be a lot of commercial sellers posting near full price goods,2
14503,I am very impressed,5
14504,It keeps sending me search alerts when I have it toggled off. It will never stop. I'm deleting this app because it is annoying me,1

14509,This app is trash. I'm almost certain the messages you get are fake from OfferUp to keep you using the App. 8 people messaged me for a desk and every single one ghosted me once a price was set or a pickup time was scheduled.,1

14544,Where do I begin? Tons of ADs mixed in the listings that look like listings. Cars for sale in the free section. Listings for items listed a year ago or more. A listing of mine was removed for violating the rules because they determined it was an advertisement. It was not. The site's kind of a mess.,1

14555,"excellent place to shop and sell. I always find interesting things, and the sales platform is easy to use. Just follow the instructions enter a few lines of information and voila! you're selling stuff. I have only ever had one instance where the app kept freezing up on me and I would need to shut it down and open it again to use it. That was long ago, and since then everything has run smoothly. overall I'm happy with it. It's nice to have another place other than e-bay or Amazon to shop",5

14579,"Overall, nice App. We've noticed some filtering limitations. Also, would like an ad free option.",4
14580,they need to implement a feature that requires sellers to respond to all mesages before marking annitem read.allow consumers to rate even if they didnt buy any item.and take complaints more seriously.reminder.mental health is important.help those people as well with mentioned above concerns. ill change my score once my problem with a seller is resolved(if ever),2
14581,Update so far OfferUp has denied to do anything more than cooperating with the police but so far they've been telling me that since it is considered petty theft and intimidation they have higher priorities rn. SO thanks offerup for not protecting you inperson buyers! I would appreciate 2 things 1: full refund for the small amount I Had losted (like you do when you take 13% from sales online Via your app) 2: Plz fix the glitching & kicking me out when posting a item. fix both please ü§¨,3
14582,Interest?,3
14583,"Really bad. I go to ship items and then after i leave the post office, offerup cancels the sale... why? ebay is a giant in this game and they let customers and sellers do their own customer service. why would offer up think they should step in and cancel a sale after you ship!!!? twice now. I end up looking like a bad seller to my customers because they get the item for free .. making me have to ask for them to re-buy.",1
14584,New,4

14593,"Scammers galore and in android app crashes and no way to turn off notifications, not worth it and too many cheapskates",1
14594,expectacular!!,5
14595,Their needs to be away to get rid of many months to years old posting whereas the seller doesn't respond or doesn't care they still have a posting. I have seen dozens of duplicated listing that someone has done purposely. The app needs better control of postings.,2
14596,"Thank you, and very nice people, they helped me load it to the car. I feel very grateful",5
14597,"It's good way to sell your stuff, but my only hope is that if you sold something put sold, take it down.",5
14598,great platform if you can find a real person. watch out for scammers. there is paid ads so they make you pay more to be seen more. smh,5
14599,I like offer up but I don't like that all vehicle offers are from agencies. Offer up should be more for individual sale not commercial sale. I think it's a better experience when selling and buying from an individual. I hope they take all those agencies off.,4
14600,"The app is generally pretty good, and I've had good experiences buying and selling items on here! But it gives me random notifications all the time even though I turned off all notifications in my settings. I don't want to block them entirely because of course I want to be notified when I get messages from people. But it gives me notifications like ""new items matching your search"" even though I specifically turned that setting off. Other than that the app is fine!",3
14601,I sell a lot of items and this app makes it easy,5
14602,despite having changed my location I keep getting listings from my prior location. I have tried contacting offer up to see if they can take it out of the system as I cannot find my previous location anywhere on the app or by signing into the computer. these are now nuisance emails I'm getting notifying me of the things I want but that are halfway across the country,1
14603,I can't post all of a sudden. The app just keeps freezing. It's up to date. It's frustrating.,1
14604,excellent app and service I love it!!!,5

14606,Very sketchy!!,1
14607,"It has become extremely difficult and frustrating to sell on this app. Sadly it's the only option at the moment since it has a large following. Just like others commenting, the app is extremely slow / freezes / crashes / keyboard locks / failed messages. Overall a terrible experience... but, like I said, it's only option until they fix it or a rival company overtakes it. Started out just fine when I logged in 2016, what happened?",3
14608,I love offerup.,5
14609,great guy to work with,5
14610,"Honestly? App crashes semi-rarely when scrolling too fast, sometimes my hold-to-magnify bugs and creates a dead spot from the previous screen, and I still find myself using this every day. Lovely updated design, used to dislike it until I got used to it (no surprise) and often find several decent deals I just don't have the space for. Many thanks to the hardworking devs, this is a splendid app and will have me for its whole life, hopefully!",5
14611,"I loved this app, but whatever cost cutting they did or new programmers have done HAS COMPLETELY RUINED the app. It crashes constantly, and posting an ad takes you back to the speed of AOL dial-up. Why do people have to ruin a good thing to try and pump their bottom line? Gives me great pleasure when they try to and fail miserably, and they make less than before. Keep losing users, you idiots.",1

14613,awesome,5

14615,Does not work on Google pixel pro 7. Crashes every time I try to use it,1
14616,this used to be a great app. however now trying to message people is causing it to freeze up and stop typing if the message is more than three words. same goes for when you are trying to posy an item to sell. 3 stars is generous IMHO,3

14626,Easy money,5
14627,"Beware DON'T DOWNLOAD! I have used offerup frequently for years buying/ selling items. Flagging scammers whenever I come by them. I told a scammer I was going to flag him and his ""business"".

Afrer losing his phone, my husband tried logging on to his account on my phone and got ghosted unable to use his account now. Totally wrong!! Let the scammers run rampant and take over offerup!!",1

14633,everybody this is a great idea,5
14634,"Constantly crashes, it take at least 4 tryst just to list something. Awful",1
14635,I like offer up for the opportunity to sell unwanted items and to find a bargain. the only thing I don't like is that people don't delete things like they should and so there are so many ancient posts. that's not the fault of offer up tho. I've sold and bought things off this app. love the buyer/seller guarantee protection. saving me from scams. don't accept payment outside of the app! that's my advice. will keep using this app.,4
14636,"Generally my interactions have been amiable, if occasionally frustrating, anything from inaccurately posted items to confusing directions. My biggest issue is that neither the app nor the website seem able to save my preferred settings. I only want items I can pick up locally, yet every time I go online or on the app it reverts to 30 miles + shipping. Why is such a simple thing so impossible to set!?!?",4
14637,"awesome site. , awesome app",5
14638,"Offerup used to work great but now it runs slower and I'm unable to upload. Everytime I attempt to upload, it gives me the message ""attempting to upload your photos"" but tries to upload +1 photo more than what you selected. So if I select 3 photos to upload with the post, it says uploading 4 photos. As there isn't an additional photo you selected it says it's unable to upload and tells you to try again. I've closed the app, restarted my phone, used different photos all with no luck.",2
14639,I don't like how you have to press the picture to see the price,3

14647,I like it but not too much exposure from your postings,3
14648,I think it's ridiculous that you don't delete ads that sit on your site for so long sometimes years it just clogs everything up. Some of these ads have been sitting for years you don't realize there 2 years old and no one answers it's absolutely ridiculous and I hate even using offer up anymore also you email a complaint and a robot answers you with some lame response,1

14650,CRASHING ALL THE TIME!!,1
14651,"I don't know if it has to do with the area, but the majority of sellers are FURNITURE STORES! and they post the same items over and over and over again. Maybe offerUp can create a filter for ""second-hand sellers only."" I'm tired of searching for an item, only to be flooded with 80-90% store products. If I wanted brand new cardboard furniture, I'd go to Ikea.",2

14665,"I signed up & created an ad with pics for some furniture. When I posted it, the app IMMEDIATELY deleted the ad, AND gave me ZERO explanation. I tried to find an explanation for my ad being deleted but could not. It took a while, but I finally figured out by process of elimination that the app instantly deletes any ad with the word Cash in it. I had said Cash only in my ad. So apparently Offer-up classifies Cash as a dirty word!! Bizarre!",1
14666,"Nice to deal with, responded quickly.",5

14672,Great app for scams! When u post something for sale within minutes several messages will come in asking for your phone number. This is a scam because if you give it to them they want the code they sent to your phone. SCAM! They will tell u its for their protection. Pfft. Don't do it. This app also counts a verified user as someone with an email address and phone number. It doesn't consider that the number was hijacked from a scam. Verified is different than tru you verified.,1
14673,It's always crashes as your putting in your information about what your selling. You get almost done then you can't type anything. Use to never do this. Now all just put in basic info then have to explain to people the different info about it. Never did this before.,1
14674,Won't let me post I thought it was posted this jerk left me a text saying thanks for your post we really appreciate it...but little did I know it wasn't posted ...buy local don't get robbed by scammers and gangbabgers ...offer up I's a joke,1

14684,"For the past few weeks, I have been trying to list items. I'd say I'm over Offer Up, the most difficult part about using the app is it suddenly freezing while just trying to write a description. I shouldn't have to write my description 5-6 times after every time it crashes. Selling things online is hard enough as is! I really want to like Offer Up, but if I can't make it thru the listing process, there's no point sticking around! How did listing the item become the most frustrating part?!",1

14708,Do not use them there is no contract phone number and God forbid you package says delivered but it wasn't and never showed up they blame the post office all the time. Even when they have 2 day Protection they refuse to help buyer and let's seller keep your money and you don't have item. It's best to do card dispute if you don't have item even if tracking says delivered. Post office decleared my item lost even know I did missing package and went to the post office physically.,1

14730,This app pushes sellers to sell nationally so they can charge a fee and then take weeks to pay you. They basically hijack your payments from buyers. The worst experience ever. No customer support response. You can use it to buy or sell locally but DO NOT ship your item through them because you'll never get paid.,1
14731,"Horrible App! I used LetGo a long time ago and was sad to see it remodeled under the ""OfferUp"" app. I was on the app for 3 days and my account was disabled for ""violating community guidelines"". I'm not sure how this happened as they didn't provide an explanation and I can't restore my account. There's no CS to contact either. Beyond this, the app was horrible to filter, navigate, message, or post on. You'd have better luck just hosting a yard sale than using this trash app.",1

14747,"Terrible app. I wanted to use it because I was having no luck on Craigslist and I want to avoid Facebook Marketplace because I hate Facebook and I refuse to make an account. This app has been so slow and clunky and always telling me ""something went wrong."" Hard to do simple things. I remember it used to be better when it was just LetGo. I will try eBay instead.",2
14748,"Yoo. I agree with alot of recent reviews, its freezing alot rn. Yall need to patch it up. Something is wrong",3
14749,"offerup feels a bit more secure than craigslist in that profiles are attached and that there's accountability via ratings, etc.",5
14750,"When typing a message or post, the app becomes exponentially slower with every word you type, eventually causing the keyboard to crash and subsequently freezes the entire OS. Yes, I've tried multiple keyboards with the same issue. It has made the app unusable.",1
14751,I think it's lame that we have to pay extra $$ if we want more parties to view our postings of items for sale. it didn't used to be this way.,2
14752,I can only post a couple things then it freezes my whole phone. And it won't stop. How am I suppose to sell anything when I can't post anything? Please fix!!!!!,2
14753,getting a green circle round and round for several seconds sometimes so long page becomes exhausted on their end not mine.all my other apps have proper speed.and my offerup app is updated to date.site is extremely slow for android devices.,1
14754,Too many scammers on this site!!,4
14755,"best app for selling, but so slow",1

14761,nothing in my area of interest to me,1
14762,"To my scammers and the app favors the sellers protection and not the buyers. SCAMMER LOVE USING OFFERUP, because they face little to no discipline from OfferUp.",1
14763,Cool,5
14764,My name is Mike and am a combat vet who sells items online to help supplement my households income. I started account in 2016 and was recently deleted for violating guidelines. Those guidelines are not specific leaving many open to interpretation. I had posted knives once in while when I'd see others donit and get the item removed. But this time was a silicone handle cover used on anything really. Now they won't even have a dialogue w me and bow my family is short that income. NOPE,2
14765,I haven't used this app yet but have heard really good things about it.,5
14766,Anything I'm needing wanting or looking to buy or see what's comes free this is the best as well,5
14767,"I've been using this app since 2015 now all of a sudden it crashes almost every time I try to post something. It's never done that before now its an ongoing issue. There's a ton of fake scam posts on it as well. I report them all the time but they just come back. I guess it's too hard to control that but I'm no expert. I don't sell hardly anything on here when I post and I used to sell within a day or two. Now, people only want to buy if they feel like they're getting over on you.",2
14768,Great app for buying and selling things and wondering are we allowed to post kittens for adoption on here can you post animals for sale?,4
14769,LOVE OFFERUP!,5
14770,They don't do anything meaningful about scammers on their platform yet they punish and threaten users for confronting them,1
14771,I've only used the app on my personal email not my gmail. I was banned for posting a exhaust yesterday and it had the catalytic Converter with it and they said I did not follow the community guidelines with no appeal. After over 200 5 star interactions on my old account decided to make a new one under my Gmail which I use for my android and google related items. I never made a offer up account to find out its been banned when I never had one linked to this account in the first place.,1
14772,Constant freezing. Ridiculous how bad this app has gotten. Can't type a post or message without it freezing up and closing out,1
14773,I've tried to contact many people on this site and no one responds. they list and and then forget. very disappointing. if they are not active for 3 months it should be shown they are not active.,2
14774,yall erased me messages,1
14775,Lots of scammers and you can't report due to bugs in app.,2
14776,Very pleased with the furniture I brought and at a good price!,5

14782,"Freezes all the time. Can't post anything, can't message sellers or buyers without the app slowing down and freezing up. Used to be smooth, now it's the worst. I have to keep closing it and trying to post quickly before it freezes but rarely works. Super frustrating.",2
14783,Crashes constantly. Tried to sell some items and it freezes in the description area causing the app to crash. I ended up selling items on another site and removed this app.,1
14784,Frequent freezing and crashing,1
14785,maybe it's just the economy but I have had a new atv listed for half the price for almost a amonth with not a single hit I remember before the merger let go being more active before they started to charge you for exposure now I feel like an algorithm sees my item not people maybe it's different if you pay to boost pretty disappointing,1
14786,good app,5
14787,doesn't let me communicate,1
14788,great app,5
14789,Window Shop at its finest,5
14790,"The lag on the app as of lately has been crazy. App is solid over-all, just lacking on the user interface and performance. Maybe there is a better way to set up the layout of the app to improve work flow! I would love to see something like this!!! *******UPDATE******** Has gotten progressively worse. Just waited about a minute for the messages to stop bugging out. Every other app on my phone experiences no issues. UI needs a serious rework!! U Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Please fix thanks üôèüèª",1

14792,"A lot of stuff has been on the site for a while,no updates.",3
14793,A lesson in how to ruin an app and use experience!! Once was a great app. Horrible since it merged with LetGo. Searching is way too inconsistent. Way to many fake listing. Somehow it's gotten even worse!!! Everything thing is so slow and there are constant notifications even though I opted out of all notifications.,1
14794,I thonk I get a lot of bots responding or just asking if my item is still available.,2
14795,it is been good,5
14796,Something as simple as typing text shouldn't slow down and crash the app. Hope you can make an edit or a post in under 30 seconds before it becomes potentially frozen.,2
14797,Good,5
14798,Pictures too small on camera screen...,1
14799,very good,5
14800,I really enjoy this app however it does get a little bit hectic when people are trying to haggle don't want to come down to meet me saying I'm too far away and I'm right downtown right off the freeway but that's okay pictures of the safety aspect and helping us along so well,5
14801,Good when it works. App times out constantly.,2

14804,"I don't know what they did to this up, but it keeps freezing up when trying to type. Almost unusable. My cell is Samsung S22, the latest , just for the record.",1
14805,Looks more like free advertising for furniture stores instead of a site to find good local deals now.,2
14806,so far so good this has made some good side money thank you I've tried other apps they haven't been as easy or fruitful :),5
14807,"This app has became garbage. It constantly freezes when attempting to message anyone, ontop of that you have a high chance of getting your listings removed when posting anything similar to an existing listing you have,all because they want you to buy their insanely overpriced ad option.",1

It does not even allow the app to load to offer customer service stating your security certificate is not valid, or trusted. The app shows nothing in the selling section by me, and upon retrying to post it says I used all my posts for that section allowed, and requires I pay. That is not acceptable.",1

I contacted tech support and they just gave me the runaround, pretending they didn't understand my complaint, trying to blame third parties, etc. I even sent them a screen shot showing that I'd turned off notifications and another showing their notifications.

14823,Full of creeps and I did not feel safe selling items.,1

14830,yal are so good,5
14831,"This app is ok for finding rare items but it sucks for ratings. The ratings ppl receive are only half accurate since they're solely based on after sales. It's unfortunate you can't rate a seller/buyer until AFTER the sale is complete. The ""Help"" feature does not really help b/c nothing EVER comes from it! Ppl will sell right from under you after the agreement is made and buyers waste your time after leading u on w/ an agreement to buy. OfferUp does absolutely nothing about this behavior!",1

14856,Great app to sell on and purchase gently used items or new items.,5
14857,"Great app. Easy to post and you can pretty much sell anything. I do recommend for everyone to read the guidelines on What you can post prior to posting. The only downfall is it does freez up alot when changing from any search options they have, like from post to selling etc. 1 thing I think would be great if when your looking at someone's postings you can just swipe left or right to the next picture also for the browse page that has everyone's postings. Also if it had to sound notification",5
14858,"Please read the Reviews I think the 5 star ratings are not real users. The Owners & Staff don't seem to care & Paying to promote items does not help them sell either, not worth it & They don't fix any issues they just give you the runaround and nothing changes.

Unreal really how bad it has gotten.Good Luck",1

I've even contacted customer service and get generic response. Would be great to be able to block out ads from these repeat offenders. At a minimum, offerup should actually do something about this issue. Another issue is the amount of post over a year. Offerup should automatically delete old ads. I have seen many 5yr ads",1

14908,I'm very upset and disappointed with this app. I used to love it until recently when I sold something shipped it to the person and then all the sudden the sale was cancelled and I still have yet to receive my money and that was almost a month ago. I've tried multiple times sending messages to customer service that's a joke because nobody has yet to even respond to any of my messages. I've tried contacting the person who bought the item from me but of course they got what they wanted for free SMH,1
14909,Sister had it she liked it,5
14910,Good reviews.,5
14911,I have been misled and disappointed several times with purchases I've made from dishonest sellers who don't tell truth about items they are selling and since I pay cash I have no recourse to get my money back. Well-off guy in Lake in the Hills took me for $90 for washer that he lied about when I asked directly if there was anything wrong with it he and his wife both said it worked fine. A person sold printer that could not be used because it was too old to get software to use it and no cord.,3
14912,Frustrating! Locks up in the middle of trying to write the description for what I want to sell. I have to close the app and I lose everything. Incredibly frustrating!,1

14921,This is a website that I'm on every single night. I love the selections from A to Z And if you need something specific just type it in And they're good about posting the results Thank you D,4

14945,too many store/retail adds,1
14946,They want a credit card number to show you free stuff. No thank you!,1
14947,Literally just full of fake posts. You try to buy something or ask a question and there is never a reply. If you get a reply and make an offer the seller won't be able to accept it. Multiple ads that are similar but slightly different can find the same pictures on posts on eBay and other sites. If the seller has not sold anything and has just joined it's a bot that won't reply. Better off using other sites for second hand products.,1
14948,definitely a good to go place when u buy something w no hassle respectful sellers n buyers on here God bless them all,5
14949,After the latest update the app freezes after a few seconds of opening it. I'm on a Pixel 7 Pro,1

14968,"You don't get paid until after you ship the item and the buyer receives it. Plus their taxes and fees rank up there with ebay. Was better when Letgo wasn't absorbed by offerup. Wasted a lot of time on this app. You can not cancel a sale, you have to wait until several days after the sale expires and item isn't shipped. Very inconvenient",1
14969,I love this app,5
14970,"Most of the items I was looking at are from users that never respond even after a full price offer is made. Inactive accounts should be deleted. Another big issue is that I never received my shipping labels via email. No way to have them resent. It's not located in the ""chat thread"" like the useless help site states. It created a real pain during the transaction process. Luckily my buyers and I were able to handle the transactions outside of the site. Won't be using this app anymore.",1

14986,Best out there,5
14987,I just downloaded this app again because I'm so tired of trying to sell items on Facebook Marketplace but this app sucks to even look through items for sale. Everything is just jumbled together with no headliner of what I'm looking at. Just a bunch of small thumbnail pictures and no prices available to see until you click on it so what's the point in having a click on 300 useless pictures? I've never tried to sell anything on here but I don't think I even want to try.,1
14988,best app ever,5

14997,OfferUp is a great place to buy things for a lower price than you would normally find for a higher price brand new. Beware of scams. They are pretty easy to spot. Every transaction I have encountered has been positive. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the app is slow when opening messages.,4
14998,"Tried this app. Asked a simple question and the seller went crazy, vulgar and name calling. All I wanted to know is if the top drawers were real drawers or a false front above the doors. Report days ago and offerup did nothing about it. Wanted one with fake drawer fronts so blender, mixer and other tall item would fit. This was my first contact with anyone on this app. Uninstalling this now.",1
14999,So Ive noticed lately that I am hardly getting any views on items I sell and getting very little interest at all which leads me to believe that because I dont pay i am getting the ghetto service which is inadequate and therefore a total waste of time. It doesnt matter what the item is its just not getting seen. Ive had some nice things listed for good prices for 2 weeks now and gotten 3 views? Yeah bye bye offer up you suck,1

I view offerup as an upscale craigslist, but it's almost unusable, whereas craigslist works with standard PC browser, and it's easy. Once I'm done with this sale I'm uninstalling it. Oh, and I uninstalled and reinstalled, and it still didn't work.",1
15155,"OfferUp is the WORST app. You post a costly $500 item, a buyer contacts you and is ready to buy item. The buyer is on their way and arrives at the spot. You make the trip to the location. You send the buyer a message, only to learn that it did not go through. You send another message and it doesn‚Äôt send. The buyer leaves since they haven't received a response from you. You lose the sale. OfferUp will randomly choose the audit your account disabling your all post and your ability to communicate",1
15156,great app,5
15157,I love it were straight works great,5
15158,Not very good not user friendly can't reach a real person,1
15159,"It was better before they combined with let it go. Good app for selling and buying local stuff, I have sold a lot of stuff on the app and never had a problem. Just beware there are still a few scammers on there so try to meet I a public place and if at night you could always meet in front of P. D station just let the desk sergeant now what you are doing. I did this twice when I had a doubt about someone and it always worked out good.",4
15160,Great and easy transaction.,5
15161,I've been using this app long before it merged with letgo. I've never had issues until the new update. It's super glitchy! Kinda reminds me of a kid that just consumed mountain dew to wash down his powder donut..all over the place.,1
15162,Great app!!,5
15163,"God this app sucks so bad. Just awful to use. A million trackers and little ads, slowing the app to a crawl. Idk how people check messages, it takes 10 seconds to load my inbox, then scrolling is jagged and I have to click the chat I'm looking for 4 times until it actually opens. This may have been acceptable 10 years ago, but certainly not in 2023. Also, I sold an expensive item, they said they have to do ""further tax verification"" before releasing my money, their support never replied...",2
15164,"Very clunky and laggy. I'm trying to check my sales, and it's so clunky and slow. And whenever I exit viewing the details of one listing, it resets to the top of the list and have to scroll down again. The app needs to be optimized in some way to make it more fluid. Shouldn't be too hard. And I'm on stable WiFi.",2
15165,"Nice way to buy, sell, and rate transaction experience. Needs to have an expiration on posts. There's a lot at the end of the search that are years old, and the sellers no longer have the items or respond to inquiries.",4
15166,nice,4
15167,people be careful I was scam on OfferUp,1
15168,excellent way to get rid of things that others can use.,5
15169,"Got to love it, when your trying to edit or even post an item, where the app freezes then crashes, making it impossible to do anything.",1
15170,It never notifies me and the loading time for messages drags,1
15171,"Terribly slow, can't even type on this app anymore and it's been over 2 years since a fix. I guess offer up is dead.",1
15172,good shopping,5
15173,To hard to post new item.,2
15174,"The worst customer service and app of all time. Not only does the app keep crashing and me thinking it was my phone, but the customer service is horrible and frustrating. Customer service caused me to get my account banned by telling me to sign into my account on someone elses phone to see if it crashes- then proceeds to ban my account saying i have too many accounts i only ever had 1 account for over 5 years. Anyway- i am SO DONE THEY SUCK",1
15175,the layout seems a little harf to follow. I have a hard time looking things up.,4
15176,"Worked perfectly in the past, but on my Pixel 6 Pro and 7 Pro it crashes as I start to search for anything. I can still use it to make listings and respond to messages no problem. Can rate higher as soon as I no longer need to go to their site to search their marketplace listings.",2
15177,üòéüòéüòéüòéüòé,5
15178,"Edit: They now have auto paying music in their adds. Also, you have to manually adjust your search parameters every time you open the app. Search and browse formats are obnoxious and clunky. Have to search through drop down menus to find a specific sub category that you want to browse. No more free section either (that I can find). It didn't work great before, but at least it was simple to navigate.",1
15179,I get no response ever,1
15180,"Closed account, they don't let me cash out the money I have in my account. Its been like this for me foe almost a year. They kept my money so I'm done with offerup.",1
15181,Messages take forever to load. The whole app is just slow in general. Can't see prices on posts until you click it.,2
15182,"Needs to allow options for other photo albums to be accessed. I could of used this platform to sell many items however, I had to go to another site all due to access to images. Shame. Hopefully we can revisit in the future.",2
15183,"There's so many weird people on the app, I don't even know if it's actually real people or fake people, they ask me about items and then just never say anything again even though they say they want it, and 2 people really really kept trying to get me to meet up with them like they planned on kidnapping me or something, or either they just keep harassing me about the price",2
15184,I generally love OfferUp but here lately the app keeps crashing.,3
15185,I love offer up,5
15186,Beyond upset with the way this dam app has been freezing and WILL NOT LET YOU POST ANYTHING FOR SALE!!! swear I want to spike my dam phone everytime I try and post anything within the last couple months... it did the exact same thing 8-12 months ago but they fixed the problem... well now it's 10x worse than before... just as I'm almost ready to his the post item button there it goes freezing up... are you ever gonna address this issue and fix it or is it time to look elsewhere?,1
15187,Awesome and safe,5
15188,üòÇ I see your jumping on board with silencing people. Welp good luck! It's a no for me ..!..,1
15189,"Please add a function of ""Send my location"".",5
15190,Constant freezing. I cannot complete a post without the app freezing and wanting to shut down. Super frustrating!,1
15191,"Easy to get used items, but one thing I hated is pass 1 year listing still on sale. Really! I would to give 5 stars because I seenlot of sold item that listed over one years still on the listing.",2
15192,love it,5
15193,"A lot of sellers never reply, y'all should add the option to post a phone number",1
15194,Ok,5
15195,"The app takes forever and constantly freezes, what's up with that?",1
15196,fun selling on OUp...,5
15197,I liked this app a lot better when it was letgo. Now it consists of mainly garbage. Literally. Items should be screened and discarded at some point. Also you have to continuously change from local and shipping. It doesn't stay the way you set it. Then everything is so close together. I will no longer be using and I've used it 3 or 4 years now .,1
15198,OfferUp is an app that is well designed and useful.,5
15199,"It crashes a lot. Like almost every time I use it. But I keep using it, so that's gotta say something.",3
15200,Very good because it's easy seller and buy things,4
15201,"Needs to clear old listings ,not very timely",2
15202,Too many scammers. Dont waste your time like I did. Stick to eBay.,1
15203,"I got my account disabled permanently cus apparently my email had multiple accounts üòí which was not true ,no warning or anything Ive been having 1 account for years and customer support was no help",1
15204,"App takes forever to load, plus SO MANY LOW BALLERS. You can report them, but support is non-existent, so nothing happens to them.",1
15205,Very dood deals an everyone is very friendly so all around a good way to find anything you can think of.,5
15206,It's hard to find actual people selling their personal items anymore. It's flooded with businesses using the app to advertise their products. For example I search for a nightstand hoping to find someone getting rid of theirs at a good price. Instead the thread is flooded with furniture stores and their stock of nightstands. If I wanted to go to a store I'd go to one!,1
15207,This app keeps closing down you can't even finish a sentence,1
15208,"seems fake, no one is buying.",3
15209,This used to be a great Customer-to-customer app to buy locally. NOT ANYMORE. It is now floaded with resellers. So much so that it's almost impossible to find a regular person selling their own stuff.,1
15210,customer service is non-existent. works fine most of the time,1
15211,"Have used this since before the Let go merge and it does work fairly well and there are enough people now that you can reasonably expect to sell an item quickly. One major issue I have with it is the posts need and expiration date. Whenever I search for something, I find posts sometimes dating years back. There should be a time limit (30, 60 days, etc.) and if exceeded then have to repost or renew.",3
15212,Doesn't really help to put your stuff on this site nobody responds to it so obviously people aren't using it,1
15213,Exalent app one of my favorets,5
15214,all that you need in one place!,5
15215,"Been using this app for 5 years, always loved it. Now I can't even search to buy something without it freezing within 45 seconds of using it. Might be time to move on and use something else. Really disappointed as I've been a long time buyer and seller on here.",1
15216,Never got my refund Do not download the customer service is non existence,1
15217,There are a Ton of scammers now. Literally lost $290 shortly after I was recommended the app again.,1
15218,good app,5
15219,Ad city,1
15220,App is unusable and lagging bad,1
15221,Very hard to use now. Constantly crashes while browsing or trying to send message to sellers.,1
15222,A little more time but so worth it üëå sur√∑ beats market place.,5
15223,I have found so many good deals. Havent sold anything ..yet,4
15224,Not the best search filter. I search up motorcycle and it gives me cars and motorcycle.,2
15225,great app,5
15226,Check ‚úîÔ∏è this out y'all üòé,5
15227,Great for a side hustle,4
15228,"Works fast, once in a while it will freeze up",5
15229,Great offers greater prices,5
15230,I do buy and sell as my side hustle. All my items is Authentic Guaranteed from where I get them and also its been Authenticated by other selling platforms. Unfortunately Offer Up just took down my for posting counterfeit items. A lot of fake items is floating right now in this website but they never took them down while the item that you posted with very detailed picture and description is counterfeit and need to take down. Its just so frustrating and sad coz it's such a good platform to sell.,1
15231,"I needed to install on my computer b/c that's where the photos had been DWLd, but the system wouldn't let me. WTH?",1
15232,6/5 $tars easily,5
15233,Worst way to sell anything. Fast deposit doesn't even work it's been 3 days and still my money says 'deposit pending' this app sucks!!!!!,1
15234,They are letting scammers on the app to scam people for money I've been reporting them accounts if I'm going to do there job tracking scammers I should get paid or get free things.,1
15235,great platform but moves slow,4
15236,Letgo was much better before the merge. You want to make it better how about you show items that were newly listed first rather than what you think we want to look at with your algorithms new listings should be at the top,1
15237,handy,5
15238,"I'll trying to make a ""buy now"" purchase but it won't go through the payment. It keeps saying ""something went wrong"". I tried solutions but none worked.",1
15239,it's ok except it seems to stop working properly alot.,4
15240,Before was so good..no worse I can't find anything Alot of thing is for shipping and I can't trust them. Alot of problems happen I unistill it,1
15241,Best,5
15242,"Doesn't work... I tried posting a single item five times. Once a day, as soon as I selected not to use the ""boost"" feature it seemed the posting was removed. Doesn't make any sense. Ended up deleting it.",1
15243,Occupy space and time harpazo people. Offer up is opportunity in trying times!,5
15244,Looks like a good app until you see they're selling your personal and financial info. I'd ask why but I already know the speil they'd give me...,1
15245,this app is boring and never gets any good sells or buys. waist of time,1
15246,Offer Up has never failed me. I've been a user for years and never had any trouble with a buyer or seller. lots of great things posted at wonderful prices! by far the best buying selling app there is. I won't ever stop using this great app! changed my life. Amen,5
15247,helpful when your looking to not spend a ton of money on new stuff,5
15248,"I'm glad to have this app. On my phone. Very convenient with not enough time on one day.when a job and school take up all of my time. So I can get a few dollars for gas or etc. Happy so far. Good app well used, that's helpful.",5
15249,Have enjoyed using to sell my items,5
15250,The longer I try to use it the worse it gets .,1
15251,honestly I've made good money on this app. Worth it in the long run. if you can handle not getting any replies after you post it takes time just like everything else,5
15252,I leke,5
15253,so far pretty good .. except for pressure from ads to spend more money to seal the deal ; promote what your tring to sale ..I feel that it s not fair to others who don't have that in their budget to be last on the totem pole because they cannot financially afford uour promotion promises?? however..the friendly user is great and the quick responses are good..,5
15254,Not to bad if you having a car to going and getting what's for selling my husband said about this wed set and not badly if you are looking for anything you need or wanted,5
15255,Love this app,5
15256,"Has removed 2 different accounts for absolutely no reason, but indicating that I ""violated a policy"" when I haven't listed or purchased any items, nor contacted anyone to do so. My account must be getting mimicked/hacked and other people using my info or something. Stay away.",1
15257,great place to sell your stuff,5
15258,"rated e for ""everyone"" so with being stated, beware all the scammers only looking to collect your private cell. Or even worse the people who make it sound like their interested to pickup, only to not show up or stop communication with you. These people should do us all a favor and give back the phone back to your mom and pop and grow the hell up _KARMA",2
15259,i can't post or send message to people that have items that i'm interested on,1
15260,Best app yet easy to use,5
15261,"Offer up is wonderful! I sold everything I needed to with nice and reliable people without the hassle you get dealing with Craigslist. In my opinion, this is the best way to buy or sell minus the worries.",5
15262,I just wish the prices were less,5
15263,no one seems to be posting new things on here I keep seeing the SAME THINGS week after week hardly anything new not like before,1
15264,why is it such a big deal to use or trade phone numbers? I have many times that the deal falls apart because of missed messages. being able to meet at place and time is best done by phone.,3
15265,great communication,5
15266,"Pretty nice app, anything 30 days old should have to be deleted or totally updated.",4
15267,I hear its a. Good place to sell your stuff,5
15268,"Had issues with account, but was fixed shortly afterwards. Great app.",4
15269,I like the fact I can look for equipment I need and others no longer have use for. and vice versa,5
15270,App doesn't work. It crashes right away. I can't even list. It started messing up my phone!!!,1
15271,"great way to communicate with buyers and sellers, great app",4
15272,good app,5
15273,Bans people randomly...I spent a lot of tome to try to sell items to purge and move. I guess it's time to just donate to horrible salvation army and do a long list donation because offer up is lame. I hate companies that waste my time. I finally back to it this after surgery and after two posts it banned me. I was just posting my normal stuff.,1
15274,Can't sell anything. Posts keep being removed without explanation.,1
15275,"I have been using this app for many years and used to always recommend it, but it has really gone downhill, especially if you're trying to do more than just browse. The site freezes when trying to send messages to sellers to communicate about an item. Often, if you're not going to be able to send more than the auto populated/suggested comments because of keyboard freezing. The same is true if you're getting to list an item, you can't add description without feezing.",2
15276,"Slow slow slow. I have been using this platform for years. Now, seems so slow it takes over 15min to post an item for sale. Also, when trying to read messages the app glitches. Not happy with updates or whatever caused this. Please fix the glitch.",3
15277,"good experience, on time, very helpful",5
15278,i love it,5
15279,"I see an issue while looking at things already. There are items posted 5 years ago. Is it possible to shorted the time frame to 1 year for every post so that its up to date? People forget to take postings off, if they still have said item to sell they can reapply it. If this happens to the app I do think many will see it's beneficial benefits. So please fix that issue!",2
15280,"excellent communications, exactly as advertised.",5
15281,I keep having problems ever type I want to post an item. In the description I start writing and it freezes and does not let me continue. I've restarted my phone ans the same issue keeps happening ever time only in the description,2
15282,So offer up was a good app. Now it just freezes after typing for 10 seconds. Then it crashes. I'm a patient person I tried to let it catch up but I just completely crashes. It's litterally not usable in the current state I reached out to support no answer. As is seen by other reviews many people have reached out to them so apparently they don't care not sure I will use the app again if they don't care enough to respond.,1
15283,Doesn't work. Can't update phone number,1
15284,I have had really good luck selling on OfferUp.,5
15285,"The offer up concept and website are great. The app constantly crashes, runs slowly, takes forever to do anything. It used to run very well... But it has been a year with a terrible product. I've waited for improvements that just aren't arriving. I want to continue using this, but I'm about to uninstall entirely",2
15286,"some items are listed for years and have potential to be still available. if they are not available I would like a feature that asked the seller if the item is in fact available, like a reminder. it would also help to weed out the people that are no longer using the app. Also the payment side for shipping seems excessive. other payment options would be great as a well.",4
15287,makes me money,4
15288,too many commetical ads,3
15289,Great,5
15290,I don't want to give credit card info until I actually review what kinds of items you have listed. And I want something,3
15291,"every time I post an item from a simply cat backpack to a welding helmet, moments later, it says your "" item removed"" then gotta take time to contact them for no reason, just to get dry apology and be told it's an error...but seems to happen 4 out of 5 times.....horrible inconvenience. I'm sure if I post a couple gallons of water, they will think it's moonshine and remove the item. ridiculous for items ive posted",2
15292,Good 4 U.,4
15293,"Useless, dead app. No one used it in LA, useless in Chicago, no traffic in my current area. Just another digital waste of time dinosaur. May as well go back to physical garage sales and flea markets.",1
15294,fast and easy went great response,5
15295,"It's so hard to sell stuff on this app, it's full of morons that waste your time messaging you asking dumb questions that are covered in the add posted! I don't have any of the technical issues these other people have it's just the folks on there who are supposedly looking to buy your items",2
15296,The best Market place app.,5
15297,great app to sell and buy only problem is sellers do not delete what has been sold,5
15298,they kick you off the site at a drop of the hat be very careful posting things and offer up refuses to start your account back up,1
15299,Where to start..I had two seller's ship items that were in different condition than listed. I was refunded but it took several weeks. There are so many spam accounts that never get deleted. Old ads aren't removed and dormant accounts clog everything up. Many of the users are rude and make ridiculously low offers then block you. I suspect there many stolen goods being sold on here since there is no oversight and users aren't required to register with ID. Could be a great app 1/10,1
15300,Wasn't offered nowhere in my area. Even couldn't scan out far to find items for sale. Disappointing,1
15301,I think you charge the sellers too much per item,4
15302,Well can you guys make it that you dont need a phone number to post or buy stuff,3
15303,Please please don't Subscribe the promotion thingy before I subscription people could see my post I used to few messages after posting since Subscribed to paid promotion now no one can see my post Please be aware never go with subscriptions,1
15304,Great tools for everyone,5
15305,Sucks nobody in grand forks on here,1
15306,"Horribly Slow.... takes 5 minutes to open the app, select messages, open what message you want, wait for it to load then another 1 minute for the keyboard to pop up... All while slowly glitching and lagging on every click... horrible just use fakebook market unfortunatly.... So sad they have 1 competitor and they suck this bad!!!!",1
15307,"If you want to search for a specific part for a specific size, or a specific year, them this is NOT that app. It is so simple to post that no one actually clarifies WHAT is exactly for sale. All you see is a blurry photo. My personal favorite description so far ""se vende bick"". DELETED",1
15308,"It takes forever to load. Also, when you are finished posting items, and you click ""Done"", it should just go back to the beginning. You have to hit back twice or three times. That's dumb. And I'm not hearing the notification ""Chi-Ching"" sound.",3
15309,"lags but other than that, coop concept",3
15310,rarely shows items as they're listed- instead it looks for items like previous ones you've viewed. likes to pick items and send irrelevant notifications and messages to let you know about items you're not interested in. I'd like to see the newest listed items in my area- but that's not what the app does. it's a pretty lousy app,3
15311,great for getting money fast and buying used goods,5
15312,"Crashing makes it IMPOSSIBLE to list items to sell! When entering a description the app crashes and freezes. It's impossible to successfully post anything for sale.

15357,"I buy and sell cars for a living. Now, offer up is letting so many spammers advertise cars, that it is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to find a REAL ad and purchase a car. GET RID OF FAKE SPAMMER ADS IN THE CARS SECTION!!!! I'm pretty much DONE with offer up. I'll stick with Craigslist until they have fixed this big issue.... Months later, still .. NO FIXES!!!!!! And now every time i open the ap... my Samsung wallet is being opened up. Even with all permissions DENIED. Can we say... ""PRIVACY""??!?!?!?",1
15358,"Not stable on Galaxy S22 Ultra! Constantly freezes and crashes when trying to type a description while posting items, sometimes even causing my phone's UI to crash! Didn't have any problems with my Galaxy S9+, so this is a build-specific issue. Will change my rating to 5 stars once this is fixed.",3
15359,Great app,5
15360,"App now clearly states it doesn't work with a VPN and instructs not to use. No. Uninstalled, my security is more important. From previous update: Message feature is really bad. I can't see what I'm typing. List feature needs improvement to make it easier to view/reorder/compare your items saved.",1
15361,"I'm sorry, but you are using too much security in order to make purchases. Forcing people to get on stripe... I can't purchase anything off of offer up through the offer up app because of this. When I want to buy something I've to tell them to load it on a different app that doesn't do this.",1
15362,best little janky app,5
15363,Good place to sell,4
15364,This new update keeps freezing/lagging as I'm posting a new item for sale on my Galaxy S22,1
15365,"Posted an item, all seemed fine. Then a few seconds later my item was removed. No explanation, just removed. Useless app, do not bother to download.",1
15366,Not 2 minutes after I posted an item that people were making inquiries about it. Offer up is truly amazing!! Thank you offer up!,4
15367,OfferUp is amazing,5
15368,"Ngl, this app kinda blows. Between all the promo adds soliciting garbage or the fact the app itself is constantly encouraging you to spend money to sell your item(s) faster - sorta defeats the purpose of why I downloaded the app to begin with.",2
15369,1. Please enable offline cache. 2. Display the items price on tiled icon pictures in gallery. 3. Enable online payment without shipping fee for local pickup.,1
15370,Lately this is the slowest most laggy frustrating app I have. And for the love of goodness can you please make replying from the notification drop down a reality? This is literally the only app I have that makes me leave the task I'm on and fully open the OfferUp app just to reply to a simple message (such a pain in the *&*#).,3
15371,runs slow. too many adds. it tries to push you to use their shipping plan. but I have manged to sell some of my old stuff locally for some decent cash,3
15372,Bad,1
15373,awesome app,5
15374,Too much fraud.,1
15375,slow,1
15376,"Friendly, Prompt.",5
15377,The only app that you can triple your money!!,5
15378,There's so many fake ads. There seems to be more fake ads than real one's. Looking up Playstation 5 console. I expect a couple but not most of them.,3
15379,it sucks big time,1
15380,The app freezes and crashes so often that made the whole shopping and selling experience unpleasant. Please fix the app issues!,3
15381,really like offerup just wish they could get rid of old post I have found offers that were three years old,4
15382,"I love the app for the platform it offers. A place to sell things. But for some reason I have a problem with posting. It freezes up while im texting to post my items. Then the app stops working, and i have to rewrite and repost. It's becoming annoying because i try to post to offten. If your tech support team could help with this issue, i probably can sale and profit more on my items. Other than that the app is 5 stars.",4
15383,I like all the detailed options and updates offer up has made.,5
15384,great at the shop for things that you cannot find regularly in a shopping store!,5
15385,Could be improved for local face to face sales,3
15386,Are we talk mg about the app or the one I made called market place or I don't own a book to write in,5
15387,User if up for years and they haven't let me down.,5
15388,"I just downloaded the app and have spent the last 20 minutes repeating the same steps trying to set up my account. Each step bounces me back to the app page asking me to rate the app. Well, here you go. Now maybe I can finish setting up my d"""""" profile. Otherwise, why bother?",1
15389,The baseline app gives simplicity to sellersc& buyers. I would like to see a fair or great deal analysis like carguru does for cars in there app.,5
15390,Many searches bring irrelevant items or are 600 miles away.,2
15391,"Worthless app, worthless desktop site - PLEASE ADD THE ABILITY TO EDIT LISTINGS ON THE DESKTOP SITE. The app constantly crashes, which you can always foresee coming once you slowly lose your ability to type without it freezing. Oh, but of course you can't just hop on the desktop site on your laptop to edit posts with a full keyboard, that would be too easy. The site doesn't allow editing of listings, doesn't even allow you to create a new listing. What is even the point of the desktop site?",1
15392,"Sold a few items without any problems, very easy to use, no BS, no bunch of ads. I'm impressed. This app works wonderfully.",5
15393,So laggy on any Android phone I use. Please fix. Crashes often and is slow,1
15394,"Inconvenient requiring to post things to sell by phone instead of giving the option to post by computer, don't like the incompatibility with using VPN, either.",1
15395,Awesome,5
15396,No one ever responds.... feels like tons of fake people or items.... have never been able to get anyone to reply to any message,1
15397,won't let me add payment info,1
15398,"Good transaction, knowledgeable seller",5
15399,Great,5
15400,Freaking great app!!! Love itüòÉüëç,5
15401,This is crazy üëå!!!!????üò≥,5
15402,I go to offerup daily to both buy and sell. Scammers are pretty easy to ascertain. Most deals are good deals not a scam.,5
15403,lack of support to the users,1
15404,Great way to sell things you no longer need!,5
15405,"No, I don't need items picked for me ,or related items from sellers, or items from sellers I follow. Leave me alone with these kind of messages, and let me search for what I need by myself.. annoying!",1
15406,I just started using offer up and had a terrible experience. The UI is very glitchy and my account was disabled twice within 2 hours without them telling me the exact reason when all I posted were items that I have for sale,1
15407,Great,4
15408,I love Offer Up! Best app for buying local or I can have items shipped to me if I find them at a distance! So easy to set up a profile and start selling! Start making money people! Try it today! Thanks Devs!,5
15409,How is it F,5
15410,ü•≥,5
15411,so far so good I like it,5
15412,Great app for finding anything you want or need !,5
15413,Constantly freezing. Can't even type s complete a sentence without it closing due to ot becoming unresponsive,1
15414,Is anyone else experiencing lag? I'm trying to post something but it keeps freezing. I switched from my phone to my tablet in case it was my phone but same lag. I then tried signing in on a desktop and I can't edit my half detailed post.,1
15415,"Great way to buy and sell! Haven't met a bad person yet, and even made a few friends!!",5
15416,the site keeps freezing up and I'm unable to post,2
15417,üî•,5
15418,"Better of selling stuff on eBay and flea market. Really, no one comes on this website to buy stuff, then they make you pay a monthly fee to have them advertise losing money in the back end ü§î üòï",1
15419,keeps removing my items I'm trying to sell automatically. annoying. never happened before.wont be using this app again.,1
15420,Great way to buy things. Tried posting a few items but photos never uploaded.,3
15421,"3 stars down to 1 star Good app but could be much better. Used to be great pre-2019. During and after, this app has gone to trash. To much useless up-dates turned this application into a complicated pointless app. Don't download this app! For some users this app may work (new users) but for the most part, this app is not going to function as you'd expect.",1
15422,I can't write questions to people because typing lags 6-8 words behind. Then sometimes doesn't ever catchup. Craigslist is gonna be my go to if this isn't fixed. It's not my S22 phone.,1
15423,I used OfferUp for many years I was robbed and reported to them and they still allowed the people who robbed me to do this I was never told that they were going start changing u for using offers up thanks a bunch not an way too do business with the public if I had my way you would be shut down. I do own my own business and I wouldn't charge people who are trying to make an small profit now days most of the time you make an appointment to sell and the person doesn't keep the appt. Your out of gas,1
15424,A versatile app for online marking.,5
15425,Great,5
15426,this is a good app to sell stuff it can be a little laggy but overall still works,4
15427,Use to be good but now I can't post anything without it freezing and crashing halfway through writing the details so dang frustrating update and fix offerup NOW,3
15428,good sh*$!,5
15429,Trash fb marketplace has killed this,1
15430,"Unable to describe my item for sale, the typing is freezing up",1
15431,awesome,4
15432,es buena se vende rapido,4
15433,EVERY POST IS BEING FLAGGED AND REMOVED AS UNTANGLE PRODUCTS. SO DONT BOTHER USING THE APP UNTIL THIS GETS FIXED.,1
15434,Excellent,5
15435,I don't like the way the pictures are set up,2
15436,This app sucks! It freezes half way through typing up a question for a seller. And everybody on it that is selling literally thinks their junk is worth gold. Nobody will negotiate on price. The sellers will not lower their impractical prices. As the months go by the same sellers are still trying to sell their junk at the same price. Nobody will budge. Waist of time.,1
15437,Many items looking for to furnish home,5
15438,"Horrible experience! Go to eBay instead!! I sold an item and shipped it in a timely manner. Then, I realized they did not mark it shipped and reached out to them to ask them to correct it. They responded that the item ""was never scanned by the post office"" and therefore they cancelled the sale. End result? I do not have my item nor the money. I was robbed and they did nothing to help me.",1
15439,The OfferUp app consistently crashes on a Google Pixel 7 Pro and on a Google Pixel 4a 5G phones. Unable to browse or send messages before the app crashes/freezes and needs to be forcefully closed and reopened again. Not a smooth or enjoyable experience. Desktop computer works fine.,2
15440,stupendous,5
15441,Great!,5
15442,I brought a TV stand and the person. That I brought it from. want communication with me!,1
15443,OfferUp is a good place to find a lot of good deals I've bought many bike's and my boat off of the app,4
15444,very easy-going,5
15445,Nice Lady. honest,5
15446,Good,5
15447,great place to find just about anything.,4
15448,"Right off the bat: I listed three things on OfferUp shortly after creating an account. I verified my email & phone # beforehand. The listings were removed within minutes of posting them. No explanation as to why (their website claims that when a post is removed, they'll send you an email). The listings were not duplicates and did not involve prohibited items. I'm now unable to get in contact with a customer service rep. Long story short: I'm going back to Craigslist.",1
15449,Eroor when typing item description. Freezes up phone everytime and i have to force close. Cant post anything. Just freezes,1
15450,App is extremly slow to archive sold goods. Error message pops up from time to time when attempting to mark as sold after last attempt on another item. Very tedious and time consuming. This needs to be fixed pronto.,3
15451,"great app, easy to use, thanks",5
15452,Fun,5
15453,"Don't sell items that require shipping. I've sent an item using OfferUp's label, it's trackable on the USPS website, but I was contacted by OfferUp's support, claiming I didn't ship the package thus my transaction was cancelled. Additionally to this, their support is the worst. And their support center requires transaction id, but they don't give you one.",1
15454,great place to purchase,5
15455,on time and awesome crew,5
15456,lots of junk buyers,1
15457,Update 2.0 : I'm shopping for a used car and thought I'd give this app yet one more chance after the 2022 disaster . I've contacted 6 people to buy are car from them and not one person is seeing my messages . I don't know what is going on with the developers in charge of this app but if its bugs don't get worked out then it will end up in the buy/sell cemetery. Please fix this dam app!!!! Until then Facebook marketplace will be where everyone goes to shop & sell used items .,1
15458,I can't get into the app anymore. It doesn't go past the opening screen. It works online but not the app. Please fix.,1
15459,to many dealers not organized,3
15460,Hate the injection of random areas items when I'm searching local.,4
15461,Ebay has everything they have on this app much much cheaper. Don't allow yourself to be scammed into spending a lot more than necessary while they laugh at you just be smart and shop on ebay. Online shopping is supposed to be cheaper than in stores not more expensive. I'd give this app zero stars if I could.,1
15462,"Super hard to sell. Had several ""buyers"" that straight up ghosted me when time to buy. Everybody wants the deal of a lifetime on here, and are literally living in fantasy land, and enjoying it!Weirdo stuff,deleting app",1
15463,love it,5
15464,ONLY CRACK HEADS SEEM TO SELL JUNK ON THIS SITE. GOOD LUCK!,1
15465,"The app serves it's purpose, I'm able to search, buy and sell fine. My problem is the messaging within the app it's so slow to load and almost makes you want to communicate with the seller or buyer outside the app (which they themselves recommend not to do). But what can I do if it takes minutes for messages to finally load? Please fix, it used to work fine so don't know what you guys did to make it slower. I have a pixel 3a and have already uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no change.",3
15466,A pointless app. People asked me for drugs and then left nasty messages for some reason. People are intersted in your items then never show up. I emailed a seller about an item that was up for 3 months several times. No response. Then item is sold all of a sudden. Disappointing chaos. Stick with the original shady app- craigslist. Update: the app is fine. It's malfunctioning humans that screw everything up for functioning ones.,5
15467,great app,5
15468,Glitchy and cannot post anything. Constantly freezes and takes ages to type something out. You can't even use the desktop to make a post which is ridiculous.,1
15469,Always been my favorite go to. loved it from the beginning!! Thank you.,5
15470,I wouldn't give it 1 star but I have to.eversince they updated it to offer up letgo it just feels worse quality and more difficult to navigate. Bring the old version back,1
15471,Great Platform!,5
15472,I like this,5
15473,"It's so laggy! Whenever I try to message anyone about something, the app just freezes for minutes at a time. This is the only app on my phone that does this. For reference, Im on a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5g, this shouldn't happen!",1
15474,Keeps on freezing every time I use it,1
15475,This app is very glitchy to where it's hard to use I'm sorry you guys need to do something about this,2
15476,Great!!,5
15477,great app,5
15478,takes forever to get paid using the app. but i guess thats makes it safe and you wont get scammed if you go through the app. also they make the person pay for the shipping but u dont get money for the shipping. i think they might pay it back once the customer actually gets the item but i broke so That's always hard to get the money to ship the item even though I just sold something.,4
15479,"Trying to use this app to sell items has become such a horrible experience. Freezes and crashes constantly while just trying to create a posting. I have to save a new post and try to get out of it before finishing because it begins to freeze up. Then when I try to edit the post to add more details, it crashes before I can a full line of text. Annoying to say the least!",1
15480,great help,5
15481,Never got anything with this app cant sell anything,1
15482,pretty good.,4
15483,Keeps crashing,1
15484,Continuously problem with login and OfferUp team is not helping. Keep sending the same email.,1
15485,Exellent,4
15486,It's ok but wen looking for stuff in my area it always look and see some other city out of state they need separation between cities so I know where I'm searching instead of me find something then find out it 1500 miles away,1
15487,"It works, but it has constant annoying notifications that you can't disable in the app. You would have to disable notificationa for the whole thing through android. This makes it a real pain if you have things you are selling or buying but constantly get useless information.",3
15488,I thought this was an app to find things people are selling but it's not. Turns out it's now an employment website and that's the only things it adverties. I couldn't figure out how to find anything that's for sale. All it kept showing me was ads for employment within 25 mins of my house. I'm in need of a vehicle and land for sale. Not a job. Wrong app I guess,1
15489,App is very difficult to navigate very slow,1
15490,"LetGo was better all around. OfferUp has terrible support. Absolutely horrendous and robotic. I used to use great reviews as a barometer for trust, but it appears that it can be gamed so be careful of scammers. How can it be gamed? Who knows. OfferUp won't tell me after recently getting scammed.",2
15491,Keeps freezing,1
15492,Great Site to buy and sell,5
15493,great and reliable service,5
15494,so far so good. made my first sale right away.,5
15495,"After an hour and two attempts at my first post, app lost first one and automatically removed second attempt. Offer Up pages on my laptop AND my phone couldn't load and would lock up. And the idea of paying to 'boost'?? Kinda like a dating site. I'll stick with Facebook Marketplace. It works.",1
15496,Good,5
15497,They delete listings even though they don't violate any guidelines,1
15498,First time user Made one post The second won't go through. Takes forever to type and won't load anymore picsltures,1
15499,Its a p.o.s. like the rest the apps that r like this,1

15501,Great üëç,5
15502,Friendly website.,5
15503,"Just ok with room for improvement. Most of the interesting items I find here usually have inactive sellers with tags such as ""responds in minutes."" There should be a system that removes these tags when sellers have not used the app or logged in for a while. Out of the 10 local items I was interested in, I was only able to purchase 1. Edit: 1/15/2023 Lowered it to one star because no one responds to offers even when offering to buy at the listed price",1
15504,glitchy!!!!!! keeps crashing,1
15505,üëåüëåüëçüëçüëç,5
15506,Algorithm limits your choices whenever you explore an item. Notifications are annoying,2
15507,One-hundred-percent trash. It takes me 10 minutes to answer one message slow glitchy plus steals all your information,1
15508,very easy to use I recomended,5
15509,easy to navigate,5
15510,Love this sh**!,5
15511,If i have the option i give 0 is not responding im not getting any texts back fix it or delet the app !,1
15512,wonderful thank,5
15513,It would be SO MUCH BETTER if there was a way to post and edit listing using your desktop. Fairly easy platform but many buyers don't read the description.,5
15514,they have everything you may need. always have a good experience when buying or selling,5
15515,"Usually a pretty good site with great deals out there. Hit and miss, of course",5
15516,No one responds after they ask if the item is still available. Starting to think they are bots.,2
15517,"Furnature stores are killing the site. The algorithm allows their hundreds of posts to choke out anything being actually sold by other people, please fix this.",3
15518,slow app! all of a sudden shuts down on me!,3
15519,"You must now disable VPN the entire time you're using the app. Why? It's unnecessary, when all it needs to do is know your location when signing up and updates. But now this app dictates to me what I can and can't do. I'll stick with ebay. It's safer anyway.",1
15520,awesome experience some of the nicest people I've ever met,5
15521,money üí∞üí∞,5
15522,so many possibilities but could use less adds.,4
15523,intrusive notifications,2
15524,"I truly believe this site helps others. But when you have people on this site selling other people's belongings that they haven't paid for posted on this site is not very professional. Then they have the nevers too put sold.When the owner went and retrieve it back, Then they got upset because I was lost for words when I saw my furniture. Being sold for a higher price. Now the young lady has changed her name on the site. With a different picture. But I love this site.",4
15525,It keeps kicking me out man what's in the viruses is going on?!?,3
15526,AWESOME!!!,5
15527,Offerup was good maybe in 2019. You cant even make a listing on this app anymore without having to either verify something or pay a fee. Offerup went downhill after it merged with letgo. I had multiple accounts shadow banned also for whatever reason also. Im a long time member of offerup but im quitting today,1
15528,Locks up wayyyy too much!,1
15529,"Great, all around!!!!",5
15530,LIST about 50 items sold a whopping......,1
15531,"Not too excited about Letgo and Offer Up merging. Never had problems with Letgo freezing up. Almost every 3rd posting Offer up freezes up. And before you tell me I should reset my phone. I've done all that, and it doesn't seem to help.",4
15532,Looks like a great place to shop. Thanks üëç,5
15533,App grinds to a halt when attempting to edit text (as in item descriptions). Infuriating and unusable.,2
15534,Cool,4
15535,Works well but one major issue is it does not allow you to sign up or edit your phone number using a virtual phone number like Google Voice. I do not have a mobile carrier number. I only have a Google Voice number. It needs to allow this.,4
15536,good place to find used furniture lawn equipment or just about anything never had a bad experience from this and they even have stuff for FREE,4
15537,"No granularity in notifications, can't use any notifications without constantly getting notification ads",1
15538,"I really like this place but lately I've been running into people who want to make different rules than what I signed up for, like meeting in strange places and being paid before shipping.

15539,"great app, easy to use and no scams like on marketplace. Definitely recommend this app to buy or sell",5

15545,I cannot update my ads. The app freezes every time. I cleared the cache for the app and the problem persists.,2
15546,can't get a response from sellers,1
15547,"It's pretty decent when it comes to finding what you want, interface is very well made, and easy to understand. However, there are items that are posted on here that have been sold years ago, and are still up for sale.. Normally, I'd have given it four stars, but I'm only giving it two because of the lack of transparency between customers, and sellers.",2
15548,What I don't like about this app is if I sell an item somewhere else & mark it sold then OfferUp says it was sold on their website.I have done everything that they told me to do & now I have to provide info that it wasn't sold on their website.A few times after I tried to take an item off it asked me if it was sold which I replied yes. Then I was asked if it was sold on their website which it wasn't. I put in my answer to that ? & multiple times it wouldn't go through.Can't delete an item either,1
15549,Great way to save money and sell your things.,5

15569,Good Items,5
15570,I can't get on the site anymore. Just keeps loading.,1
15571,get what you want at a reasonable price,5
15572,"Most people do not respond. I find most posts tend to be dead posts where you will never hear back, if not for that I've made a few purchases over the years and it definitely works with some effort.",3

15576,great for finding deals but the app is glitchy !,2
15577,Cannot +pics that are stored on my device. Hard to add details due to cannot post from PC. Cannot edit posts once they are listed. The phone app does not show the price unless you click on the item. That is different from the PC web browser. Should include the price on the phone app to make searching quicker. 2021-12-04 update. Still two stars. I don't get offer updates on my phone or email when someone asks me a question. 1/13/23 need to turn off VPN to use. Not secure! Even though I'm Tru U.,2
15578,I've purchased several random items here (including a car) I haven't had any issues and enjoy the functionality of the format.,5
15579,"I'm very happy for the stuff that I found here,I save my self a lot's of money and people is always professionalüòâ",5
15580,"I'm hustler, you a hustler.... We all hustlers my sisters & brothers! Sale, sell & sold!! I love OfferUp y'all!! So, anyways, enough gibgab. Lemme see your wares üíµüíµüí∞üí∏",5
15581,easy tonuse and works well,5
15582,unstable app. flickers on and off,2
15583,"great app, have bought and sold many things on it.",5
15584,Every time I use this app it's get more complicated for the user so someone paid me threw the app to have the product labeled and shipped but the dude lived close buy and we just met up since the money was on the app I can't take it out I tried talking to customer service 0 help they don't understand nothing like they can't read I have no patience for stupid but this app itself looking more as a scam,1
15585,is good place to sell and buy stuff you sometimes can get at the store,5
15586,Easy to utilize and friendly.,5
15587,"This app is extremely slow, it CONSTANTLY CRASHES and CLOSES OUT without any sort of notice or a pop up that says ""Would you like to exit OfferUp?"" That would be nice!",1
15588,R √ü,4
15589,Love this app I sell a lot of stuff fast,5
15590,"It's a decent app, nothing more. Everything is ok except that they purposely change your settings to shipping every time you search something. I only want to use these app for local purchases. Very annoying.",2
15591,awesome fast way to sell your unwanted used or new items.,4
15592,Not sure what changed but after a few years decided to see what people are selling. . And very disappointing nothing but high over-priced items majority of the stuff is probably cheaper at stores and actually new/unopened. Everyone has it as new when clearly it's open box. And for the people that sell below retail price it's 5-10$ difference but charge ridiculous amount on shipping which again its better ordering from actual retail store.. also many of the good to be true deals are scams.,1
15593,He ran a scam....First lie he said it was smogged in December and the paperwork was in the glove compartment it was not there it was not smogged. Second lie he said he had the car a lot longer than he actually did he lied about the reason he's getting rid he said because it's a manual and third lie the check engine came on as soon as I got a mile down the road turn the car off turn it back on and boom there it was. I don't know why people lie that's my story to y'all buyer always beware!!!!!!!,2
15594,My offer up don't work because I been block by offer up how do I get unblocked by yall,5
15595,Good sight to shop,5
15596,Crashes when trying to post items.,2
15597,"I Don't like how long it takes for a response it takes a week or more a response and when you have cash in hand and you need that item right then and there cause you have That's extra cash and no response, well then it goes to wife or kids or should say both of them well then I'm waiting for the next time to save up 1500 or more for my drone for the 9 time now! :'^{()",2
15598,to many fake coins and OfferUp gives no protection. stay away from Howard beach guy named Francis,1
15599,"Just downloaded this app for the first time. Logged in through Google and continued on so I could post something. Tried posting a laptop for sale twice with no luck. ""Try again"" message appears. After the first failed attempt I closed the app, waited a bit and then tried again. Same failure. I already deleted the app within an hour of downloading",1
15600,"Very slow unresponsive app. I hit a button and it just has so much lag. It's frustrating even attempting to post, sell, or even look up anything. This app is garbage",1
15601,easy to use and you can find great deals,5
15602,Seriously beware selling on this app. I shipped an item I had sold through their shipping process. I followed all the rules and shipped in time. 2 days after shipping I got a notification that my transaction was canceled because I hadn't shipped my item by the deadline. The buyer got a FREE $800 camera from me and now isn't responding and the app has no customer service to help with this.,1
15603,"app is great, some people don't have some respect",4
15604,"easy enough to use, good activity on items I've sold.",5
15605,Very helpful üëå,5
15606,Can't even use the app all it does is crash,1
15607,great app I love it,5
15608,I've used this platform for years however I've the past year I never get a single response to something I've tried to buy it sell. It's like it makes me feel like I'm visible but in reality I'm ghosted it's very frustrating. I've missed countless sales not to mention buys as well I can't seem to even get a response from OfferUp as to what the problem is and so I've I've even gone so far as to delete my account set up a whole nother account and I'll get maybe one or two responses then dead again,1
15609,"Too many defects, when I go into a post I get a small cilindrical screen capture from the post and you can't get rid of it. Super annoying.",1
15610,Beware of MAIL in products. Many FRAUDULENT SELLERS!,1
15611,to many scammers,1
15612,"Cx'd account w/ no explanation after 9 years of loyal usage and spending thousands of dollars on local ads pilot program. Posted microwave and removed post for ""intangible item"". Advised to relist if we thought it was mistake. We did. Account now permanently banned & we can't get answer other than ""we reserve right to cancel account without notice or explanation"" for ""violation of community standards"". All while others post animals, inspection sticker & drug paraphernalia. No cust.serv to call",1
15613,This app its awesome,5
15614,I love this app very resourceful,5
15615,"Nothing interesting, and you can't sale or trade, lot of sponsored posts",1
15616,Someone hacked my non active account and started selling things. I have requested my account be deleted multiple times and I have heard nothing back. Won't use ever again. Update- finally got a response that told me your account has been deleted and the next day I received an email to finish setting up my account. DONT USE,1
15617,Horrible experience. Ap will not allow me to describe item. It freezes up. Also. I am often charged $7.99 for ads that do not appear on the site. Ive complained many times still no response nor refunds.,1
15618,Couldn't get any buyers and it bugs out,1
15619,Won't let me post it hour location and won't let me choose location,1
15620,They have some very nice itms quality merchandise,4
15621,"OFFERUP DOES NOTHING ABOUT SCAMMERS EVEN AFTER REPORTING THEM!!!! According to offerup they updated this app 9.10.2021 and i say BS. ITS WORSE THEN IT WAS. App Includeds to many old items on inactive account, that never get responded to. Their are tons of scam ads you will waste a lot of time opening ads.... App does not save my perfered settings and pics are hard to expand and close. APP is designed to waste your time.",1
15622,quick and easy,4
15623,convenient place for all of us,5
15624,It's a good app...but....I feel it could be better......when it was let go the app let us edit the ads on our home laptops....much easier....texting ads is a real pain.....I hope you consider this in the real near future....,5
15625,"Crashes every time on pixel 7. Ever since that stupid ""job"" update. I have to use the browser",1
15626,"When I use the app and try to post, my keyboard keeps freezing. Also, why cant I post from a laptop? Your website keeps telling me to download the app. I should be able to post from a computer.",1
15627,"Great app, easy transactions, nice options as a seller.",5
15628,Good,1
15629,Love it!!,5
15630,I keep getting annoying suggestions for stuff I'm not searching for,2
15631,love it,5
15632,Capt charging me for subscription that was cancelled 4 month ago.,1
15633,great. but too many ads!,5
15634,pretty good site,4
15635,"Terrible app. Crashes constantly, makes it unusable",1
15636,Unable to confirm any of my cards. Found a great deal I wanted to purchase but it seems offerup's card verification process is broken. I see issues with this dating back at least a year with no resolution. Basic troubleshooting I got from support didn't help. Would change my review if we could get this resolved,1
15637,Infested with scanmers,1
15638,great way to sell item's. i sold mine within a couple of days. thks.,5
15639,"I recommend selling on a different platform. Worst customer service ever , hope you don't need them because they won't be there . This is the first time I need assistance from the in all the years I have used this app and they have totally left me to figure it out myself.",1
15640,Install OfferUp,5
15641,"Can't stop won't stop... water üí¶ 2 whales....snow to Eskimo Joe!!! Takes the HUSTLE.... and allows you to reach the once OUT REACHABLE...ü§ëü§êü§îü§≠ü§´üíØüíØüíØ..üêï=ü¶¥ ""NUTHIN BUT A G-STRING.....BABYüíØüíØ",5
15642,It's convenient easy to use.,4
15643,"I wish the price was on the thumbnail photos, like on Mercari, so you do not have to open every photo to see the listing price. The app also needs to take off old and sold items. Many times I have opened an item only to find it was listed 4 years ago....",2
15644,got od,5
15645,amazing,5
15646,"So many flakes, no follow through, scammers have the control, can't block people. It's pathetic",1
15647,Bien,5
15648,I appreciate the integrity of this site and app. Its my first choice to use a platform to sell items that I no longer want or have a use for.,5
15649,The person was very polite will buy from her again,5
15650,Glitches and slow,3
15651,every sale I make they give you only a certain amount of time to get it completed and in the mail. Even when you do get the sale mailed out there's no option that informs the app that it's been mailed only way to let it be known is to tell the person you're selling it to in a message. Either I don't understand it completely or this service isn't a good one.,1
15652,"there are to many commercial business on this website, takes away from all otheres",3
15653,"Technical issues galore. Unable to make purchases. I told support but instead of addressing my specific technical issue they gave me lame trouble shooting steps like restarting my phone. They suggested I send in screen shots etc. I would but this is the first I'm using this app. I'm not a user yet, and I'm not getting paid to QA so no thanks. Edit: Full of scammers from what I can tell. Texting to have me send them money on Zelle, or Cash app.",1
15654,Great place to meet new friends in selling stuff that you have in common with others. Easy extra income as a side hustle when you need extra cash. Hoping to meet my future wife on here. Many single moms I have met that need something for their kids. Great place to share knowledge on hobbies. Easy to block scammers! ü§òüòéü§ò,5
15655,"Love it but I wish there was some additional filters for searching. Example: being able to search for cars from private or dealer sales. Title condition, salvage, clean, etc....",4
15656,Great app to sell and buy items. My only issue is that the app keeps crashing when writing out descriptions for an item I'd like to sell. Tried all recommended troubleshooting tips and problem still continues. Work around is to write desc outside of app and copy/paste.,4
15657,"clunky and slow, but works if you have patience.",3
15658,"Don't use this service , they stole from me Not only that they charge to much for their service, but customer service sucks Not only the charge touch they keep my earnings I deleted all of my items from their app and WILL NEVER HAD BUSINESS WITH THEM",1
15659,awesome app üëç,5
15660,Nothing really ever SELLS just a bunch of LOOKY LOUS... It takes a lot of time to just input one product. Every time you think you sold something they end up apologizing that they really didn't want it or they just never contact you again. Or that it was a accident that they were Even interested. Which makes you think someone is employed just to Pretend you finally have a customer. This is a lot of our opinions I've talked to other people who are on this Site.,1
15661,I purchased an item. The seller has to check his inventory when he gets back from vacation.,1
15662,"This app stinks, and no one ever responds. The main landing page never loads, and why on earth would you not have standard notifications when someone messages you or vice-versa?",1
15663,Great app,5
15664,"easy to use, never any issues",5
15665,great app. helps with anoter source of income,5
15666,VPN makes this unusable. If you use the app where you need to worry about your privacy this does not work when you're using a VPN. Fix it so when I'm in a public place I can use my VPN to be safe and use your application and I will rate it higher,1
15667,Offered up doesn't give you any more notifications like it used to,1
15668,I want to start by saying offer up has been a huge help for me both buying and selling items at no cost for their service which is greatly appreciated thanks offer up. I would love to give a 5 star review but more recently I've been having trouble with the app and from what I see in the reviews from others I'm not the only one. Hope it improved so I can bump ya'll up that last star! *****,4
15669,great app,5
15670,No üëé good,1
15671,Ino sales yet?,3
15672,Love the app. I try to sell whatever i have no use for and possibly jas some sort of value. I love browsing things to buy also.,5
15673,"I love OfferUp. But, the app sometimes freezes on my Android phone.",4
15674,great site to buy or sell,5
15675,"So after I report my issue with customer care, instead of fixing the issue, you all just disable my account for violation. I don't even have anything for sale, I was just trying to purchase a perfume and you alls system isn't working. I will stay with ebay and mercati. You all are so unprofessional",1
15676,several sellers have cancelled purchases due to high fees.,1
15677,Hard to post when it starts to freeze,1
15678,I've Heard excellent things about this app so I'm jumping in just see if our T G Y Store store will profit.,5
15679,great place to shop,5
15680,"Slow than snail poo, this app is full of garbage no one wants.",1
15681,the new way of yard sale,5
15682,Posts don't expire so people either have sold them and they stay up or your stuff isnt selling because people think it's gone because you can't renew the post so it has a new posting date. And so many other problems. Bad for seller and buyers. Pretty lousy app overall but glad they finally brought the free category back.,2
15683,Trash. App crashes everytime you try to message someone.,1
15684,works well,5
15685,"Update ~ THIS APP BECAME SO SLOW, I upload stuff to load and I find it soo messed up I DONT RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS---- & YES MY NOTIFICATIONS ARE ON.... this app now has made me so mad. üò§",1
15686,App is garbage. Won't accept my zip code as real. Can't sign up if app doesn't work. If this is any indication of their quality control then I don't want to use them anyway.,1
15687,Works for browsing but when I have to post or message someone it keeps freezing and shuts down,3
15688,App keeps freezing and cutting off. The new features haven't improved the app. Seems like it's gotten worse,2
15689,amazing üëç,5
15690,Zaddy,1
15691,Love OfferUp! I have met a lot of great people and found some awesome things. I recommend the app to lots of friends and family.,5
15692,"Shopping, or lets make a deal.",4
15693,doesn't show prices,2
15694,"excellent app and actually my favorite, would give 5 stars, but it's really annoying that, when you scroll in pickup stuff, there's ads included when you're looking for ""pickup specifically"" not cool.",4
15695,banned me without telling me why. I didn't even get a chance to log in,1
15696,never received my order,2
15697,has all ways worked good for me,5
15698,Too many dealers and other crooks,2
15699,Very happy,5
15700,It was way better when it was let go!,1
15701,"This app is just getting slower and slower,takes too long",1
15702,Satisfy,4
15703,"The company claims to be ""focused on the app"" every time I complain about lack of basic functionality on their browser interface. So how can the app still be so awful? It doesn't remember basic preferences, clogged with so many ads, hard to navigate, and missing basic and obvious functionality. I find myself using this app less and less. They are so focused on ad revenue that they have forgotten their customers. They are going to ad-blast their way to non-existence.",1
15704,I was given a link to refer friends for $50 if they sign up and sell something. so I sent my dad the link he signed up posted something for sale and I never received anything,1
15705,"Item was not shipped after purchase, leading to automatic cancellation after 7 days and no communication from seller, wasting people's time. So I waited a week wondering if I will get the item I ordered, and I am not able to give feedbacks on the seller even after they failed to honor the sale? The seller had good reviews which would not account for failure to honor the sale. If I had known sellers can just ignore sales order I would not have purchased on the platform in the first place.",1
15706,"App keeps ""Not Responding"" every time I try and post an item for sale. It is costing me money for my business. Something needs to be done about this or I will be taking my business elsewhere, where I don't experience this type of problem.",1
15707,"This person was very nice and I couldn't be more pleased with him and the amfm,CD and cassette player I got .",5
15708,Freezes constantly can't post or respond without freezing,1
15709,"App has been malfunctioning a lot in the past few months. It goes slow, closes since it stops working, doesn't type properly (keyboard doesn't work properly with this app). Be warned, this is home of the cheap skate.",2
15710,Interesting,5
15711,"The app is great, but it has one annoying attribute. Some search results will show items that are months old, even a year or two old. There should be an expiration date on the posts. The app should also have a HISTORY tab. Sometimes I'll find an item of interest. Do some research about it on my browser. When I come back to the OfferUp app, it takes me to the home page and I have to try to find the item again. Half the time it won't show up in the search.",4
15712,Love it,5
15713,they continually mess up your account,1
15714,"I think üí¨ these app is too sensitive... I had it for about a year, and then it no longer worked for me.. I think it was because I didn't respond fast enough on one of the ads so they cannot kick me out of the app.. Not cool!! Creiglist doesn't have that problem..",1
15715,Slow fix app,1
15716,Esta muy. Lenta ya no sirve como antes,1
15717,fast to respond courteous and honest,5
15718,"Buggy, slow, and unreliable.",2
15719,great with customers. even loaded,5
15720,no one ever answers back yes or no,1
15721,i love it,5
15722,Awful one seller was very rude and sold my order to someone else for a bigger price,1
15723,very good app!,5
15724,love this app,5
15725,"I have been using OfferUp since before it merged with Letgo. I have never had any issues with posting listings, buying items, or selling items. The user interface is actually very user friendly in my opinion. There are alot of ads though, which is a nuisance. Only way around the ads to subscribe to their premium service, which will be ad free. Only thing I don't like is the inability to delete a listing. You can only archive it at this time. However, these few issues aren't deal killers for me.",5
15726,The msgs people have sent you gets lost.. so you can't really sell anything on this app,1
15727,buen lugar para comprar,4
15728,Keeps freezing.,1
15729,overall great app just a lots of scrammer,5
15730,"Account got disabled, says due to violating community guidelines. I posted clothing, not sure how that's violating guidelines. Messaged offer up through FB and IG (since I cannot access my account) with no response.",1
15731,"Would be a lot better if therevwas a way to search local only without ads that are not in the area, can't be picked up in 30 minutes for cash.",4
15732,sometimes is slow so have to restart the app,3
15733,Laggy buggy piece of trash,1
15734,"The app and the community are useless. All you do is get spammed with the message ""Hi, is this still available?"" And then you respond to them all and get nothing back. Of course it is still available, the status in Offer Up hass not been changed to SOLD yet! If u want it, make an offer! What is the point of the features if not a single user uses them?",1
15735,Excellent venue for great finds!,5
15736,it's a great way to buy and sell thing's,5
15737,"Offer Up ha$ not given the opportunity to sell items online, but also let's me know about jobs. Fantastic Combination! Happy New Year Offer Up 2023!",5

15742,It's great,5
15743,Good place to buy and sale items,5
15744,Cool app ! It's made me money an also got me good deals,5
15745,"Worst experience as a seller. When a customer placed an order you get confirmation & a statement from offer up letting you know the pre label is sent to your email! I never got this so called email with the pre-shipment label. So I contacted OfferUp they're telling me they cannot do anything that I would need to take this up with the buyer to get paid are you kidding me and also I sent them receipts and proof that I sent the item to customer, but yet they refuse to respond!!!!!!",1
15746,Need to eliminate OLD posts and eliminate scammer posts.,1
15747,"The deal didn't go through i""m very disappointed i really wanted the game i don't understand i will never purchase any item from this person. Thank you.",2
15748,"always a glitch..people never respond or show up, filter is off, slow notifications, couldn't post for a week bc the site was glitching",3
15749,"Why do they leave listings up for over a year. Every time I search for something, I find it, click on it, and it's a listing that's years old. Because they don't have the volume so they have to make it look like they have listings otherwise every time you search it would say no results.",1
15750,"I liked the idea of ""letgo"" more. Now sellers are a joke. Most of them belong on eBay and the rest sell things like tree stumps for $2500, Pennies for $100, Individual Pokemon cards for $175. Vehicles are okay (2* instead of 1* rating) but still has dealership traffic and scammers. Is it too much to build an app and a community that is for giving things you don't need away for next to nothing instead of giving them to the landfill?",2
15751,I have met good people and have gotten great buys!,5

15765,Do not use my algorithms to determine what I see I want to see whatever people put out in a timeline nothing I bought a battery for my phone and now I get bombarded on your app with a bunch of phones that I really really don't want to see and it's unrelated to your app if I searched it on your app I can understand some of that but I bought the battery for my phone off of Amazon and used it on your app this makes me mad.. no setting and it continues changing to one star,1

Very laggy, outdated, keeps showing me the same stuff that i searched for once, keeps crashing, very slow and very more to add on. I may come back in future if this app gets better as before.",1
15783,"I'm trying to use the rating for this App as a warning for new or potential customers!Up till about a week ago, I loved this App! I recommended it to everybody! I would have gave it 10 stars on a 5 star rating any day of the week! All that was until I sold something as simple as a remote control for a television. OfferUp turned a simple $25sale, into a week long guessing game / waiting game. I sold a remote,I had to ship it, customer got 2days to play with it,then I had to wait 5days to get paid",1
15784,Flakey buyers and annoying unrelated notifications,3
15785,Can't get through terrible app when u post an item they post the same item for less price...not good,1
15786,It's great when it doesn't freeze up every five seconds and you can actually post something for sale,1
15787,Like Offer up but did have trying to get to customer help and finding my previous account also getting them to recognize me,4
15788,very good app,5

15794,I wish items that have been on there a long time or have been sold be removed...,3
15795,love it is easy and I sell a lot of items,5
15796,"Okay,well seeing as this app doesn't remove creeps or spam accounts, it's gonna get a low rating. Even though selling and shipping is super easy, the actual service of this app is horrid. Too many fake accounts who don't want to buy anything harassing women on here. After the year of me having this app I've only sold to one person because everyone else either ghosts or is just a gross man. I recommend mercari instead if you actually wanna sell items.",1
15797,no real buyers,1
15798,for some reason no one ever responds?,1
15799,Lagging this app won't let me post. Spent 30 minutes opening and closing the app.,1

15802,First never had an offer up account but apparently I've violated guidelines,1
15803,love this app.,5
15804,I used to love this app but lately it's been very glitchy and very slow I don't know what's going on,3
15805,"Ever since you guys got rid of the chronological feed on the home screen and started using an algorithm to tailor our feed to what you think we want to see, is for sale this app has gone downhill. Bring back the chronological home feed you incompetent developers",1
15806,The seller and the ring was just beautiful,5
15807,Something is off about this app I clicked on 12 different items and all are listed as one owner there is no way in hell every item is new just like an item I seen ratchet straps from farm and home seller asking 25 dollars and they don't even cost thatuch at harbor freight or farm and home what a rip off,1
15808,App works great. People suck.,5
15809,Yeah OfferUp has changed it gets stuck it freezes on you it takes forever to post something now it's like no good anymore,3
15810,Nothing is free,1
15811,Cant even send messages or post !! ! It freezes or foreclose when typeing a message or Description of product! ...its constantly freezeing & fore closeing having to start all over just for app to do it again and fore close smfh .,1

15818,Sellers having to approve full price purchases is Insane!,2
15819,I love the deals and great merchandise I find on offer up,5
15820,Why ya deactivated my account,1
15821,"I like it except for the job part that takes up a third of my screen. I'm a drummer in a rock band at 67yrs old and turned on my fellow band mates and they love it, we always find music equipment at great prices, some that need work but we're all retired and need something to do anyway. only bad thing is my wife thinks I spend too much time on it.....oh well!",4
15822,no good,1
15823,it's awesome Optimus.,5
15824,OfferUp is great I can always find what I need on offer up.,5
15825,Complete waste of my time,1
15826,What's wrong with the app lol üòÜ This app is so laggy that it forecloses itself every time I used it just slowly dying now what happened to it I used to be a wonderful app before all this happened is there a way for a fix,2
15827,I am new to Offer up but have both bought and sold. I hope to do even more in 2023!,5
15828,"Used to be great for used products, I'm tired of seeing the search flooded with retail sellers when searching a product. If your looking for a used couch or something there's more ads from furniture stores than from actual people.",3

15833,Great for the now.sale,5
15834,Everything sells quick here. Great app,5
15835,Love the app but lately it laggs and crashes when I'm trying to create a post. Very frustrating that it takes practically hours to keep trying to create a single post,4
15836,great market place app! Shipping works great!,5
15837,The post option buggs out every time. I try to type in the description and it freezes and I have to close the app,3
15838,I got banned permanently after having this app for only about 3 hours after I somehow violated community guidelines by posting Pok√©mon cards. I don't know what I did that was bad enough to result in a perma-ban. I reached out for help on this and they got back to me saying I will not be getting my account back. I saw other people selling Pok√©mon cards just fine on the app so this is very confusing. Thanks for nothing OfferUp team.,1
15839,"sellers on this app, at least the ones that I have been purchasing from are very courteous and polite,they want to help you. I love this app",5
15840,"Great app all around, easy to use, good customer service, and the vast majority of users are nice honest people. Out of the few hundred transactions Ive been a part of in the last 2 1/4-2 1/2 years Ive only ran into 3-5 dishonest, shady, and/or rude users. Those are great statistics considering no matter what the app you are going to have these types of people who also use it.",5
15841,"It won't give me a shipping option as a seller, only pickup. I do not want to meet people. I am a woman and it's unsafe for me.",2
15842,It's just stupid ads. WAY too many ads. No option to remove ads. Endorses predatory job listings (no salary range for jobs). Useless waste of time.,1
15843,You can get a lot of great deals,5
15844,FIX YOUR APP. Can't even post anymore with the app crashing. OfferUp: you're going to quickly become useless and discarded if you don't fix the app issues.,1
15845,Offer up is great,5
15846,Too many scammers. Hard to report them,2
15847,"Guy was wholesome, very easygoing, and honest. The product was really great. Very satisfied.",5
15848,Don't not download Would give a 0 star if I could literally every single person on the app is a scammer. Not even me exaggerating. I would say 9/10 people I have talked to are people asking me to cash app them that they only do cash app bevause the app doesn't work. Every market place app has scamers but this app literally every seller is a scammer. OfferUp don't seem to care. I report them and they are still on the app. People are using photos from Google images. Awful disgusting app.,1
15849,hangs too much. it is slow to pay and just hangs. I have to make 3 to 4 attempts to make a post.,1
15850,it's impossible to actually buy anything. all the listings are either years old or I make an offee and it just gets ignored and expires,2
15851,Love it!,5
15852,great app I have never had any issues with it,5
15853,up needsneeds‚Åπ take off items that run and run for years. Although it has gotten where you can't find what you need and of you do the ad is so old you don't get a reply. It use to be great. Now not so much..,2
15854,i love this app. they have everything you want,5
15855,"there is always a good selection of whatever you need, I wish there was a lil less dealer adds",5
15856,"OfferUp has been a journey for me in the sense that your able to trade, sell, and buy multiple items that you can imagine. You also might find fun going out places you might never been to before and meet other people.",5
15857,Good,5
15858,so far so good . about to make my first purchase.,5
15859,This app keeps freezing and crashing when entering listing. So terrible!,2
15860,I lost a good deal bcs of you. My account was disabled after I paid for an item. 1 star is too generous.,1
15861,very quick and friendly,5
15862,"slow, not very user friendly",1
15863,Everyone expects you to put your item on here for free or to scam you,1
15864,Trying to edit or add a listing and it just freezes. Now I remember why I stopped using this app.,1
15865,awesome,5
15866,"Have had several sellers fail to ship items, or request payment methods outside of offerup ü•¥",3
15867,"Useless, used to be good for stuff but now you have to watch long ads just to read a message? Much rather just use Facebook marketplace.",1
15868,offerup is awesome,3
15869,No es gratis!,1
15870,"Big problem with scam/fake users. They try to get cell phone info by asking you prove you are real. They acted very interested, and I almost fell for it. Then they deleted the message thread, and so they cannot be reported. To make it worse, there is no way to report the incident without their account. And no live help desk. Only FAQ.",1
15871,Sucks got banned for what reason ? Who knows since customer service won't reach out after trying to contact them multiple times !,1
15872,extremely helpful seller and easy transaction. I would gladly purchase from them again,5
15873,"I tried to make a listing. The app froze. I tried again. It froze again. Tried 5 times. Gave up. My phone is a brand new S22, so don't try blaming it on my phone. Thanks for wasting my time.",1
15874,Took my money but didn't post. When I asked for my money back they posted the car I already sold elsewhere.,1
15875,Horrible,1
15876,Best place to buy and sell things around your home.,5
15877,easy and good deals!,5
15878,Upgraded to the latest pixel 7.grear app but This still glitchy and buggy. Freezes .,2
15879,IT ALSO SAYS YOU CAN DEACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT AND THAT IS A LIE! YOU DO NOT HAVE AN OPTION TO DELETE IR DEACTIVATE ACCOUNTS. I WANT MY ACCOUNT DELETED NOW! If you don'tpay to promote what your selling then no one see's what your selling. Thanks for waisting my time. I will not purchase anything from this app or attempt to sell anything again from this app. It use to be great now its a joke. If I could give it 0 stars i would!,1
15880,very easy to find what you are searching for.,5
15881,"App asked me to upload my photo ID and personal info before I can post a sofa. Its scetchy. Feels like they are fishing and going to sell your info or worse scam you. Its a no for me. Deleting the app. Its a shame, I found so realy great things on it in the past.",1
15882,"Garbage application. Filled with scammers, that will try to get money from you using Cash App, Paypal. This app should be banned!!!!",1
15883,"Great app, fast and easy to post or buy",5
15884,what I don't like is that OfferUp has items on it s list from one to two years ago why do they not erase certain things and update?,3
15885,very nice clean playpen that was just like the pic showed. thanks so much.,5
15886,To many people charging way to high for there items plus those items that say free really ain't,3
15887,Hope to have a good feeling like mind,5
15888,App keeps turning off. Can't respond to anybody because the app turns off after 30 seconds.,1
15889,"Ever since the last update, I'm getting listings for Kansas, and I'm in Texas. Yes, my settings are set for distance within 20 miles.",3
15890,This has got to be the most judgemental website out there. They banned my husband for trying to post toy airsoft rifles that he bought on OfferUp. If you search airsoft now there are dozens of them on there for sale now. He has never been in trouble on OfferUp before had a great seller's profile with years of selling and now its all gone because of one misunderstanding.So all it takes is one mistake and OfferUp removes you. What a great place to buy and sell.,1
15891,there are too many people on here that do not respond to messages or offers.,2
15892,"love the app always have ,it works!",5
15893,Google,5
15894,Awesome!,5
15895,They are trash no one buys nothing. I post something they say it's prohibited but have the same things on there. Straight trash do not use this app.,1
15896,"Edit: haha wow, I deleted the app and I'm STILL getting emails about ""items matching your recent search""! Constantly sends me emails and alerts, even though I have turned all alerts and emails off and unsubscribed. I'm just going to uninstall and hope the emails stop coming.",2
15897,Disables your account. Doesn't tell you why. This is a SCAM app.,1
15898,The young lady that answered me was extremely helpful and nice. She was willing to try to work with me and was very professional.,5
15899,Difficult to edit postings. Also some pics of what people are selling are so bad you can't tell what it is. once you click on it you get pics of whatever it was as if you were searching for it regularly as you browse. Not the greatest format.,3
15900,I love this APP. Sell what you don't need.,5
15901,Not worth the time to download. Have used it for a while and haven't found anything worthwhile. No good deals. It's like a bad overpriced flea market.,1
15902,"Very buggy. Anything I post to sell gives a successful message but didn't actually post. So basically, you can't sell. If no one can sell then pretty soon there will be nothing left for anyone to buy. Pretty useless. Customer support was automated and also useless.",1
15903,App is glitching and won't stop. You try to describe something for sale and it freezes every time,1
15904,"Signed up to buy a camera, found a good deal, added a payment method, linked AND verified my email, phone number, and Facebook account. Started processing payment when it suddenly cancelled the transaction, and banned my account for ""Community Guidelines violation"" with no explanation at all.

15905,"Can't stand the lagg of this app it's so annoying, developers instead of making it better they worsen this",1
15906,Im working on a class action law suit. I am not the only one this company has stolen money from. My account was closed with no detailed explanation and I have yet to be paid for an item I sold over a year ago. I have submitted several support tickets to receive a computer generated response. You cannot get a hold of anyone with this company. Do not risk loosing your money with this company. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!,1
15907,I want more people to see my posts for free,3
15908,"Best for buying but worst for advertising in-app. I have been trying to advertise on my s21 note dor last 3 hours. It keeps crashing if I start writing more than 3 lines. It works only if I copy paste a large context written somewhere else. This is all in-app problem. Also, they NEVER fixed my app problem that couldn't Map to my phone number. They said they deleted all my records I'm order to reset but they still can't fix it. I lost all my ADs and messages randomly.",3
15909,The seller has shipped the item and I payed for it and he is not messaging me back I think I got scammed,1

15916,Lags alot,1
15917,my posts no one see it,1
15918,This app is a hotbed for scammers! And the fact that you can't talk to customer service is even worst!,1
15919,It used to be easy to sell stuff on offer up. Now it seems like your item won't get seen unless you pay to promote it. What a shame.,1
15920,always take care of you help out supperior,5
15921,"Umm not great. Says my phone number isn't a valid US phone number üòÇ. I searched for an item to pick up and it gave me items from tx, ca, and other random states. I'm from ia. Sooo yeah it's bad.",1

15928,this started good then turned out to be all vendors app..not end user to end user anymore,1
15929,Not sure if most of the ads are fakes or the emails don't go thru but I've contact a dozen ppl about items and I never hear back. Used to be good before merging with Letgo. Now it's just a waste of time. Much better apps out there for this...,1
15930,after a year of 2 post... items or offer should be automatically deleted.,4
15931,"For the passed month, not 1 of my messages have been ""seen"".. my paid promotion items have zero views. The app crashes while typing descriptions. It has crashed while I'm attempting to type this message twice. I have had to type it elsewhere and copy and paste it here. I feel robbed of my money for paying for promotional fees and getting zero views on those items. Not 1 person I have messaged in regards to buying their item have ""seen"" my messages or replied to my messages. FIX THIS OR LOSE US",1
15932,awesome website,5
15933,I tried listing a few different items to sale. Some eltronics and rc cars. Offer up is immediately removing my listing as soon as I press done,1
15934,"Not bad but need more and better features. The search engine outright sucks. They like to show you things that you have looked at before. I just want to see everything that is being sold in my area not just what I have looked at before. Last and the biggest issue is that if you have an issue with a seller don't expect ""Offer Up"" to help in anyway. Amazon and eBay do so it's more like craigslist or the wild west. Knowing this before hand sets an expectation.",4
15935,"Tons of scammers,bots,ppl leaving you on read and the shipping system screwed me over I sold a 35$ item and the app never paid me",1
15936,seller was rude and insulting totally inappropriate for no reason in a response message to an offer!,2
15937,100% happy experience,5
15938,Multiple times I have tried buying stuff and it gets canceled because the seller never shipped in time big waste of time just to hear back a few days later and be told the order is canceled. Ebay is way better.,1

15940,the best app for selling stuff,5
15941,"There are a LOT of Inactive accounts on OfferUp. You can waste a lot of time messaging people who never respond, yet items remain listed ""for sale."" Craigslist listing expire if not renewed, Offer Up should do the same.",2

My rating was 4 and a half stars, I was very respectful with every person I spoke to, and I have rated every purchase I had.

15944,"I am extremely frustrated, the only way to post is through the mobile app and right now my phone is stuck in safe mode and not allowing the use of my apps. I get on the computer and am able to check inbox, communicate and shop but am unable to post from my computer. I like Offer up but this may force me to post more in other marketplaces.",2
15945,very helpful to buy something you need that you can just pick up rather than wait for it to be sent to you especially for things urgently needed,5
15946,straight up deal an timely communication.,5
15947,Great place to move things.,5

15961,my favorite app,5
15962,Excellent,5
15963,It post my wrong location . im in oklahoma city and it keept posting my items in mexico. Crock of shitzoo.,1
15964,easy to use. just type what your looking for.,5
15965,"I had found an ad where the poster did not respond to me at all. Instead of ignoring it and allowing it to clutter the site (which already has a bunch of junk), I reported the problem. Instead of dealing with the problematic ad or subjecting me to a clearly articulated, negative consequence, the app now disallows any of my searches for F150. Either that or everyone suddenly deleted their ads.",1
15966,Mike was great. The exchange at Safeway was seamless and pleasant.,5
15967,very nice,5
15968,"app is put together fine and the interface is nice, but there are too many business listings for items clogging up the feed. entire stores post inventory and it makes the experience irritating at best.",2
15969,they don't do anything to scammers,2
15970,Since the recent update offer up keeps freezing up and you keep haven to close the app. Please fix,1
15971,I Traded My Laptop That was completly Cracked for Ipad 3rd Generation So that steal and deals.,5

15975,This app is constantly crashing or freezing whenever I try to edit my post or even attempt to post new ads. Please fix this issue.,1
15976,"the ap is slow as hell, and they only have email if u have a prob, & they don't help fix a prob at all! it takes 2 weeks to get any $ from a sale, & they don't send it correctly!",1
15977,Crashes and stops loading almost every time I open or move to a new screen,2
15978,Can't type questions . Updates are horrible.,1
15979,Seems that this app has been abandoned by most users.,2
15980,this app is very helpful. get some good bargains. and the location setting is pretty accurate.,4
15981,They dont let things expire. Digital 30-day limit like craigslist so you don't waste all your time looking at stuff that's been listed months if not years ago. Also the people that pay get preferential treatment in the way it's ordered so your search doesn't bring up what you're looking for It looks what other people paid for you to see. Used to be a good app but I deleted it after my last experience just disgusted.,2
15982,This used to be a really good app until they started letting all of the businesses put post all of the brand new furniture and whatever else there is on here now it's all clogged up with all of that and you can't find anything on here it's not worth your time downloading,1
15983,This app will never be as good as letgo was they should have left letgo be,1
15984,Never had a problem buying or selling on this app always found what I was looking for also,4
15985,Deleted my account for a post selling quads. I don't understand but Ih well app is dieing anyways,1
15986,"So freaking slow , idk how it's possible that any app can be this slow. Also they shadow ban people for no reason, so you think you still can sell and buy but it doesn't post your item. They do this so they can still get ad revenue from you .",1
15987,"Apps good, craps good, now people... that's a different story!",4
15988,"still a nice app, even w/ da ads.",5
15989,My experience with Offer up has bot been good. Cannot type more than 50 characters in the box box.,1
15990,Item was filthy. Seller suggested I wash down the never before used step ladder. I purchased it because the price is unbeatable. just wish the seller advertised the condition prior to the purchase.,1
15991,to many scams fake ppl,1
15992,I haven't been able to sell anything .it says it's installed but I can't get on it WHY?,2

16006,VPN not allowed,1
16007,Trash. Sellers are bots and the one's who aren't never respond. Wanna be Craigslist. The children who run this app are a big problem.,1
16008,Bad algorithm. Have it set for local pick up and all I get is Amazon adds and pick up from states hundreds of miles away,1
16009,"OFFER UP repeatedly allows scamer car salesman to list cars for $2k, but the small print says.. ( based on $5k deposit) . This is tacky buyer deception. I've reported it over and over",1

They asked what issue I was having after already giving them info. Told them to refer to first email. Then just get a response saying they are aware of the issue that the app hangs, never loads. There is no fix & just wait for an update. Have updated the app many times since then. Reinstalled multiple times. Still doesn't work at all. Useless CS.",1

And I decided to treat myself to a useless purchase: the Simpsons Hit and Run for Gamecube: $60. I immediately bought the it and I waited a week for it to ship. The seller cancels it. Ok honestly it happens.bought a Boss pedal. It didn't ship and the seller also canceled that. This has happens 5. times. Thats it.:)",5

16026,I have been blocked from. Using your app? It claims that I didn't adhere to the guidelines and I did something to get myself banned. No explenation!? No number or website to check it out. I didn't mean to mess up. Can I get a hint as to what is was that I did wrong? I miss Let Go a lot.,1

16033,"Offer Up rocks. I love It. The short answer to meeting a stranger on the Internet Is to do It In front of A police station. This app gives users the ability to buy and sell whatever. I bought a few laptops that needed love, and flipped them on the same site. No diploma no problem, go make your money fam and stay legit. Some city's have implemented a small ""Internet trading gods space"", so as to not congest the understaffed public service. Watch SSSniperWolf she covered this already. Love me <3",5
16034,A lot different from the original Letgo.. shipping is a hassle and the pictures posted are too small. Wish Letgo never sold or merged..... it was much better ..,3
16035,I really we'll sit there and browse this app for literal hours and get nowhere it's a confusing waste of time yet I continue to do it so three stars to you and me,3
16036,Please fix!!!! It ALWAYS glitches when trying to post and edit description. It can take 10minutes to post!! It's very frustrating!! I have to constantly close the app and reopen and that still does not fix the issue.,1
16037,Useless app you can never sell anything anymore. It used to be pretty decent but now unless you're paying and marketing you won't get any hits. Do not waste your time even posting on this app.,1
16038,Very cool app. Love it... Except it would be cool if the price for each item/ad-posting could be displayed over the ad image. So that way you don't have to click on each individual ad and open it all the way to be able to see how much the asking price is.,4
16039,"ultimate bait and switch with sellers, has happened 2 out of 4 times",2

16047,Unbelievable.....!!!!,5
16048,it can be a bargain,4
16049,"Perfect place to find the pre-owned products that I have been searching for.

One particular seller, Nestor Soto he post his listing as a shipping item but will not allow you to purchase through the app. Unfortunately I sent money to him via zelle and never received my item. I reported him numerous times to OfferUp. Unfortunately I haven't gotten not one response from OfferUp. The seller has now changed his name from Nestor Soto to Famous Vintage. Good seller ratings doesn't mean you won't get scammed!",1
16051,"Nice app functions well although not as busy as it use to be. Alot of low ballers just looking to buy cheap resell items higher. Also two many unwanted notifications, even when you turn off notifications in app it will still send them unless you block via phone permissions which effects getting messages from prospective buyers as a notification. It also spams your email with lame related search messages, totally unnecessary.",2
16052,constantly coming across great finds at reasonable prices or free. I'll need to be getting a bigger house at this rate.,5
16053,It's nice but they don't make it easy to contact someone you previously bought something from. It's also not easy to find customer support. They don't show your sells or purchase history unless you pay through offerup. I make most of my purchases via cash face to face so no purchase history on my account despite several purchases.,3
16054,great experience for me,5
16055,"This site has turned into a complete joke. Nobody wanting to buy, they only want to trade. The people that supposedly buy always flake out. Nothing but cutthroats on this POS site. It's worse than Ebay and that's saying something.",2

16064,"they don't do anything to remove scammers from the site. had a thief try to sell a very expensive speaker multiple times. after reporting it multiple times, the same thief would still have listings up. otherwise, it's an ok seller's platform. way too many ads",2

16069,Takes too long to be paid,2
16070,Horrible app and customer service! Shipped something from UPS. I got 2day extended shipping because I was running behind on dropping the package off. I dropped the package off before the 2day extended deadline on a Saturday but my package didn't get scanned untill Monday. I get a message from offerup saying that I have to contact the person I'm selling the item to because it wasn't within the deadline. Now the customer has what I sold them and I haven't even been paid. No response from offerup.,1

16081,very well managed by.,5
16082,it's nice being able to look of what's for sale from private vendors but it's an app exactly for that so why do I constantly see ads for Amazon and Walmart,3
16083,"Nice tool to avoid buying things that will just end up in the landfill. Ads are ridiculous because they all only come from Amazon or Walmart, 100% of Amazon is counterfeit and expired garbage. The other annoyance is in-app back button might exit the search, so you have to start over every two min. Also, they show you what they want you to see, not what you want to see. You may have to scroll down for 2k items, just because. Make sure you wait for the items to load in endless scroll.",4
16084,"tried to unsubscribe and it keep referring me to ""this web page does not exist""",1
16085,They cancel offers if the seller doesn't ship in 24 hours,1

16087,Good place to find what you want at a Lower price,5
16088,"The app would crash every time I tried to post something. Filling out a description or more sections would cause the app to crash, and I would have to forcefully shut it down. The OfferUp team doesn't know really when someone violates community guidelines. My account was banned twice, first from an error on their end, and second they are refusing to tell me. Their systems do not seem very legit as well as very scam likely. It is a good app yeah, but they need to have better customer service.",1

I will also no longer recommend this app to anyone I know or asks for a marketplace recommendation.

More greed and monetization hiding behind what should be a community app.",1

I get that they are trying to improve engagement with but false engagement is worse. They need to have better notification categories than just general and offerup. What does that mean? Yes, I know the app is called Offerup but what kind of notifications are they? Provide more transparency please.",1
16093,they never respond,1
16094,Unfortunately I'm preparing to not use Offerup app anymore. I used many online selling platform apps because it's what I do for a living. I have an online thrift store and I must say that I avoid posting on Offerup when I can. My biggest annoyance (that still happens even after the update) while I'm typing a message to someone the app freezes! And I have to close the whole app and start again. This happens almost everytime. Not a consistent or reliable app. Not making good money here. Sorry.,2

16096,"Used to be decent but now it's just a bad app. When it works it's ok at best but usually very slow, takes a few seconds to respond to input and most of the time it never actually loads to show anything so I have to use the website. Seems like every update doesn't fix anything or makes it slower.",1
16097,"This app is unusable! Even fully updated, I cannot send a message. It types a few words, freezes, types random stuff, freezes some more, exits the app. It's 2022, how does your app suck so bad?! And no, it isn't my brand new Galaxy s22 ultra that has no problems with any other app.",1
16098,"Update, it keeps crashing on me lately.",3
16099,this app sucks. it's always asking for you to rate it high.,1
16100,Really dislike the new update why change something when it was already working. Please fix offer up it's so laggy,1
16101,I've bought and sold using the platform. Businesses that spam need to be blocked. I can't find real individuals selling because business are spamming every single day. I'm sure my posts are hurting for the same reason.,2

16105,"Terrible company. Terrible support (non-existent to completely useless). Super sketchy sellers (i'm talking about homeless people that steal stuff, list it on OfferUp, then have you meet them at sketchy homeless shelters with people doing drugs, trashed out cars). This is an entrepreneur thief's wet dream to start a stolen goods business. I'm not sure I understand the point of OfferUp vs eBay, except for the enterprising porch pirate stolen goods market. I've canceled my acct but still get spam.",1
16106,If I'm not paying for the app ..I dont get viewed but only for the few minutes right after I post something. Haven't sold a thing even though I went down considerably in price. Other app work better to at least be seen!,3

16130,Flakes flourish and lowballers dominate this app is for the poor and ficless!,1
16131,I'm almost debating to delete this app from my phone since it's so hard to sell anything. Always get scammers messaging me and they're allowed to have accounts but I can't sell certain items because they get flagged for something against their rules when it's not but whatever. A lot of sellers don't delete their listings when not available anymore or just don't respond.,1
16132,Full of scammers with no support from OfferUp. Many listings just give an error when you try to purchase only to have sellers demand another from of payment. No support from customer service - seems like they're happy to have their site full of scams,1

16149,App crashes and sometimes a phone reboot after entering 3 lines of the description field.,2
16150,I'm writing just to anybody who might be wanting to download OfferUp that's a very very bad company they suck they don't do what they say they have no customer service and they say that you violate the community standards just for trying to post a simple ad so my advice is go to Craigslist and don't do OfferUp because you guys suck and I give zero stars and a thumbs down double thumbs down on offer up for my review thank you would definitely not recommend OfferUp to anyone,1

At least the top half of the list are sponsored ads from Walmart or some 3rd party site like aliexpress and even wayfair? Craigslist with an app, except at least Craigslist doesn't have this many issues and it shows more listings than ads.",1
16220,it really needs better servers offer up is super slow but besides the bugs it's a great app,3
16221,Be careful a lot of stuff you wanna buy was sold 3 years ago.,1
16222,This app is great to buy and sell it may have a few bugs but they do their best to fix it the only thing am mostly unsatisfied with is you can't see who you bought stuff from I wanted to get incontact with one of the people I bought from and it doesn't let me they need a option for that it only shows how many things I bought my 7 other friends agreed in this I hope they do something about this and if anyone else agrees,3

Thanks for looking into it Update as of 12/22/22 Nothing has changed. Why does no one from support or customer service try to address or fix this issue?,1
16227,Nobody wants or needs the little fake reminders you think something was happening you're getting some action and it's some lame suggestion it would be more helpful since you save everything everybody does if you saved preferences for distance and local no shipping some people don't do shipping and don't want to sign out of it every time they get in the app,2

16234,False ads..spammed with dealership car ads...they track your every move violating the new privacy act. They force you to use the app to post things for sale because they want access to your phone. It is harder to block malicous actions from an app that is why they don't let you use the website to post. THEY WANT TO STEAL YOUR INFORMATION...,1
16235,My messages are being delivered but not read. Horrible app.,1
16236,Easy to use and they treat you better than Marketplace. You actually feel like it's more professional and you feel valued as a buyer and a seller.,5

They say 5 days, but that's a lie with the weekend and holiday I'm looking at 7 maybe and of course the where's my money feature isn't there so I can't get an estimate.

16263,Day 1 I tried to buy something and they banned my account for no reason. I email them about it they unbanned me and then banned me again not even a minute later. This app is garbage,1
16264,Bad app.,1
16265,Will block you from messaging sellers so you can't buy anymore without telling you nothing for no reason! They make money from sales off buyers like me yet they don't care. I tried making another acount and it worked for a bit and then the same thing you get blocked. They like to protect scammers & fake products being sold! You message sellers but sellers never get your messages! Horrible business practices and Offerup wont last long in business! Mercari is way better!,1
16266,"When selling items, my OfferUp app doesn't consistently alert me when I have messages, so I often miss opportunities to sell items. When browsing to buy, I would like more filter search options. Specifically, I'd like to search by owner or by dealer when searching vehicles.",3

16276,great app. very useful,5
16277,"The biggest problem with this app is, that people don't respond to messages! People have posting over year and offer up didn't removed them and people do not answer the text. Craigslist is deleting posts after week, that way you know all posting are new, updated and the people answers the calls or text. I wish offer up do the same. remove the post after week let the junk postings go away and just have fresh postings on the app.",1
16278,App sucks. I can't use emojis or it doesn't have autocorrect. And then people wanna sell items at retail price. Please add an option for those who wanna trade items. Please fix this,1

Four messages to Customer service & they wont bother giving me even the slightest reply.

16323,I am actually curious to see if they are going to actually implement the suggestions people are giving them to improve the app or if they are going to continue to be one of the worst of the reselling apps I have used.

Since I already know what their price is on their phones I would like to see what other ppl have to offer. But what you get is 10-15 of their posts then some individual. Then 10-15 of their posts and some other individual. So just a warning to y'all. I don't use Offer Up much anymore.",1
16401,Tis so awesome....,5
16402,Offer Up is amazing! You find gems!! Thank you!!,5
16403,Tried installing it to search for a used car...almost all the postings were MONTHS IF NOT YEARS old! Would not recommend. They need to sort and weed out the ads much better!,1
16404,"Last few years worked well, now i geta notification then attempt to read after linked to the app and every time I Receive an error message...which blocks me from all offers and sales! A12 galaxy thru csphire wireless is the android I now have app on. I've missed so many sales. Need to work smoothly for my sales reputation to stand a chance.",2
16405,Cheryl and her husband Rob were on time and very nice to work with. live the bike and looking forward to getting some miles on it.,5
16406,So far ok,5
16407,Very laggy. Becomes frustrating trying to update or post items for sale.,1
16408,This is literally the worst app known to man way to many rules u can never get in contact with anyone and they keep removing people's items that we pay to post aswell as removing are accounts how is it a violation to your terms and conditions if its a buy sale and trade app that is what it's for and even that is a probelm bad enought we have to pay to even post vehicles now yall tryna tell us what we can or not add into the text why can't yall just let peopel be? Everyone gas to try to control,2
16409,"Great app, only issue is it's hard to reach someone for troubleshooting if you have a problem with the app. But I still would recommend it because it's an excellent platform!",5
16410,"Unless you stay on here, there is no way to see any replies to items you ask about. I dont understand why I cant leave my phone number so I can get a text back. I'm willing to sit on here all the time waiting for someone to get back to me and in the meantime, I find other stuff on Craigslist, so everyone misses out.",2
16411,Sent really quickly. really well packed. Great communication!,5
16412,it's like marketplace but better,5
16413,Sellers are mostly fraud,1
16414,Good application,5
16415,I can't use my account while traveling and I have lost a couple of offers. They don't allow VPN too. You suck,1
16416,"I'm not sure what happened. The first two items I posted have views however nothing after those have any action. Not enough users for getting rid of garage trinkets. I'm going to keep losing them, however it's feeling hopeless.",1
16417,old posts,3
16418,Be VERY wary of scammers.,3
16419,Great way to sell extras.,5
16420,kinda slow and a lot of flakes. I wish they could do something about that.,3
16421,works great,5
16422,This app used to be usable for everyone but now the keyboard suddenly stops working and freezes and crashes to Frequently I would give this a 0 out of 5 stars if possible because how unusable it is.,1
16423,"Like most others, keyboard issues. Swipe is Gone, number row is gone. Predictive and auto are gone. So whatever u did to the keyboard side undo it and fix it. So I'm not the only one seems like ü§¨",1
16424,"The app feels clunky, and sometimes will take a long time to load the search bar. I'm on a Pixel 4a that's able to run all modern apps fine.",2
16425,runs really slow.,1
16426,Nothing is viewed in any order any more. It's all ads ads ads. youll see something that interests you and click on it and quickly realize that it was posted two months ago. Then you'll back out and you're ten items from the top. Absolutely ridiculous. I can't even use it anymore. Avoid at all costs,1
16427,"it's a good forum, but at least on my phone, I don't get the notifications correctly and it takes a long time to load everything or move between pages",4
16428,I went to several different issues with OfferUp and they have done their best to resolve them she might have expected currently there is some problem with their I don't know what it is all they know is it takes forever to load pages and to get navigated through the program what is very sluggish and tends to be irritating. Hopefully they will resolve this issue soon.,3
16429,the best app the best option for sell or buy,5
16430,"My experience with this app is drastically going downhill. Never saves when I edit something never gives the right location. I promoted items all to no avail waste of money doing that. I used to love this app I sold many things on this and I bought some things. It's frustrating to have to edit. And I've wasted money promoting items. I cringe if I have to post or edit something. Update: tried promoting again, let's see if this is just more money wasted!",2
16431,best place to find what u need,5
16432,Pretty good üëç,5
16433,just amazing. never had a problem!,5

16437,Shaun was very helpful and scored an awesome fireplace. Thanks Shaun,5
16438,Always freezing up,2
16439,"Used to love this app. The last few updates have basically broken it and now it's basically a waste of time to try and use. I know messages go undelivered because I have tested this by messaging friends who never receive them. I used to pay for promoted listings but can't justify that anymore. On top of all this I've been experiencing the same keyboard, lagging, crashing, and terrible search function issues everyone else has. I'll come back when the app is fixed.",1
16440,seller is very nice and communicates well,5
16441,When offer up took over let Go they let go of the best features. At what point will yall start removing old listings or letting people use a sub search in the lines of in the last 30 days or 24hrs? Also let us see the price at lest. it should be the name and/or model of what the listing is not just a photo with 0 description. do this so we don't have to click every listing just to see they years old its annoying. Also there are tons of scammers on the shipping side of things its ridiculous.,1
16442,can't send or receive any messages for some reason,1
16443,found what I was looking for and much much more,5
16444,so cool just wish people wouldn't discriminate or be mean,5
16445,Good,4
16446,"Every update makes the app slower, harder to use, and clunky. What's with the forced search selection?? Gets in the way of my recent searches.",1
16447,New update screwed everything. It keeps freezing and crashing when I'm trying to post. Didn't do that before. What the heck? Do you not test updates before they're released?,2
16448,"BE CAREFUL WITH THIS APPLICATION DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT, THEY STEAL YOUR PERSONAL DATA, THEY ASK YOU FOR YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AND EVEN A PHOTO OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE SINCE THEY HAVE EVERYTHING THEY CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION, AND I AM I ASK WHY EVERYONE WANTS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION??AND THE PHOTO OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE WHY DO THEY WANT IT?? IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR PERSONAL DETAILS THEY WILL NOT LET YOU USE THE APPLICATION, DON'T BE FOOLED LIKE ME....",1

16451,"Issues again, I've had offerup since 2016 & again I can't buy or sell or message others for over a week now. Now I can't hide password when I type it in ugh. No more auto correct. Aweful. Please fit it back to how it was.",1
16452,no one responds,4
16453,Great app! a big help with me getting extra money for house needs.,5

16456,My messages are not going thru.. I'm getting no response from anybody and no one can see my posts for sale. Did I just get banned for no reason?,1
16457,"Absolutely terrible app. I might be a bit biased against another certain seller app in this review. OfferUp employs a flawed service model that relies on outdated promotion tools, poor visibility of items, and poor control of spam. Try Mercari. They're much more user friendly and sensible. OfferUp! The Pay to Promote is a scam. You know it, and I know it! Ax it if you want to remain relevant!",1
16458,great,5
16459,Far the worse selling platform. They are very roof less with closing accounts for no reason. No explanation of why. I posted a car wave got an email stating my account has been removed. Very bad communication when you appeal and they never overturn their decision. Selling a car isn't illegal activity. I had to get a family member to post it and they remover their account.,1
16460,Good stuff flaky people,5
16461,"This new update is very buggy and slower. It has stop working causing me to un install and re install. Please fix or bring back the old version..edit the latest update has disabled a lot of the keyboard functions. There is no autocorrect,swipe or voice typing. Especially on a Samsung phone. Offer up please update it again. Many people are having this problem New update did not fix the keyboard problems Update: new update has fixed the keyboard problems.",1
16462,I'm a long timer.... The App works for me.,5
16463,"it's a little lacking in procedure making a sale over the horizon , had some long distance scammers try to take me but in the same zip code it's fantastic!",4
16464,Not working,3
16465,"I'm liking this App quite a lot. It's easy to post items for sale and convenient to sell what's been posted. Thanks ""OfferUp""!",4

16467,Having problems with keyboard ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
16468,Be careful when purchasing on this app customer service don't help you out with anything they don't respond if you purchase something someone don't send their items they hold your money for 5 days and it's another five to seven business days to receive your money so it holds up your budget and chance to buy anything else for practically nothing but your money sent in limbo well I mean OfferUp just to use your money to make more profit off your money but that's all you're doing for the app,1
16469,the product was exactly as was described at the advertising.as well as looks at the pictures. I am happy with the purshase.,5
16470,Was billed 19.99 without bring told just showed up on bank statement I want a refund now,1
16471,Quick and easy... congratulations.,5
16472,Love it!!!!,5
16473,communication,5
16474,good,5
16475,the amount of views and ppl that actually write cus there interested realy don't add up how is there 100 views on my post but not one person has txt or been interested to ask for price or negotiate to me it looks like BULL,1
16476,"This app had become complete and utter trash. You filter search results by local pickup only within 20 miles, and LITERALLY all the top posts are shipping from across the country.",1
16477,offer up and let go fusing together what's the worst thing they could have done since the app has started I have no replies responses from anyone I have merchandise for sale for about a year now and only one view this is horrible they need to let offer up and let go be its own separate app it was working great when it was like that so disappointed I would not recommend anyone downloading this app,1
16478,great,5
16479,"very bloated app, everything is slow to load. If you click on a post just to look at it, you get a bunch of similar ad posts of the thing you clicked on, which makes it hard to navigate through genuine posts and ad posts. the app is somewhat good but it's just so slow and bloated and FILLED with ads. I can't stay on it long bc of that.",2

16482,Outstanding,5
16483,"Flaky as of late. Keyboard is borderline unusable, text box for chat is tiny and won't expand to what you type in full, and shipping is not available on eligible items.",2
16484,"Very hard to type anything out the last update won't allow any swipe-text or any auto spelling, doesn't space the words out. Just awkward & it is VERY VERY ANNOYING & DISAPPOINTING HOW MANY ADS POP UP AND HOW ANYTHING YOU SEARCH FOR IS INSTANTLY THE MAIN AND ONLY THING YOU'LL SEE FOR SALE... I LIKE TO BROWSE THROUGH MANY THINGS AT A TIME ON THE HOME PAGE LIKE BEFORE. IF I WANT TO SEE 100+OF THE SAME ITEM I WILL SIMPLY TYPE THAT IN THE ""SEARCH"" BAR!!!",1

16488,i wish you could send photos in the chat.,4
16489,"For some reason the app has been VERY laggy (with frequent crashes) the past few weeks. It makes the app nearly unusable. A couple bugs I've noticed: 1) keyboard takes several seconds to initiate after clicking on the search box 2) when clicking on a message notification, it takes 10 full seconds for the app to open and the message thread to fully load. 3) the app will crash after entering a search and the results come up. This makes the app unusable.",2
16490,"After my phone updated to android 13, offerup app while text messaging will not show the predictable texts. This is a huge pain for anyone who's used to using this feature. It works on everything else but the offerup app.",1

16492,very difficult to communicate with seller,4
16493,waste of time,1
16494,this is a good place to shop I love it,5
16495,room for improvement,3
16496,"app doesn't work good at all, I want to buy a car and don't let me send messages",1
16497,This app is Garbage! I listed a truck for sale and the app immediately deleted my posting and kicked me out of offer up saying I had multiple community violations. I have nonidea what I may have done to deserve that but there is not even a customer service phone number to call and get an explanation. Do yourself a favor and don't bother trying to sell on Offer Up!,1
16498,Great quality and Great price,5
16499,Hello I think this is a great idea for people to buy think cheaper and good quality. Thank you,5
16500,fast service,5
16501,Can't apply new location.,2
16502,Is to slow sometimes I lost deals because it take to long to answer or open the app,1
16503,It's all right,4
16504,Very Nice,5
16505,I wish I could post on my computer too instead of ONLY my phone.,3
16506,alot of stores advertising taking over on app,4
16507,No one responds to requests for interest or reply to messages. Better responds from Facebook Market.,1
16508,"Absolutely unacceptable, these apps allows sellers to fraduantly sell items. Because of the complete lack of moderation, I mw have thirteen hundred dollars that has been sitting in limbo for 2 weeks. Disgusting, especially when its around Christmas time. My family wont get presents this year on time, becayse of this garbage. Thanks to the lazy developers",1
16509,Couldn't live without Offer Up,5
16510,What's with this update. Developers are adding unnecessary things to the app and are in all honesty making it worse. After update have experienced a plethora of crashes and bugs.,2
16511,"Great app, definitely worth using.",5
16512,Recently I updated the system on my phone and predictive text stopped working on this app. Predictive text works fine on all other apps. Otherwise the app works fine.,3
16513,Pointless,1
16514,"It's been terrible since the last few updates. It's like the updates are making it worse. Can't delete text in search by hitting X, keyboard doesn't show predictive text, search results are inaccurate, items are on there from 3 years ago that. Update 12/14/22 - new update seems to have fixed most of the issues. It would be nice to see items expire so you're not wasting your time looking at items that are more than likely not going to bear fruit.",4
16515,There's no reason that notifications for messages from buyers and sellers do not pop up if you turn off all the secondary settings in the app. This is very dumb I don't want to be notified from something I searched for 3 months ago,1
16516,Doesnt work and Barely loads pictures,1
16517,App has become absolutely useless. Things don't load anymore.,1
16518,there's a lot of scammers on this platform,1

16521,App freezes everytime I type anything. It's incredibly frustrating,1
16522,"App is absolutely terrible. This is now the 2nd time offerup has disabled my account without telling me, or explaining why. I have over 300 sales, my last profile even more, I do nothing but good business, i follow all guide lines, everybody gets treated with the upmost respect, this is seriously disappointing. The fact they delete profiles of good legit sellers is insane to me. But everyday I get contacted by people trying to scam me. Again, TERRIBLE.",1
16523,Recent update won't allow Gboard keyboard swipe. Samsung swipe works.,1
16524,Not dure where to find replys to people who are interested in my items for sale.,3
16525,"Incredibly addicted!!! Love the app, have both bought & sold items. Wish I had come up with the concept! 1 point of aggravation...there should be a rule in place that ""you must mark Sold or it will be deactivated after 90 days"" Then if you want, repost.",5
16526,a lot of scammers on this site,1
16527,great place for good deals,5
16528,OfferUp is definitely a good platform to use for everyday searches. Very user friendly and easy to navigate.,5
16529,"Good app, but items need to have an expiration date. When conducting searches I find things that have been on there for 1-4 yrs. People either forget it's on there or they just don't respond. 90 days should be a limit, then they can resubmit or extend the posting... Just sayin",3
16530,I give it five stars if not for two things number one is that it shuts itself down all the time right what I'm trying to post something to sell it waits till I get to the very end and push post to sell it it shuts down I have to start all over again it takes me 15 times to get it to post second is I had over 200 sales with all positive reviews on the last account I know what the password is but no matter what it would not let me sign in so I had to make a new account again with 0 sales. Its BULL,4
16531,They continued to charge me for promote plus after I canceled,1
16532,"I've used this for some time now and it has served well for my purposes but one of the recent updates has disabled autocorrect, auto capitalization spell check and the ability to use swipe function on the keyboard which makes this a big pain in the butt to use.",1
16533,"I think messaging system should give ""read"" notification not just delivered. It may save us from sending too many messages to get someone's attention.",3
16534,"Almost useless now. So many spammers and businesses autoposting every 5 min. Also, they took away the swipe typing and auto correct features on the keyboard.",1
16535,Still waiting on the ability to send images in chat so that I don't have to give out my number or other contact to send photos,3
16536,it's fun and lots of items to look over,5
16537,It's pretty simple to sell things on this app if you are knowledgeable about how to do it.,5
16538,Ridiculously slow,2
16539,"Message notifications dont always show up. I cannot always find my ads or other ads I know are for sale, keywords dont seem to work.

16546,More Ron sellers don't respond.,2
16547,"I cannot understand what the heck is going on with this app. I just downloaded it yesterday. I tried posting an item literally 7 times now and it does not show up. Once I click done, it goes away. It was there once and now gone. Exactly what is the selling section for if you can't post an item to sell? I appreciate reading the other reviews. Maybe you all need to go back to basics. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. In this case you broke it, please fix it.",1
16548,Just blah and dont feel like i can do enough to help sell my stuff...,1
16549,Well they have nice product on here not abused or ussed prices are pretty good too Merry Christmas everyone,4

DJ equipment, nice office chairs, Snoo bassinets, all for seemingly great deals, but the scammer tries to get payment outside the app, etc. Look at the age of these accounts, and zero consistent backgrounds in any of their item photos. Always photos stolen from eBay or somewhere else. Offer up seems to do almost nothing to screen. I guess they want us looking at the ads while we peruse fake listings. Offer up is garbage now.",1

16564,it's okay limited to reposting,3
16565,"They keep old posts up from years ago, there are spammers, scammers, people dont even explain what theyre selling. Letgo made a huge mistake merging... Offerups platform and management is complete garbage. Still garbage.. nothing has changed. Theres a reason no one really uses this app..",1
16566,Great guy. Even took the time to bring the item to me. Thank you.,5
16567,"This app is pretty good. If it can get more users (seller and buyer), that will be even better. Why does this app so big (5gb which I rarely see an app bigger than 1gb) and takes so much space on my phone? Anyway to reduce the size of the app?",4
16568,"Decent, can't complain..",4
16569,Great App!,5
16570,With every update it just gets worse. The app is so slow to load messages. The most frustrating thing is they removed keyboard swiping from messages!,1

16597,"thank you, keep up the good work...üëçüí™",5
16598,Love it,5
16599,I post things and no views. app is a scam. bombarded with notifications of nonsense,1
16600,It can be a decent app if the sellers ever responded.. !!!,1
16601,have the price of the item on the main picture.,4
16602,"Slow in the last two months on multiple phones. Now it freezes within 30 seconds to one minute. Sticking with the browser version until fixed. What a mess. Phone's it is crashing and freezing on - Pixel 7 Pro, Poco F3, OnePlus 7T Pro, HTC U12+ ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2
16603,This app sucks it doesn't even work right it's the people don't even return your request I think it is hacked,1
16604,I love this app! You can look for items you're interested in and place offers for what you want. I'm able to buy locally or from anywhere in the U.S. I have also sold items on this site and it's easy and safe!,5
16605,Very slow loading .,3
16606,Best place to sell your s*** handstone,5
16607,"I can't even make a purchase every time it asks to verify my card endlessly, it's a literal never ending glitch even tried different cards didn't make a difference and after adding to many payment options to blocks you simply ridiculous don't use this horrible app.",1
16608,Offer is Cool. just dont buy out of state.. its a disapointment. Packages never arrive. Hard to communicate with seller.. If packages arrive they arrive in terrible conditions. Thats if they even Arrive...,5
16609,"Keyboard issues still with the 12-11-22 update. Swipe, predictive, nothing works, been a while so stopped using this app as it takes a while to do anything. Why would u mess with that? Seems like everyone else has the same issue. Suggest putting prices on main screen like every other app does, instead of going into each one and waste allot of time.",1
16610,I loved this app but for the last 6 months the message portion does not work. I send my questions or inquiries and get no response. I've easily sent at least 30 different messages asking dimensions of a product or a plethora of other questions but no response and no checkmark letting me know they got it. THE POINT OF THIS APP AND BUYING/SELLING IS COMMUNICATION!,1
16611,too many scammers.,1
16612,a lot scammers everywhere. they just want to do transactions outside the app,1
16613,great app I've used it for many years,5
16614,good app,5
16615,waste of time.,1
16616,app is super slow since last update.,1
16617,Good so far will reevaluate in a month.,4
16618,"Need access to Google photos for posting ads or at least allow posting ads on web site. App is broken after upgrade to Android 13. Now, the app only keeps showing your first page of your for sale listings and keeps repeating the list as you scroll. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it's the same behavior.",1
16619,"I have used this app for a while. It has made me sales where I am. However, it's more difficult to make more expensive sales on this than cheap sales where I live. And that has been like that since I have been using it since 2017. Not long ago it started becoming slow, I thought it was my wifi at first but, I tested other apps and they do not have this issue. Their are some things that need fixing but all in all it's very useful if you need to make quick, mostly cheap sales, at least for me.",3
16620,The app does not run smooth every time you click on something it says it's working on it it takes a very long time to do anything,1
16621,great job and selling site,5
16622,I enjoy looking for things that I needed for my family.,5
16623,not a lot of sell on here,1
16624,"Love OfferUp! It's a great app! Easy to use, someone always has what u need, and the process to buy or sell is perfect. Thxsüòä",5
16625,Constantly getting offerup not responding when trying to post.And then the app crashes.Way too many ads now.Especially ads from ebay and amazon.If you are a seller you even get unsolicited ads in your notifications. Too bad a few years ago this app was 4 STAR.,2
16626,How to cancel membership account please,3
16627,12.9% of sales.,1
16628,Really easy-to-use,5
16629,Listing instantly removed from marketplace with no explanation. Defeats the purpose of selling your stuff...,1
16630,"Love to shop and sell. And there with you, to help you,if you need it.",5
16631,too many junk emails.,4
16632,i like your app but why don't you allow it to be used on windows 11? it's necessary especially when you don't have a phone to use.,5
16633,love offer up,5
16634,if I only had 15 of everything that I've sold on here I'd be a rich son of a gun family oriented I got to keep it clean tomato tomomotto it's all good,5
16635,Latest update just crippled the app. Doesn't load anything lmao,1
16636,I like the app,5
16637,There are many things wrong with this app. I will say though you can't control what other people do but with so much technology how about deleting those that are a nine months to a year old. Make it the responsibility of the seller to re enter their data. If you ask my parameters for searching why do you not stick to them? I stay 5 miles for pick up only and I continue to see stuff that I am not interested. For heaven's sake don't ask me then and waste my time. I won't bother asking for save,2
16638,seller was extremely kind.,5
16639,Lots of problems. It wouldn't accept my password. I reset it multiple times and it would still say the password was incorrect. This after my first post was removed within a few minutes several times. I was just listing a bike for sale. I got a chat message welcoming me to the app but there was no way to reply. Garbage app.,1
16640,5 stars till they kick you off,5
16641,Lousey,1
16642,great app!!,5
16643,have not had much traffic on here!!,1
16644,I have never had any luck selling anything on offer up. I got a lot of texts and calls at unreasonable hours and when I respond the next day I never hear back or am told I didn't respond in a timely manor,1
16645,Always could always could find a deal and I could always sell what I need to sell,5
16646,I'm seriously disappointed in the customer service it sucks. For the past 3 days I've been sending emails with an issue I have with a payment and no one is responding. The item was delivered on Monday December 5th and I've yet to receive my money on my account. This is totally ridiculous,1
16647,Cheap nastards,5
16648,Great,5
16649,"Great finds, easy to use, and profiles with ratings from others of the people you choose to buy or sell to.",5
16650,love this app always been my go to wen I need to make cash or find something I'm looking for best app ever made,5
16651,"Horrible! Mostly ""game players and trolls"" that just waster your time & never come through!",1
16652,"App took over my default keyboard, won't allow for swipe out voice to text",3
16653,"good to sell old and new stuff to make extra cash,",5
16654,Replicas Replicas Replicas... What happened OfferUp? It hurts my storeüòÆ‚Äçüí®,1
16655,ÿ¨ŸäÿØ ÿ¨ÿØÿß,5
16656,no offers,1
16657,this app is getting political.,1
16658,Does not work without wifi,1
16659,Does NOT give notifications in ANY FORM when potential buyers are trying to contact you üò°ü§¨ NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!!,1
16660,Been trying to download this all day. It never gets past the pending stage to actually download. Don't bother wasting your time with this broken app.,1
16661,it is what lt is,5
16662,Great Application to buy and sell.,5
16663,"responsive, honest, and fair",5
16664,"After update. My keyboard gboard doesn't show the auto correct or have swipe function. Works in all other app. Wierd. Notification also doesn't let me know when I get a message anymore, no rings. I just see a notification popup. Everything else works well. Very easy to use.",2
16665,Good app,1
16666,"Lags way too much. I can't be on it for more than 2 minutes before it freezes or kicks me off. Would be nice to be able to post something, and it does not freeze, then kick me off, causing me to have to redo the entire post. It's exhausting trying to have to remember everything that I'd already written down. I miss the old offer up. This new update really does suck.",2
16667,I don't use it,1
16668,i love offer up very good deals,5
16669,This is the worst. Slow and clunky. Buyers are rude resellers who are interested in low-balling in order to sell items themselves. More notifications from sellers than from Buyers. I have to delete the app.,1
16670,"Great condition, great price and smooth transaction.",5
16671,convenient,5
16672,Thank goodness FB is letting me ship so I can delete my OfferUp account lol --Previous Review-- Let's hope this update actually fixes something. The last update broke uploading multiple photos at one time while still being just as slow and inefficient as the previous version. This has been typical of OfferUp for the better half of the past decade. I really do miss LetGo a lot but unfortunately only the version you can download and still use is not for this country so no one nearby will use it.,1
16673,easy to use and reaches many people,5
16674,Excelente,5
16675,Searching for free items. Where is this page???,2
16676,Every time I try to post something for sale it crashes I've tried over and over again and I already have the latest version of this app and I've tried to Uninstal and reinstall and nothing fixes it,1
16677,Concept is good but I feel the saved lists need major improvements. It's slow just to remove 1 item listed and requires a whole page reload...I have to scroll down again and again. We also need a feature to delete all unlisted and sold listings from our saved lists.,3
16678,What happened to this app. I loved this app before last update lagging in description very frustrating I'm going to have to start selling on another app. Very disappointed,1
16679,I like it alot,5
16680,I LOVE OFFER UP,5
16681,easy to use and convenient to make a lil extra for whatever u may need the cash for.,5
16682,haven't sold anything yet,1
16683,This is the slowest app ever. So bad it is so popular.,1
16684,"BEWARE!!!! This app will literally deactivate your account for no reason and will not tell you why. Haven't used it in years, tried to get back on it to sell and my account was deleted. No warning or nothing. BOOO",1
16685,Best App ever :) Great place to buy locally and in any state :) Ebay is trashhhh :),5
16686,good but once in a while takes long to load the message besides that I love it,5
16687,"ok. lots of ads, little customer support or staffing, no option to renew listings",2
16688,Great for selling stuff other people want or need üñêÔ∏èüíµ,5
16689,"app is great but super slow when switching from post to messaging back to post. Its not a deal breaker, just annoying. I tend to give my cell number out just to avoid the delay so i dont miss getting the sale or scoring on a deal",4
16690,"Would be way better if I could use with my VPN. I always have to deactivate my VPN just to use the app which makes Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, and Ebay so much more appealing.",3
16691,Super slow.. hate it THANK YOU LETGO!!!!,1
16692,OfferUp is the best place to buy and sell anything!,5
16693,I have missed out on so many sales because the only way I'm able to receive notifications is in email form,2
16694,Overall my experience with OfferUp has been very good. I do wish that our items for sale would run through the feed at least three times before we are charged to promote the item. The only other issue I have is when I make a sale the $ amount of the sale is automatically entered as items listed price. Rarely do I sell an item at listed price. It is usually 10-20% less than the listed amount. this can make quite a difference regarding income taxes.,4
16695,"Every post is not viewable by anyone but myself... I posted headphones, plants, art you name it. Using zero prohibited words or pictures. Zero responses back from offer up reps. Avoid this app",1
16696,App freezes often,2
16697,"They deserve a zero star rating! The item I posted which resulted in my account being removed was identical 2 many others that were currently listed by other sellers or were actively being advertised 2 me as a user on OfferUp. If these items are being displayed as paid advertised items, than they most definitely are items that have been pre-approved as acceptable by offerup. But still they'll remove your account with no explanation other than claiming they reserve the right to do so. Total BS!",1
16698,Best app to sell anything you have. real simple to use even a 5 year old can do it...no spam no ads...try it out I promise you will like it.,5
16699,It's great! üëç,5
16700,You need fix the editing process. Very bad.,1
16701,Freezing.,1
16702,great tool for buying and selling stuff safely,5
16703,love the choices and all purchases have been great,5
16704,The app has gotten to be nearly unusable. It is so slow and laggy. There are more ads than listings and the messaging feature is dogwater at best.,1
16705,0 Stars if I could- Bugs + Vulnerable to hacking then they ban you! The search always defaults to their preferred settings when you want to change categories. Message portion is difficult to manage and delete. Must have some severe system vulnerabilities because my account got hacked then they accuse me of doing something I never did and they ban you without any further review even after multiple emails trying to explain the situation. No real customer service phone number exists!! Bad Company!,1
16706,Decent app but won't stop sending useless push notifications even after changing settings.,2
16707,"12/8 edit: Keyboard suddenly stopped working?? I don't have autocorrect anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. There was NO reason to overhaul this app. It did not need it. It was simple, quick, and easy to use for everyone before. Even a grandma could use it. And although they tried to clean it up, it somehow looks so much worse. You guys should be able to tell by the feedback, this update has had the opposite effect and is very negative.",1
16708,Some people are transgender and still have their deadname on their government official ids and don't feel like deadnaming themselves just to verify who they are this app forces you to use your government official id meaning if ur trans u gotta deadname urself to use the app,1
16709,"Easy to use format, good graphics and a system that is convenient to contact sellers. I do wish, though, sellers could be contacted by email or text messages rather than just through the OfferUp app.",5
16710,Excellent app to sell on,5
16711,Nice,5
16712,"There should be a filter to separate private sellers and dealerships for vehicles. It's hard to find something accurate because dealerships price cars really cheap but that's not the sell price, that's the monthly payments. I only want to buy from private sellers not dealerships.",2
16713,they are very snooty with they're members,3
16714,Very great app and things to buy and sale. Real person,5
16715,The app for scammers and bike thieves. Please clean up your app. There are listings that are months old. Shipping being offered only means scam to me. Too many scammers.,2
16716,Offer up makes a false claim of 30 seconds. I have tried for 2 hours to post an RV on there app. No luck at all. Terrible experience.,1
16717,"When this app first came out it was awesome. It was fast, smooth and I didn't have any glitches. Now it's gotten to the point where it constantly crashes on me, so I'm going to uninstall it. I don't know if it's because I have an older phone(LG Stylo 4), but if this is happening to other people with newer phones, I hope it gets fixed soon.",1
16718,"Being forced to join ""truyou"" for verification. I did all other verification requirements to prove I am not a ""fake person/account"". I'm just trying to sell my coins. I know many people that have an account and aren't being forced to join truyou to sell something.",1
16719,This app is very unreliable. Lags a lot.When you try to buy items some people will purposely give you the wrong address to set you up for a car accident so you can be driving around lost. Then for some reason they don't want you sharing phone numbers like if they are the ones hiring people to scam you.Why would u do business with someone who can't provide a number ?Try to search for a car at 3 am it will be sold by 8am like if the ad was fake just to get your hopes up. Many endless fake ads.,1
16720,good items to find,5
16721,Without warning they disabled my account I had for 8 years. Make sure you read all the rules and follow them to a T or you will get band.,1
16722,lags,2
16723,"For years this app has been awesome. I've gotten rid of so many items I no longer use, and if I'm looking for stuff I will search here, for sure. Recently the items I had posted for sale disappeared completely. And my messages on the app are getting forwarded through email. Don't know what's going on, hopefully this issue gets resolved soon.",4
16724,"Sadly I started having issues with keyboard in message section of OfferUp. Really frustrating, not having predictive text, auto correct, auto capitalization or spell check. Not sure what is going on.",3
16725,It takes like 45 minutes to finish a conversation when you do a sale because it's so slow. I don't even want to go pick up these shoes that I already got the address to go get because I I've been trying to reply to this girl for like 5 minutes and it won't bring up the screen it just keeps saying retry. At least put the price on the post so I don't have to click the picture and wait 20 years I bet we'd sell a hell of a lot more stuff if we didn't dread the excruciating process.,1
16726,App turned to garbage with a quickness as of the latest update. Can't post anything since you can't type much without it lagging and eventually just freezing and crashing.,1
16727,easy to use the search feature is good I really like the app,4
16728,Like the app.,5
16729,"Offer up Deactivated my account for giving away free bras. I tried contacting them and got the same automated message over and over. EVERYONE on this app gives away clothes for free all the time! But according to offer up my post ""was in violation of their policies"" what a joke. I was on offer up for 7 years. My seller stats are ruined because of offer up!",1
16730,gives Craigslist some competition,5
16731,I would love to be able to repost my items for a new or day on a easy way and fast,5
16732,TOO SLOW!! I've been using the app for many years but lately it's too dang slow. It lags big time. And it does it no matter what device I use and it has nothing to do with the network either. The app is frustratingly slow. And what's with the jobs thing lol it don't make sense!,2
16733,Buy great things from friendly people.,5
16734,some messages don't deliver to possible sale.,1
16735,it's glitchy. it's slow and unresponsive sometimes. the numbering notifications is wrong often. slow and glitchy please fix.,3
16736,I was scammed via trade and OfferUp didn't do anything,1
16737,not sure if I was scammed and no help from offer up.,1
16738,good prr,5
16739,"The app itself is very useful, I use it often and like it. My only complain is that keyboard swipe, autocorrect is broken and developers haven't fixed it in over a month.",4
16740,Slow. Trash app.,1
16741,to many spams,2
16742,Was 5 but nothing but over posting from business's. You cannot find anything that's going to be person to person in electronics or cars. Unfortunately the only option is the Facebook Marketplace,1
16743,niec and easy to find things. but the fraud department needs to step up their game. they don't do anything to anyone who you report as committing fraud on their app. Very disappointing,3
16744,Great App!,5
16745,It doesn't allow you to search for items you're selling. Poor IT help desk when there's an issue. No quick resolution to app issues.,1
16746,"The app has my favorite in person selling app desires but DAMN this app is terribly slow and glitchy, i tried the desktop version and its not any better. This has been an issue for wayyyyyyy to long now so get it fixed asap or nobody will use it no more. Myself included.",3
16747,So slow I can't even post an item. Frustrating.,1
16748,this app is complete garbage and I can't believe it replaced let go,1
16749,"love the app, so much easier for me to use than Facebook marketplace and can actually search for stuff locally. bought and sold hundreds of things and never had any issues personally just have to remember to test things whenever possible and if your unsure about something trust your gut and pass. if it sounds too good to be true; it probably is..",5
16750,So like this app used to be cool you should put on there you know pick up now you put pickup in and they still want you to order s*** online I'm not ordering nothing online OfferUp don't you get it let me have my own f****** choices,2
16751,Easy app to list on. Simplicity is key.,5
16752,Very slow and bad in submitting reviews... customers rate but my reviews are not increasing witch means there's a problem in the system.,1
16753,very easy to use,5
16754,Worst encounter of my life. Scammers are all over this app. Please beware people !!!,1
16755,Who would have thought we can work together to sell or give away items we no longer use. This is wonderful.,5
16756,Tried to sell my video game headset and games and did all the verifying...my items still won't appear to others. Stay clear of this app. As no one ever gets back to me on fixing anything,1
16757,garbage app lots of scammers,1

16766,"The app is complete garbage. I have constant glitch issues to include scrolling. As a seller, it is frustrating to have 300+ items for sale, however, there is no search icon to use to quickly locate items. For promote plus, those are not all displayed together at the top. Again, you have to scroll through all of your items. I have sent multiple messages on how the app can be improved. I still get the same bot responses.",1
16767,"Got banned for no reason, no warnings at all.",1
16768,"Don't get notifications from buyers, have someone pissed that wanted to buy an item. He messaged multiple times and I never got notified until I opened my phone. (Android)",2

16773,great app.,5
16774,great customer service! definitely will buy again.,4
16775,Posts are left up way too long and people don't remove the item once it's been sold....,2
16776,Offer up allow certain people to post stuff but not other people... I counted over 50 Colorado advertise posts about the same service I'm offering and mine's keeps getting deleted instantly and they got some that have been posted from 6 days ago up to four years ago. I feel discriminated against...,1
16777,"Im giving this app 2 stars because I was forced to download the app to make a purchase. I don't want the app,what if I didn't have a smart phone? Anyway im deleting it, I made my offer.",2
16778,I think its really cool,5
16779,Kept crashing first time I attempted to post something to sell. Could never get through adding details. Totally froze up my phone and crashed my system. Phone resumed as usual after deleting.,1
16780,My time on this app was not as positive as I would of hoped,2
16781,easy and best desls,5
16782,being able to find good deals on things via this site has saved me money on multiple occasions and any money saved nowadays is needed,4
16783,"The app and company are trash. I asked them for information on an account of someone that had stolen stuff from me and then tried to sell it on their app. Not only did they delete the conversations I had, they also removed my account and stated that I violated their Prohibited Items Guidelines. I looked at them and I had nothing posted that would violate, so I asked them what I did wrong. They then replied with vague answers and now its due to violation of Community Guidelines and Posting Rules.",1
16784,nothing has sold,2

16790,love offer up..Easy to sell all your stuff in one place..,5
16791,update a few months back slowed it down,2
16792,App is slow and would not download on a phone it was installed on previously. Stating that the phone did not have the capacity to download it to. It downloaded before and friends who had the same phone were able to download the app but not me. Very frustrating to say the least.,1
16793,Not crazy about all the business companies selling on the app. It was better before all the business activities.,4
16794,They have gotten better when it comes to them having to email them on weekly basis regarding my account bit sending messages.,3
16795,Too many businesses and shops have taken over. Can not get for sale by owners anymore,4
16796,"The lag as you upload and type the description has been corrected. Although, under the ""selling"" tab, it only cycles a partial list and repeats, thus not allowing you to see everything on your selling list and see how many times an item has been viewed.

16797,"Shipping fees and commission are high. When contacting support with technical issues, only get automated responses with solutions that don't work, and it seems impossible to have a person to actually read your emails for further assistance.",3

16814,"cant add new items on desktop This app went downhill. I used to have 200-300 views per day, now I get one if I'm lucky. Unless you pay to promote you get zero visibility. Looks like back to Craigslist",1
16815,"This app is filled with deadbeats and incompetents. People either aren't reliable, or don't know how to take pics and compose proper descriptions and terms. This app is like the trailer trash of online selling forums. And now with this latest update, I cannot even scroll through my listings.",1
16816,Best web site to sell 6*,5
16817,"Excellent customer service, highly recommended.",5
16818,It's a great app when it works the way it's supposed to but lately it's just so ridiculously slow and laggy. Almost unusable to be honest.,1
16819,finding bargains is why I rate it 10 stars.,5
16820,Great app,5
16821,"Like this app, have made a few sales as well as some good deals on a few items. This was quite some time ago. I want to like this app cause it HAS helped me sale quite a few items and make some much needed money as well as find good deals, BUT HERE LATLEY I CANNOT EVEN RESPPOND TO MESSAGES with more than a sentence or maybe 2 before it NO LONGER ALLOWS me to type anymore and freezes up then either shuts down, & stalls. SPENT all day taking photos etc. but now CANNOT post from the website, WHY???",5
16822,"I don't know what's going on with this app lately. I can only access a handful of my posted items, even though I have probably over 100 items for sale. I can't do any edits to any of the items I can't see. This a horrible inconvenience, since this is part of my income. Any advice on how to fix would be great!",2
16823,this app is terrible when it comes to sending messages,1
16824,Charged me 20 bux after trial for sales promotion ended. No contact information or customer service. Promotion did nothing.,1
16825,This app has went down the drain!,1
16826,Easy to manuever. People response it quick and usually considerate of each others location.,5
16827,Great place to sell junk. Everyone comes with low ball offers.,4
16828,It's great to buy and sell,5
16829,This app is a joke u message people and the never respond you better off buy and selling on a street corner than with this app,1
16830,"This is a great app, except every time you go in you have to reset your preferences. There's no option to save it. It's frustrating when I find something and it isn't in my area.",2
16831,üòèbusiness friendly I guess. ü§ë easy to use .. üòÅthere is always room for improvement üòà,4
16832,I can't share my listing so there's no way I can promote it.... Every time I click the sheer option literally nothing happens.,1
16833,good place to shop for pre-owed item with affordable price,5
16834,This use to be a good app what happened,1
16835,"super easy to use, love how I can contact the seller before I make an offer absolutely love that I can make multiple offers and negotiate price along with shipping. also new items almost every day and if you like an item you can heart it and put it in a list and check on it later so you don't hafta scroll through every page to find it if you exit out of the app. 5 thumbs up!",5
16836,"Dunno what happened. Got a notif. about new items that matched my search. Clicked on it. App won't open. Restarted phone, no dice. Cleared cache, no dice. Cleared data, no dice. Uninstalled and reinstalled, no dice. It just hangs on the offer up loading screen. I'm at a loss.",1
16837,Verry simple to use,4
16838,"Has Orwellian and ostracizing policies. My post to sell a piece of a toy gun was taken down. After appealing it they still refused to put it back up saying it may not generally be perceived as a weapon (implying it is) but to ensure the safety yada yada yada we wont put it back up You also can't post some hand tools, yet there are chainsaws posted all over the site.",1
16839,sell faster did nothing,1
16840,I love this app,5
16841,good app to sell your stuff with no hassles,5
16842,Great app to look at,5
16843,ok,3
16844,Garbage. I ordered someone through offerup to be delivered it charged me still but yhe seller says they accepted the item but offerup canceled it. There's no email no proof.but I still was charged. So what are they gona do about it? ?? Make it as difficult to fix as possible that's what they do about it.,1
16845,"Microwave in good condition and thankfully Ross was able to install for me...he was very efficient, well mannered and respectful...many thanks Ross!",5
16846,Xcllent,5
16847,"Yes it's great to sell your things but if you can get in. To start the app it takes several tires to start and slow slow slow. I thought something is wrong w my phone,so I go tablet same=slow. I thought something wrong w my connection or equipment but after reading few of the comments I realized I'm not alone. Update Dec22: This app sucks, it's so slow and frustrating I just leave.",1
16848,Offer Up always have what you need!,5
16849,"Had it as 5 stars before, but now the app messes up my keyboard settings. Can't use swipe, doesn't do autocorrections, doesn't do Word predictions. I feel like I'm typing in the old ages with this app now",1
16850,Swipe will not work with this app anymore after the last update. Please fix it.,1
16851,The app is so slow it's ridiculous I've deleted and re-installed but same outcome.,3
16852,very nice app for sale anything,5
16853,Awesomeness üëç,5
16854,u will find it here and u will be safe in here.,5
16855,great app. was easily able to sell appliances i no longer needed. Thanks,5
16856,takes long to load and it shows different items between my app and my wife's app when we both type the exact same thing into the search. (shows more items for sale than mine). And yes the search mileage is the same as well!,3
16857,best app ever,5
16858,I love OfferUp!,5
16859,nice,5
16860,respond well product was amazing everything I saw in the pics wood definitely buy again,5
16861,Great place to sell and buy,5
16862,OfferUp needs to time limit ads,4
16863,After the update it won't open the app üòí what going on...,1
16864,you took fast typing away. can't save a search with the filters,2
16865,"Deletes all my listings after I create them, so completely unusable.",1
16866,When the day came I first used this App everything I posted sold within days. Presently nothing sells it is like my posts never get seen by others. If you do not pay the promo fee then why post. That is my Experience with this App. If you do not have an Android or iphone then this is worthless to use why is that. for that reason i rate this Zero Stars. Going back to C.L.,1
16867,"IT JUST STOPPED WORKING, I have to UNinstall and reinstall. No way to update, no way to log out and log back in. Only way to use it is to uninstall and reinstall. So lame. Than I can get lowballed on my objects for sale. People don't understand to offer an amount you have to be close to the price, don't make 50% off price offer or 10% offer. If you can't afford it move on to the next item.",1
16868,"Wasnt happy initially with the state of things on the app; it seemed like most of the listings were only intended as local ones, despite often having obscenely cheap freight costs listed within their posts. Then after not even one whole day, i went to log in and i guess my account was restricted or revoked or whatever? Which is weird because, unless there's something against selling your own paintings on here, or a used game controller, that breaks ToS? Things have NOT improved since LetGo. =(",1
16869,"I found exactly what I was looking for and tried to buy it, It would not scan my car to verify. I cannot buy anything on this website without the scan card function which I tried repeatedly and with multiple cards. This entire website basically is useless.",1
16870,"I like getting notifications from Offer Up, the pictures are super helpful as well as the sellers profiles. In-app messaging keeps communication safe too. Buyer, always be wise when dealing with any long distance deals though.",5
16871,"Some odd reason, I can never get a response or a message seen by a seller. missed out on some dope items to buy.",3
16872,"Very slow, and have to double or triple tsp everything. Trying to view my listings and it shows the same ones over and over. Definitely disappointed.",1
16873,"After update when setting search distance and local vs ship, the settings don't stay. Either the distance or ship (or both) will go back to default. Sure would be nice to set a default that I choose (perhaps In App settings) and always use that. Also, when you search for a specific item, popular items show up above the items that you actually use. Recent searches should always be on top instead of items that are useless to the user.",3
16874,"No customer service. Items listed for sale four years ago, items from sponsors showing up in local seach - the backwater of online marketing. Uninstalled",1
16875,Quick and easy,5
16876,"sometimes you don't give single hit on posting , probably to promote paid boost",4
16877,"Notifications come and go, it seems like the only ones I receive are ""new near you!"" versus the important ones like messages about things I'm selling. Other than that the app is user friendly but there's way too many paid features.",2
16878,I experimented: I emailed 200+ Sellers straight out offering full price or 20-30% over list price immediately the same day they listed item for Sale. RESULTS?: NOT ONE REPLY FROM SELLERS. After listing my items for sale and never getting a Buyer response over the past 6-8 months NOR Seller responses on my offer to buy - IT BECAME EVIDENT OFFERUP IS A SCAM APP. For YOUR EFFORTS - You WILL neither Sell nor Buy a single item on Offerup until they change their business plan to ALLOW transaction,1
16879,I like everything about it in the past I never had any problems,4
16880,I used to love offer up but it seems lately that my items for sale rarely or never get seen by anyone.?,3
16881,The App is horrible stay away from offerUp. OfferUp shadow bans you for no reason you think you posted your item for sale but it gets no views nore it shows on items listed.,1
16882,awesome app,5
16883,Have not been able to post to make some extra Christmas money. Don't waste your time they never respond to emails. Blocks you from even attempting to make a new account and lost out on a shipping sale because of this. My first review ever.,1
16884,App isn't working properly. Doesn't always post,2
16885,After the new update when you message people the default keyboard with your phone doesn't work. You can't use spell check or auto select a word. I've tried clearing cache and data. I've uninstalled and reinstalled same issue. Please fix this then the app will five stars again,3
16886,"Usually like using this app, I prefer to get things second hand, but I was having the same problems others have described below. Now the app just wont even load. I just get stuck on the startup screen. Pretty disappointing.",2
16887,I love this app so much,5
16888,it's too many people on here that waste your time,1
16889,üòÄ,5
16890,great platform,5
16891,great ser. andcoverage,5
16892,It won't open today. Says there's a bug and needs to be updated.,3
16893,"So easy, convenient to use. Experiences good so far.",5
16894,"Started good but I have to end it,I even got my first car and managed to sell as well thanks to this app, but after sometime it became very very unsafe with an almost unending army of bots and strange posts,not to mention the cashap harassment,I also had to cancel a sale because I had a bad feeling about the meeting. And the day I got scammed finally came so I'm done,If you are reading this just use the mainstream shopping sites, no matter how cheap the item is, its not worth the risk or worse.",1
16895,"Account deactivated! My account was deactivated for not following the posting rules or following community guidelines. (Which was not correct). They have bots that report and remove posts that they think are prohibited items, but they are not! I have reached out to all the customer service emails and they have not reactivated my account. Absolutely ridiculous that they think I was not following the rules. Please reactivate my account!",1
16896,Good,5
16897,Meet alot of nice people!!!,5
16898,"What's up with the keyboard not working with my swipe functions. When I try to message someone you have to hit each letter to write now and it wasn't like that before! Please fix this ASAP üôè you can't even use voice to text like it was before the last stupid update. Well I fixed the keyboard swipe function myself, I downgraded the app to 4.54.0 now I can swipe in the messages or use voice text much easier than the stupid recent updateü§¨",5
16899,"Horrible communication. Accused of not following community rules.....I don't think so........nobody cares at offer up to correct that, after 6 months..still no response from anyone at offer up..........",1
16900,"App became slower after updates. I'll put in my city but it will list another city, there are listings shown from users that haven't been active in years. The community isn't great either. Bunch of lowballers, ghosters, and people who don't read descriptions and location. If you want to sell pricier, rare items, go with eBay or mercari. Edit: Even slower than before (how is that possible?). Can the owners just sell this app to someone who actually somewhat cares?",1
16901,I changed my location and yet it keeps giving me offers from a completely different state. Hard to buy locally if it isn't anywhere close to local.,1
16902,"Slow as all get out! Now I can't see all my items. Also, there is no option to delete an item that was given away or taken off the market.",2
16903,awesome,5
16904,a good selling and buying site,5
16905,app very slow!!!,1
16906,"You have to give up personal info to become tru you qualified. even if you have been in for 6 years. oh yeah, that facial recognition you submitted is now able to be shared and sold to 3rd parties. Super not comfortable with that.",1
16907,Wont let me sell anything. Any time I list something it is removed immediately. No response from customer service. The layout is not the best for browsing items either. Do not reccomend.,1
16908,no one responds,1
16909,"App sucks a**, not worth the memory space it takes up.",1
16910,app is slow and you have to reinstall all to speed it up.,2
16911,"love the app, how me find and buy what I need",5
16912,"The app needs updating, how about a relist option after a week instead of deleting and having to fill out all the information again and again. Also all my lsting are not coming up, it gives me the same ones over and over again, won't load all of them.",3
16913,"App is slow. Some of my inventory is not showing up, but loops what does show.",3
16914,Absolutely Useless ... Try and search local used and OfferUp FLOODS YOU with new COMMERCIAL items on the other side of the country,1
16915,Decent app to find things locally but I would not recommend buying or selling through the app. It is not secure and the customer support is aweful if there is a problem. Just do yourself a favor and use PayPal or Venmo. These people do not care if you get your money.,1
16916,"The absolute best. I love it and it's very professional and I guarantee that you will find exactly what you are looking for, in the best of ways.",5
16917,Keyboard messed somehow. Can't fix,4
16918,Never works anymore. Just keeps refreshing constantly,1
16919,Very glitchy on Pixel.,1
16920,I havent went against any guidlines and i cqn post my postings but when i went to look for my profile through someone i know who wanted to purchase my items they cant even view non of my postings. But i have it on ly selling list with no views. I contacted offer up and no response. I cant sell anything if no one can view it. Its there but it cant be seen even with my profile public.,1
16921,very easy and convenient üëå,5
16922,I am definitely biased because I hate Marketplace and Craigslist. OfferUp is my go to .,5
16923,Lots of scammers. However the app severely slows down while trying to type a message. Very odd glitch. I have to restart the app almost every time I try and type a message.,2
16924,Really only one free post for motorcycles and other items can tell you're becoming a greedy company as well,2
16925,I love you offer up!,5
16926,"Bloated with spam, full of scammers, prices not visible until you click an item, inaccurate results. Please someone remake letgo. Garbage app",1
16927,Very efficient,5
16928,"I like the app purchasing features, but don't like some of the ridiculous sellers rules and I really hate the customer ""no-service"" hot line. When it comes to people exchanging money for real property there should be a live person to help when problems arise and if you use the site often enough, there will be problems with scammers.",2
16929,I hate the fact that you find an item that you're interested in and you send a message to get more information or get the location on the item and you don't get any response. These people should be banned from using the app. And offer up should look into these a little more.,3
16930,"Doesn't let me post, offer, or message sellers my account is basically useless since its trying force me to join truyou",1
16931,"Using the mobile app hurts the soul. My soul bleeds everytime I have to wait for the app to respond or just open the damn chat for me to respond to someone. OfferUp on PC is decent, on mobile is absolutely a piece of garbage type experience.",1
16932,All positive results so far,5
16933,app has been having issues loading pages,4
16934,Have found three deals that were awesome. However one of the sellers was a hoax.,4
16935,Scammers app . not reliable at all.,1
16936,you guys let corrupci√≥n in the app,3
16937,"Best nonFBMarketplace app for buying and selling locally, IMO. I've spent several thousand on different items and saved a ton of money doing so. Ever since they merged with that other similar app (Mercari) this has been my preferred market and the first place I usually look.",5
16938,Good,5
16939,"I absolutely hate this app!! I've sold two things on there but to get to my other items, it does not show me. It shows the first eight items I have but that is it. I will be deleting everything once I'm able to and move on to a better platform.",1
16940,I like how you celected our protection with the customer.,5
16941,Ok,3
16942,"Cant actually make purchases because the card verification doesnt work. Attempting on the website tells you to use the app. Support says ""other users are effected"" and ""theres no eta on a fix"". Seems counterproductive to not allow your users to make purchases..",1
16943,"ok so we all know the app is slow, I want to know which app everyone is using as an alternative.",2
16944,"after I submitted my info for truyou, I found out my messages weren't reaching to anyone and offerup's support won't help me past sending me canned automated responses. it's like I got shadow banned for no reason",1
16945,you don't get any messages from this app it withholds messages and notifications for whenever it wants to tell you the messages come in days on days late if you don't buy the promotion where they promote your sale then your item up for sale will probably never get seen and even if it did the way the messages are not in a timely order you would probably miss your sale I am so sick and tired of this app I post things to sell and nobody hits me up which is really unusual as I used to sell so many,1
16946,I think maybe somethings should have a short video on electronics and motorized vehicles ü§î,4
16947,"This app is horrible. I even photographed both sides of my i.d. and I am still banned from commenting on posts when I am in desperate need to buy a vehicle to get to work to earn a living. offerup used to be a wonderful website, and I have purchased more than 30 items when I was allowed to.",1
16948,great site,5
16949,"This app has operated as good, as I could ask any app like it too operate.",5
16950,lots of useless users,2
16951,great app to help you clean up and clear out some space getting rid of stuff that's just taking up space collecting dust. instead of collecting dust you could be collecting money selling those items,5
16952,Great Selling app. Just would hope to see more features,5
16953,It used to really work good,3
16954,Please fix the new android 13 update issues. The keyboard when typing the predictive text auto correct spelling and other features doesn't work anymore also the emojis has been disabled.,1
16955,Fix this app NOW !!!!!!!,4
16956,great app for resale,5
16957,I have had trouble posting and photos not loading,3
16958,perfect,5
16959,"great way to get rid of things and make a few bucks. Best part is you don't have to load your car up with your unwanted things to take to a donation center. The people can come to you. The only part that makes me want to stop using this app is how VERY SLOW this app is. Even with leaving the page open, I can never pick up where I left off. It always restarts itself and you have to go through the app startup every time",4

16966,"I have loved this site for years. However recently, I made an ""offer"" on a rug and a woman berated me and stalked me all afternoon for offering $15 less for the item. She was so rude and incessant that I needed to be nicer when I text her. I said, ""Take $15?"" and she abused me all day long. Now today, I find out my account has been blocked for approx. 2 weeks because she reported me. How can OfferUp make these decisions without involving the other party? This is beyond crazy and unfair practice.",1
16967,"Updated the app, now I can only see my last 20 listings and when I try to scroll to see all the others it only shows me the same last 20 listings. Please fix so I can sell or archive all of my other listings.",1
16968,the app is ridiculously slow,2
16969,"Very easy to use , I sold things and bought things Glenn L.Barber",5
16970,Alot of glitches. Slow to post ads and repost ads. OfferUp needs an upgrade and a face lift. It's either poor programming or someone's asleep at the wheel here. Offerup used to be great. Very few glitches and ran smooth.,2

Zero, and I mean Zero, customer service. They literally just don't care. This is not uncommon, thousands and thousands of people have the same issue. It looks like the app is working normal, but you will get no responses and cannot communicate with sellers, to buy their products.",1
16974,"Nothing but SCAMMERS and SPAMMERS baiting and switching on this app. Offer Up is doing nothing to prevent these thieves from operating. We are smart people and can cut through the BS but come on man the level of spamming is ridiculous. Get these people off of the platform, once a report has been submitted OfferUp needs to follow up. They're just selling ad spaces that's all they're doing. Do not use.",1

16984,duplicate posts obscure items from the people this app was meant to connect you with. the app is not policed well to app this from occurring.,1
16985,I used to enjoy this app but it has changed immensely... I didn't have to worry about what I bought being a scam and now it's like I have to think twice if I really want to purchase anything from this app... I wish this app would go back to being as simple as it used to be but I don't see that happening which is really sad to me...,2

16990,"Customer service is a joke, app is ok, but lacks many features",1
16991,Amazing application easy interface and quick sales.,5
16992,"The biggest downside to this app is most things are posted from 5-6 years ago, nobody takes off the items if they just throw them away. they just leave it there and forget about the app post... A solution to this is: every 30 days you give the person a message saying you're going to take the post down unless you update it",1

17007,Customer service is garbage good luck getting your account back once this morons disable it for no reason. Worst app ever in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend... the idiots won't even tell you why they disabled your account for no reason. I miss LetGo they didn't do this garbage.,5

17016,This app is nothing but cell phone wanted ad's it's frustrating and annoying,1
17017,you can find what u need for the rite price üíØ,5
17018,Awesome app for both selling and buying!,5
17019,"Trash. Can't sell an eotech it gets taken down every time, but then it goes ahead and tells me when someone else is selling one",1

17021,Offerup seams to get more responses quicker than other advertising sites.,5
17022,Before I buy anything I check offer up first... And 9 times out of 10 I get an unbelievable deal. A deal that is so good my friends are starting to ask me to find them stuff. Just truly an awesome app.,5
17023,great app and great people who use it,5
17024,great app with great offers,5
17025,"Good Site! I am new to offer up, and I like how they have buyer protection and how fast and easy it is to get into contact with the sellers to talk to them directly about what it is that you're looking to buy from them. Yes I would and will reccommend to friends!",5
17026,Using Android 13 and SwiftKey keyboard. The messaging part of the app doesn't have autocorrect. Makes me sound like a high school kid from the 2000's when trying to communicate with sellers/buyers.,3
17027,I AM NEVER Disappointed anytime I go on offer up and buy anything I love offer up I love whoever begin this app. Whoeverdidthey smartes people in the world because one man's trash can be another man's treasure or 1 woman's jewels could be another woman's Tools lol that was just my little saying But I love offer up keep up the good work guys and let's keep up helping each other there is families out there that need each other right now I'm one of them,5
17028,The app is easy to use.,5
17029,great as always,5
17030,Don't want to give a bad review because I use offer up all the time but there is a major glitch in the app when I'm scrolling up or down it bugs out,3
17031,A lot of things were sold over a year ago. The adds are still up long after the item sells.,3
17032,"app loads up to slow, and sometimes you get kicked out after error message.",3
17033,Find a ton of things to get that you can't find anywhere else at a suck low price.,5
17034,Really Cool place to shop for bargains!,4
17035,This app deactivated my account because I wouldn't get a subscription. They charged me randomly a few times within a month. The funny part is I didn't sell anything and I still wasn't getting enough views. This app is trash juice. Try Mercari or Ebay I've sold alot on those 2.,1
17036,allot of spam texts,3
17037,Sometimes 'I don't receive messages and it makes things complicated,4
17038,Shuts down,1

17040,"This app tracks the heck out of you and sells your info to everyone. Over 6,000 tracking attempts in less than 5 minutes and draining my battery. Had to force stop the app because it would not stop the tracking attempts that I was blocking through duckduckgo.",1
17041,limited search opinion,3
17042,Don't like this app won't let me get back on it says to join truyou and won't accept my phone number bring back let go,1
17043,"There should be a way to batch delete items that have been sold or delisted. There's no reason to keep them saved if they're unavailable. Sales tax should NOT be added to used items and when a user limits the radius for searches, it should be adhered to.",1

17049,great app but to many non responders,5
17050,thanks for coming in life,5
17051,"NEEDS TO DELETE OLD LISTINGS/SEARCH ENGINE SUCKS. They leave old listings up to make it look like more is posted, but more than half the items are inactive/old (even 3 years old). So you waste a lot of time browsing. Search engine is awful. It'll show lots of irrelevant results from different areas and doesn't give you good filter options.",1
17052,"Within a half hour my account was blocked for ""violating community guidelines"". I have no idea what I did. I can't even find a way to contact customer service.",1

17078,"Update** It's only right that I update my rating from a 3 star rating to a 5 star rating. I enjoyed it before the updates. I held off on updating until I really had to. Before, I was able to have my saved boards and add somebody to view, add and so on. That was taken away. Also taken away was the 'free' category. I feel like I don't get many items when I search for something. I haven't had the same luck searching for clothes for my kiddos as I used in this app when nothing was wrong with it.",5
17079,Good,5

17081,I can't swipe when typing.,1
17082,not impressed! I haven't sold anything here only on Marketplace!,1
17083,These people are not selling good deals. They are charging regular price for used goods. Whoever is buying this stuff is slow. No way I'm paying $150 for a used cricut and you can get it in the store for $160! Or a new embroidery machine for $600 and it cost $400 in the store! And all of these ads are just ridiculous & unnecessary!,1

I have zero faith it was worth it as I've had my account with offer up for 7 years and never sold a thing!

17096,"Good app for selling, but sometimes message notifications don't go through. I'll open up the app to see I have messages from potential buyers. I'll never get a notification. This causes me to miss some potential buyers who think I am inactive or ignoring them. Another thing is how items are promoted on the app. I feel like the app doesn't promote my items or simply shoves them into the background. Other times it shows them to everyone, but not sure how true this it.",4
17097,Ok,4
17098,"I've tried posting items for free, but offerup keeps removing posts. why are you doing this?",3
17099,"This is the redheaded child of selling apps. You know you have it but it's easily forgotten. The app is clunky and slow, you have to click on each button twice for it to be processed to the next screen very frustrating and very slow. This is the last app that I update and post on. While the other three apps I use have my top priority because they are user friendly and I get results.",2
17100,"They have a lot of ads and people trying to scam. Also they don't let you sell things that are completely legal like knives or gift cards, they will disable your account and not inform you of it, so you you will go and post a some items and get 0 views.

It makes posting an item impossible. S22 ultra.",1
17101,Best game graphic,5
17102,great app,5
17103,easy to used,5
17104,Nice app for selling items in you're area.,5
17105,Please stop giving me a stroke with the top menu flashing constantly while im scrolling,3
17106,Good to find go od stuff on low pics,5
17107,Just bad. Just work on the app. No autocorrect or slide typing. But it's also just trash in all aspects,1
17108,"Offer up dead, I sent messages to them(sellers) none of respond, looks scam.",1
17109,Let go was better off alone.,1
17110,Obsolete platform. Very few users.,1
17111,The app is really slow and the changes we're not improvements. Too much focus on premium. Very low traffic it seems. Will not be a FB market competitor on this path. Used to be much better.,2
17112,Good stuff,5
17113,great place to buy for less,4
17114,"Needs interacting map to set your search areas. Should have autodelet for old forgotten posts, businesses need separated section",4
17115,Very Happy with t Offer up,5
17116,u have to pay to get ur items pushed which is essentially the only way to sell them. very annoying. basically like a garage sale in the middle of nowhere: no one is gonna know it exists,1
17117,the best,5
17118,They don't give any refunds. And they are very scummy. They don't care about their customers. Just please if you do decide to try offer up beware of their scams. I still don't understand why I was charged. And you can't speak to a real person. The number is a recording that says not yo leave a message because they will not get back to you.,1
17119,For sure this app can compete with Craigslist in buying and selling the things. And having it's own messenger even makes it easier to communicate than the Craigslist. Thanks!,5
17120,"excellent source services please use it, üôèüôèvery good üëçüòÄ",5
17121,it's great,5

17126,fine. lots of ads. some shady characters. old o posts dont come down.,2
17127,Super easy to use,5
17128,Great,5
17129,CAN THIS APP STOP CRASHING ALREADY!!!!!,1
17130,quick easy and cheap tons of variety,5
17131,You removed double tap zoom. You removed spell correct when messaging. You still have the worst touch response when clicking to see a saved search; it wants to remove saved searches. Still haven't fixed saved items in order. Nor have you added an edit feature to remove sold or unlisted items. Last give sellers a fricking bone! Allow sellers to give bad feedback on people who ghost them or read but never respond.,1
17132,"Slowest app on my phone! I have 72 apps installed on my phone, and this one is Slow! Slow!",1
17133,Electronics aren't allowed to be shipped despite not breaking the shipping policy.,1
17134,Been happy with every encounter I've experienced on the site so far.,5
17135,Too many spamming sellers and no way to block seeing repetitive sales posts.,1
17136,Quick to respond and frenly..,5
17137,"To many messages. I signed up yesterday, in the past 24 hours I have received 6 messages reminding me to spend my money",2
17138,Better than FB marketplace and less scammers trying to get you to send them a goggle code. Easy to sell to local people in surrounding area of your listed items,5
17139,slow,3
17140,My account got hacked and now it won't let me do anything. This app is really getting on my nerves I've never been asked to add the truyou when activated,1
17141,I used to be able to swipe to text and my predictive text would show. Now I can't swipe to text and no predictive text. If this doesn't get fixed soon I'll probably have to say bye bye to this app because now it takes too long to type up a description.,2
17142,The app still sucks.,1
17143,always has good selection,5
17144,awesome platform and marketplace.,5
17145,Great place to post. Good opportunities to sell negotiating or firm prices. Enough time to sell difficult items,5
17146,"I don't understand. I listed a vehicle to sell, and got an email confirmation that I listed it, but it does not show up under ""selling"". I listed it again, tried to view it, and got a notification that my item was removed from the marketplace. No email letting me know it happened, or why. I reached out to customer service. We'll see how this goes..",2
17147,99% of the people that was on here trying to sell stuff was higher than what you could go to Walmart and buy it,1
17148,Overpriced for repeat users. Alot of spam asking for your phone number. But you can sell your stuff,3
17149,Everything was out dated,1

17154,"Ever since OfferUp got with Let Go my experience selling went downhill. I'm looking for a different app. OfferUp, does keep you safe by telling the Buyer's & Seller's to keep the communication open on OfferUp.",3
17155,I have had such great experiences and found a lot if great things with OfferUp!,5
17156,the app is great it's the people that don't read the description that makes this thing bad because they just waste your time and then people just are rude and they'll lead you on and then space you off,3
17157,Lots of scammers and no help on fixing posting issue. Everytime I try and make a post it disappears a few seconds later saying it was removed. The reason given why and everytime I contact support for why they get deleted for apparently no reason I never get a response. I've tried reinstalling the app and it didn't help along with a handful of other fixes I got from a forum. None worked. App is basically useless to me if I can't make a single post so I can't go over 1 star until I cam make a post,1
17158,Super slow,2
17159,locks up all the time,1
17160,Was OK to use till half the screen was turned into a giant ad. I understand ad based apps but this is ludicrous.,2
17161,"The app is great if you are trying to sell stuff and you don't have a certain time frame. I have a wide variety of stuff for sale and some have sold in a day or two, and the others have been on there for months. Also I believe I give really good prices if it retails for $100 I usually don't charge no more than $50 maybe $60. As long as you know your item is worse don't let people low volume that's all",5
17162,Tried to use the app but it won't even open on my phone because I have a VPN router. What are you trying to harvest from my network that you can't function without me turning off my VPN? Guess I don't need to use this app that badly. Sounds like a lot of people aren't impressed enough for me to risk it.,1
17163,It's a great app to be able to find all kinds it things to buy. I'd give it 5 stars if it loaded faster and opened on my second screen of my LG V60 like it used to a while ago.,4
17164,Functions fine would like to see the adds gone,5
17165,Very disappointed with this site most of the items I'm looking at is from two and three years ago you think the people would update this I'm going to delete it waste of time,1
17166,It's all good,4
17167,So much lag. It's obnoxious.,1
17168,Very good trusting app,5
17169,"I love offer up, but I wish there was a limit to how long someone could leave a post, there should be a limit, like 6 months, and the the item has to be listed again.",4
17170,I pay for premium and really hasn't improved traffic.,3
17171,After submitting offer to seller for an item it goes under review just to get my account banned. Like not cool did nothing wrong. Do not recommend.,1
17172,Waste of time full of scammers promote plus is a joke,1
17173,for very slow and responsive and I know it's not my phone,3
17174,"Lots of ads that are years old; clearly no longer active but are listed as if they are. Too few filters. Excessive notifications of stuff in not interested in. I only want notifications for messages ONLY, but it's all our nothing. Use it less and less as time goes. Too bad, it had potential.",2
17175,I posted my one free car then it was removed so I was forced to spend $7.99 and then my post is still not showing up I sent a message to customer service and they sent a general message that is automated and still no help. I followed all the rules of posting. I haven't been on OfferUp in 3 years and since I've been back on it for the last 3 hours it totally sucks it is the worst app on the market it's a scam there's nothing but shoes .. smelly shoes for sale in horrible neighborhoods,1
17176,I buy and sell for a living on the side. But unfortunately my account got banned just because I put up a Roku device and then I took it off decided don't wana sell it..my account got banned when I can't message anyone and I asked OfferUp to help they completely removed it. Really uniust when we are just honestly selling and buying here. No human communications either just ban ban without any response if u message their support. . Do they just automatic ban you without any real human explanation?,1
17177,kicks me out often and runs slow with plenty of glitches... but once able it's a good site for buying and selling.,2
17178,everything as described and on time,5
17179,No sirve para nada ya puse toda mi informaci√≥n y no puedo enviar ni recibir msg muy mala aplicaci√≥n,1
17180,need to clean up some stuff more then a years,4

17190,Very slow app. It's running like super overloaded truck.,3
17191,Have a great experience I've been able to sell lots of stuff I didn't need and found lots of things I'm interested in,4
17192,Offer up does not do a good job in flagging posts. Numerous commercial retailers spam offerup making it an unpleasant experience. Too many retailers posting numerous duplicate posts daily.,2
17193,"App is so laggy on all low end device, for 1 min post I end up taking 20 min just to post one post. Facebook, 5 miles and even Craigslist isn't like this",1
17194,"bought&sold stuff on here, yet to be scammed or ripped off. I always deal in person that's probably why. thanks offerup!",5
17195,reviews are very helpful,5

17215,can't get a response out of offer up tech support. if you have a new number and the previous holder had bad dealings good luck. other than that seems good. never have sent an offer so....the ads look good,2
17216,"App needs to remove "" still available "" it's very annoying People just send it and Text this message all the time and they don't respond back.",5
17217,When did Offer Up get so soft? And now you gotta pay to post items in the same category? Man really trying to get their money out of people. Hell I remember u sold a paintball gun back in 2014? Now it's a big issue.,1
17218,This app is so much worse than Craiglist. Constantly getting message from scammers and people out of state who don't realize that my items would need to be shipped. Searching only yields results from users who paid for their ads (scams) or Walmart links. Why are we using this garbage?,1

Two actually said they were going to come look, but never showed up. I wasted most of my day waiting for their arrival. Very rude not to at least cancel their appointment. oh well.",3
17238,awesome app love it,5
17239,App is pretty good .. definitely another way to earn extra cash..,5
17240,"Do not purchase anything to be shipped to you ! do not trust this app when making a purchase unless it's in person you will not get refunded you will lose your money and get no response from customer service in a timely matter I recently purchased a couple of items got no responses from the sellers ,after a few days it triggers a automatic refund that I never received It's going on two weeks they have a 3 to 5 business day policy do not trust I'm not certain if seller keeps money or offerup",1

17243,A very great app,5
17244,super,5
17245,lots to buy and easy to sell. thank you offer up.,5
17246,"The app places the buttons so that an accidental double click just submits an offer for the full amount, and the app has no easy way to cancel an offer. Seems really sneaky design. BE WARY! Also, there are a lot of scammers on here.",2
17247,absolutely horrible user interface the app barely moves takes about 20 seconds to open in about 20 seconds to move from page to page.. it is the worst operating app for site I have ever used and I'm shocked that no one has fixed it yet,1
17248,SUCKS!!! I've been waiting three day to get TruU verified. I'm missing out on money!!,1
17249,"I can't get into my account. It's saying that your account has been disabled due to violating our community guidelines. But all what I did, I disabled my account due to get maybe newer version and it didn't let me to get back. Please help me what can I do.",5

17251,It's a great app,5
17252,this app is SUPER slow and unresponsive,3
17253,the app is too slow to load up and maneuver through on a Galaxy android. SAD,1
17254,weird u can't see price until u click into it. which is annoying,3
17255,"This app is getting out of line. Why can't there be a way or option to block a seller and not be able to see there listings it's getting ridiculous how there's so many listing of the same person with multiple accounts just spamming. Also, there's no point in reporting them since it's a possibility of getting banned for reporting. That's what I've heard.",1
17256,One of the worst sites for selling items that I have ever used.,1
17257,great deals!,5
17258,Today I sold my Sony Trinitron television to Evan . Evan said he paid me through the application but no such transaction showed up he went and checked to make sure his banking that it hadn't showed up. He then paid me via zelle I would have preferred cash but zelle would work that being said it would not let me rate him it said it was already done it gave him problems too cuz he was trying to make sure he didn't get charged and it made offer up for the first time a horrible experience,3
17259,I hate this app it always kicks me off amd doesn't let me search for what I'm looking for,1
17260,"This app disables swipe texting on my keyboard. The entire app is glitching. You can't offer a different ""offer"" price. It just sends the already offered price as the offer. You can't hit/use the enter button to start a new line in the chat area. The quality of this app has steadily decreased over the years. So many ads. So much fraud.",1
17261,My biggest problem with offerUp is ad's are allowed to stay posted for yrs. I was looking at a post the other day that was 5yrs old and that's just dumb,3
17262,"A place in favor of scam, unfortunately. Most of the lists in this app seem being phishing. I tried to query over 50 of lists and got 0 responds.

After successfully bought the items off craigslist, I eventually uninstalled this useless app.",1

17264,Everything is available here to negotiate!!!!?!!!!!?,5
17265,nobody ever gets back with u,3

17275,please take out the popular searches that takes up almost all the recently searches menu. it was better without it.,5
17276,Good Offerup,5
17277,Too many advertisers now. use to be more one on one without the retail stores and companies,2
17278,it's good,4
17279,App always kicks me out. I've contacted corporate and they instructed me to try several things that may fix the problem. I've done what they recommended but issue still has not been fixed. Very unreliable and unpredictable.,1
17280,I like how easy it is to post items and communicate with buyers/sellers. I don't like that they automatically populated my followers list from my friends list and now I can't delete them. What if I don't want my friends and acquaintances to be notified every time I post something for sale?,4
17281,"Used to work perfectly fine, then started glitching and freezing and booting me off. Its getting annoying.",2
17282,finding great deals and nice people,5

17286,not good at all there are listings on there from 4 years ago that they do not take down so you waist your time . let go was great when it had its own app let go should have never joined offer up,1
17287,The reason why I write this app so poorly it's because I went to the process of identification I went to two ID my email address has been verified my phone number has been verified and my email address has been deferred by everything's been verified and yet I cannot install anything enough rap I think this happens worthless and useless because I put stuff on offer up two weeks ago or actually a week ago and no one nobody has responded at all so I say to developer you need to change policies on y,1
17288,Horrible customer service. The items I am posting kept disappearing. I reached out to the customer service and they send me their policy and guidelines; 3 times same response for the follow ups. They would not say which policy I violated or what guidelines I missed. Please use Facebook marketplace instead. More viewers and better support.,1
17289,"This company will close your account/ghost ban you without any notification, making it appear as if everything is working fine on your end. They reserve the right to do this ""at [their] own discretion"" whether or not you have actually legitimately violated any terms.

I literally did nothing wrong other than provide as many details about it as possible and checked on it daily just to one day be signed out, so when I tried to sign back in it said ""your account has been disabled for violating our community guidelines"". What did I violate? Posting a legit brand new watch and providing legit details about it?????",1
17292,great place to sell and buy! messaging needs work. text doesn't scroll so key board covers up what you are typing,4
17293,1st old items are still showing up years later. (should give a max 90days) 2nd app takes too long to load images and pages. (I've uninstalled multiple times) 3rd scam ads of same items on multiple accounts 4th when I need the app it doesn't load at all.

Like I'm waiting on the thing to load my inbox for a whole 2 moms just so I can contact the person I'm trying to me The app behaved the same on 2 different phones. But the most frustrating thing of all, I rarely get notified of a new message from a potential buyer and have missed out on countless sales. After the new phone, it worked for the first week. And now, it only ever notifies me of items from followers and other promotions.",3

17326,REALLY HOPPY TO HAVE DOWN LOADED OFFER UP!!!!!üòÜ,5
17327,They remove legitimate posts with no explanation. Posts to sell only show up in app and not on web page. No explanation of fees when you sign up.,1
17328,time to let us post from our desktops. this is where my pictures are and my folders. the play stores say it can go on other devices. isn't a desktop another device. but it only wants to load to phone and ipad. ggggrrr,1
17329,"Having the same experience as everyone else as of lately. I thought it was just me. The app lags, freezes, then shuts down as I try to either respond to a message or edit a product Description. I've moved on to other apps such as ebay and mercari because it's frustrating. Also, please allow sellers to relist and renew items. This app is very outdated compared to others.",2
17330,"I love how when you switch to or view another app to enter in your 2FA code, it immediately closes whatever you were working on and brings you back to the main listing page. Very convenient.",1
17331,Great transaction,5
17332,I'm new to this selling online & OfferUp is easy and somewhat effective. however it seems like the buyers want the sellers to GIVE your stuff away!! The fees are fair and I m happy to post items on their site,4

17337,"I've been on OfferUp for many, many years. The app just progressively gets slower and more difficult to create postings. Latest update now prevents Android keyboard from using predictive text, automatic capitalization, automatic period after 2 spaces, etc. Why in the world would they do this? Inexcusable.

17341,pretty good results so far üëå,5
17342,"Honestly, I almost never like to give my opinion but what I see about the app is that it never puts my post, they seem good or bad but it is what I offer and I deserve to be put online, Also if he touched a post to see it, wow I get the other posts as in the same category and I don't like that I want to see all, all the new posts that come out. because if he touched some shoes, I get all pure shoes, and that's not what it's about I want to see everything new no noms shoes Thank you very much and",2

17350,I like it except it always freezes during texts.,2
17351,There's a guy named Rusty that sold fraudulent items and wasn't willing to take product back and return it went I got a vacuum cleaner sometimes ago and the lady said bring it back for a full refund,1
17352,Whether it's buying something new to you or selling something you no longer have use for. Offer up is one of a few apps that bring you the chance to do both right on your mobile phone.,5
17353,posted 5 or 6 items. only one showed up in the listing.,1
17354,overall positive experience,5
17355,"Switched from apple to Android . Offer up app is almost unusable. It freezes for no reason then shuts down. Loading lag is horrendous. I have a new pixel 7 pro . I use my work iphone to use offer up now . Hopefully this app gets fixed. Support is unresponsive , and never email back.",1
17356,"Finally able to use the app...what a joke. Every time I list, it is removed for not legal,. It's a damn trailer or a ring. What the hell is illegal?. Don't download...not worth it.

17357,great deal....and Bob helped me with all the details of using the trailer. thanks!,5

17378,The app is slow and it turns itself off very often.,1
17379,i was selling legit items and kindo of making a living off offer up.. had many stars and great ratings. for some reason they banned me and people can nolonger see my items and cant see my messages. its as if they banned me. i tried creating other accounts but no luck. its as if they banned me from being on offer up using my phone.. its such a headache. im so frustrated and disappointed. i used to think and talk highly of this app,1

No spaces after words unless u remember the space bar, no return button for a separate paragraph. The developers don't care anymore as they don't respond nor do they fix the issues.

17386,a 3 becuase old post should get deleted after certain time and not leave them for as long as they stayed after they sold.,3
17387,messages only works timely when you start being a user. after awhile you feel like forced to pay to upgrade your listing . messages come in a much later date .,2
17388,I love OfferUp but I always have the same problem with this app. I have uninstalled then reinstalled this app six different times on two different phones after about a month of use I don't get the Cha Ching sound when I get a message so I never know when I have messages on OfferUp.,3
17389,What was a nice local way to get rid of stuff has become another marketplace overrun with advertising and commercial marketing.,1
17390,sometimes it freezes,4
17391,Could y'all maybe monitor how often the same pawnshops and actual electronic and phone stores (people who already have a place to sell their items) and remove some of their listings from the top blocking everyday users items? Or are y'all just really in it for those paid promotions that don't really help the average customer who relies only on this to sell? Because a lot of them do it so your forced to go to them and get a 3rd of what it could be sold for.,1
17392,"Too many scammers and no 800 number to call, can't file claim because website is down, meanwhile folks creating fake profiles and stealing my money and no refunds or help at all...great place for scammers promoted by offerup",1
17393,idky but sometimes it gives you the home screen with prices on the pictures. wish this was always.,4
17394,"Trying to post items for sale and it won't let me go past 4 items. Sometimes it'll give me 5 items, but if I close the app and go back in, it's back to 4. So frustrating",2
17395,This app is full of fake accounts and fake people they will comment on your post and not respond back and this was a good app before letgo was put together and this app was good 4 year's ago but now it's trash !!,2

17397,very efficient and protective of sellers and buyers,5

17401,no problems at all,5
17402,too many adds and push nitifications for the site,2
17403,I have done pretty good with selling on this app. Maybe in the future they might consider allowing for promoting one's locally owned cleaning business.,4
17404,me encanta la aplicaci√≥n,5
17405,offerUp is hands down the best place to buy and sell. I would have given 5 Stars but the pop up adds and promotions while opening the app are getting out of hand.,4
17406,People don't give much away lately except wood crates,4
17407,"Zero views on multiple cars I've listed. The app limits the user to 1 auto listing per month. Fair enough. But I post a car, sell it elsewhere (not through the app) archive it, post another one and it gets no views. Horrible app that is designed to work against the user. Find a better way to work around this issue, you idiot developers",1
17408,Great App,5
17409,The heads behind the services of this app are providing the greatest security and peace of mind that customers deserve.,5
17410,"Messaging issues. All of a sudden the app doesn't play well with the keyboard - no autocorrect, no word preview, you have to type exactly each letter. Using Google keyboard which works with every other app. Makes writing to buyers a big hassle.",2
17411,This app doesn't work anymore. I've had the same problem for 3 weeks where it keeps asking me to verify TruYou but it gives me an error. It won't let me sell anything. I've gone back and forth with their support. Absolutely clueless! It's like they go out of their way not to help you. They have the worst support!,1
17412,very slow app and when you switch to another page you will need to reopen new offerup page and miss your search and we need more fillter options.,1
17413,"This app has just gone down the tubes, too many car dealerships, glitchy performance,very aggravating to say the least... this app used to be great !, But now I have to say that a 1 star , rating is being generous...

I've reported more scams then I care to consider and yet they come back over and over. I can't understand how it is so hard to filter out the scams. I used to browse randomly multiple times a day. Now it is not worth even searching for a specific item.",2
17417,Will delete your account for unknown reasons. Stead clear of this soon to be obsolete app,1
17418,Sucks they bought out let go now it seems the entire app is made of vehicle retailers and wholesalers selling broken tvs for 3/4 price it seems like there aren't a ton of organic sellers but the ones that are on here are great from what I have experienced.,4
17419,Is this app having a stroke? The top and bottom are flashing on and off the screen.,1
17420,Absolutely ridiculous application to use. I DON NOT RECOMMEND OR TRUST THIS SITE!! To many scams and spams. Do not use offerup as you can be hacked and lose everything!!,1
17421,user friendly program and immediate results.,5
17422,on time and great watch thank u,5
17423,"offerup does not follow its own policies, if a seller doesn't follow through with thier end in the allotted time frame. yet the seller prints a label and you decide to cancel youre stuck and they'll not give a refund, regardless of circumstance. I am currently dealing with this issue & will be deleting the app. I would rather go on Facebook marketplace or swap meet than deal with shady business practices like this. if they did it to 1 they'll do it to all!!",1
17424,"If you want to sell something this is the app to use. It's easy to use, simple and not many bugs. I like how it shows how many things they bought and sold. Transparent history helps",4
17425,"Now i cant send anymore messages because app says its preventing SPAM even when I have my account verified. Uuugrrrfffff im trying to search something OFCOURSE i will write to lot of people and choose from the ones that are still available the one i want, but now i cant go on....",3
17426,you no why I m right you like that because yesterday make me words to setup my profile asking for too much,1
17427,Y'all removed my post even though it did not violate any terms. I was clear and concise and even explained that you yourself as a product has a glitch. Please explain this. Also your app forces and doesn't allow more than one item per user currently. This is a forceful way to make someone possible violate your terms even if it is not intentional.,1
17428,Offerup should change its name to AwfulApp Biggest scam,1
17429,"Useless, just use craigslist. Listings don't actually post. I've posted several computers, most of them I've had to post multiple times before it shows up, but today my listing was published and then disappeared without warning a minute later. App is CONSTANTLY nagging me for my ID (which... no). And as expected, all interested buyers leave you on Read. Uninstalled it.",1
17430,"it's a good site, if you need something. you might get located.",5
17431,I would give zeros stars if possible. Immediately deletes anything I try to sell.,1
17432,I have purchased a couple things using offerup but the search radius has never worked. If I search withing 10 miles I get results from California to New York. I wish they would fix that.,3
17433,"Can't authenticate credit card. Filled to brim with scammers of every variety. Avoid this marketplace like the plague unless you're exclusively doing local, cash only deals.",1
17434,lacks a bit to get from one point to another bt still does the job if u be patient,3
17435,Absolutely atrocious selling app in terms of customer service as well as the user interface. Full of scams as well and your browsing page is littered with adverts that will take you out of the app and to places like Walmart or Amazon. Hard to tell the difference between an actual listing and the ads because the adverts are set up in the same manner as the listings are.,1
17436,"Wow can it can worse? Apparently so, now takes almost a full minute to open",1
17437,DO NOT USE!! THEY WILL BLOCK YOU FOR NO REASON & THEN SAY TERMS OF SERVICE VIOLATED. JUST USE FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE OR CRAIGSLIST. YOU CANT GET BANNED FROM THERE. TOO MANY ADS ASWELL.,1
17438,Great help,5
17439,great way to give and sell,5
17440,Wouldn't let me sail anything and said that I had to verify my phone number but wouldn't even tell me how,1
17441,Nice,5
17442,i need it,5
17443,this app has always been a really good place tro buy or sell just about anything.,5
17444,"never anything worth buying, shows me results far out of my area even though I've reset my location amd distance multiple times. useless",1
17445,Love it!,5
17446,All it is is advertisers and you cannot adjust settings if I wanted to but something from wal Mart or Amazon i would go there I wanted to buy something used.,1
17447,Trash nothing loads everything freezes its been years and still no fix,1
17448,Great!!!,5
17449,"Ads and promoted ads obscure search results. Lots of miscategorized listing, lots of scam ads with computer screenshots, placed clearly scams. When you report it nothing is done. Clearly favoring hurting users with these ads financially. Be weary of this app",1
17450,"great items to buy but major problem it has, is people don't respond to their postings or many postings seem like they're abandoned with no communication",3
17451,This app is horrible. You type in washing machine and it shows you place mats and a bunch of junk. If you find an actual washing machine it was posted 3 years ago. Filters do not work. Waste of time.,2
17452,Pictures are to small,2
17453,"App is not working since Its updated, I'm not able to post pictures of items I'm trying to sell. App was working fine just yesterday.",2
17454,this app sucks no one actually wanting to meet just people making low ball offers to get some comedy,1
17455,Good man. The item was basically new.,5
17456,great app!,5
17457,Why does offer up allow old posts that sometimes over a year old. The post should be limited to 30 days unless the poster renews it,2
17458,easy to use even for someone who is terrified of computer stuff!!!,5
17459,Very slow they block you from getting views this app can do better thank you,1
17460,2 Milwaukeebrand dry core bits new Milwaukee dry core bits 140$ value willing to let go todayday for 65$. Call asap they will go fast I'm in Quincy,3
17461,"I really love Offer Up however I don't like the 12.9% fee they take from each sale so I do try to sell on other apps first. It's a lot of money when you're selling something that is a high priced item. If Offer Up would reduce their selling fee, I believe they would be outstanding, as the rest of the app is great.",3
17462,"Why is it so leggy? Come on it's 2022 find another app developer, most apps are pretty responsive these days and offerup is the worst app.... Unbelievable.",1
17463,"11/2022 Hackers chased us thru you, our good email acct ruined. Don't use this bogus app. Too good of a deal?! It is fakes. :(",1
17464,Straight forward transactions despite too many outside advertising.,5
17465,very good results. everything I've put up has sold in the last few years. Great app! much better than marketplace,5
17466,good place to go find. truck,5
17467,"I was wrongfully terminated,. I was hacked list all emails and control of my devices. I came back to having over 100 5 stars to nothing couldn't even make a new account cause phone number was blacked out..... Total BS. I really loved the app too...",1
17468,Good bussines grate communication,5
17469,Glitches,4
17470,"awesome app, very easy to use.",5
17471,I love the app but it keeps crashing.,3
17472,Great if you got a hot item you need to offload overnight.,3
17473,The purpose of using offer up is to buy items at a low price. App does not show prices. My guess is you have a spy from marketplace or craigslist trying to destroy your company from within.,2
17474,user friendly. no spam..,5
17475,the only thing I don't like is the app does not allow you to remove your post if you change your mind or at least it's not clear how to,3
17476,Another update to an app that somehow makes the app about 10-100 times worse. I feel like im using a dial up modem now when using the offerup app. Total trash update to what was a solid working app prior to this. No measureable or noticeable improvements. Basically the same exact app with the same features it just runs like garbage now...,1
17477,Love it,5
17478,They literally have no option to delete your account. Very scam like behavior.,1
17479,"item as described, 5 star seller! ty again",5
17480,Love it,5
17481,it could be easier to navigate,3
17482,Glitches when trying to message others. Crashe my S22 Ultra 3 times. Had never had problems with this app previously,3
17483,cool app ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
17484,The people who use this app are weird. They'll message you and say they want to buy your item and so you exchange information and then they go ghost. It's really sketchy. Alot of people low ball the hell out of you as well for items you're selling at an incredibly low price. Overall experience is sus and therefor I'm not liking this app in the slightest.,2
17485,Has been √† pretty good app.fairly easy to post items and does seem to have a lot of other users.,5
17486,There needs to be a way to delete posts instead of just the archive option.,1
17487,deserve 5 star thank you üëå,5
17488,"KillAr,easy app to use and find stuff.Everything you need in one place.",5
17489,it seem like something is wrong with the system today. it states that my location is not detected. so I check my settings and my location is on. that's why I gave it a poor rating today.,1
17490,great app I love it,5
17491,"All items I tried to buy were either scams or sold long ago. Waste of time. There is no automatic purge of old, sold or scam items. If offer up charged a refundable listing fee and refunded it once items is sold and removed from the site, then the site would only have available items. This would also reduce Nigerian scammers if they had to pay to list their scams.",1
17492,Needs two changes.. 1st change the layout and add the price to the tittle. 2nd remove old post more that 60 days old. Some of the old post will never reply or they are no longer available. This makes this app unpleasant to use.,2
17493,The app is easy to use. The only reason I deduct 1 star is because of their automated responses. Too much of my time is wasted responding to people who accidentally hit SEND on them.,4
17494,"Great way to network for jobs and make some LEGIT, side money at the same time!",5
17495,Too many useless and pointless notifications. Otherwise easy to use.,3
17496,Trash app For what they charge in fees they should update this GARBAGE APP I hope you find comfort that everytime this piece of trash freezes I cut myself,1
17497,Some experience,5
17498,It's about as basic as you can get but offers the best way to get rid of some things that you may not be using ATM.,5
17499,"used to be amazing now its just a useless app where anyone can post fake stuff. The latest update lists your location wrong, seen this on multiple posts for several people.",1
17500,"this app is a joke. one week you can post purses, and the next you're not allowed, AND THEY WON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY WHEN YOU PAY TO PROMOTE YOUR ITEMS.",1
17501,"great stuff, fun times",5
17502,Awesome app,5
17503,"This app has serious optimisation problems, it's struggling on a Snapdragon 888.",1
17504,This app has legit just become an advertising space for business. Spent 30 min just weeding through store adds to find like the same personal add shown six times for the same item lol.,1
17505,You can't sell anything on here they just show you other ppl stuff,1
17506,They will go above and beyond to help you! Would definitely recommend if you need good used tires!,5
17507,Good to have. Helps when you moving.,5
17508,It keeps freezing when I'm typing my post descriptions and then you have to start all over.,2
17509,"Wanna sell something? It better only be basketball shoes and stolen tools. That seems to be all they allow people to list. 75 to 90% of the ghetto postings are either shoes, phones, stolen tools, or cars for sale at used car dealerships. Everything I try and list gets removed, even after reading their entire list of prohibited items and making sure what I'm posting isn't prohibited, which is ridiculous and far more restrictive than sites like eBay or Craigslist.",1
17510,"It's a friendly app. And I'm never really have had a problem. I like it when pen people ask me to explain how the product works out how I'f it's shoes or clothing the meaning of the item. The only down down side is sometimes people who don't know the history of a item, or if they do know the history will try to get sell your short of a authentic item. but overall a good trust worthy app.",4
17511,I have not had a negative experience on OfferUp. It's so easy to connect with the seller. Thanks OfferUp for the fin and easy shopping!,5
17512,Never had any issues. Thank you,5
17513,It used to be good until all these dealerships and promotions started popping up if anyone knows of any good individual buy/sell app let me know cause so far I'm still using FB marketplace,1
17514,This app has alot of scammers. Not the best thing. The app is fine itself.,1
17515,I always find what I look for and the people are really friendly,5
17516,"I have had a lot of success using this app. I sell my item very quickly, usually...I have had a worthwhile and good experience w/ virtually every purchase or item I sell. I really really like app. PS there should be a ""free"" section like Craigslist....and make it possible to earn or be rewarded by being able to make your ad promo w/o it costing the person placing the ad any money.",5
17517,Really annoyed with the notifications. Even after turning off all categories except search notifications I still get other useless notifications every day. Stop. It just makes me want to uninstall.,2
17518,in general I like the site. the last item I sold what is a 7x10 metal shed guy came over and gave me $40 deposit said he'll be back tomorrow in the morning didn't show up till 3:00 p.m. it took four people to lifted over a chain link fence to the neighbor's yard they attempted to disassemble it and it collapsed they said they'd be back they were hungry. never came back never returned the call so I had to go and clean up the mess. as a result I lost $40 and had to clean it up.,5
17519,"The app contains deceptive ads that appear to be ordinary items listed by sellers. Also, this company's customer service sucks. The only way to communicate with them is through email, and that made it very difficult for them to comprehend a simple issue.",2
17520,wonderful people,5
17521,it's ok,5
17522,"Letgo interface was my favorite. Since their merge, I have not seen an ounce of Letgo incorporated into OfferUp.",3
17523,good,5
17524,Very intuitive but has some minor glitches or slow at times,4
17525,Freezes a lot,1
17526,Don't subscribe their promoting plus plan! It's a trap with no benefits no refund money! Period I wouldn't even give a Star to them!,1
17527,Always been a great resource for me.,5
17528,Use to work good now is freezing and lag badly on Android 13,1
17529,"Lately the powers that be have let new & used car dealers in on the app on certain days, making it almost impossible for the little guy/gal that wants to sell smaller items. They should have a section only for cars instead of drowning out their public. Also, when they ask you if you want to pay to promote your ad so it gets more attention is a waste. The new ads bury the old ones because yours keeps moving lower and not getting seen. All they do is put a banner on your ad that says promoted.",3
17530,For some reasons it kicked me out for poster a mask and two hats and it says violating out community so OfferUp is messed up,1
17531,"My DuckDuckGo browser stopped 4,005 file tracking attempts being sent to 8 different companies within this app. It stopped them for my security for my tablet files. Uninstall.",1
17532,Fast sales :),5
17533,This app socks nobody ever replies when u want to call or go check out an item and 6 months later they send u a message saying it's sold already this app is garbage,1
17534,"Your app is slow with poor UI. Talk to your users, gauge their experience, and fix it. The 2 stars I am giving you is only for the diversity of the market and has nothing to do what your app.",2
17535,you can find some good deals on OfferUp,5
17536,they will block your account for making one little mistake. that is ridiculous,1
17537,Constant crashing when trying to post,1
17538,too many con artists nowadays really ruined the app,3
17539,ADS ARE EXCESSIVE***,1
17540,I've just come back to offer up. The ease of listing to sell is very user friendly. I don't think I'll go anywhere again.,5
17541,"Very very slow, it shows a line in all text boxes!! limitations & obligations & ....",2
17542,Crashes,1
17543,great app,5
17544,clunky and slow. Crashes then automatically closes constantly. Developers please upgrade!,1
17545,it's Grape ! üçá,5
17546,always extremely easy to post and sell everything that I post. There's never been a time that I posted something and it didn't sell.,5
17547,The app freezes when I'm trying to write the description. I have tried 3 or 4 times this morning to post. Such a pain. I guess I will delete my items & post them somewhere else.,1
17548,Could be better,4
17549,I love being on offer up t see what is for sale and t have the ability t sell.,5
17550,Best buys.,5
17551,good üëç,5
17552,"It was a very smooth transition,friendly and easy.",5
17553,Free trades adds,5
17554,best deal yet thank you to leo and family,5
17555,"The app works, but good lord is it lacking. While I have made some good sales and buys on the app, it didn't become apparent just how much there is to be desired from the app until more recently. It's embarrassingly slow, the app glitches and takes forever to load new messages, menus, or updates, and the keyboard will sometimes cover what you're typing as well. Not to mention the app could use more in the way of options for streamlining the posting, selling, and rating process.",2
17556,My account got deleted again dont know why,1
17557,great tool but needs some changes to help eliminate scams,4
17558,all right you guys the developers of the app really need to do something and get on it the app now is laggy it's slow on no matter what device you put it on it freezes legs constantly something needs to be done about it you guys have a great app it works just fine normally like it used to but not anymore I don't know what you guys have done to it but it's worse and it gets worse u need to please address this issue. install the app on your personal phones and try using it. please address it,2
17559,good way to buy and sell ......app is slow,3
17560,very impressed with my purchase and seller who was helpful in loading it for me,5
17561,"Love the ability to buy and sell. This app reaches people who need what you have, etc. Great multiple experiences!",5
17562,"used it to sell a lot of things, thx. Also, a lot of buyers don't come to my area.",4
17563,Dont use this app. I signed up for the 3 day booster yesterday and they charged my card $20 and refuse to pay me back i went through google and offer up to get my refund both said no . So now im calling my bank and if i dont get my money i am suing for them stealing and false advertising,1
17564,Supper slow and laggy. Takes forever to let you type and sesrch for things.. used to be great,1
17565,Doesn't allow the use of a VPN. :),1
17566,This app sucks. Why do you need my phone number to sell. The only reason you want my phone number is for you to sell my information. Adding a number is not going to keep the app safe.,1
17567,Lagging when I try to edit postings.,1
17568,10000X's superior over craiglist. Only app I'll use to sell items now.,5
17569,real nice place to sell my things,5
17570,The pawn shops makes this a horrible app. It's not a fun app to shop on no more,1
17571,Hate the notifications about things I'm not interested in. Hate the personal ads of girls with tongues out wanting me to sign in to their site.,2
17572,very useful but for a free app it has strict guidelines that make it difficult to continue your profile. slow response time to interact with sellers/buyers. had no problems since 2019 but recently logged in my mom's iPhone and now I'm banned. again slow response time on both ends.could be the app,1
17573,love offerup,5
17574,this app is amazing !!,5
17575,"I enter, Low to high while browsing, & it still gives me higher priced items. When I select, w/in 20 miles, still gives me items 1hour+ of my location. Also, EVERY TIME I delete an item from my saved faves list, it takes me ALL the WAY BACK UP TO THE TOP ITEM, even if deleted item was @ # 50 or 150 or 350. It is frustrating & infuriating because most often, I still have quite a few more to items delete. U don't allow 1 to SPECIFY how sale really went or any speciffic issues.",1
17576,Wish I could see the prices before clicking on the item.,3
17577,pretty good,5
17578,"I had my account for years, posted an item and they sent me a message the deleted my post. I contacted customer service asking for an explanation so it doesn't happen again and their response was blocking my account. I thought it was a selling site in which you can list your items but it seems like a scam operation. Stay away from this scam.",1
17579,good platform to find really great deals,5
17580,Lots of stuff to sell,5
17581,VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. NO RECOMMEN TO NO BODY FIRST I SOLD BRAND NEW PAIR OF SNEAKER.

17582,"App only shows the name, won't load fully, restarted phone, nothing",1
17583,it's always freezing ever since they meged with letgo,1
17584,It's literally just ads. You can't even get to the viewing part to see what's for sale.,1
17585,Its due for an update bad it kicks me out every five seconds super annoying,5
17586,"The App is great .... however my first experience was filled with a Couch full of Urine smell, and Fire smoke !!!",5
17587,When searching thru the local section it gives you 40 or 50 local listing then forces you to see only shipping. If I wanted to look thru shipped items I would have gone to the shipping tab . I clicked local get 40 items then thats it.,1
17588,"I use to love this app,but lately is been a pain so frustrated, seems like they trying to add to much stuff in to the app,like jobs etc ,come on really I am trying to buy/sell stuff. Keep it simple.",1

17594,"You guys have got to figure out a way to filter out the business sellers, commercial sellers etc..I only want to buy from a personal owner!!!!!",1
17595,they send emails that don't go anywhere when you click. probably expired clickbait.,1
17596,This app. is Awesome! you really have to download the app. The prices are unbelievable! try it. you have nothing to lose. I really recommend OfferUp.,5
17597,such a great app,5
17598,Fast,5
17599,Green dot Notification comes up but when opened nothing shows inside. Looses email inquiries. Not visible anywhere.,3
17600,"somehow I no longer get the ""cash register"" alert, when I get a notification.",4
17601,"Has become a bit laggy lately, and there are a lot of inconvenient features that should be better optimized. Lately feels like nothing gets viewed or sold unless you pay to boost your post.",3
17602,None of my posts are being seen or offers. It worked good on my last phone. It's like anything I post or offer is invisible to anyone else.,2
17603,Haven't sold anything here.,3
17604,Last few updates since let it go have made it slow and laggy....not as good as it was. It just got worse over the last week...lol 11/2022,1
17605,I love the ease of use from uploading an item to promoting and selling. I would love if older items were removed when they have been idle for longer than a yr. Some don't respond at all.,4
17606,I've used in the past and it worked and I did sell some stuff. Came back and now the app freezes when entering description. Can't post so it's now a brick.,1
17607,Update: WORSE NOW! good when it 1st came out NOW!....TRASH WORSE YOU GUYS ARE A SCAM YOU GUYS KEPT REMOVING MY POST FOR NO REASON NOTHING WORONG AT ALL WITH MY POST AND NOW TO POST YOU WANT ME TO PAY AFTER YOU REMOVED MY POST LIKE 15 TIMES JUST TO GET ME TO PAY üñïüèΩ,1

17614,"What happened to this app? Simply does not work anymore. Can't use it, crashes, lags, pushes you out at any click, posting, viewing items, messages, is useless. It just crashes & shuts down, uninstalling & reinstall, doesn't work either.",1

17617,If I could give this a zero star I would!!! Offerup disabled my account just bc I tried to sell never used formula but yet other people can sell it without any problems an still keep there account.,1

17625,love this app,5
17626,This app/ company ought to be banned. Can not unlist an item. Have to mark it sold to unlist it. Should be illegal. Just horrible to use. Yes i have sold items here. But the aggravation is not worth the money.,1
17627,"I received notice for a post that violated the policy, stating it had been removed, that was the one and only notice I received, and I didn't repost another post after ! I used my phone and the app hours later to find my account was disabled. I want answers ! I subscribed to this application, why would I continue to repeat a violation ?? Something is not right, and I would like real customer assistance. I want my money refunded for the subscription I paid for also, that I had for a few days!",1

Use to be a phenomenal platform for buying and selling, not sure what the deal is. If you use actual browser it is alot better but constant lags when going to view an item as well.",1
17655,"still to many scams popping up, but the shipping through this app is the most reasonable.",4
17656,"It use to work great. Now it crashes consistently, lag time is crazy long and the screen constantly turning green. Whatever they did, app sucks now.",2
17657,"Great option to selling you stuff... Only fault it doesn't track old or abandoned ads , and if you get kicked off by accident your not getting back on , and a lot of people with multiple accounts and posting that they don't track... It's become a junk site hard to shop because of all the multiple, duplicate postings.",1
17658,great deals,5
17659,easy to use,5
17660,"LetGo was my go to app for selling. I made amazing customers and the app was simple to use. The few times I used it after the integration, I was spammed by fake buyers for a laptop. LetGo was by far a million times better than offer up when it was on its own, please undo the integration",1
17661,Suks,5
17662,"Replied right away, kept me informed. Quick and smooth transaction!",5
17663,Why are the filters for vehicles gone?,4
17664,Update 4.54 (11/10/22): not sure if it a bug or feature got removed ?? But I can't no longer able to sort-filter out Price Range ($) to ($$$) anymore. Choosing between Shipping option and Local option also seem to be glitched out,2
17665,How I can unsubscribe from all emails? When I click 'unsubscribe' it says this page doesn't exist.,4
17666,"I don't know what happened, but when I'm searching in cars&trucks it does not give me the option anymore to search for specific details ie. manual transmission, min and max dollars I want to spend. Those options disappeared.",5
17667,Works great when updated,5
17668,letgo was a little better but overall 4 out of 5,4
17669,most big items are scammers and why too many ads.,1
17670,It's an incredible app I always find everything I need on the app,2
17671,has everything you need,5
17672,"Really needs a time limit for listings. Posts that are years old are not helpful, but an annoyance (especially in the auto category.) A delete option for items you are selling would also be helpful. Right now, the only option is to mark as sold. Can find good deals on site but a hassle to comb through.",3
17673,"1st Time User. It Seams to Be More Focused on Shopping. Not Selling. Plus, I Took 12 Pictures. The App Didn't or Wouldn't Let Me Pick The Cover Photo! The App Used The Last Picture I Took. NOT A GOOD Representation of What I Was Trying to Sell. And All The Other Pictures I Took, All Disappeared!!! Only The Last Picture Saved & Used as a Cover Photo. Again, NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATION of My Product.",4
17674,So far so good,5
17675,It's great,5
17676,"Cool and easy. üëç Also, another suggestion for improving the app is to give sellers more options for editing their profile. Not too much, but maybe just a box for a paragraph or two just for a little more description of the seller themselves.",5
17677,üëç,4
17678,Have done many buys but right now I'm waiting on a purchase that I made and haven't received it I can't get ahold of the person,5
17679,great item and great folks. much appreciated,5
17680,Used for a good while but the app has a problem with messages not showing up and having delay issues and some fake accounts,4
17681,Great! Very easy to reach seller when interested in items listed.,5
17682,"too damn slow, and nothing sells",1
17683,don't give enough posts for the month,1
17684,can't be used in my location but always sends notifications.,1
17685,Glitching and freezing screen on galaxy fold 4,1
17686,Great app,5
17687,They told me to disable my VPN in order for the app to work. That's a deal breaker for me.,1
17688,App works well. Regularly get notifications of items I am interested in.,5
17689,I've had SEVERAL packages that I never received but still had to pay for. Just because the post office says it was delivered doesn't mean a dang thing. Rip off!!!,1
17690,What happen to this app it does not run well it keeps kicking me out and I need to keep logging in what a headache you guys should have left it the way it was it Sucks now,1
17691,Perfect,5
17692,Great app for selling stuff!,5
17693,"Offer Up is extremely user friendly, and the experiences that I have encountered as a buyer have all been on a positive note. I really appreciate the opportunity to save on a wide variety/category of items, and the fact that it is constantly being updated makes it ever so relevant. I sincerely thank Offer Up and the sellers that take the time to post for making it all possible, especially in this day and age, when our economy isn't exactly thriving, very much appreciated.",5
17694,"I received 4 inquires with different names but had the same story of "" I'm the buyer but my brother will pick it up"". This seems to be a scam. No other activity.",1
17695,easy,5
17696,Great way to sell unwanted items!,5
17697,"This app sucks n charges u19.99 and won't give ua refund.. Never apply to show n your items on front page... there's no one to talk to, 2 cancel",1
17698,"Good app, but one star because the ""item related to your search"" is made to look like an inbox notification.... very deceiving",1
17699,Needs better customer service and a way to get money back from bad transactions.,1
17700,"Generally I find the app useful, but the number of promoted ads and listings unrelated to a particular search, i.e. - cars for sale that show up when I search for used doors, seem to be increasing. They make any search less productive and it's difficult to sift through and see the actual items pertinent to your search. Very annoying!",2
17701,Why did you guys charge me twice for a single paid month that I only agreed to for that one time of your car sponsorship service. Not happy at all.,1
17702,I should be able to block buyers and delete my selling products and re-post them,4
17703,Have a paid post up and got disable for no reason,1
17704,keeps crashing,1
17705,"i dont care of their mergers and acquisitions with letgo. now i need to waste time to upload pics again. i dont see whAt i won with their merger noone cares about. upd. lots of fake offers Made by bots asking for the phone number. offers are much lower than on fcbk if you speak to a real person. upd they disable sales 0f certain items, absolutely not inclusive and discriminative policy! ppl might need cheaper items to buy elsewhere than from most of wholesellers!",1
17706,An app for overpricing idiots and broke crack heads,1
17707,"Not a fan of their item review time. It took the seller 5 days to ship it, I got worried they scammed me, where OfferUp says forced to ship in 3 or your money back, then! I go out of town for the weekend, and there goes my time to test and review a BROKEN product now I'm stuck with it. Thanks OfferUp üëç",2
17708,"It is no use trying to sell something on this app. Most of the time, OfferUp will either crash as you try to post a listing, or they remove your post for no reason whatsoever. And even if they don't, you just get harassed by scammers. FB marketplace is much better to sell items. They don't remove your listings, you can actually make a sale, bc they have legitimate buyers on there. Also, OfferUp has an ad to a porn site which is sketchy af. No wonder LetGo got shut down.",1
17709,Slowest app on my phone. Not sure why it's so difficult for this app to run but it's slow & it lags big time. Possibly because of all the ads they're trying to force on us? Not sure but the developer needs to get it figured out.,1
17710,"If I could give negative stars I would. If your a serious seller dont waste your time downloading this app. Its more like a low key hook up app. Nobody wanted to buy anything (unless it was worn panties). Only got ""hook up"" messages.",1
17711,Do not buy anything shipped through offer up you will get screwed and there is no back up.,1
17712,"Lots of scammers on here, instead of moderating and taking down they seem to rely on users to report it instead... sometimes to late after being scammed. It says they'll cancel an order automatically if the seller fails to ship after 3 days and that isn't true even though it's stated in the receipt. Not worth the hassle.",1
17713,Something broke. I can't type more than three words now without the app freezing up,1
17714,This app would be great if they offered a pro version without ad's. I would pay up to $5 a month not to have them. It pi$$es me off when the ad looks like an item someone is selling and it redirects me out of the app. I have messaged them several times b1tching about it. They do it for clicks on the ad's and it's slimy. I still use the app but they get three stars till they change it.,3
17715,amazing,5
17716,love the website.,5
17717,Excellent.....,5
17718,I am inspired by the outlet that offer up provides me to provide merchandise to the public and to conduct honest business trade and extra finance. It's All Good! üôÉ.,5
17719,good way to sell stuff,5
17720,Great app and great service thanks,5
17721,great,5
17722,Love it!!,5
17723,"Good app. Met up bought, sold, and traded through offer up. Never had a problem with it untill recently. It bogs down so bad when chatting, editing post etc to the point is not usable. (Also dont give your real phone numbers out scammers try to use it to get access to your account use a throwaway like Google voice.)",2
17724,It's a great app to lost and sell. But when looking through the main page. It would be alot better to have a price tag for the posted items. Like how Facebook does it. So I'm just not clicking that the price range is far. Overall pretty good,4
17725,Too many ads and the app is buggy sometimes it gets stuck on the loading logo,3
17726,awesome app.,5
17727,"Terrible, the online website is much more user-friendly and adheres to my set parameters. I uninstalled my app.",1
17728,Posted my first offer only for it to be removed immediately with no reason why or ability to edit and relist. Then they wanted to charge me $5 to post another offer.,1
17729,poor selling performance compared to Marketplace or Craigslist,1
17730,Close account but let me know why,1
17731,good üëç stuff,5
17732,I like the app but it pauses and stops regularly,3
17733,"For the past several years, I've been fortunate using OfferUp. I'm all for recycling and repurposing, as well as saving money. Before I buy anything, I check OfferUp first to find a deal. From bulk wee wee pads for my puppy to my living room furniture, I've been Blessed. The sellers I've encountered have been legitmate, professional and courteous. I recommend OfferUp to everyone, especially members of my own family.",5
17734,I have found some awesome deals on this site.,3
17735,"BEWARE: Do not sell with OfferUp unless it is local for meetup. I sold a brand new jacket to a user named Omair in NC. He fraudulently switched the item claiming that is what I sent. I immediately contacted OfferUp and filed a police report. Despite all the info I provided OfferUp, they refunded the scammer and I took a loss. There is ZERO SELLER PROTECTION. DO NOT USE.",1
17736,would be nicer if it stopped giving me the same things but overall good app,4
17737,Automotive vehicle listing have multiple dealerships posting as/under private individuals with misleading prices. Also there should be a process where if the listing isn't renewed after 60days then it should automatically be permanently deleted as there are listings that are several months to several years old that still pop up. I myself dislike entering a search word and seeing a 5 new listings out of 30.,3
17738,Shity,3
17739,"Arguably the most user friendly selling app. Some people on the app can be questionable or sketchy, but that's not a controllable variable. Offerup does put a lot of effort into safety and security, so if you notice something going on they always take care of it :)",5
17740,"This app crashes every. Single. Time. I open it. I used to love offer up, but lately it's impossible to use because I have to close and reopen several times just to search for an item...",1

17742,Great,5

17747,"lots of scammers on here, app owners can't seem to address the issue. also some of my listings constantly get removed without any explanation (I only ever post furniture). lots of errors in app (""Oops something went wrong"" screens, etc)",2
17748,Love to browse üòÉ,4
17749,Hasn't been updated for newer phones and accesses. It's been extremely glitchy since upgrading the phone.,4
17750,The app is okay when it works. The users make it a terrible experience. Most try to offer 20% of what you're asking for an item. The rest say they want to buy it then never meet up or ghost you. Nothing but garbage.,1
17751,great app,5
17752,it's not perfect but it's fun and relatively easy to use:). please add a barter/trade checkbox for items,5
17753,Really Badass app to make some side cash,5
17754,poor job of weeding out scammers,2
17755,This thing is so slow it's like AOL diaiup. Am I the only one having that experience for the last 4 years?,2
17756,Terribly slow It is just better to use it n the web,1
17757,Slow and glitchy. Terrible app.,1
17758,AWESOME APP!!! A must for selling and buying.,5
17759,Sucked,1
17760,I have used this app for years and it's always been a little slow but now it has become almost useless. Takes way to long for pages to load and app to respond to clicks. Fix the app and I will change my rating!!!,1
17761,Great app,5
17762,Posted first item perfectly. All posts following have been removed within seconds. Have tried many different methods of posting with the same result.,1
17763,offer up works great for me! take a photo Load it up write discription price it wait for your buyer! works great for shipping too!,5
17764,Nice guy. Quality item. Safe and comfortable transaction.,5
17765,I would say something like this place is totally unethical and what they did is they did not tell us they were charging us $40 for a service fee they just slipped it in there when we sold something and took it straight out of our bank account so this place is deceitful and manipulating and very unprofessional,1
17766,The app isn't responding and it keeps lagging on me A LOT! I've been trying to post something for sale and it just keeps freezing once I start typing my description pls fix this asap! It also lags a lot in the search are.,1
17767,Horrible ripped off and closed mt accout i would nor recomnend,1
17768,My acct is not visible to other users. And I can't get anyone to respond to my messages for purchase,1
17769,Been on for weeks haven't sold anything my truck at 30k is 3300 lower then book still haven't sold even thru In free fishing boat at 31k boats worth 2500 you be the judge,1
17770,very convenient!,5
17771,"Too many jerks on site. Tell you they want item, then never respond.",3
17772,Very easy to use.,5
17773,Posts should be deleted after a certain amount of time. Sellers should not offer you the item only to sell it to someone else.,3
17774,fun and easy to use!,5
17775,"buy and sell, it works",5
17776,items for sale should expire after 60 days they got stuff on here from a year ago,1

17792,"had an offer by William...was bothered when asked questions about appliance. Arranged delivery & price as he requested. Gave 1/2 hr. notice he was going to deliver and payment method. Was away at the moment, called him back in 1/2 hr., said forget it, wasn't delivering...had other offers. I couldn't believe it! After waiting 1 week to accommodate his working schedule!",4
17793,"Pathetic experience, New Version slows down tremendously and then completely freezes. Old app was far better.",2
17794,"Under appliances for example they let single posters put 100s of their products in a row, day in and day out, so no one else can post or look for items (except from the seller who has taken over the site) making OfferUp useless. They are unable or unwilling to do anything about it.",1
17795,slow! slow!,1
17796,"I have been unable to open my acct since Aug 2022...no reason given, just a stupid picture of a bear with arm in a sling, ""something went wrong, we are working on it, try again later"". Absolute hopelessness. I can't even close out my acct. Took over letgo, completely ruined by big business ads.",1
17797,Nice but sometimes you are playing phone tag.,4
17798,"I find it hard to trust people. When they don't have a picture and they don't even have their name, there's no information about them, no information about who they are or where they are even located. Seems like anyone can verify a cell#.",3
17799,The apps product development team sucks. So much Bs you have to deal with because they refuse to enforce quality of life features for it's users looking to buy things. So often I encounter spam posters listing the same item 10s of times in a month repeatedly. People's IPs should be blocked as they just make new accounts and keep posting. Ads are also frustratingly similar to normal listings. Other than that it's nice to browse and find things to buy and list things for sell.,1
17800,I enjoy offerup. I have purchased and sold items.,5
17801,I like this application.,5
17802,the power amp didn't come with any power cord,3
17803,2 orders i ordered. I would like to a sup or manager contact me if not just cancel them and i'll go to another. Why can't you fix this?,5
17804,so far I love the app first time using but it isn't bad at all,5
17805,nobody uses offer up anymore. not worth spending the money to.promote an ad.,2

17807,Good and fast,4
17808,"All we ever get is a bunch of low-ball offers. We know the value of our items and would like just as much as these resellers would sell the item for on ebay. Although we understand it is not Offerups fault that this is our experience, we are seriously considering removing ourselves from it and only using other apps. We truly hope other people have a ton of success and better experience than we have.",2

17813,My item was delivered to wrong address by Ups. Yes the tracking number stated it was delivered to my address. Ups called me and said they goofed up but did I still have not received my item. I have attempted to contact Offerup but it's impossible. Its ridiculous. I need help and I don't know how to contact Offerup or what to do next. Very frustrating Offerup. Please help resolve this.,3
17814,Offer up just magically won't let me log into my account. I've left them so many emails to fix my problem but no matter what I sat to them they never respond back and never fixed my problem. This app is cool and all to sell things...but over all the customer support sucks . They really need to step their business up.,2
17815,Very nice and smooth transaction!! thank you again . Rex,5

17831,first times order love you can also sell,5
17832,The clunkiest app I've ever had on my phone. So much better before the merger.,2
17833,it never sends me the notifications that I need. And the notifications that I do get are usually false.,1
17834,Every time I'm interested in something and message someone it takes me three or four messages and they never respond back to me.,3
17835,I can't type more than 3 sentences in the description without the whole app crashing. Using a Samsung Galaxy S22+.,1

17838,"I go on this app to look as a buyer, for the most part I really like it . The only down side in my opinion is that lately some of the sellers are asking way too high of prices for used goods.!",5
17839,"Seens to be ok , but some don't reoly for days",4
17840,A very nice and helpful young man.,5
17841,"the app works fine. organics are pretty good, but if you want to sell quick you gotta pay to promote usually.",4
17842,Couldn't verify an ID I just renewed. Couldn't use the app. Not very good customer service. So I just went to Mercari and Ebay.,1

17846,Don't really use,2
17847,"The app took down my selling post as soon as I posted it. I'm trying to sell used camera gear. Not weird, inappropriate or banned items. I only want to sell these items locally but I guess it's not possible at the moment. I tried to post this item hours later, but same results. I disabled my account and contacted support to permanently delete my account but they chose not to reply. It's been 3 days. I guess they want to keep personal information of users forever and then ignore them. Beware.",1
17848,"Account disabled for NO reason. Started out as messages not being sent, waiting around for responses that never came, basically rendering the App useless. Reported about it, then out of nowhere account disabled. Just had to complete uninstall. Doesn't even deserve a star let alone my time.",1
17849,Love the app but sometimes especially in the auto section there are many fake ads posting nice cars for really cheap and they post to respond to them outside of the app like to their email. They all have the same story and they try to trick you just to get all your information. Other than that the app is great!,5
17850,very happy with my purchase great experience would definitely do business with Frederico again,5
17851,Bring back let go. It was so easy to use and so easy to sell things on there. I am trying to sell things for a family member in a different city. When I posted the app defaulted to Seattle WA for all my posts. So I manually corrected the posts to the correct city. Now I received an offer from someone in Washington. I reviewed my posts and they have all been changed to Seattle again. App doesn't allow me to correct the posts because my family member is in Canada & I have returned to the US. Bad,1
17852,"Very bad, almost impossible to use most of the time! Thanks for ruining something great! Still @$$ as of 11/4/22",1
17853,this use to be the GO To app that kept me financially stable on selling things but they have chosen to disable my account for a minor rule my Boyfriend by accident broke by posting a item that wasn't aloud which was a locked apple product that was posted for parts only. I've had nothing but 5 star reviews an my reputation and following stand by it all the way to when Letgo was still up and running. Shame on u Offerup for taking my financial livelihood away so I have to struggle now!#2ndchances!,1

17862,nothing cheap facebook marketplace is better,1
17863,My posts got took down for no reason it was for my Chevrolet Silverado and they said I wasn't posting in the guidelines but I only posted a truck. Horrible customer support too!!!üñïüñïüñï,1
17864,just be rreal,5
17865,only thing I don't like is I have lowered my prices so much it's like giving away valuable stuff for free. I have trouble opening my account to edit my prices. If I go anymore It will be free stuffüò©,5
17866,App works great. The issue is the constant marketing notifications. Nowhere to turn them off without disassembling all notifications in system apps menu. Very bad marketing decision. Would be 5 star of the company chose a different path.,3
17867,have not sold a thing. im not getting my notifications...super slow in app ...not able to renew listings i even boosted a listing still nothing!,1
17868,Wonderful user friendly interface! Found some great furniture at excellent prices. You have to be patient and willing to keep digging through all the stuff to find the great deals!,5
17869,"very convenient, fair and so much savings ü§Ø",5
17870,Kinda slow loading other then that wonderful to sell on lots of less bs scams.,3
17871,I love this app. I get all the things I want without the big store mark ups,5
17872,"Excellent place to buy and sell, a better alternative to CL.",5
17873,Didn't like it.,1
17874,Great way to find anything your looking for a good price & sell items as well,5
17875,"When I try to buy an item it has me scan my payment method over and over, and doesn't actually proceed with the transaction. Very frustrating and buggy interface.",1
17876,lots of vendors posts their same items every day till it sells. It's annoying and time consuming to see through their stuff every day. Specially stores do this. for example anthony's furniture in Los Angeles.,4
17877,App keeps crashing when I am writing and replying to messages. I have to constantly close the app and reopen just to experience another crash. I haven't been able to respond to buyers for 2 days now because the app keeps crashing. Unacceptable!,1
17878,excellent selling experience,5
17879,"I get an error message as soon as I open it. ""Sorry, something went wrong"". I uninstalled and still the same. I have a galaxy S21 so my phone isn't old. Every since the letgo merger it hasn't worked.",1
17880,Good app,5
17881,Works if you have good items & price them appropriately they will sell. Thank You offerup.,4
17882,Free to talk to you all.,5
17883,Awesome,5
17884,"Decent although I wish my stuff was promoted more. Also should add push notifications for when users recieve messages from potential buyers, I literally have to open the app and check for messages rather than have a message notification show on my phones notifications bar, it would be a nice feature to add.",3
17885,I think they using my Google account to do with all these can you please help me I'm tired of this I'm getting stressed full and I really need professional help,5
17886,"WARNING: No Seller Protection but they want you to pay them for unnecessary fees. Sold and shipped a MacBook, guy said it wasn't a Mac Book and gets refunded. He didn't send it back either and when I reported that I'm told ""we don't offer Seller Protection"". -make a post only sell locally so Offer Up can't profit anything. They have a seller fee, listing fees, processing fee, they also charge the buyers. For what? For no seller protection.",1
17887,good,4
17888,"Well i think just about any merchandise has value, i mean the diffrence in the sells is based on what material the item is made of. For an example clothing,is made of of cotton.Also items made out of plastic are usually cheap because it breaks easily or is easy to come by.",5
17889,Great Place to Sell,5
17890,"4 stars... I dig it for the most part... but can the search criteria like distance and most recent posts be honored? When I tell it most recent and the 5th post is from 9 months ago... or I tell it 20 mile range and all I see are things that need to be shipped... I'm in Phoenix, there are things for sale here I promise.",4
17891,There are to many companies selling new stuff! I'm deleting! This is a scam app,1

17897,to me offer up is one of the best tools to use when it comes to being a reseller,5
17898,I'm done with the app. Literally wasted my weekend searching for items & messaging sellers with not 1 reply. All messages say delivered no one has even seen them. I finally send my son a message trying to buy something he has for sale & I tell h to check his messages because I've made him an offer.. sure is nice that he has no message from me.. so I send him a link to my items he clicks on it & app tells him the user is blocked . wow . why don't they tell us accounts is blocked,1
17899,Ok,4
17900,very slow,3
17901,Every time I reset it to my location around me it gives me stuff from all over the states which I don't like that,1
17902,"Downloaded the app. Listed as item. Started getting an amazing amount of spam and suspected spam calls. Was ridiculous. And apparently I'm not the only one.

17906,"Been using this app for years now and just has been so great especially in times in need. Never had a negative experience with this app aside from it just sometimes crashing or not issues with receiving messages or notifications on time. Which can be a little bit inconvenient when trying to make sale solid. But overall, thus far one of the best selling platform apps out there .",5
17907,"Can't pick a location by clicking on The map, and why are the only suggested spots police stations?",2
17908,Great app to sell your things but it is buggy. It will no longer let me post items to ship and it is slow to do things on the app.,4
17909,"So far, so good.",4
17910,its a nice easy app.. but the algorithm is to heavy...look at a few items then that all that shows when you get back on later...a little annoying,4
17911,Every time I try to purchase something I need to go to my notes to see my card details and every time I leave the app for 5 seconds. It gets out of the what I was doing,1
17912,"every forced upgrade, this app gets worse. slower. more complicated. customer service is nonexistent. zero stars. app deleted legit ads, no way to get help .",1

17918,fun!,5
17919,completely love this app üíØ wish more more like this,5
17920,I love this app. it's easy and safe. it's like a yard sale on the go,5
17921,I've found many items @ great prices. Customer support responds promptly.,4
17922,The app begins start-up but gets stuck on a blank screen. Very disappointed with this. I can't access anything. Android phone. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. No luck. Please fix this ASAP.,1
17923,offer up rocks! you guys are the best out of every other site out there!,5
17924,"Too many repeat postings. One store has multiple users (too many to find & count, some out of state) posting each appliance with the business address in the description. The business is on a corner so now there is a different address for the same store. The number of appliances in the store doesn't come close to the flood of posted pictures. Recently I've seen other stores doing the same, another appliance store & a furniture store. I've done my share of reporting, it's worse than cars now.",1
17925,They keep listings for years up on thier ap which are very difficult to navigate when searching for available items. They need to make people renew them after a couple of months or take them off.,3
17926,Good,5
17927,Not showing the prices before you click the item makes this nigh unusable. Every other app I've used to buy/sell shows the price right there and they do that because it makes sense. I understand wanting to do something to make the app stand out from the others but making it more difficult to traverse seems counterintuitive. It works fine I guess but I'm never willing to look through more than 3 items at a time.,3
17928,"Is this app just a scam now? It's more than just an info fishing site now. Seems thieves could use it to track you, hear talking and see what's in your home. There's no reason for any of those features to even exist. Why do they need to record my audio? I can't post any audio. do they need to record video? I can't post it why does the first picture have a larger frame for it? The rest of my pix don't have? All of that grants thieves unreal access if hacked. Getting more suspicious every day..",1
17929,Some good ads..,4
17930,No more prices on items without clicking?,1
17931,I guess everyone has to make money these days. I didn't know offer up wasn't free anymore.,2
17932,"it feels like some of the items up for sale are being sold by ghosts or bot accounts. I feel that if I ask you a question, or make an offer on an item that you have already sold, you should at least respond to me with the appropriate response. too many items I have made an inquiry or inquiries about to the seller, and I have gotten zero response",3

17946,When I posted something they want me to pay money did you say that the very beginning for you to be able to post to sell things you need to set up an account with a credit card I don't like offer up,1
17947,"This app used to be good but it is trash as of late. Nobody responds to messages both from selling and trying to buy ....it's like this app makes your profile a ghost unless you ""pay to promote"" your items....and If you don't give them all your information and verify and make a Facebook to verify all this verification...then they don't let you get messages from others. 0 stars if I could.",1
17948,Looking for a bicycle: 1) A few unscrupulous people are selling used models that are far more expensive than the same model brand new! 2) My most common experience is sellers who mysteriously won't respond. Hence the internet expression 'GhostList'.,3
17949,"Tons of good stuff, but no one ever replys to offers I offered over 10 people offers not one reply",3
17950,I get mad when I want to buy something and they don't respond.,3

17960,Nice,5
17961,A friend recommended to try this selling my stuff. Turns out it is the same scam as fb marketplace. Every. Single. Contact were scammers. Useless. Uninstalled.,1
17962,smooth operationüíØ,5
17963,It's running very slow and glitchy very glitchy The screen shakes up and down before you can enter the search box takes a very long time to open when you first click on the app,5
17964,Don't subscribe for the 3 day free trial to promote your items it's difficult to cancel and no customer support,1
17965,Don't sell your stuff on here it takes months to sell anything on here and not to mention they don't update there list of stuff there selling.so alot of it out dated like from 4 to 5 months ago kind of post. Let go should just go back to their own app. At least with let go I was able to sell more stuff unlike offer up were I only sold one thing out the 20 items I had to sell somewhere else.,1
17966,I really like using this app. The only thing I think could improve usability would be showing the price on the item before you open it up. It would make shopping more efficient.,4
17967,"DO NOT SELL USING OFFER UP. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY EVEN WHEN YOUR SHIP ON TIME, THEY CAN SEE IT WAS SHIPPED BIA TRACKING, AND EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT USPS DOES NOT SCAN FIRST CLASS MAIL RIGHT AWAY (LEAVING SELLERS WITH AUTO CANCELLATIONS). HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. HORRIBLE SERVICE.",1
17968,This app continues to get more bloated and slower. Needs to go on a diet.,2
17969,Good,5
17970,Updated it & won't go pass loading screen,1

17976,"This app needs a lot of work. Been selling online for 3 years and i made less than 100 sales in 3 years. 3 year trial is a long time to be on here. If your new to selling and are intrested in shipping, Mercari seems to be the best for new sellers. I started on ebay and its easy for me cauae ive been on it for years but mercari is way easier for beginners. (Update November 1, 2022 : This platform is dead. No one is messagimg me back on iteme im intrested in. No one seems to be active on here.)",3

17993,"Maybe it's different for other locations/geographical areas in the country, but where I am from (Mississippi), there is basically next to no seller traffic whatsoever here, and what very few sellers there are, just post crackhead-type clothing and shoe items for amounts that I'm sure they will absolutely never see (being that it's ALWAYS the same items on the app for months at a time).

17997,I liked the letgo app better and then they bought it out and now it's ok,4
17998,friendly app!,4
17999,The worst,1
18000,People will low ball you because they are trying to sell it somewhere else or later posted here too. People post items and they don't respond back if is been sold just update or delete the items. Worst app to buy things,1
18001,I found the dirt bike on there for my kids,5
18002,I liked using the app but now I'm locked out because the verification code never arrives to my email account and customer support just sends me impersonal responses. I have listings I can't attend to and creating listings is enough of a headache as it is.,1
18003,Too many lacking Integrity. 50% its late night and no follow thru.,2

I have to do a charge back because I cancelled their service for promote+ & they charged it anyway & refuse to refund even though I've been trying to connect w them since the day they took the erroneous charge. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They DO NOT care about sellers! Also see all recent reviews. The app is slow, unresponsive, crashes regularly. I recommend Mercari or FB MP for local & shipping items!",1

I had someone send me their phone number which is fine but then start asking for my address and payment yet they cant even show proof pictures to see if they even have the item they are selling!! And thats multiple time i tried to buy! Keep away from this app",1
18028,I have sent numerous messages and offers and no one responds. I assume most of these are scams.,1

18038,"This app just sucks data up when posting photos or just in general, it's highly noticable when you're on a set data limit. Takes forever to post ads with photos, new layout is nice but it keeps thinking I've added One more photo than I've put. If letgo is part of offerup then the developers need to get together and brainstorm because letgo had something good going. 1/21 I appreciate the Normal people who actually use the site correctly, I hate selling to those who do not rate their experience.",3
18039,This app is not good anymore. I had lots of good reviews on letgo non of it transferred over and just doesn't work good anymore don't wast your time. Letgo worked alot better wish is was back to the way it was. They lost me as a customer.,1
18040,i pay to post my car and it didn't even appear,2
18041,Everything is months old or states away. Was hoping for a market place replacement. Can't stand Facebook. Definitely could be 100% better and take some market cap from FB.,1
18042,My posts immediately disappear after I make them. I heard a lot of good things about this app but disappointed it's not working.,1
18043,"Good app, but is it too much to ask to purge old listing? There's stuff from 5 years ago or more. Doesn't really fit in the ""most recent"" category.",3

18049,I had the app in the past but I wasn't following up with my posts.,5
18050,Works great never had an issue. Easy to use too.,5
18051,Why it's so terribly slow???,3
18052,This app is completely garbage compared to FB Marketplace. This app limits the amount of ads you post and does not notify you of incoming messages. My advertising strategy nets me over 10K a month on FB while using the same technique on this app gets my ads restricted. This app is also only for phones which makes control of your advertising even worse. Dump this app for any other platform if you are trying to carve your niche in a market.,1
18053,Runs slow .. but does Anyone else get emails sent from offer up about them giving a gift card for selling on the app ? Is it real?,3
18054,Good app overall but obviously someone paid them to slow the app down.,4
18055,Payment Method camera scanner doesn't work. Using fully updated app and fully updated Galaxy s21+ Ultra.,2

18059,perfect for when you wanna do some discounted shopping for designer clothes and shoes!! I love it here!!!!,5
18060,there site is great never had any problems,5
18061,Demanding I verify my identity to even make purchases now. Gross and unacceptable. Would give zero stars if possible. Back to craigslist.,1
18062,I was a daily user until after the seller sent me the wrong item I didn't purchase I was only given a short period to return the item without a deadline. Offer up closed the return period before I could send it and has Not responded to me since I emailed for help. Use with High Risk! Don't expect help from them either.,1
18063,"Not usable no more, so slow or freezes when trying to reply to someone or when posting a item.",1
18064,"I LIKED LETGO'S FORMAT BETTER BUT WAS BOUGHT OUT BY OFFERUP. OFFERUP SHOULD REBRAND ITSELF AS LETGO, WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT FEEL TO IT THAN OFFERUP. PLUS LETGO WAS JUST EASIER TO NAVIGATE. OFFERUP SHOULD ALSO ADD A FEATURE TO WITHDRAW A POSTED ITEM (DECIDED TO KEEP IT)",5
18065,Nobody ever writes you back nor buys anything,1
18066,"Most of the things for sale is usually 2 months old, and when you specify a location it shows you ads across the country, not worth...I uninstalled for the second and for the same reason",1
18067,Love it!!,5
18068,Alright app for selling and buy. Wish it would save your search parameters instead of having to reset it every single time,1
18069,By far the worst selling app. Has really deteriorated over the past 2 years in terms of use. Now you have to pay in order for your items to be sold.,1
18070,very nice person explained how to operate and take apart,4
18071,"Unusable if you have a VPN running. Says ""something went wrong"" and shows you nothing else.",1
18072,excellent. great merchandise extremely nice friendly and helpful people..,5

This appears to be a corrupt system.",1
18074,"Nothing but scammers Since offerup doesn't make people verify, every single person I've tried to buy a Nintendo switch off of has been a scammer who immediately asks for my phone number and card payment off the app. Offerup is nothing more than a cesspool of losers",1
18075,1 WORD! HORRIBLE!!!!ü§Æüëéüèæ,1
18076,EDIT: The latest update finally fixed the slow messaging issue in the app. Back to being usable again. I feel like I notice a lot more ads though but overall functions as it should.,5
18077,poor customer service and screw you over without your Permission. other go somewhere else to post and sell my stuff.,1
18078,great app but would be nice to have the ability to filter out dealers that flood page after page with their products.,4
18079,Worst app to sell things. Excessively laggy and will remove images and postings without warning or reason. Almost every responder wants your address and will stop communicating when they don't get it. Super shady. I'm moving my efforts to face book market place.,1
18080,"Used to be great, but now its just laggy when used. Also, you can type in something specific, like a specific car or truck you are looking for, and hundreds of non related cars will show up. This platform has gone to sht.",3
18081,Ok stuff,3
18082,LOVE THIS APP! EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF IS AVAILABLE! I EVEN BOUGHT MY 2015 BUICK LACROSSE ON HERE! 30K MILES FOR $11K!,5
18083,No funciona.... Quiero publicar mis cosas y no aparecen en la lista general. No tiene views. No tampoco puedo mandar mensaje para comprar.... Simplemente NO FUNCIONA LA APLICACION.,1
18084,"Terrible app, has a ton of people selling same item but mine gets taken down üòÇ not prolific or mature in anyway so I don't understand how, garbage app",1

18088,This app is showing items from 4yrs ago.. Its not for sale.. And my search was 30 miles away and showing things from 5000 miles away! Wth man?!,1
18089,"Was good at the beginning of the year now my posts get no views... I really wish this would be fixed!!! Please help! I've uninstalled, reinstalled, signed out etc and nothing seems to make a difference.",1
18090,Too many scams. The last 4 items I've listed have only attracted scamers looking for my address or phone number.,2
18091,all good so far,5
18092,great app to sell or pickup items to your liking üëç,5
18093,JUNK APP,1
18094,Not so great anymore. IItems used to go quickly. Now the app keeps asking to pay to promote. Without paying for the promotion service it seems like my posts aren't being shown. After listing the same items on another site they sold right away,1

18103,it is a great way to sell items,5

18107,"This site is awful. I put up a ton of items for sale and 3 things sold immediately to one guy. Unfortunately, one of those three packages was destroyed by USPS. OfferUp claims there is a 2 day protection plan but both me(seller) and the buyer have been reaching out repeatedly to get this issue solved and no one will get back to us. This is by far the worst app to sell on. Please use ebay, Facebook marketplace, Mercari or Poshmark. If something goes wrong they will not fix the issue.",1
18108,I've had success with selling on this platform.,5
18109,There are a lot of scammers on offer up. I have been scammed and because of my law enforcement background I was able to track the guy down. I don't think Offer up has enough security in place to stop these people from praying on victims. You report their page and it doesn't get taken down or anything. Please pay attention on here. Question everything and be very observant.,1
18110,letgo was a better app cause I can't even my stuff or items anymore,1
18111,used to love this app. past few months I've sent countless messages and gotten zero responses or emails and yet the items are being sold ?,1

18115,"Been a rollercoaster with this app. Downloaded earlier this year, had to email support services for help. App functioning a lot better now, but NO ONE ever responds to my inquiries, even people who have high ratings and are clearly active. My messages are delivered but never seen. Not sure if this is a user issue or an app error. Idk but it's frustrating. Haven't had any success purchasing the item I want, and I've been trying for months.",3
18116,"The app seems to only show items for sale, but when you reach out to the seller, they Do not respond. I don't know if these are fake accounts or what, but I've sent out over 25 messages for items and have received 3 responses saying that item is still available, then when I ask to purchase at asking price I get ghosted. There is No customer service to help AT ALL. Better off just going to an estate sale, garage sale, even Goodwill at least going to those you know you can actually buy something.",1
18117,Need a new manager! Or will lost all fan,1
18118,Horrible No way to communicate with anyone to sell your products. Can't contact anyone for a follow up for what you post very useless app.,1
18119,Offer up used to be awesome now for some reason my conversations disappear and I missed a sale because I couldn't reach back out to the guy that's so annoying.,3
18120,I have asked numerous people on this app if their products were still available and haven't received one message back and haven't sold not one item,1
18121,You suck,1
18122,"For some reason, switching to a new phone has caused this app to freeze. I keep trying to post and I've even uninstalled, restarted my phone & app, waited for it to load properly and nothing. It's very frustrating.",2
18123,Perfect for selling,5
18124,many bugs especially with txting. keyboard covers conversation and conversation is slow and laggy.,3
18125,Offer up hands down has the worst customer service you can't talk to a real person. I have emailed them 5 times now because of an issue with getting my money that was paid to me through their site. They have a bunch of stuff in place to protect buys but not sellers. The way the have things it is very easy for the seller to get scammed and not only that offer up profits from the seller getting scammed. And they take so long to get back to you that at that point your screwedüò° 0 out of 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è,1
18126,SLOWER THAN A TURTLE!!!!! HOW DOES AN APP WITH SO MUCH MONEY HAVE TERRIBLE SOFTWARE PROGRAMMERS????,1
18127,"My post doesn't show. Not even under my account ""Items Selling"" it is blank, with the ""Creat post"" button. I tried a second time, even paid to post my truck for sale. Nothing. No help from support. Just a template email that told me to log out of the app, uninstall app and reinstall app, reboot my phone, change from WiFi to Cell Data, etc. Nothing works. I can't figure out how to get my $7.99 back either.",1
18128,"It doesn't show prices when searching, which basically makes the app unusable since have to click on every listing to see the price.",2
18129,This app sucks to many businesses on here over takes everyone ads so it's not worth using I'm just gonna delete and use Facebook market place,1
18130,"Site has a wide range of classifieds and a good push notification to let you know about your messages which is nice. Only complaint is that they should remove super old posts, I've seen some over a year old still being posted.",4
18131,Makes it super easy to sell?,5
18132,slow,3
18133,"Useful to buy and sell, but garbage app. So slow and laggy even when messaging.",3
18134,"App used to be great, but now it's filled with lots of counterfeit items and scammers. Offerup doesnt seem to do anything about reports either. Shopping experience isn't even close to what it used to be nowadays and I wouldn't trust offerup for online shopping.",1
18135,great app but I can't see what I'm messaging cause the text field is at the bottom Under the onscreen keyboard,2
18136,It seems like offerup has pretty much died because I never see anything anymore when I look for stuff locally basically nothing shows up I remember when it was popping for a bit an everyone was selling stuff on here I'm sad RIP offerup lol,1
18137,offer up I think is the best way for publication,5

18139,Working out for me but the app is very slow at times.,4
18140,Awesome,5
18141,DON'T USE THIS APP! My Samsung s10 was hack through this app. Someone offered to sell my china cabinet that I was giving away for nothing. Apparently my account was hacked. My GMail account was accessed and the password was changed. Bad on you OfferUp bad on you Samsung. I had two factor authentication turned on also. DON'T USE THIS APP!,1

18145,Super,5
18146,"Quick to respond, extremely polite and helpful.",5
18147,This happened again in error but don't understand why. They keep telling me I didn't abide by their guidelines. I asked them to show me proof and they just say they can ban me if they want. I've asked to escalate to a supervisor and they just say don't try to make another account cause mine was deleted by them. Its very unfair how they are treating me and wish I could talk to someone over the phone so I can explain. I loved OfferUp up for years but they need to consider their polic,1
18148,great app on point,4
18149,works well it's a great app I use all the time,4
18150,App always tends to run slow or freeze up. Running like a 2002 windows when it's 2022. Been using this app for years and nothing has changed to fix this.,1
18151,"My account was revoked after using once, with no explanation. I reached out to customer service twice asking for an explanation and never got a response. They have a policy that they can revoke your account without an explanation, but when you've done nothing wrong it just feels like blatant discrimination.",1
18152,fantastic items,5
18153,has changed its platform not a good app anymore,1
18154,Good app,4
18155,if I post something people can't see what I'm selling. if I place a offer I never get a feedback. this app was so good and I used to use it all the time but now it sucks so bad.,1
18156,good,5
18157,"This app gets worse and worse. Still overrun by spam and scams and it's worse than ever, but now it's the laggiest app I've ever used on top of that, and there are WAYYY too many ads that take up half of the screen in any given search and the ads vibrate your phone when you scroll past them! My phone vibrates 100 times whenever I use the app to find anything and it drives me crazy! Still can't block sellers who post the same items a thousand times a day making it impossible to fine a legit item.",1

Now, when I respond to talk to sellers, about 5 words in the keyboard and text filling lags insanely long. I have to close the app and reopen to get back to real-time type to text response only to have it happen again in about 3 to 5 words in. I tried testing other apps and I get no issues.

18217,This app is just fine overall. I just logged in after forever and posted some items but then saw some weird posts that I did not believe I posted (I had this app back in 2016) Turns out my page was hacked. Saw an angry comment and now it makes it look like me so I definitely won't be able to sell on the app with this email. I tried to delete the posts including mine but all you is archive them. I tried to delete/deactivate the account altogether but there's no option to do so -__-,2

18223,Don't use this app! It's a complete waste of your time. Possibly the worst app in the Play store? I have to close and reopen the app at least 5 times just to send one message because of the many bugs. It's just a terrible app. You're better off using eBay if you actually want to sell or buy items.,1

My partner and I we receive about 15 to 20 messages a day and I have to force close the app after every single conversation! Come On Offer Up!",1
18230,A lot of items for sale. Have been for sale for years and are forgotten items by ghost sellers. It's a home invasion risk. From criminals looking for a victim. Be extra careful From fake buyers looking for a victim.,1

18241,This app is garbage they keep showing things from one month to years ago,1
18242,I like using Offer Up. its easy and items are generally in the right categories. not like craigs where every section has a used tire shop sellin the wore out dry rot tires. sellers answer quickly and its nicer when you can see good things about your seller. Good app for me.,5
18243,The app has been freezing up lately. When messaging it gets frozen then unexpectedly stop working. Samething happens when messaging someone then clicking the image of the item being considered to purchase. It just freezes for no reason. Already uninstalled and installed back again with no change. My phone has 30 plus gbs left. All other apps function as they should with no problem. On the web is a better experience than the app. Hopefully they fix it asap.,3

18279,"I hate that I can't post things through the website and have to use the app. The only good thing about the app is the search function. The bad: 1. My posts keep disappearing seconds after I submit them. This has happened three or four times already. No, I am not attempting to sell banned items. 2. Messaging can be difficult. The keyboard is glitchy and freezes frequently. The only solve is to close and restart the app.",2

18281,This app runs really really slow I've tried it on two different phones and it just sucks it takes forever to send or receive messages,1
18282,Sllowwwwwww and app keeps crashing. üê¢,1
18283,It's a rolling dumpster fire. Update: Now the app randomly locks up on keyboard entries. This is on a stock Android Pixel. Way to AwfulUp an already terrible app.,1
18284,"Hate how you can no longer 'window shop"" anymore. Now when you search for something afterward it tends to prioritize those type of search results in the normal list when no query is been performed. Takes the window shopping aspect out of it. I've probably bought less since this is happening.",1
18285,it's been great. the only glitch I seem to continually have is on qualified shipping it sometimes won't open to allow it. also would love to be able to search my own listings in my postings to pull up to edit etc easier than scrolling through. been using for over a year and do like the archive once sold.,4
18286,"Awful ! It lags , when typing its lags ,",1
18287,Let Go was so much better. OfferUp has so many scammers.,2
18288,"love the app so far, something other than Ma**k**pl*c* and with less rules and flexibility. I've been getting messages faster and the option to boost my listing after a free trial! definitely referring friends to join!",5

18297,Too many ads too many ads what to do business with individuals not dealerships too many ads too many ads I'm getting rid of this after being on it for 10 years it's changed a lot in the last couple years don't need nothing to do with this app any longer it's b*******,1
18298,App constantly crashes,1
18299,"Should add a Buy Now filter. Some sellers don't even have the item anymore. Also need to do something about dead accounts and listings. Facebook marketplace makes you renew your listing if you still have the item. And please make it so I can check out the profile of buyers messaging me before opening the chat. Sometimes buyers have bad ratings, don't want to leave them on read. Want to see who I'm dealing with before opening the chat. Like when I tap the profile picture in the messages tab.",1
18300,good app,5
18301,In reminded of EXACTLY WHY I deleted this app. Everything is advertisements for RETAIL... it's such a shame... it used to just be everyday folks placing ads for items at pretty good prices...TWO THUMBS DOWN,2

18315,"slow and clunky, only sends notifications for messages half the time",3
18316,Well this app was good. I've been on this app for over a year and I just started doing really good with my selling. Then all of a sudden today I am not able to log in it's telling me my account is basically not acted active because of some issue that happened which I don't even know what happened I have no issues with any customers on that app and for some reason you deactivated my account and I have people that I need to reply to and there's no phone number to call so I'm really frustrated,3
18317,Most unstable app I have ever owned,1
18318,App doesn't load when opened. Trash,1

18330,the best,5
18331,cool app.,5
18332,Should of know it would happen again. This time it was a couple bucks but last time it was MORE. That's when I deactivated account & went to mecari where I've been for 2 yrs actually makin money but nothing lasts forever. Shipping prices got higher & ironically for them they just did it a second time. Only reason i stuck with them is their app does freeze or glitch or reboot like this one has done to me many times. I'm done with offer up forever!,2
18333,"The last month or so has been abysmal, with every text entry screen effectively bringing the app to a standstill and Android prompting me to close the app or send feedback. I cannot respond to people, update items, or post new stuff without it being an ordeal.",2

18340,OfferUp is a great place to sell your items. it offers lots of high-end things for sale. you have the option and most sell situations to negotiate the price.,5
18341,Safe place to sell or buy.,5
18342,Offer Up is way better than having yard sales.,5
18343,Aids is better tbh,1
18344,Either fix all the crashing or get out of the game becoming a useless App!!,1
18345,"I hadn't used the app in months. Finally tried getting back on for furniture. Somehow, while not using it, I violated the terms of whatever and now I'm banned for life.",1

18348,I like looking at offer up and buying and selling but the notifications are getting like eBay over kill.,3
18349,I wish people will leave phone numbers. It might eliminate some scams,4

I can't get any messages or talk to any of my customers. I have 10 pending orders but no way to communicate with the customers. It's so frustrating and I'm not getting anything from customer service. Has anyone else had problems? If so, how did you get them to respond to you?",1
18373,This has become unusable on Android 13 (pixel4xl). App will freeze if I'm messaging someone. Ive been using this service on a web browser to avoid the app crash.,1

18377,GOOD,4
18378,"Absolutely horrible. Crashes constantly. I can write about three words before it freezes and I have to close and restart the app. Brand new Pixel 6, latest app and android OS. Junk.",1

18380,all you need you going find it here,5
18381,"I use this app all the time and recommend it to everyone. Doesn't matter what you're looking for, you can probably find it on offerup and for unbeatable prices. The form of 'offers' allows a healthy platform for bartering.",5
18382,after the recent update the app reliability has tanked and crashes constantly on Android 13,1
18383,Instantly removed my post 1 minute later without explaining it just to try and push me into reposting for $8. Wow lol,1
18384,The app keeps freezing. When I can finally get it the option to pick my location it freezes constantly and loops and I can't post anything. Very annoying especially after you write all the details for what you're trying to sell. My phone is brand new too so it can't be that.,1
18385,"As I'm reasonably sure, most would consider OfferUp an Excellent 'App' for buying, selling, or just wanting to determine a reasonably price for an item (in your area). Interestingly, most users don't realize the site is Monitored - to Help protect Users. I have used the app for years, but occasionally forget to check. I do Rate it as Excellent.",5

18398,Could pay shipping for items and,4
18399,DUDE the BUGS and lagging literally make this app UNUSABLE!!!! So infuriating.. bc it could be such an amazing app,1
18400,App gets worse and worse. Horribly slow now on droid. Wonder why they let posts stay up for years that are from defunct accounts and don't pressure sellers to mark thier items as sold or require reactivation of posts so you don't waste time looking? The more you have scroll through junk and message non responsive sellers the more ads you end up viewing. A marketplace with terrible fidelity to what's actually still for sale = big ad profits. 80% of people I text are non responders! üßê,1
18401,Nice,5
18402,just,5
18403,Simple and reliable,5
18404,app is slow,1
18405,Good place to find things at a reasonable price. However make sure to check your item before the 2 day refund period. I ended up paying over 70$ for a gamecube it was said to work great and it turned kn and everything but I didn't have any games to test it out and found out today that it doesn't read any games. So just be careful.,3
18406,App runs extremely slow,2
18407,This app is the slowest app I have experienced. Not exagerating! It literally takes 30-45 seconds to download any click you touch on the app. From opening the app at least 90 seconds to 2 minutes! Really? Then you go click on messages it takes another 90 seconds to get all your messages. Anther 90 seconds to get to the actual message you want to read! If you try to delete a message it bumps into another message and deletes it! Same or worse to post an item; so on. Its back to DINOSAUR age!,1
18408,search engine needs to be better and you need to be able to extend your range out past 80 miles for searches,3
18409,my experience with OfferUp has been a fast response for selling.,5
18410,This app should be removed,1
18411,"OfferUp is the greatest platform for buying, selling or bartering great,useful merchandise. Skip the YARD SALES!",5

18418,Buggy. The app keeps hanging while typing in messages...,2
18419,I've used OfferUp for years and have had no problems until just recently. I got a new phone and signed in and ever since it has been crashing mid writing messages to people a lot. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it did not help. It's frustrating enough to not want to use the app anymore. Hopefully it can be fixed!,3

18421,Didnt sell anything this whole time i had the app,1
18422,the app should have never gone with shipping. just keep it local it has ruined the app when I go to search something in my area it always pops up shipping and that's why there isnt alot of local people post it's honestly stupid and should be changed,1
18423,Great app. good place to sell and buy items locally and other states miles away,5
18424,"This app was great. Until about 3 weeks ago. Now all it displays is a bear that says setting went wrong try again later. Have deleted, re installed, restarted phone you name it. App still doesn't work. Whats sad is I had 3 messages for offers.",1

18456,I have only had good experiences here,5
18457,The world is at your fingertips. you can find anything here. I really like this app.,5
18458,Not the greatest. Most sellers don't delete sold items and OfferUp doesn't seem to delete after a certain time period. Ads are so small on phone and you can't zoom in to see them.,3
18459,beware of scams this app is not safe at all,1
18460,Overall I like the app but I often do not receive notifications when someone is questioning or asking about one of the things I have posted. By me not seeing possible buyers questions for hours I believe I may have lost some sales. The only alternative is to check randomly throughout the day to make sure I haven't missed anything and that is very time consuming.,4
18461,"Nope, I'm going to find a better app than this one. You're so stuck up and customer service is bs.",1
18462,Epic,5
18463,Buggy on pixel 7 pro It doesn't let me answer messages without crashing.....,1
18464,makes it easy yo post and purchase.,5
18465,Needs work. Bug that states I need to verify with TruYou in the account settings though it's already verified. After verification it doesn't allow me to message or make offers. ========== It's okay. Lists a lot of ads so be aware of that. My dislike for it is the lack of notifications... Wouldn't it make sense to alert the user of someone messages and wants to provide and offer? Having to open the app everytime to see if I got any offers made sales take longer than it should have. Look elsewhere,2
18466,2 sells so far hopefully I get more lol,5
18467,Offerup has been terrible on my android..,1

18503,Right now I'm pissed because I've been trying for like 3or4 years now to get verified with my ID. It doesn't let you know that that's the reason nobody's getting your messages. because you haven't verified your ID. I mean you have to go in and dig for that information. It doesn't alert you doesn't let off a beep whistle or anything of the sort. Furthermore for whatever stupid reason my brand new DMV issued ID is not scanning. Have been trying to do this for yrs now. UPDATE all fixed up. Ty O Up!,5
18504,Great site.,5
18505,good spot to sell stuff in the public,5
18506,I want to block so I can block all the car dealers and auctions that spam the car pages. Also the app is very unstable and glitchy. It freezes a lot and lags out too. I have most recent update on it. I still use it tho,1
18507,"Easy interface, and organized. Love the ease of use! Update Oct 2022 TERRIBLE since the update! Who's looking for jobs on offer up? Makes no sense lol",1

18509,"from no reason. I can never log in. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, tried different phones, made new accounts, nothing works. Useless app! 2 years later, I just tried to revisit this app and it's still garbage.",1
18510,"Very slow on Pixel 7. Almost impossible to use. It will not even allow to type the message fully - it would become so slow so letters you type will stop appearing. Developers, please look into this.",1
18511,"Horrible, Everytime I load in I can only stay on for about 15 seconds before it kicks me out please fix this",1
18512,"I'm new to offer up, I used to use letgo. I've always used ebay but wanted to expan my options.",3

18514,Dope,5
18515,way to many old stuff months even years ago still posted ...hate having to look at post from 6 mth ago..I'm only looking for cars at the moment not sure if those issues is only car related,2
18516,i can buy really good stuff with the money I made selling what I dont need anymore.,5
18517,"OfferUp when abiding by the guides, it can be a professional platform to success,. I can say that I am both shocked and impressed by OfferUp, from networking to sales, it is significant, the gains .",5
18518,Haven't used itvyet,3
18519,great try it,5
18520,wheels were even better in person.,5
18521,"Letgo was a great app. This app sucks. Too many in line ads, also I keep seeing posting that are not even near me even though I have a distance limit. Posts that are 6 months old! Developer will respond to reviewers with ""oh let us know how to improve"". You already know, you are quite aware of your scummy tactics. You know what to do to make this app not garbage, so just do it. But you won't. Don't act like you care",1
18522,"Great App, especially in the big cities. Highly recommend, thank you OfferUp.",5
18523,one of the best apps to find stuff that you need and things you want to sell on the market name Steve trust me I do storage lockers I do bids on blind sales like I know what's up so yeah this is a good app definitely my favorite,5
18524,Great Buying/Selling Experience,5
18525,company sliw to remove scam ads. some posts on the site pong after being sold. needs a time limit on how long something can be posted before it expires and requires the poster to repost the item. very frustrating to find something you want and see it's been there for 2 years. please fix this. if ebay can do it..you can do it.,2
18526,good,5
18527,Sellers don't follow up on your requests.,3
18528,VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS APP IVE USED IT FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS NOW AND SOLD AND BOUGT PLENTY OF THING BUT ITS BEEN MORE THAN 20 TIMES I TRY TO REDEEM WITH A GOOGLE PLAY CARD AND WHEN I TRY TO USE IT .IT GIVES ME A ERROR SAYING ITS ONLY VALID IN USA..I AM IN CALIFORNIA'S I LOST AT LEAST $500 IN REDEEM CARD...OR EVEN IF I PAY WITH MY BANK CARD IT WILL LET ME PUSRCHACE A POSTING FOR $8 THEN THEY WILL REMOVE MY POSTING EVEN IF I FOLLOW THE RULES...THIEFS,1
18529,Awesome app üëå,5
18530,Love it!,5
18531,"SLOW, BUG RIDDEN, & LACK OF OPTIONS. To the developer; 1, make it a one step process to remove old items from favorites board!! 2, The ads are RIDICULOUS and the searches generally don't show what's in my area FIRST which is what is recommended. 3, LOCAL SEARCH should be first priority and other searches available as an OPTION if desired, not FORCED down your throat. 4, message history should be better handled. It is SERIOUSLY FLAWED and some messages JUST DISAPPEAR!",1
18532,App constantly freeze and needs relaunch.,1
18533,Offer Up is a great way to sell something and a great way to buy. All transactions I've had on it so far have been üëç,5
18534,I got my profile blocked because I posted a flashlight streamlight tlr9. Customer service was no help replying with the same email,1
18535,Very slow app,1
18536,Ads are filtered in among items fairly often. No item descriptions are shown when trying to scroll through options. Deleted the same day I downloaded it. There are superior options available for this type of service.,1
18537,"So far, safe and reliable. Have used before and was very helpful..",5
18538,This app has the most lag I've ever dealt with compared to ANY app I've ever had since the intro to smart phones,3
18539,"Platform is great, app is dog poop. I don't know why but the chat feature grinds the app to a crawl. I use the app to browse, but it's useless to actually communicate",2
18540,#1 APP,5
18541,offer up it 's a good support,5
18542,"This app is a joke! People put stuff up for sale and forget about it. The app doesn't hold people accountable for the items they list! 90% have zero descriptions, same items being listed multiple times. Don't waste your time here!",1
18543,"I am only a few days (a week) old on ""OfferUp."" I have received few incoming/sales responses. Besides in-person exchange, I still have not [been able to] figured the payment process. It seems like an average app, for its size, and the efficiency, in terms of individualized ecological conservation efforts, probably needs some considerable improvement and networking with other apps/an interapplication master app. I am just glad it works at all. some don't",2
18544,Love it !,1
18545,Great way to save a buck.,5
18546,App is so slow,1
18547,"The app runs slow and it is difficult to navigate. The service it's non-existent unless you pay money to promote your items to sell quicker. If not, you're pretty much stuck not selling anything on there. You'd do better just giving your stuff away, selling to friends or starting a garage sale. The community is terrible, they want Pawn Shop prices from back in the 90s to buy your stuff. There are posts that are over 2 years old with items that they still haven't sold. ""Not recommended""",1
18548,"Critical 1. While messaging the keyboard is over the input field, so you can't see what's you're typing. I'm on pixel 4a 5g. 2. The app hangs when I type a message to the seller. Also it hangs when you go to the seller's other items and the seller has a bigmore then 10 list. Not so critical, but need to be fixed The notification about an incoming message sometimes comes 5 or more minutes after the message arrived. That's extremely confusing when you meet someone outside an apartment building",2
18549,My acount suddenly stopped receiving views and no one saw messages I sent. I contacted support and received a couple of automated emails and followed all the instructions with no improvement. Still trying to contact support...,1
18550,"when I open this app and I go to my inbox and start a chat with anyone. as soon as I open the chat my whole phone slows down to a crawl, I have a Google pixel 7 pro, do you beta test your apps before you release them?",2
18551,"offer up has no limit to how many items you post upfront free of charge and, they sort most the odds and ends out for you including shipping. definitely a must if your beginner or just don't simply see yourself doing it long-term.",5
18552,works well,5
18553,shopping and selling 24/7 love it,4
18554,Seller didn't not ship the item I paid for and basically scammed me. Tried contacting customer support and they have been unhelpful. Please be cautious buying from sellers who ship only,1
18555,"Too many scams, it's not hard to tell what a scam is but for that I would never trust when someone wants to ship something to you. I was trying to find a good deal on a scooter and I wasn't able to find a single one that wasn't a scam. I would say only 2 out of 30 that I looked at weren't scams. Sadly they were too far away and offer up doesn't offer any shipping options for bigger items.",1
18556,"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT DOWNLOAD ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èLET GO used to be the best selling and buying APP. However, things took a nose dive ever since the merger took place with 'OFFER UP'. It runs very slow, can't even get notifications on time, and it only shows old sales from months and years ago since they merged with 'OFFER UP'. To many ads and THEY ALSO TRACK ALL OF YOUR INTERNET BROWSER SEARCHES. CREEPY",1
18557,"Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt let me post because it gives me a notice that says ""category is invalid"" when it isnt. It doesnt even explain to me how to fix it or what do I need to change. It tells you at the end when you click on 'post' so I have to go all the way back to try and figure out why or how is the category wrong and how to fix this issue.",2
18558,How the might have fallen. App hasn't loaded for me in months.,2
18559,Updates Fail to fix glitching I have pixel 6 phone and this app crashes and glitches a lot. I can't even message ppl without it freezing and crashing. I don't know what needs to happen on updates to fix this.,1
18560,"great app, bought and sold stuff here.",5
18561,Could be easier to reach people even when they don't respond!,5
18562,no real buyers. too many ad items,2
18563,Constant freezing. lots of people advertising items for $0 and $1 trying to scam,2
18564,This is an okay app. It may be great for sellers if it showed who was looking at the listings and from where. Another issue is that it will constantly bug out. It freezes when texting other people on the app or even just scrolling through listings.,3
18565,Doesn't allow my posts,1
18566,Items don't post to feed. How am I supposed to sell anything when people can't see what u post??,1
18567,App runs as if it was optimized by a 5 year old. WHY DO PEOPLE USE THIS?!?!?,1
18568,I Like,5
18569,"I have had this app for awhile and have been satisfied with the process of selling my items, but in the last few years, I have had nothing but people inquiring about my items then ghosting me after I responded to them. Or I will have people saying they will buy my item for much less than posted, even when I state the price is firm. Almost like they're doing me a favor. I am very disappointed this and am on the lookout for a similar selling app where people are a little more considerate.",1
18570,the app works and is a platform for people to sell their things. the problem is that there seems to be no time limit on how long an ad stays active on the app. it's not uncommon to see ads as much as 4 to 5 years old. I would think this should be an easy fix for the programmers,2
18571,Great customers!,5
18572,She was fair on the price and she was on time,5
18573,This app helps you reach out to people from the comfort of your home and assists you in getting what you and getting rid of what you don't want.,5
18574,"Terrible app, no seller contacts, only message without answer. How can I buy item if seller doesn't read it.",1
18575,app is much better after the most recent update,5
18576,Great if it would download,5
18577,The service is fine but the app constantly freezes requiring me to kill it and restart. Oftentimes the keyboard doesn't work correctly.,2
18578,I love the way that I can be sale items that have value easily and safely. I have only had good experiences and hope this remains the same for a long time.,5
18579,This is a great app!,5
18580,it thinks it knows what you want if you click on a picture. just to see how much or what the picture is doesn't mean I want just that stuff .,3
18581,I love OfferUp,5
18582,Great app so far I haven't sold anything but I've been talking to someone who seems to want to buy something from me started the app yesterday really happy,5
18583,"Messaging is completely broken. The app constantly crashes whenever I try to communicate with anyone. I noticed some weird highlighting during the ""app is not responding"" circus, so I think they added some kind of spellchecking or something in there and it's draining too much memory.",1
18584,I only gave it 3 stars because I always use the PICKUP & I get items that SHIP or are NOT in the radius I select!,3
18585,Completely disappointed in the way offer up handled a issue with my account! Nothing was explained to me and after a couple good years using the app I'm left in the dark and unable to post.,1
18586,Estufas electrics usada,5
18587,"Slow, terrible messaging, does not allow pic in chat room. Very useful though.",3
18588,there is no option to block people who annoy you,3
18589,if you change your phone number you get locked out,1
18590,"I use OfferUp often, for buying & selling. I would like to see prices on the pictures, instead having to open the listing to see it. And it's a little slow to respond when clicking on anything (listings, creating a listing, editing, etc). Member since 2016.",5
18591,excellent,5
18592,Nest selling app,5
18593,offer up police have to many rules in place for people looking to buy sell and trade so they removed my ad,1
18594,Swell perfect,5
18595,Not sure what happened but the app will not quit crashing and it's impossible to send messages. Typing is nearly impossible. I've reloaded and reinstalled but nothing works!!! Please fix this!!,2
18596,Horrible app. As soon as I opened it after installing it just froze and I couldn't press buttons and when I finally could it would do the same thing constantly and my phone was lagging on other apps all day until It clicked and I uninstalled. Guess what? Phone was fine again. Pure trash.,1
18597,friendly. helpful,5
18598,Great app.,5
18599,New update is aweful! Everything takes forever to load and update,1
18600,good obe.,5
18601,This app is very resourceful and exceptional according to it easy access & findings being applied.,5
18602,Very easy and convenient also quick and safe,4
18603,works great,5
18604,awesome buying and selling site..,5
18605,It's garbage wouldn't recommend it to anyone,1
18606,great!!,5
18607,App is too slow to load. Fix it.,1
18608,great views but no sales,3
18609,"I like the app.for the most part.But it seems to cause alot of confusion when offer up injects links into messages and replies ,making them look like some sort of scam or spam.i believe it scares away some potential buyers and add's to the already large number of no shows.",4
18610,In the beginning... I'm not as good. I was able to post two listings because that's all the items I was trying out to sell on the app a smartphone and a tablet both T-Mobile products I am selling. However since my free offer up promotion ended I can't relist the items they are archived and they won't relist. So I decided to list each item individually all over again and not I can't list anything I keep getting an error message saying my 4 photos won't upload when I only have 3.,1
18611,"The absolute most garbage App ever made. How is it possible that the app hasn't improved at all since it's inception?! Scrolling through pictures makes my phone feel slow and old, but I'm using a OnePlus 9 Pro that is a beast of a device and has no problem with any other Apps. Notifications don't work, and old ads never get deleted. Fix your terrible App OfferUp!",1
18612,loveee ittttt,5
18613,Don't trust,1
18614,"Seriously. How do you screw up a database ap? It's buggy, crashes, all the time, half the time you can't access messaging because the servers can't keep up. The interface is pretty good. But goodness the buggy chat, search, and scrolling is horrible. Fix yourself Offerup or you're destined to fail like your parents marriage.",1
18615,20+ years of selling online/local here. OfferUp brings in low quality junk leads who lowball and or don't read your listing description. The fact that you can mark something sold even if it isn't and it will count as a sold listing in your profile speaks to the low quality of this marketplace. Stick with Mercari (fee based like OfferUp) or general Craigslist for local. Heck even the quality of leads on Facebook marketplace is better than OfferUp.,1
18616,"It a good place to look for used items for sale in the local area. But I noticed there are ads that I checked to be from scam websites on here. They advertise a lawn sweeper for like $89 or some other low price but buyer BEWARE! Offer Up should check these scam websites and remove them from this app. I checked one of them and it is a verified fake website. They take your money but don't deliver. I will list the advertisers to watch out for in a future update! ""Vizilox"" is a scam website.",4
18617,"Apps has lost it's purposes, should work more on filters descriptions and the way people are using.",3
18618,I haven't used it yet but I'm sure trying to üò≤,5
18619,Promotions are becoming too aggressive. The promo vehicles are jumping ahead of my searches. I can't even find what I'm looking for due to promotions overriding my actual desires. If you're selling promo put it on the side or something. There's no reason vehicles for 50-60$ grand shd be spamming my search. If that's not what I'm personally looking for.,3
18620,"it used to be a great app to buy and sell your items at, but now,... Appliance/Tire/Car Dealerships will just FLOOOOOOOODDDD the whole damn site at times, making it near impossible to look at private individuals items, I believe it would be a much better app if they blocked the business sector from being able to post, there are other venues for them!!! let them post there ?!?!?",2
18621,The idiots won't even let you post a yard sale. They deleted my post after i spent all that time. Ppl want to see yard sales offer up!!! Get with the program!,1
18622,great deals!!,5
18623,very honest and was great deal,5
18624,I bought my car off this app and everything works out fine anytime I can buy any items off of here I always have a great experience the app itself works perfectly.,5
18625,Love it,5
18626,"Aside from all the lagging on your app, I still made decent sales using this platform. Until I'm posting and posting and realize I'm not getting any views. Forward my link to someone to check and they see a message that pops up and says offer up has blocked me. Offer up didn't even tell ME they were blocking me. No warning, or explanation to what I did wrong. Just basically make my profile invisible to people. I have written you all through the app 4 times, and I am yet to hear anything back.",1
18627,good,5
18628,awesome app guys!,5
18629,So far it seems to be good I haven't had shipping anything or be paid that way yet so I don't know as far as that goes but as far as meeting up face-to-face with people It works great,4
18630,Wonder app. love everything about it,5
18631,Great shopping experience. everyone has been great to deal with & very negotiable,5
18632,Incredible,5
18633,Poorly designed and clearly not reviewed with QA best practices. UI is unintuitive and painful to use.,1
18634,"The UI and UX are fine but I truly don't understand why they allow posts to sit and not expire after a certain period of time. I was just looking at the free stuff and saw some interesting items, which weren't too far down the list - maybe 15 posts or so - and it was posted FIVE MONTHS AGO! I saw another one that said ""Today only!"" and it was right down the street from me but it was posted TWO YEARS AGO!!!! C'mon guys, even Craigslist makes you reactivate posts after 30 days üôÑ",2
18635,Doesn't launch anymore.,1
18636,Nice app to buy and sell stuff,5
18637,"Put a red dot sight for sale, they took my ad down and said it was ""dangerous"". They might as well take down ads for binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, etc. Mine didn't even magnify lol They got ads for $30 fake rolexes selling for $500 everywhere but then took my ad down. This app is guilty of ""political censorship"" even though my ad was not political, they are wanna be idiots.",1
18638,"After several attempts to log in I kept getting a ""Oops! Sorry! Try again later."" I give this app an F for failure! Will not recommend this to anyone.",1
18639,great app easy to use and safe,5
18640,the lack of ability to search for items that's not a vehicle is extremely annoying,1
18641,"After LetGo and OfferUp joined together the app features took a step backwards. Categories were removed and othere's placed in sub-categories that don't make sense. The biggest issue I find is having to weed through ads that are waaay out dated. There are ads up from over 2 years ago! How about putting a time limit on ads and making people renew them so we can eliminate some of this junk?? Say like, every 30 or 60 days.",1
18642,"This app is a joke it thinks I'm a fake person, won't let me post my stuff.",1
18643,"Downloaded a few weeks back. Tried to create an account every couple of days, but it's never worked. Restarted phone, cleared cache, reinstalled, etc. Frustrating and completely unusable.",1
18644,"Update: I can finally log in again. It's better, but they don't punish people for ghosting you after you pay for a transaction and expect to get what you paid for. They can just ignore you for days and then OfferUp will just cancel the transaction. No penalty on the part of the person who agreed to sell to you, but didn't. --------------- Used to be good. Now I try to log in and it brings be back to the sign in page every time. I've cleared the cache, restarted my phone, and same thing happens.",3
18645,great products- often near by- awesome price,5
18646,Very Good,5
18647,Well they are bad news can't even get back on office up got to go through some of stuff man they already hacking in all your systems and everything else,1
18648,Is it just me or is the message portion not working? I've literally had this app since 2015 and had no issues. But recently left messages to literally 60 people and not one has replied? I don't think my messages are going through or my incoming messages are not coming in? I've texted the help desk but nothing has been done? Hopefully someone in the technical department sees this and fixes the problem. I think I'll have to go elsewhere which I do not want to do but this is where I buy and sell..,1

18653,"Became unusable. ZIP code auto sets to 30 miles for everyone now it appears. I have people from thousands of miles away contacting me. Also the app has become increasingly laggy, it takes almost 1min for me to get to my sales tab and lags when loading messages. Needs complete overhaul. It always had issues, but not this bad. Someone at OU is messing up.",1
18654,"Love it, also met up with local gals ,started business wise and ended up smashing twice.",5
18655,Last 4 times I tried to purchase nothing happened and I got refunded. This app allows anyone to post forever.,1
18656,Useless.,1
18657,"bought a camper shell, seller helped lift it and install it.",5
18658,Too slow I've sold a lot of merchandise on this app. However with all the adds now the spam the (bots) that message me and waste my time I would think that a company that's as large as this one could weed out the nonsense I am currently looking for a new selling app to sell my goods on,2
18659,Works amazingly well but after using it for a while the app has been a bit slow and a has not been notifying me when someone messages me or sends an offer.,4
18660,"it spontaneously stops alerting me. The notification just stops working. no little number, no little sound. when you're trying to sell things and trying to be someone buyers can trust , you've taken the time to ensure you'll receive both audio and visual notifications so that you know when someone is messaging and the app keeps dropping the ball? not alright. the apps great other than that. just fix the glitches folks. fix that and I'll happily give you 5 stars",2
18661,"Does not remember my search filters, makes contact with other users difficult",1
18662,I just want to thank you. The chocker and earrings are exactly what I saw on the picture. And the shipping was a great service thanks again,5
18663,"This is a great app. Easy to use and safe to use. I appreciate the verification needed to join. In addition, the ease of using it anywhere in the country is easy to use. Recommend it to anyone who is buying or selling anything. I'd rather use this app versus Craigslist.",5
18664,needs more updating and to stop messing with the prices that I had on it smh,1
18665,STOP SUBSCRIBING ME TO THE PEOPLE I TALK TO. GOD IM SICK OF THIS GARBAGE FILLING MY EMAIL INBOX EVEN THOUGH I ASKED IT TO STOP. STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP WITH THE BS. IT WONT LET ME TURN IF OFF. PLUS THIS THING FROZE MY ENTIRE PHONE FOR 10+ MINUTES SO I COULDN'T EVEN TURN IT OFF AND ON AGAIN. FIX YOUR TRASH OR IM UNINTALLING AND *LEAVING* IT A ONE STAR.,1
18666,Great App love it.,5
18667,Very easy to use not as much fishing emails and posts as craigslist in Facebook marketplace,5
18668,Good,4
18669,Even slower now. Constantly freezing and crashing. Uninstalled and cleared OfferUp used to be awesome and rarely had an issue with it.. when they merged with letgo things went downhill.. both apps worked great before the merge. Now ads on every page. @offerup dev team cut back on the ads on every page!!! It slows the app down. If you have to have them put them just on the main listing page. Nowhere else! It gets users more frustrated and less likely to click on an ad or use your app.,1
18670,Can't even verify card for payment üôÑ what a joke,1
18671,Have good things,5
18672,"Find what you need locally. I have found Great deals on tools, Baseboard s, and more...",5

18675,it's so hard to get back in once you're charged phone.,3
18676,"Beware of this Thieves! I've been trying to cancel a promotion in several ways. Impossible through the app, (which by the way you must download). Impossible through the website. So I've been charged for promotion services for one month. It is only when they charge your card, then they offer you the possibility to cancel the subscription...as I said thieves... (Please don't bother to reply with your policy BS...) This app MUST BE straightforward!!!!",1
18677,very old post that should be removed. hard to search.,1
18678,Don't download OfferUp they ask your information and they leaked..,1
18679,"It should be different categories for owners , business , I'm looking for a tire and this tires shop post their same item evey 4 hours using different accounts , and it's really annoying when I get notified about the item I'm looking for and I open the app to see it and is the same item post by the same business using a different account",1

18687,Easy to post and it's nice to help people who have economic limitations.,5
18688,had no issues till i sold an item that i could not get registered with offer up to mail the item. the system kept telling me to register and i would do all the steps to get in the system but it would not register me. in the mean time im wasting peoples time because i cant figure out why im unable to complete the sale. Really a huge fan of the way things are listed. its like product over load. unless you permote your item its not seen in the feed very often if at all. the offer up parts cool.,2
18689,best,5
18690,Nice to have nearby things to buy.,5
18691,There are scamner on.offer up When you try to tell to them they seem to do nothing,1
18692,"Messages glitch when being typed out, requiring you to force close the app and reload. Makes communicating with others needlessly laborious.",2
18693,The app is super buggy. It keeps freezing when I want to respond to messages I have to force close the app and relaunch just to finish a sentence.,2
18694,"For the past 3 weeks, I've tried to add TruYou to my account and haven't been able to. I've used this app for about 3 years and now I'm been told to add truyou. I can't use my app. I have emailed many emails to support and they haven't been able to help me. It's frustrating. What should I do? Any ideas?",2
18695,"They don't allow posting of respiratory items because they ""appear to be drug paraphanelia"".",1
18696,Able to drive n buy,5
18697,The latest version is locking up constantly and crashing. I've flushed cached storage and data on the app and it's still doing it. Please fix!,3
18698,"Honest, on time and keyboard stand was as advertised. Nice experience!",5
18699,Very buggy. locks up almost every time.,2
18700,"amazing the beautiful, great quality finds. Love you can wheel & deal reasonable prices... negotiate!!",5
18701,"I've had success selling in the app, but lately it's been freezing up a lot and if you have a question for customer service that's not addressed in their FAQ section, it takes days to get a response back from them.",2
18702,"is a great way to, clean your closet and see what is to sale,fine the present from 5 year ago but don't fit me....then....OfferUp.....clink...",5
18703,"Worst app yet. Items I listed were removed for no reason and when I reached out for assistance, I never received a response.",1
18704,Worst app ever since they merged with let go.,1
18705,terrible awful customer service no phone to call like the mafia,1
18706,Love this app I can window shop all day,1
18707,Never let's me list my items properly,1
18708,I also think that the ads that are on here and on here too long to take them off like let go did and the ones that are fraud also take them off within 24 hours of them posting it and take them off,5
18709,It won't let me download!,1
18710,easy to use,2
18711,I don't know if it's this app or my phone but I finally went to post some items to sell and it keeps locking up or buffering before I can submit my post ü§∑üòñ,2
18712,"No Plymouth, Chrysler make categories.",3
18713,"freezes and its very slow after restarting and clearing cache , only slow app on my phone for some weird reason ,( moto g power)",2
18714,If i could rate it for 0 stars i would. Not only can I not just post things online from my computer wleven when I did download the dumb app (your forced to or you cant post anything.) I used the app to post something just to have it say it posted but not show it. Seconfld within a few hours my account got disable for unknown reasons. Saying i violated the community guidelines which there no way to talk to them or email them or call them. By far the worst selling app I saw. 0/5 stars until fixed.,1
18715,A little slow,5
18716,A good app for selling items. I've enjoyed using it. The only issue I have with it is it takes a long time to see messages. It's slow.,4
18717,They banned your account for no reason and they support system is horrible there terrible and terrible customer service don't download this scamm app,1
18718,Good,5
18719,have seen some nice items on here for sale,5
18720,Well organized and helpful layout make this app easy to use,5
18721,"I really like it, there are no bugs in it for me. But, I'm a minor so I can't buy stuff from people I only sell. üòÖ",4
18722,"App is buggy and posts don't register. Customer service gives the generic ""restart phone or re-download the app"", but to no avail. Maybe a fix will come out soon but I will wait for only so long before moving on.",1
18723,sometime I feel like I'm blocked. when I try to search own items,3
18724,Good,5
18725,"10-2020 ppl are not responding to me because their posts are 1-2 yr old. Why is it not mandatory to delete old posts? It cloggs up the feed. Please do something. Please make it mandatory to add dimensions of all items. It's confusing, & frustrating, I spend a lot of time requesting dimensions. 9-2022 Reinstalled app, keeps freezing + crashing. Something is wrong. I'm using a Pixel 4. Can't send msgs. 10.11.22 app is worse. Freezing every time I respond with more than 2 sentences. PLS FIX!!!!",1
18726,I signed up recently in the app and now I'm getting spam from OfferUp telling me I can get a discount on wine and more at some other site. I don't use offer up for alcohol or food delivery. OfferUp should stick to what it's good at.,1
18727,pretty average.Some sellers leave their item on site after sold,3
18728,"Great deals to be found, but far too many advertisers and resellers... probably not long for this world üò•",4
18729,I have to get on Facebook Marketplace and totally remove all of my own items off of OfferUp. The app is not working at all and when I respond to buyers I never hear back from them. This is a complete waste of time. I'm not selling nothing on here all of my stuff is getting sold on eBay. I'm having to go in and say that all my stuff being sold but it's been sold on eBay nothing is selling on offer up total waste of time.,1
18730,Great for local sales. Avoid shipping with them. On top of high fees they will withhold YOUR money for extended periods without any explanation.,1
18731,Super easy to use whether you are buying or selling.,5
18732,great transaction,5
18733,Terrible marketplace. Rarely get a response from sellers.,1
18734,I like this app because is so easy and people respond fast,5
18735,"Lastest update glitches all the time, doesn't work well and it takes a good amount of time to respond back",1
18736,Used to be great . The search suggestions make this app sort of annoying now,2
18737,"i hadn't had any offers, I then looked for my items on a friend's account and didn't find my items for sale, tried it again with another account and still nothing. they want toooo much private information to function correctly i guess",1
18738,"After updating the app, ratings don't get updated after selling items.",1
18739,Extremely tedious because of chat constantly crashing. I use a pixel 4 and I contantly have to restart the app just to type out a short message.,1
18740,Awesome,3
18741,When typing the keyboard blocks the text so you can't see what you're typing. It's done this since it was updated.,2
18742,Excellent app!,5
18743,scammers,3
18744,"Can't do anything with the app. ""Something went wrong"" error. That's super helpful!",1
18745,The concept works great. Have been able to buy and sell. The following are problems and suggestions: 1)I would like to see a feature where one can select between car dealerships and private sellers when searching for cars. 2) I would like for all conversations not to be automatically deleted.,1
18746,great app...good results. wish I could filter between car owners and dealers,4
18747,"Platform is glitchy and is poor at filter bot sellers and spammers. Sometimes opens other times shows an error message, super archaic app for 2021 Edited: letting offerup devs know how to improve the app. First start with having better support staff in place to answer questions and protect buyers and sellers from glitches & fraud. App allows people to spam post duplicate posts which doesnt allow other sellers posts to be viewed with no corrective action taken, shame on offerup for allowing this",1
18748,if the smartphone is weak then the application is slow,3
18749,"I love it! So easy to post your merchandise, and get responses quickly.",5
18750,"Shadowbanned. OfferUp apparently ""shadowbans"" new users which means your selling listings never get posted and they don't tell you they've blocked you (for no reason). Brand new account with all verifications completed. No support - opened a ticket but they never reply. Search on Reddit for accounts of the shadowban issue.",1
18751,Have good vibes about this i scanned through,4
18752,Yup,5
18753,Whatever company or development team you hired to run/update the new user interface needs to be fired. The app is now unusable and you're probably losing customers. Terrible. Just roll it back to a previous version geniuses.,1
18754,This app banned me for no reason and I lost my sell for items I needed gone. I also wasn't allowed to message anyone. When I called to fix my account I was on hold till they hung up. Please do not waste your time with this app.,1
18755,App freezes constantly now... I dont know why but recently app just freezes for no reason.,2
18756,Well I live on east side CA t get far without it being one publ8c tran. So I'm only looking in this aria,3
18757,"WHY DID YOU TAKE OVER LETGO? I HAD OFFERUP AND LETGO BOTH INSTALLED ON MY PHONE WHEN YOU BOTH FIRST CAME OUT AND SINCE DAY ONE OFFER UP HAS THE WORST LAYOUT AND INFRASTRUCTURE I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED AND I NEED TO KNOW WHY YOUR APP IS JUST SO SO BAD AND HAS NEVER BEEN ANY BETTER? LETGO HAD IT RIGHT AND BUYING, SELLING, RESPONSES BOTH WAYS AMAZING BECAUSE MY WHOLE CITY FROM TUCSON ARIZONA, AMARILLO TEXAS TO EUGENE OREGON EVERYONE USED LETGO! USE THAT APP BUILD AND NOT OFFERUP APP LETGO WAS BETTER!",1
18758,great app to help sell things you don't need anymore,5
18759,"I've loved using this app but a few weeks ago it started freezing after about 30 seconds of using it. It makes writing back to people impossible. I've cleared cache, storage, uninstalled and reinstalled... Nothing helps. Seems others are having this problem too. I can't use the app anymore.",1
18760,it's a good place to sell. when you're shopping and buying what you run into is old items that some sellers don't delete,4
18761,How do I know if the lawnmower is still there and how do I contact the person,4
18762,Same as others. App is now laggy and crashes. Almost unusable. 10/10/22,1
18763,Very poor costumer support. I been trying to contact them regarding a order that a seller sold a item and i paid for it - now trying to get a refund,1
18764,Never he'd a bad one by,5
18765,"God...slowest app I ever seen, Jesus christ , developers should be fired.",2
18766,"app is very laggy, freezes while typing",2
18767,App was great until it started Banning me for using my credit card,1
18768,love the app,5
18769,"Absolutely terrible. I never leave reviews. This app is full of companies pedaling goods. I saw two potential, real people selling.",1
18770,"too may ""promotions"" and too many fake notifications.",2
18771,Very very very good,5
18772,I don't have any faith in this app and it seems a bit shady to me.. I have tried several many times to contact sellers concerning items of interest with absolutely no reply back.. it seems like the pictures of alot of the postings are old as well and I have even come across pictures of scantily clothed females on there?!? So what are they selling? Those should not be allowed as my kids have asked questions as to why and what and I can't explain it myself.. I just don't trust buying anything here,2
18773,App shows me what I'm looking for,5
18774,App by itself is good. But lots of spam listings and spam users. OfferUp is not able to control these and it's a frustration for genuine users. Local shops create 100s of listings and spam the space. It's hard to find personal seller listings. There is no filter to select users based on their reviews like to select users who have 4+ rating or such.,2
18775,App is ok but very laggy and sometimes won't let you see the text you are writing. Needs improvement.,2
18776,this is a good platform until you run into the flakes. it's about 75/25. one thing offer up could do better is to cull the users who have not done business in like a year. those people have moved on and are not coming back.,4
18777,best place to buy with budget,5
18778,very nice young gentleman,5
18779,runs super slow on Android...,1
18780,Scammers run rampant and make up the majority of the app's population.,1
18781,"Banned me for no reason after shipping out 70 dollar order. Go to EBAY instead. EDIT: Their support system IS A LIE. They do not care. Edit 2: They banned me for ""piracy"" for selling a factory reset roku. In one of the pictures it was the roku setup screen. Bunch of clowns DO NOT INSTALL YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY.",1
18782,"I was an Offer Up/ Let Go fan 6 years ago. I preferred Let Go over offer. Then they announced ""the merge"". In its hay day, I found treasures like you wouldn't believe. I spent hundreds of dollars on things I still have till this day. Now its loaded with ads. There is more posts of warehouse furniture vs ""garage sale"" furniture. I can't find anything authentic anymore. Facebook Marketplace beats this app by a mile. Uninstalled",1
18783,Won't let me upload any photos I will be uninstalling I didn't really want to give it any stars,1
18784,I typically use OfferUp to check for anything before I go buy a new one. You can get amazing deals from local people in your community without paying big companies for severely marked up products.,5
18785,excellent eclectic collection of goods for sale. easy to use however the sellers rarely respond to inquiries. two thumbs üëçüëç up,5
18786,never had a problem always consistent there's a lot of quality stuff you can find any thang you need then some thankyou,5
18787,the best app . works great üëç,5

18791,Best buy sell trade app I use,5
18792,"Randomly decides not to use local. I'm not looking for things and used the filter to do local only at range with no shipping and it's just shipping stuff so the filter is pointless, can't find things locally if it doesn't give me the options",1
18793,nice app,5
18794,It's gotten progressively slower and slower...,2
18795,This app is not what it used to be. No one responds.,1
18796,App it's not working properly it froze time to time.,2
18797,Too much from stores. Not enough from individuals. Prices are too high,2

18806,"So slow to startup this site highly frustrating,used to be a great app, but the sluggish starts let alone any button I push puts the app into overload and nothing happens,looks like craigslist is again to be installed, at least it's faster, and doesn't drop messages or automatically restart",2
18807,This app has been having so many issues with freezing and not allowing to send messages for over a year! Are the developers drunk children?,1
18808,"I love this site as it helps me save money, and make a little money at the same time!!!",5
18809,"No longer available items continue to be listed and some sellers do not respond to inquiries about the item availability. Some items show they were listed a year ago and are active. Once you have purchased the item, the seller comes back and says its not available. Your funds get tied up until something at the seller end or at Offer Up end gets cleared up. This is no good.",3
18810,Great,5
18811,"App does not start, stays on loading screen. Already cleared data, uninstalled and installed again and same thing keeps happening. Already tried restarting device many times. App doesn't start at all.",1
18812,Works Well & No Glitches,5

18814,"good app, however; need to remove the sold vehicles.",4
18815,when searching items it's annoying that we find old listings. listings should expire or archive in 30 days and listing person should review it. thanks,2

Hours later, they deleted my account and canceled the transaction stating ""Your account has been removed from OfferUp due to violations of our Community Guidelines and Posting Rules."" with no further explanation.

18820,feel like there are too many scams,2
18821,i never sell anything on this platform. I have much better luck on craigslist. this site only promotes paid ads..,1
18822,Doesn't work,1
18823,If you want to promote an item good luck canceling the program. I dont even have anything for sale but they keep charging me $20 a month. I've tried canceling it but it says to manage acvountbon goog kml e play but bbn I've yet to figure CV out where.,2

18836,great app,5
18837,terrible,1
18838,Why is the app all glitchy now? It use to work fine.,1
18839,would give 5 stars but more than half the listings are advertisements now and you have to click each item individually to see the asking price.,3
18840,Would be good if I could see what I was typing when messaging but the key board hides the message box so you can't see what your typing,3
18841,a lot of scammers on this app be wise and careful.,3
18842,I got banned for no reason and i cant use offer up ever agian they need to fix their policy,1
18843,This app is horrible now. It used to be amazing,1
18844,Can't view my inbox or items for sale after the update,5
18845,"It'd be nice to have search preferences saved as default instead of having to select 'local' or distance for example. Also if there's a way to delete or archive any posting older than 30 or 90 days for example, kinda like Craigslist! No sense on seeing posts that are 4 years old.. Also a way to filter out spam posts would be nice.",1
18846,The app used to be good but the updates messed it up. It only shows me items I've looked up in the past and it never shows me what's new around my area anymore. I have to keep clearing my cache in order for me to see new things that have been posted.,1
18847,"I have gotten many good items from this app. I would make sure you read between the lines because you never know the person you're dealing with, but I've been fortunate and have personally never brought anything with any problems",5
18848,Doesn't work. Keeps deleting my new posts or they just vanish altogether. I've tried over a dozen times now with different items with no success. Just thought I'd give them this 2nd chance but I see nothing has changed with this stupid app. My husband deleted or doesn't use this app anymore either after the same issues. They also make it too difficult to figure out how to delete your account or deactivate it so I am just going to uninstall this pathetic app once again & never come back.,1
18849,Great,5
18850,great to work with,5
18851,Well I like to buy cars pick some up I like hot rods and Tejano music and well I fixed it by fix and sell cars also I mean you know or fixing for my grandsons in one night and more to the like them hot rod,4

18853,Great guy. Just as advertised. I will definitely use Jose again. thanks,5
18854,it's an ok app but once you get the promote plus you can't take it off its really annoying,3
18855,lots of stuff with Rated sellers and buyers enjoyable,5
18856,Best way to sell stuff,5
18857,I haven't received payment for the last 3 items I sold. I even contacted customer service with no avail. I am removing all of my items after 3 months of receiving no response from customer service.,1

18859,Literally omw to pick up a ps4 and the app just stops working. Have been reinstalling happened twice already,1

If I log out and back in I can see messages for like 10 seconds then one of those codes will pop up I have cleared cache didn't work I Uninstaller and reinstalled didn't work and I went online and my inbox showed no message even though I'm supposed to be meeting up soon with someone,1

18867,"USELESS APP... So many times I have not been notified of messages or is unable to retrieve my messages from buyers only to receive an error message over and over again causing me to lose out on potential business. I restart my phone, clear cache and still no resolve. I don't recommend this app for serious sellers because it makes you appear flaky only to lose business. I liked ""Let It Go"" much better and had great results before Offer Up acquired it. You're better off selling on a corner!!",1
18868,"Constant Errors. Mid conversation planning a meet up and error 403 and 503 code for 40+ min now. Tried deleting and installing app again, now can't even log in.",1
18869,This app is trash! I post and sell so much on here but sometimes the app makes me want to break my phone by it glitching mid sentence and I have to restart it all over again. For such a big company they don't want to help out the consumer,1
18870,"While on my way to an offerup transaction... the app suddenly stopped working and required me to relogin... after that all my conversation history went missing... 10/08/2022: a few times I used this app on the day I'm supposed to meet the person, the app messaging system just crashes making it unreliable ! I'm just sticking with Craigslist and marketplace. It is too frustrating and unreliable!",1

18875,App is not showing user profiles. It errors out. Won't load. Deleted and reinstalled still issues.,1
18876,The offerup app for Android had been pretty buggy lately. Pages have been slow to load and lags. Wish we can get a decent working app with less issues,3

18885,Definitely the go to source!,5
18886,I'm up and running with a few clicks & pics. Actually sold 2 items and bought a few!,5
18887,A good resource to sell unused items of any kind as well as search for needed items at a price less than new. More filters would be helpful as well as let's get the opportunity to rate the potential buyer that never shows and doesn't value others time.,4
18888,I like OfferUp. Should be a good improvement if they put more information in the small pic before click on it and see the details as price and where is it.,4
18889,Lots of irrelevant ads.,2
18890,Offer up it's a cool app to buy new and used fixie bicycles and fixie original bike parts like fixie rims and fixie frames and complete Fixie bicycles.,5
18891,Question why in used car search 25 miles or less it shows me cars 100 miles away ? This is a big waste of my time.,1
18892,"When buying more than 1 no response from sellers, when selling and promoting I ended up losing money since also no real buyers. Sad experience :(",1

18901,notifications (the most important thing in such an app) is still not being timely pushed,1
18902,My second job ever one and everything need a second chance,5
18903,"Last 6 months with the app have been terrible. Has become really terrible on responding to folks. Locks well using the pop-up keyboard to type a message. Have to force app shut and clear cache, but will lock up again after a few minutes when typing. Haven't using the website to type messages instead. App still works a little bit when editing a posting, but still kind of sluggish even with that.",2
18904,Buy my car,3
18905,I am having issues with the shipping labels that offerup is sending to us sellers! USPS is not able to scan the bar code so they have to enter it manually which a lot of usps workers do not like doing so the package just sits in a bin until who knows when! No one is responding to my emails and I've sent out packages that aren't able to be tracked! Please help!!!!,1
18906,it's a great app to make a few bucks for uneeded items and getting stuff at good prices.,5
18907,the app keeps crashing to the point you can't even massage someone an entire message,1
18908,loads and runs very slow.,2
18909,"When I first downloaded the app, it would not connect. It told me there was some issue, not describing the issue, to then ask me if I wanted to try again. The next day it worked, and the day after it started loading more and more recent offers. The day after it went back to not working in the same manner as when I first downloaded it. It is not an intnernet issue, ruled out when my 5G didn't work I tried 3 different WIFIs. I have restarted my phone, re-installed the app and tried clearing cache.",2
18910,Sorry something went wrong problem,1
18911,"people just repost the same over priced junk, over and over every day... Should put a limit on how many times you can post the same thing",1
18912,sold my information. since posting and using app I have had 20 plus spam calls a day.,1
18913,So far so good!!,5
18914,"Horrible, they act like they're the only app out there! I posted items for sale, not realizing that they (unlike other apps) those items were not allowed. Emails from Offer Up go into SPAM, but once I saw the emails advising of the issue with the posts, I did not post again. After that, I sold, filled, and shipped an order. Then all the sudden they decided to deactivate my account. So, now I lose my NEW item AND the money for the sale! ""Support"" is BS! DO NOT USE, much better apps out there!!!!",1
18915,"This is an edit from my last one star, it is now been 3 weeks and no issues have been fixed no items have been sold items have been viewed shows I have 10 conversations but not a single one is showing up in my inbox. This app is garbage I recommend anybody and everybody to uninstall it and stop using it.",1
18916,None of my post are getting views. I emailed offerup for help 3 times and have not go 1 reply. Does this app even work.,1
18917,Good,3
18918,Great way to buy and sell,5
18919,"Used it one time then forgot about it for a while, never even messaged any sellers or anything. Tried using it again a few months later and it won't let me log in and says my account is banned for violating cumunity guide lines. How is that even possible, I've never even talked to anyone on the app? Lame",1
18920,A lot of really old ads. They need to dump them after 4 or 6 months to keep up to date.,2
18921,Can someone PLEASE help me get my account back it was taken from me and no one will reply back to my emails telling me why!!! Just a vague prewritten message. I worked very hard to get my reviews and had almost 100 5 star reviews. I did not violate any rules or guidelines. Can someone please help???????? I need my account üò≠,1
18922,Offer up will completely lock up after a few keystrokes in messages and listing. Using latest SwiftKey.,1
18923,hard to write,4
18924,"The feed algorithm lacks any insite to the ise case of this app. You are inundated with listings related to recent searches such that it is the majority of what you are shown, greatly limiting newer posts in your feed. This is short soted as most users will have purchased what they were looking for and are no longer interested in it. It is truly awful and makes the app very frustrating to use and a second or third choice for this reason.",2
18925,so far so good. Just have to price things with fees in mind 12.9% plus .50 per item.,5
18926,awesome I love the app recommended app to my friends,5
18927,"too much spam, fake listings, warehouse spam. just as bad as Craigslist",2
18928,Didn't give it FIVE stars- for no reason; it's the ppl selling & buying experience who write reviews. I am not a store front and we all have lives. That aside I recommend üëå this platform.,4
18929,"truvue is garbage, craigslist is better because they still provide anonymity",2
18930,"Hate this app! I haven't been able to see any of my items, even if I promote them. I've tried different ways to search and even had friends search and they see none of my posts. And the same items keep on popping up all the time. Very disappointing, letgo used to be great!!",1
18931,good,5
18932,love love love! so easy. user friendly. safe. over all best selling/buying app out.,5
18933,Great app it just runs ridiculously slow. It has to be the slowest app to retrieve messages I've dealt with since dial up connection. EXTREMELY frustrating. Takes over a minute just to open one message. Fix it!!!,2
18934,a good way to sell things,5
18935,App freezes when trying to respond to messages. iPad version has been consistently buggy too.,1
18936,Used to be nice but this is the only app on my phone that lags when typing and could not continue. Would not respond then crash. Annoying.,1
18937,Cool,5
18938,I cant ever post anything 90% of the time and what i do manage to post sits for months like im not getting any views or interest and eventually ends up selling on another platform via my assistant. I liked the letgo platform way better before the merge please bring it back!,1
18939,it's great for selling things you have no use of. Someone else could use it.,4
18940,Love it!,5
18941,"On a PC w/ Windows 11 Pro and all attempts to download the app to sell with has failed. It keeps defaulting to a device I don't even have. Other times it keeps trying to download to my iPhone, but the send text has no download link. Beginning to have second thoughts about using this App since it seems so plagued with issues.",3
18942,"DO NOT USE THIS APP I couldn't even use the app as soon as I opened it. Before I could do anything, it said my account was disabled for violating community guidelines. I've sent several emails and never got a response. This app is a joke and a waste of time",1

18946,I recently sold a pair of sneakers (Air Max 90 London Underground) on OfferUp and have not yet received my payment. I've been in contact with the person who bought the item and they are very happy with it and confirmed with me that they never canceled their payment or anything. I was left with a pending deposit on OfferUp for several days and then all of a sudden that pending deposit dropped down to $0. The money just disappeared and I never received it.,1
18947,I do love the app it is easy and it is very helpful although I wish you had the ability to block people because there are some people that don't use common sense,5
18948,"To many scammers, everything I find something they tell me about a 20 pound limit and pay an alternate way. I can buy an item and its gets canceled. Same scam every seller",1
18949,"Crashing, freezing please fix asap! Interfering with my communication between buyers and sellers! Resulting in lost opportunities!

I recently stopped getting messages so I reached out to offerup CS which told me my account has been banned due to their selling guidelines (I have not done anything different since 2015). Absoutely no reason to ban my account. Way to go offerup, lose your original members. I am also letting family members, coworkers and friends know to uninstall this app.",1
18964,I have been trying to get someone from costumer service for the past two days. I am trying to change my delivery address. And I can't do it over the App. I sent three emails and I am still waiting for over 48 hours to get a response. Something like that ease to fix. I can't understand why they can't answer a simple request.,1
18965,Some of the sellers are suspicious,3
18966,great deals,5
18967,Full of flaky people and stuff that is no longer available. There needs to be a time limit for post and flaky people should be removed. Until something is fixed I'm done with this junk app.,1

Be very cautious and do not give out personal information on here or you will lose serious money especially if your item for sale is of high value and you get a message immediately, be careful. Do not use zelle with these guys. Do not give your phone number. Do not give anything. Only accept payments within the app itself.",1

Doesn't matter if you clear cache and data, or even uninstall. It's just not functional. Most of the time I have to message people through the website (which doesn't allow you to do everything needed) and have to use the web version to browse as well.

Someone needs to sue them.",1
18998,"I recommend Craigslist or Facebook marketplace over OfferUp. Bad customer service with OfferUp - account was closed and not sure why? I read through the guidelines and rules but OfferUp will not specify what I did. Before they closed my account I was experiencing issues with the messaging and posting as well.

19004,Good items on this app. All items I asked questions on received no response from sellers. Not sure if they're not receiving the messages or just ignoring. I mean if you're gonna put something up for sale but don't want to sell remove it. App is good people are a joke.,3
19005,"I can't sell my knives?? Because of ""dangerous weapons"" are you serious right neow bro?? Make it a 18+ switch thingy that removes restrictions!",1

19007,don't recommend,1
19008,needs to categorize better,3
19009,No prob fast so far.,5
19010,"Craigslist and nextdoor work better for free items. Takers no show and others send harassing messages when you say the item is already gone. When typing messages to potential buyers app freezes on the second line of text and you have to exit and relaunch to continue.

19011,I really love this app.its amazing.ive nothing but good experience .,4
19012,"I'm giving it 3 stars and not less because I've loved the concept of offerup since the days of it's inception and pre letgo merger. Thee app has pretty awesome user friendly access. Though these previous experiences have all been on iOS though. I've moved OS systems as of last week and on Android, it is suuuuuper laggy, not responding to commands too well, if at all. It makes any of the interaction incredibly annoying, specifically when creating posts. I've got other issues, but ran out of room",3
19013,This app is amazing. I've been able to sell a lot of items and find things that I'm interested in all over the United States. I recommend this app highly.,5
19014,Has been the best overall site to buy and sell locally. Really have not come across anything negative.,5
19015,Damn app hides my items every time I post I can literally search up my listed item from a different phone and not see it anywhere but you can see other people who have same thing from weeks ago and their listed item still pops up it's crazy,1

19017,"Don't you hate it when is the only notice your get ia a automatic email junk. Item Sold. Item's in offer up are over prices sometimes I send proof by sending links by ebay or Amazon however offer up will block all message from Ebay or Amazon Offer up wants to control everything Instead to concentrate for scammers They freeze my account. SHAME ON YOU! offer up. SHAME ON YOU! Goodbye OfferUp. Will give a try to craigslist,5 mile Let go apps.",1
19018,Aweful experience. Nothing I post shows up. They don't have a web based version to post via PC. Nothing but a headache. I don't normally post reviews but I'm beside myself with frustration.,1
19019,great site/ app...to sale and buy things... but customer service please reply to issues faster...it took 2 days for me to get an answer....THX,5
19020,"This app rarely works. I almost always get an ""oops, something went wrong. Try again later"" screen. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. A worthless piece of c***. How can you sell something if you cannot respond to messages. Need the ""let go"" app back.",1
19021,It worked well until a late update made the messages feature virtually unusable. The UI freezes after like 5 seconds of using it. Pixel 6 Pro.,2
19022,So sad i used this as way of buying. And when click brings me to a website. Ill just keep on using Craigslist or amazon if thats the case.,1
19023,This last app has really messed up my account.. please fix the issues and refresh my account. I don't have any of my Current information Please fix the problem with this update..,1
19024,"10/4 app is defective. Freezes. App has become a chore because OfferUp staff refuse to allow users to block spammers. Meanwhile, company seems to be completely ignoring customer service help requests.",2
19025,When people are messaging each other there is a significant lag time. When someone arrives and messages you it could be 5 minutes before you get that message to know that they are here. other than that it is a great app.,4
19026,"Review of the App, not the service: App used to function well, but has become very buggy over the last several months - particularly with messaging. The keyboard is overlaying the text field so you can't see what you're typing. Perhaps it's related to my Android updates? Regardless it shouldn't happen and has become very frustrating when trying to communicate. Using Pixel 5. Latest OS. 9/1/22 update: keyboard overlay no longer an issue but the app now hangs & crashes often during message input!",1

The box you type in often ends up under my keyboard so I can't see what I'm typing. Today I was attempting to view items buyer had for trade but even scrolling through their items it would hang and then move every few seconds until it wouldn't respond anymore. This has been goin on for months now and this app is getting worse...",1
19030,Latest update was horrible. Messaging crashes all the time . Viewing photos freezes. Does anyone test these patches before they are released?????,1
19031,"After testing this for several weeks I've come to conclusion that the ""Promotion plus"" Is just a sham scamming people, in a few month operation I've gotten over 20x views without my items being promoted in comparison to having ""Promotion plus"" with items supposedly being promoted daily. I've also sold item 2-3x faster than I have while using an account with Promotion plus , Mind you I have been TruU Verified and all so don't bother with wasting your money on promoting items.",3
19032,"App used to be great, between lagging & speed of the app which freezes & shuts down due to error, Also it's mostly big businesses jumping on and listing their items and a whole lot of dealers trying to monopolize the entire listings on buying and selling. This app is no longer for the individual but for businesses who want to sell their goods on another platform. I've had so so luck selling a couple things on here but until they start Banning scammers & Big Businesses, it'll be a SHlTSHOW.",2

19035,"I never write app reviews but honestly the app has been incredibly unusable as of late.

Have been uainf this app since 2016 with around 200 5-star reviews. Lately it's been impossible to buy or sell anything on here, in addition to a huge influx of fake/spam profiles and items.

It was user friendly and worked well. However , now it is horrible. The lag and load time is ridiculously long . It impossible to have a conversation with another user.

19083,"Shaky deals, troublesome products, BUYER BEWARE. EVERY POSSIBLE SCAM, very little oversight. 25% no show, 50% low ballers, 25% honest straight shooters. Since listing is free, prices are fantasys of sellers. Many times higher than retail. Broken, worn out, dumpster divers. Seconds, freight recovery you name it, they try dumping it here first. Very Entertaining and amusing, but treat it like recreational gambling.",3
19084,"Much too restrictive on what items can and can't be shipped to potential customers. If you aren't allowed to ship the item offered for sale, your only recourse is to try selling the item locally. This could severely limit your ability to sell certain items. Other websites and apps allow any item to be shipped. Also, there's too many items listed that have been there for over a year, some even longer. That's why I only gave them 1 star.",1

19088,I'm getting flashes across my phone that I've received an offer from OfferUp but OfferUp won't let me log into my site to be able to respond to the interested buyers. Really frustrating. It's been going on for 5 days that it will not let me in,1
19089,"Not sure whether it's because of an app update or the recent Android system update, but the Offer Up App is now unusable as I can't get past the login screen (submitting my email address and password correctly just returns me to the login screen).",1

19091,Why am I not able to sign in via the mobile app?,1

19095,Is it possible to work on the app's speed? It's kind of slow on my phone,1
19096,"It always boots me out, the keypad never pops up",3
19097,"App works ok but it's own features don't work, like using the share link and changes the city listed on items I'm selling. That's very annoying when I save an item using the correct city and the app then changes it.",2
19098,ok app. biggest issue are the offers by cos to sell their new products. should be able to opt out of seeing them. really aren't why I buy from the site. interested in private sellers only.,3
19099,awesome people,5
19100,Sellers don't respond to ads,2
19101,This last update was bad. It won't let me upload pics to existing posts.. crashes when I'm trying to respond to messages.. takes forever to load. Having a great deal of issues recently.. all bad,3
19102,Why is it too slow?,2
19103,Great,1
19104,"Very easy, fast interface, and nice layout, excellent customer service, communication, and guidelines.

19105,Out For Weeks.,1
19106,offer up let you get rid of unwanted valuables and it easy way step one two three and four post it up and wait for the right buyer. some products sell better than others but everything sells on OfferUp easy peasy for cheesy man easy!!!,5
19107,They have alot of finds.,4
19108,I can't get it to open past the login screen. This only just started 2 weeks ago.,1
19109,App seems broken. If I have chat open for more than 30 seconds the app stops responding. I keep having to close and restart repeatedly. Used to work.,1
19110,Offerup its good app to sell.,5

19116,awesome easy to use .. you must have app . thx OfferUp.,5
19117,unable to log in on phone - works only on PC,1
19118,Loads way too slow. Like the other way. Updated the app oct 2022 and it doesnt work better but worse.,1
19119,Its a little tough but fun,4
19120,Do not use this site it is not reliable,1
19121,app is good except for 1 time when i tried to buy a 5th wheel on here and the sellers Madi Burleson and Jake hollman stole my money and the 5th wheel!! I want my money back!!,3
19122,easy to use. made a few sells immediately,5
19123,Worst experience ever. They never reply to my customer support cases,1
19124,"Stopped working after update. It was not too bad before, now it doesn't work at all. It's reset password, but I can't log on with email. Don't know if it works with Google or FB. I don't have FB and don't want to give access to my Google account, so we all lose",1
19125,"Easy to browse listings but completely useless when it doesn't let me log in on the app using any method. I'm unable to ask questions, save favorite listings, or post anything. I tried clearing the cache, deleting and redownloading, and restarting my phone, but nothing works. It's been an issue for weeks. Now they disabled my account! I never even got to use it! (This is on a Pixel 5a)",1
19126,"I used to love this app. SO MANY SPAMMERS and there is no way to filter out their posts. Ironically if you report them, you can block them, but their posts do not disappear from your feed. You'll see 2 or 3 actual user items and the other 100 will be the same photo spammed everywhere sometimes with slightly different profile names like refrigerators$20 or refrigerators$40 etc etc. Please put a block function and filter them out once they are.",1
19127,This site is awesome! I have done so much business here both buying and selling. The only draw back is that posts don't automatically delete after so much time. Two and three year old posts coming up in a search? That sucks. Having said that...hint hint....I love it. Please OfferUp don't do what Facebook Marketplace did and I will use you forever!,5
19128,There is a problem with my app. I try to post a sell item and my pictures won't load and it's saying I have more pics then I should.,4
19129,"This app is great for buyers, and for just buying things in general, but not so much for sellers. You can't delete any items you sell. Ever. The ONLY way to ""delete"" an item is to archive it, which doesn't do anything except move it elsewhere, so prepare for SEVERE LAGGING. You also can't cancel a sell if someone buys an item you're selling, you just have to wait for it to time out, or for the buyer to cancel it themselves. OfferUp, as an app, is a serious test in patience.",2
19130,Definitely works as it should,5
19131,Horrific app. Have to constantly uninstall and reinstall. Total Joke.,1
19132,OfferUp is not very good too many ads and too many people want something for nothing,1

19141,Amazing App... great bargains...,5
19142,"The messaging system causes app crashes. The ads in between real listings are frustrating and don't match the filters. App needs work, especially because you rely on it to communicate around pickups.",2
19143,when I try to post something it keeps me in a loop. it keeps sending me back to sign in with my email.,1
19144,"I get the ""ka-ching"" chime and most of the time nothing is happening; the app is just interrupting your day to get itself some undeserved attention. Boy who cried wolf, so to speak.",3
19145,Can't log in. Tried everything for over an hour.. passwords... It puts me in a loop!!!,1
19146,"Using on pixel 6pro, since launch, this app runs so bad it's constantly crashing and hardly loads anything, it also makes the phone get hot. It needs a serious update.",1
19147,very happy with this app makes me feel really secure about my purchases and has a variety of products to shop for,5
19148,Slowwww,1
19149,Unable to edit post on desktop. No app download for PC. Filters are slim. Many easy improvements could be made but its clear they do not care.,1
19150,love it watch out for scams.,4
19151,excellent work and great customer service! fair pricing as well!,5
19152,"Tried to post a listing to sell something and it would say posted but it doesn't show up under my selling list or under search. I don't think it even posted, which is a waste of my time.",1
19153,everyone always cones through,5
19154,This app has become unusable. My whole feed is just advertisements for a local business.,1
19155,"Nowadays this app just wanting you to pay no matter. I thought I get 1 free post every months, but nope you have to pay, no free post",1
19156,Poor display/listing the pictures should show the price its just a bunch of pictures with no prices until you click on them most over priced and not worth the time spent opening hate using app bc of this prices should be shown on pic,2
19157,I'm glad I had notifications on it reminded me to un-install this app that is a complete waste of time.,1
19158,tired of looking at 5 year old adds,1
19159,Spongy as hell. Very difficult.,2
19160,can log in anymore,1
19161,"Will not allow me to log on. Continually takes me back to same log on page. I can log on....on my computer but that does not help if I want to post items as all pics are on phone. Plus can't respond to messages quickly since I'm unable to log on. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. By other reviews, this seems to be an issue. For me, it has been over a month.",1
19162,The app won't even let me log in. Everytime I put my info in it brings me back to the login screen again. Deleting this useless app.,1
19163,"This is a very good site, you just have to make sure you are getting what you are looking for. Not everyone is honest, but that can't be controlled by this site. Overall I enjoy purchasing things on this site.",4

19168,"Stuck in a login loop, and can't access any of my messages or items for sale. Missing out on money because of a poorly-made app.",1
19169,I'm adding a second star because they did acknowledge my account was unceremoniously locked out at no fault of my own but a technical error. I only added 1 star because I find it completely ridiculous that the only reason this was resolved was because of my original review. When I tried to inquire about the issue through private channels I was given 1 single copy and paste response and then was promptly ignored for any further communication.,2
19170,so easy a caveman could do it. LOL,5
19171,"Terrible customer service, never respond",1
19172,Get ready to never sell anything unless you want to pay extra for the pro version. I have literally had items brand new on there and never got a response and I was practically giving them away lol ‚ù§Ô∏è.,2
19173,Does anyone have the app freeze some time???????,3
19174,"It was previously working great, then you couldn't add your location, which meant you couldn't list an item. That was fixed, now it's back to not even allowing you to logon with email without cycling back to the login screen. When it does work, it's a great alternative to FB marketplace.",1
19175,"Scams. They should let you comment on the posts, so we can alert other people that the seller is a scammer, today I drove 2 hours to buy something and in the end it was a fake address and the man wanted me to pay him before I arrived , 100% scam, I reported it but the accounthasn'tbeenclosed, if i could comment, people would know that he is a scammer and they would not waste their time like I did",3
19176,"I cannot get into my account, messages or posts",1
19177,Love it but new glitch! The new job feature will open again after to go to any different page even if it's not the job tab you clicked. Like if I go back to my phones home screen then go back to the product I was looking at it will open the jobs tab before I even get the chance to click anything. Please fix. Also don't get notifications about messages anymore!,3
19178,"Wanted to try OfferUp, but I can't even log into my account on the app... I tried logging in using my Google account and the email/password option. Every time I attempt to log in, it doesn't do anything and continues to prompt me to log in... Device: Google Pixel 5; OS: Android 13",1

19181,Update---- Are you guys ever going to fix the messaging bug!!!???? It's been months now and it's still freezing... Constant freezing while trying to message people. Unable to upload images when needed. Has been getting worse over the last month or so. It's really affecting us as sellers. Offer up needs to step up and figure it out.,2
19182,I can't access my profile anymore.,1
19183,The app doesn't let me login anymore. It just keeps reopening the login screen every time I submit my login,1
19184,great app,5
19185,Constantly lqhging and crashing after new update,1
19186,super,5
19187,"Same problem, after this update i can't log in, customer ""support"" isn't helping. My password doesn't work, the ""forgot password"" link doesn't even work. They just ask the same question, 'describe in detail your problem, send screenshot, what version are you using, what operating system.... How about fix your software. I know how to restart my computer.....",1
19188,"It started great... Posted an item and got some traction, then out of nowhere it signed me out and I am trying to sign in but it won't let me, it just refreshes the log in page, intuitively telling me to log in... So I can't back into my account... I believe it might have been an update as it was perfectly beforehand. If you can do anything to help it would be great. Thank you!",2
19189,Messages are not seen when I send. Dealer posts are everywhere; no option to filter. Was a 4 or 5 star app but gone downhill.,1
19190,"Just stopped working, no more messages, no more traffic to my listings... I've logged out, reinstalled, nothing works now. As of 9/30/22 the whole ecosystem has become filled with scammers and their message system is still broken; UNBELIEVABLE",1

19193,"This app worked fine when I first downloaded it. Now I can't even log into my account I have tried unistalling the app, resetting my password. Switching between WiFi a 5G. Restarting the app. Nothing works. I did send an email to them through the online portal they have. Waiting to see if they will respond and resolve the issue. Will see how long it takes them to respond and fix the issues. If and when they respond and fix my issues I will update my review.",1
19194,"Buena app, puedes encontrar lo que buscas en ella. Seguridad, calidad y buen servicio. Chat para comunicarte con el vendedor e informaci√≥n del producto. Le doy 5 estrellas por su buen servicio y utilidad que me fue en su momento.",5
19195,There was once upon a time when you could actually buy and sell things on offer up but that time ended awhile ago.Now this site is a waste of time. Essentially there is no customer service anymore and if you pay to promote your item then your just donating to the greedy creators of this app.Heed my advice and use Mercari or another app unless you have unlimited time to kill and like donating your money. It shows priorities of this company how quick they replied to my review but won't repy n app,1
19196,"Won't let me in my account anymore at all... A stupid bear pops up saying something is wrong, EVERY TIME!!!! üò° I restarted, cleared cache, uninstalled reinstalled, and everything else I could think of and try...

19197,good,5
19198,Offer up has been malfunctioning. I always have trouble posting an image. It doesn't post it instantly you have to come back to it later and try again. Very inconvenient.,1
19199,Bad customer service they close my account because I give them bad review,1
19200,more response than any other sites like this!,5
19201,Please get the app fixed for us this is not fair it is lagging and just not acting right,1
19202,App sucks. Was robbed of $25 cause the app let a buyer return an item without my consent. They got their money back and I never got my item. So ridiculous.,1
19203,"The app is great, easy to use and makes posting items a snap but being a seller of many things, I still haven't sold anything yet.",4
19204,offer up . Real good app,5

19212,almost brand new everything is perfect . thanks,5
19213,No one answers my requests. I dont understand whats up with that. I have inquired about two trundle day beds and Never got any return texts. and its not noted if they have been sold or not. Very upsetting.,2
19214,Exceptional,5
19215,Why can't you download the app on a personal computer?,1
19216,Update‚Äî I was told to clear the cache within the app and restart my phone. Devs just wasted my time as this didnt resolve the issues with Chat. Why isn't there a fix for this already? This is critical. How are you supposed to communicate with your buyers or sellers?,1
19217,App search is not the same as web search on offer up. App is limited,1
19218,me m,4
19219,Last update has screwed the app,1
19220,First time ever downloading and using and I can't make an account or use the app in general. I have a new phone and a solid internet connection so I guess the app is broken currently.,1
19221,not selling anything too long,1
19222,I've been using it OfferUp for a very long time I verify myself via email and phone number and now it's telling me to put my state ID photo which is unacceptable Don't understand why I have to do that as well,1
19223,it's perfect,5
19224,I see OfferUp on Facebook and sometimes we try to click on the free stuff but it never takes us to the free stuff they take us to the page where everything is for sale sometimes I get very aggravated with that I'm not going to give you five stars I'm sorry offer up I just want you to know that you when we click on the free stuff we should be able to look at the free stuff,4
19225,I recently sold a washing machine. It sold the same day I posted the washer. You can't ask for anything better.,5

19228,"I stopped using offerup for a reason.I was able to sell a lot of items, as well as purchase items. My account was still there but I couldn't post anymore and my messages wouldn't be seen anymore. Contacted OfferUp and all the automated machine emails back is that I violated community guidelines but doesn't tell me what is the exact thing I did that they didn't like. My account is now deactivated by them. Sticking to fb marketplace. What a waste of time. To be clear,I didn't post anything illegal",1
19229,App is amazing really helps with getting rid of stuff. üôÇ,4
19230,Great clothing app for individual independent retail sales remotely,4
19231,Very reliable üëè,5
19232,"Once I login it redirects me to the login page, over and over. I had this bug before too but last time the bug went away. Not this time. Tried clearing data, cache, reinstall, reboot, nothing works. It'd be fine if I could post items in the web version but that's only supported on mobile",1
19233,"Seller don't respond. God! You post your stuffs to sell, then you won't respond to buyers.",1

19235,"I'm once again back to say this app is trash. Constantly freezes midway through messaging people, it will crash up while I am browsing the pages. I constantly have to force quit the amp and enter again in order to get the app to start. The latest update really killed this app",1
19236,The first time I used this app I was almost scammed. NOBODY SHOULD EVER USE THIS APP. it is safer to sell bootlegs at Fruitvail Bart at midnight. I would trust my ex would never cheat again before I trust this app.,1

19243,it's cheaper than anything,5
19244,"great app for the most part. I had a generator though stolen after purchasing here and after several attempts to contact customer support to see if they had the transaction records, they were of little help.",4

But some things are still very cumbersome. My biggest complaint is that sellers aren't forced to keep their listings current. So something listed 5 years ago still shows up even though that person deleted the app and no longer is alerted to offers. This needs to change for sure.",1
19254,I wish I could give this application less then 1 star. I have had non stop issues with this app since last Friday and now they have archived my post and are asking me to become a truyou verified member when I cannot even do that because to do that I need to access this app on my phone which I haven't been able to do for a whole week now.

19279,The text box in messages is always hidden behind the keyboard.,3

19286,"App is absolutely useless at this point. I've posted several items over the last few days and not a single one has had a single view. On top of that, when i reach out to people selling i get no responses and my question or or even making a full price offer goes unread. There is something wrong with the app at this point. My phone is up to date. I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled, unfortunately the messages stay unread. I have also had friends look for my items and they do not show up",1
19287,"It seems many people get banned and account disabled without communication of reason. I don't know why my account got disabled and instructions were not helpful. The interaction I had on offerup was someone ghosting me as far as communication goes, and I was not at all unpleasant.",2
19288,Weakass app,1
19289,can't sign in to my account,2
19290,Keeps crashing after putting the used filter on in the furniture,1

19298,best app.,5
19299,Excellent forum to acquire and unacquire items locally or broader areas.,5
19300,contacted a seller about a clothes dryer and got a great deal.,5
19301,Update review 3 years later: what the hell happened to this app? There's such an obvious memory leak issue based on the string of previous reviews. The messaging is completely broken making interaction a non option. Fb marketplace sucks but at least can be used. eBay is trash. This was the good one and still can be if the QA team/engineers get on top of the lag and bloat,1
19302,"It was an okay app, kinda slow and clunky, but it got the job done. In the last couple of weeks though it started randomly opening itself up and popping up while I was using my phone. It's annoying and intrusive. I'm uninstalling it.",1
19303,Latest software update broke something. Login via email is no longer possible. Please fix it.,1
19304,love this app.,5
19305,incredibly unreliable. Frequently can't log in,1
19306,"It a good app, but hate that's its the only app that doesn't show the price in the picture. Secondly, it shows really old ads even though I search for more recent one. They should do it like criaglist, delete ada older than 30 days, I still see 1 year old ads.",3
19307,Easy to use and almost everything you're looking for is on it!,5
19308,Offer up steals money from it's users,1
19309,Great,5
19310,Not able to login to the mobile app.,1
19311,"Ive been a member since 2016. As of Sept 20, 2022 this app has been experiencing some major issues: - unable to upload images - message notification appears, when i go to open it, app says it needs to verify credentials and so it logs me out - I have deleted and re-installed app 10+ times within the last 10 days just to proceed with sales Offerup used to be a MUCH better experience",2
19312,"SCAM BEWARE!!!! Payment taken for item, nothing shipped, no customer service help...",1
19313,Every time this app updates it begins to crash after 10 seconds of use. Can't type a message to anyone longer than a sentence or it crashes. can't look at a page for more than 10 seconds or it crashes. The app used to be great! These updates have ruined it. Update: It's even worse now. The app won't even let me log in. How awful.,1
19314,fastl,5
19315,The latest update is trash guys. You need to fix this because it's absolutely ridiculous that messaging within the app is SO SLOW now. I'm not running a 386 here. This reeks of poor QA cycle and devs who don't even bother to use the app in the first place. The app sucks now and that's a shame. Please fix it.,1
19316,App is laggin bad. I used 2 different devices,2
19317,Always crashes do not get messages freezes. Fix it!!!,1
19318,"Download this app is you want to get scammed, 90% of the items are fraudulent listing, or someone trying to scam you. It's a giant waste of time. And the developers they don't monitor this app. And to top it off, tons of ads.",1
19319,Why are you attempting to track me even when my app is closed? Talk about an invasion of privacy. Thankfully I can block those attempts.,1
19320,I have posted twice and not showing up on my account as listed. Even got email saying it posted.This app is not working. I want to remove my profile and uninstall.,1
19321,I don't get any views like at all.,1
19322,"Installed and registered. Attempted login and it takes me back to the login page, neverending circle.",1
19323,I can't log into my account. I click Account and the login screen slides up from the bottom. I enter the correct credentials but the login screen just slides up again and I'm not logged in. I'm an Android user. This app is ALWAYS broken. I also run into issues that makes me need to abandon the message I typed and start over. I can't reach my buyers right now. Totally locked out.,1
19324,"App keeps refusing my login, but I can log into the web browser version just fine.",1
19325,"It's amazing and all but slow. Takes 30 seconds just for me to load into a chat with someone, post something, or go the the next step in posting something. But still very good.",3
19326,They want to control every aspect of the sale.You cant share phone numbers no matter the amount of the transaction. How can you sell a car to someone for thousands of dollars without speaking to the person first? This app wants people to blindly meet up at a time when crime is at an all time high. Ive gotten flagged and missed out on potential sales because ive shared links to my offer up ads. That is absurd. Ive never used an app like this that wanted to control every aspect of communication.,1
19327,Never could sale nothing gave everything away cheap people want everything free,1
19328,two thumbs up ü§òüèª,5
19329,"I've used offer up or a long time, the new update makes it so slow when trying to search an item while it pulls up your recent searches, like 20 seconds wait before i can look something up it almost a chore trying to search for stuff. I was okay with the ads showing up but this lag has me using the app less and less everyday. Fix it before you kill the app.",1
19330,extremely slow...,2
19331,great app wish it would auto delete old post here I think I found a good deal today posted 2 years ago,4
19332,"Do not install this app. Its full of scammers. They post things at great prices or ""Free"" and ask you to pay for shipping. They delet their accounts after getting shipping costs from as many people as they can. I have reported so many of them and the team has never done anything about them. Scammers have taken over this app. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. Its been over ran by scammers.",1
19333,the best app for selling items,5
19334,"App freezes every time I try to type a message. Must restart literally every few words just to send an in-app text. Terrible Editing to add that I can't login at all, much like the hundreds of other people on here are saying. Same issue for a week, no fix or response from the company.",1
19335,"I like the app, but I keep getting randomly logged out of my account and then am unable to sign back in, even after changing my password",2

19338,The new offer to promote a item When you have 3 day for free to cancel the promotion any time . They lies you don't have any options to cancel they gonna charge no matter ...when you going to cancel the subscription you have to contact customer service then you have to wait until they contact you some many day by @gmail when they already charge that how they scam people,1
19339,"Love the app. My only gripe would be the boards. I love being able to save a bunch of stuff that I'm interested in, but there should be a way to remove multiple items from a board at one time. Having to remove each post one at a time is a pain, and with how quickly things get sold I'm almost doing it every day! Besides that great app! Update 9/26/22: This new update is garbage. App freezes, pages not loading, having to force close multiple times. Please fix this ASAP!",1
19340,Doesnt show price anymore have to click on it just to see price,1
19341,This app has gotten ridiculous. Each day there's some type of technical issue. Can't see your views on item you're selling or can't see the buyer views. Why so many issues.,1
19342,Horrible. Gives me listings no where near me when I tell it local. Why do I want to know whats for sale in flordia when I live in louisiana.,1
19343,Sign in with Google broken. Can't get into account,1
19344,"No views, don't understand what's been going on but app has gone from perfect to completely broken for me",1
19345,Freezes when writing a message.,1
19346,"good app, tons of local motorcycles. which why would you spend your money on anything else?",5
19347,This app now has miscellaneous ads that are annoying at front page...,1
19348,The app was working about 10 days ago but is having log in issues over the past 6 days or so. Deleting cache/storage/resetting did nothing. Many recent reviews of exact same issue but no indicator of any attempt to solve the issue by the developers. Recommend using website until update from developer.,1
19349,"convenient, easy to use.",5
19350,You have to leave a 5 star review if you ever actually sold or bought anything on offerup!,5
19351,My go to site for the great deals! I bought a eletric scooter for 125 bucks. Everywhere else the same scooter ran $299-$399. Always got whatcha looking for at a low price. Great app.,5

19357,App never loads . Just keeps saying something went wrong,1
19358,"Horrible app because it does not show prices along with search results. Something this basic not being implemented makes the app unusable. What a stupid decision, I do not want to look at a bunch of pictures like a Google image search result with more ads.",1
19359,App runs embarrassingly slow,1
19360,"CANNOT BUY ANYTHING Nothing is working. I go to check out and it ask me to verify my card. I've tried front back, low light, tons of lights, flash no flash. Nothing is working. Please change this. Not on iPhone, not on Android. Pc isn't even an option.",1
19361,I love this app its a good replacement for ebay and I did receive my cash from the sales. Unfortunately the only way to contact customer support is using message email. Plus they charge 13%. And an extra fee for promotion if not they restrict the amount shown.,5
19362,"great app, just very very slow",3
19363,"Do not download OfferUp. People on there only look at your Items and don't intend to buy them, even if you're selling At around the same price you originally bought it. This app is stupid. Only cheap people shop here. I'm going elsewhere and getting the word out to not download this app, otherwise people will regret it.",1
19364,This app is slow af and it need to move faster and stop freezing,1
19365,excellent,5
19366,Pay for another vehicle to be posted Check on my wife's offer up and doesn't show that I have anything post it. Costumer service no where to be found ..,1

19378,I'm receiving google adds in my messages and I can't delete the messages. You are overstepping Google! I have a notification set up for new items...I receive notices for items that I saw one or more days prior. SAME exact items. Definitely a programming issues.,1
19379,After last update the app has a terrible delay. Went from a great app to use alot to an app not worth using at all.,2

19383,good option for selling your stuff,5
19384,"I wonder how money the guys how put 5 ‚≠ê they get, or workers from OfferUp put those 5 ‚≠ê, this application is a joke, people use this to playing around, they don't buying nothing, ask a 1000 questions and 0 sell, also too many hackers use this app to get your information and cellular # to sell your # for telemarketing, and people from the app responded the post to keep going and keep the app on and get money from the advertisements from the web",1
19385,very easy to use. my first transaction and no issues,5
19386,Getting really irratated that I can't turn off the push notifications for recommendations. Even though I've turned it off in my preferences it keeps popping up on my phone. Fix your annoying app please. I don't need to know what's recommended for battery's or fans when I looked one time. Thanks.,1
19387,"App asks to scan your card when you want to buy something to verify it, but always fails, even when it recognizes that the card info matches. Website is no help, since it wants you to use the app to verify the card.",1
19388,Unusable. I can't even make a purchase because I can't scan a card.,1
19389,"Offer up is occasionally good to buy and to sell items, but there are many flaky people that never follow up or make extremely low offers.",2
19390,It never got to post anything that I have posted not sure if app works,1
19391,The offerup support is the worst support you can ever imagine. You post something not even close to the prohibited items and they delete it. So when you come to question them about it they just deactivate your account and obviously just because they feel like not answering you they just deactivate your account.,1
19392,"Offerup was once the best selling/buying app. But after merge with Letgo it was very obvious, and is to this day, that the programmers behind the worse app ever (letgo - known for constant glitches, malfunctions and subpar function are still working for Offerup). Every so-called update is to ""improve"" function, speed and fix issues but they don't. The updates are simply changes to add additional advertising, which ironically slows down the apps function.",2
19393,Horrible app constant bugs,1
19394,I use this to sell and it is very easy to post and manage items.,5
19395,App works good but getting paid through offerup takes weeks sold item on 2nd delivered on 6th and today the 15th and money still not in my account. There is no way to contact a real person by phone. Sell locally and get cash dont rely on their payment system. Update: Still have not got paid by offer up gave them bank account number and 4 different debit cards and they said they cannot deposit into any of them or send me a check. They have $180 of my money. Dont deal with them.,3
19396,Had the app for a while and suddenly I can't log in. When I put in my user name and password it takes me back to the previous screen. I have tried a few things but have had no luck.,1
19397,"Way too many ads and app is unstable. Crashes after just a few minutes. Also missing some very key features. The inability to save your preferred search type and radius is infuriating. I only ever want to see local pickup and items within 10 miles, but it defaults to 30 miles and local + shipping. Also listing never having a expiration is terrible. Half the time I contact someone I turns out the listings a year old and they just never deleted it.",1
19398,Can't see while typing message. Stupid,2
19399,App not working,3
19400,the app shows u text late,3

19402,Unable to log in since 2 weeks.,1
19403,"This app was working great for me for a while. I've sold a few items, and I actually prefer this to FB Marketplace. But lately I can't even sign into the app. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled, restarted my phone, and reinstalled, and the app just continually prompts me to login in, no matter how many times I enter my credentials. Disappointing.",2
19404,"When I had LetGo I made local sells almost every day, haven't been able to sell one thing with OfferUp, not locally and not shipping! And I market my items very well and at excellent prices! I'm sure I'm not the only one, we want LetGo back!",1
19405,"Uses too much space on your phone. I did a recent search of my apps and discovered OfferUp was using 19GB. That's ridiculous! Also, so tired of the app spying on my web searching activity, so the app can market items to me. And finally, the app needs to get rid of the preprogrammed button, ""Hi, is this still available?"" So many people hit that button, only to NEVER even read your ""yes"" response! Why ask if you're not even willing to check your messages??!!",2
19406,Difficult to just load ads by phone only,3
19407,good app but slow response from the server,4
19408,The app runs very slow and when typing app will freeze and have to restart the app.,3
19409,I'm an appliance technician. I buy sell and repair for a living and offer up was awesome for years foe selling my products. But now the appliance section is overrun with a local liquidation company that spams hundreds of ads everyday.. making impossible for buyers to view my ads. I don't mind going up against other sellers. But this company even says in their posts that the inventory and prices in store don't match what is posted on offer up. Just a scam to get you into the store!!!,1
19410,It's great. Easy to use.,5
19411,Terrific ap! Let's see what things we got and dho busyness!,5

19425,I have posted a million things and no one is seeing them?? So I'm trying to figure out how to contact OfferUp and get in touch with anyone... I'm completely varified on the App as well....HELP,3
19426,I had offer up once before and posted some items on there that sat for weeks. I finally decided to delete them and remove the app. So today i tried again as I have a few more items that i felt may have sold better and somehow while I havent been using the app I violated community guidelines and im unable to log in or post anything.

19432,way too many dealers...,3
19433,I've been using the app for years now. Lately it's very laggy or slow. When I'm trying to send or see my message or looking up my saved notifications. Most of the functions are just unresponsive or that take a while to load. It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or network. When messaging the keyboard overlaps so you can't see what your message is saying. I'm on a Samsung Note 20 plus 5g. Can anyone recommend anything to fix this issue?,1
19434,"Used to be great. But its become incredibly slow w/frequent crashes. BUT the real problem is the terms stated, yet when you report something, even illegal they do nothing about it.. For instance somebody is selling alcohol, I have reported it 20+ times and they've done nothing. Not only is it against their terms, it's also HIGHLY against the law. I have a teenage daughter, and this is worrisome to see how easily they could buy alcohol. This is how easy Offerup makes it for kids to get alcohol.",2
19435,OfferUp is really freaking out on my phone I can't use it I don't know what's going on can you please uninstall your app and then reinstall it I can't figure out how to do it I keep trying and it gives me the runaround,4
19436,"I registered an account, verified my email and phone number, and listed two items to sell. My items straight up disappeared, not even shown on my own page. I wasn't notified they disappeared. I wasn't told my items were being reviewed. I wasn't asked to do more to verify my account. Nothing. I even gave the platform the benefit of the doubt and waited for 18 hours to see if my items would reappear. No, they did not. This app has earned my one-star rating.",1
19437,better responses from people just as it says and everything functions fine on this app,5
19438,Its ok it was better years ago,3

19451,can use it without a high dollar telephone a PC windows version would replace Craigslist in one month,1
19452,This app stopped working after a week. I can't view my messages of materials I'm trying to sell. My TruYou application ask for photo id but claims it's blurry after 20 attempts. Why can't someone manually review my application. I'm trying to contact someone but there is no resource available.,2

19468,I can't log in and so I have no access to my account. I also wasn't offered any real solution.,1
19469,offerUp needs to delete all posts after 6 months because of all the people that don't take down or delete after the item is sold. if they haven't sold the item they can repost it.,2
19470,Really good experience.. I sold a car. A month ago.,5
19471,Doesn't load on Android 13 Pixel,1
19472,It's a buying/selling app that's not full of B.S. Need one like this for adult classifieds,5
19473,This app is a very slow seller I don't know why they took down let go it had a lot more features for the sellers this app sucks but it is what it is though,5
19474,"When it works its great but in the last update the app has completely locked me out. I can see notifications of people wanting to buy my things but when I sign in, it glitches and sends me right back to the sign in menu as if I hadn't just inputted my information. Support is no help. They are a series of auto responses with generic fixes that don't help. If you look this up online many people are experiencing the same thing. Do yourself a favor and use Facebook marketplace or Mercari.",1
19475,"YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT TRY TO SCAM BY PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT, GIVING A FALSE ADDRESS, PRODUCT NEVER RECEIVED SO YOUR MONEY IS BASICALLY SITTING THERE FOR MONTHS AND YOUR ITEM IS SITTING AT POST OFFICE UNDELIVERABLE. SO BASICALLY THEY TRY TO COLLECT ON INSURANCE MONEY THRU EITHER THE APP. WITH SOMEONE WORKING INSIDE COLLUDING. MY PAYMENT IS STILL PENDING AND I MOVED SO I WASN'T ABLE TO RECEIVE THE PRODUCT! CUSTOMER SERVICE DIDN'T DO A THING TO HELP, if this happened to you put a 1 star!!",1
19476,Can no longer add images to my post. App updates need serious QC before release. Response to dev response: Tried all suggestions including clearing app data. Still not working.,1
19477,"Great concept for quick selling. Wishlist: 1. Auto capitalization on the first word in a sentence in the ad description. 2. Spell-check. 3. Ability to cut/copy and paste text or images from one dialogue with a buyer to another for quick repeat of answers so that I don't have to re-type the same message. 4. Please don't allow sex and pornographic/sexually revealing ads to fill this great site. It's offensive to see women in seductive lingerie all over the place. Otherwise, it is a useful app.",4
19478,"super buggy app. entire days where I could not log in or post using the android app, though my account works well on the website. I tried clearing the app's cache, restarting my phone, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app without luck. Can log-in just fine from iOS devices.",2
19479,Offe d s RegreT butt no one responds,3
19480,they won't no longer let me shop around due to not having an active phone number due to financial issues I'm only able to browse around when I have wifi I was able to shop on offer about a month ago but not anymore so they suck now üëé.,1
19481,multiple times now won't allow me to message anyone contact customer service and nothing,1
19482,Keeps crashing.,2
19483,I post items to sell but they never appear!,1
19484,this app is awesome it's sent me to everything I've searched for up to date,4
19485,Rediculous pricing structure,2
19486,Listen there's Interesting items and good deals but the amount of sellers who are unresponsive is a pain. I've purchased items and it's a game of cat and mouse to get any response from the sellers. So beware. Yall need to remove accounts that haven't been active for months.,2
19487,Great selling app. Just wished the promote + subscription would allow 2 items to be promoted instead of one.,4
19488,Great to find items but continually freezing in the messages section of the app.,1
19489,"for some reason I cant get photos attached. it shows what ive selected, but doesnt carry over and wont let me proceed. ive uninstalled and reinstalled. and restarted, still do want work. every upset because this is where I sell everything",2
19490,Used to be better. Now no one really checks it out much,2
19491,"I'm not able to log in to the app at all! When I try it just sits there like it's trying and then it redisplays the log in options. However, I can log in via the website. So there is definitely an issue with the app. Also, before a response of reinstalling the app, deleting cache, deleting user data and rebooting the cellular device, I have done this numerous times with the same end results of not being able to log in to the app. Copied the recent review as I have the same issue.üò©",1
19492,Chat not working and crashes app. At some point I got logged out and can't even log back on. Has an endless loop of login screens. Uninstalled at this point.,1
19493,Not getting any sells,1
19494,Most recent update broke google authentication. I can't even log in. The app is generally really buggy. Messaging freezes all the time. Trying to sell a car and it only would let me post 1 picture. I wish there was another option.,1
19495,"Can't log into the app anymore. Had issues in the past where the app would sign me out and give an error that wouldn't let me sign in. I'd have to clear the cache to sign back in. Now I can't sign in at all, the login prompt reappears after trying to sign in. Clearing the cache did nothing, reinstalling did nothing.",1
19496,"Offers Up is the quickest, most reliable and efficient to turn your excess into cash. Clean out your cupboards, closets, garage .....and make a few bucks too. It's a hoarders delight",5
19497,It is a slow site especially for messaging.,4
19498,"Terribleüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª2years later and again you disable my account with no warning üò§ I have a good seller/buyer reputation and you accuse me of ""violating guidelines"" with no warning, no email, no explanation about what ""violation"". What is Going On? I had people ready to buy my items and you do this!!",1
19499,Awesome,5
19500,It's really slow now I hate it üñï,1
19501,"I don't know what happened with the new update,but it needs to get fixed ASAP..I updated the app last night and today I wanted to see what new offers there were..As the app is loading,a message stating""OfferUp is not responding"" shows and leaves me with no choice but to close the app..Tried multiple times with same result..Had I known this would happen,I would have left it alone..",1
19502,Literally crashes my phone when I open this. Unusable. Absolutely unexcusable.,1
19503,"This app is so buggy,, I'm trying to log in with my Google account and once I click connect there's a see through box that comes down as if the page has closed and I'm still at the sign in,, also keeps on logging me out.",1
19504,"can't upload my photos from the phone gallery. have to log out from the app, restart phone and still sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. this feature needs to be fixed!",2
19505,great app place to wonder around great page.,5
19506,Keeps crashing after freezing up. Not good.,1
19507,Letgo was so much better. Offeeup is garbage and full of ads.,1
19508,Way too many people who waste time and don't follow through. Or they're bots trying to scam,1
19509,I rarely use this app. It is pushing notifications even though I have notifications turned off. Uninstalling.,1
19510,"1.No custom shipping options? I have a large item that will cost $40-130(depending on location) but the largest preset only wants to charge my customers $12. Thanks for the useless shipping feature. 2. Chat feature breaks everytime I try to talk to someone 3. No confirmation prompt for cancelling offers. Asked to update payment info, so all I did was hit my back button and BAM cancelled my order for no reason. Thank you for screwing me over",1
19511,the phone was reported lost or stolen. I wanted a refund.,1
19512,can't get on the app and their customer service just doesn't want to talk but only thru email rather than one on one. So how can you resolve a problem correctly if you can't explain it to them personally??!!,1
19513,"used to be a great app but since they merge with ""letgo"" these app suck's, bunch of annoying adds and you always look same items from previous searches!!",1
19514,"Sellers never respond to my offers to buy or to my questions. Not their fault. The technology that should enable 2-way communication simply does not work. My message shows as ""delivered"" in my inbox. Only one of the 25+ messages I've sent are ""seen"". It's incredibly frustrating. I'm not here to window shop. I'd actually like to buy, but this app has been a huge waste of time. I've had a much better experience on Facebook Marketplace. I upgraded the app on 9/20 to the latest version, same issue.",1
19515,overpriced junk,1
19516,"Seller beware! After being a 5 star seller on this app for 2 years, my account was banned for selling modded devices and hackable fire sticks..WHICH I NEVER SOLD! I keep asking support to look further into this because I think they made a mistake but they are unwilling to help! Such a shame! Just know that if you sell on this platform, your account can be banned for any made up reason at any time!",1
19517,The app does not work constantly crashes. I cannot log in from my phone to sell. I can log in online now but I can't sell,1
19518,Great place with great value,5
19519,This app is amazing there is so much instead of buying stuff from the store u offer,5
19520,App has been really glitchy since last two updates. Ever since they started charging for ad promo my viewership on items have dropped probably because they flood everything with ads nowadays. Their pricing model for ads is worse compared to eBay or FBMP & not customizable.,1
19521,Updates always mess this app up none stop. Every time I post an item it shows no views but I type up my item it shows it in postings. But I ain't getting any messages witch I know I get them fast. What is going on im getting sick of this.,1
19522,Letgo should never have teamed up with these looserz. This app sucks in every way pissible,1
19523,8/22 update. It lags extreamly bad loading into it and thru the replys as your going along. Its awful if not worse. No update to help its lag either. We need a new developer to make a selling app like this but one they wont just slack off on. Im here but lost so much do too poor app funstions. .,1
19524,great way to buy and sell locally!,5
19525,Updated review: For some reason this hasn't allowed me to list items. I make my listing it says it is posted then when I click on it it says its been deleted. I have contacted customer service get no one gets back to me. Easy to sell items. Needs to add ability to rate people who set up a time to purchase and don't show up and don't bother to say they changed their mind. About 90% of messages are from people who ask to buy then don't follow up about a time or don't bother to show up.,1
19526,Account deactivated without explaination. I am unemployed and selling my things to make some sort of money. Why is this happening?,1
19527,good place to look for bargains,4
19528,App is having issues not showing how many views .. it lost them...idk if my products are being viewed,2
19529,"I have not able to post items for over 2 weeks. I can not compete adding my photos. I have reported the a number of times.. keep getting the same ""canned"" response.",1
19530,"Won't let me add pictures! I'm trying to post an item but can't complete it because it won't add the pictures I select, I tried taking the pictures in the app and that didn't work either!!!! It won't let me post it from the computer so I guess I will post it else where",2
19531,Makes you verify your card payment through the camera (why?? No other app makes you do this??) And then it never works and you can't actually buy anything,1
19532,offer up the best,5
19533,Nobody responds anyone else have this issue,1
19534,Can't sign in anymore. Just keep getting the sign in screen even though the auth succeeds.,1
19535,üòª‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇü§£üòªüòÑ,2
19536,App went down hill has more ads than listing. If I could upload screen shots I would.,1
19537,App is freezing up,1
19538,good condition just what I was looking for,5
19539,not reliable to display inbox notifications. otherwise an ok app to sell or buy used items,2
19540,waiting to be able to sign support very slow,2
19541,can't post pics,2
19542,It won't allow me to login even though it recognizes my login credentials. It flashes the home page and returns to the login page. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app.,1
19543,"Posted a few things and got mostly messages from people who stop responding or never show up. Out of nowhere my account was disabled. Opened a new account, posted a few things and have had 0 views on the items, giving me the impression they want me to pay for the service. Pretty lame.",1
19544,Nothing sells,1
19545,marginal reliability and ability to post. Too many bottom feeder buyers even when you indicate price is Firm.,3
19546,This app used to be quicker to post ... Now its slow and cumbersome ... Ever since they merged with letgo and upgraded the app it has been super slow! But I still like the app!,4
19547,Can't type more than a line at a time in chat before it freezes. Not getting notifications. Many low-ballers. Posting and editing is slow. Can't just browse prices - you need to click into an item. Constant log-in issues. How can you mess up something this badly? Really disappointing. It didn't used to suck.,1
19548,have trouble loading pics,2
19549,I haven't had good luck with this app. People just post items and if you are interested in the item they never respond to your message. Why even sell anything on here if you aren't going to follow thru.,2
19550,Horrible app takes a week to open it very slow garbage needs major work just use marketplace instead,1
19551,Noone ever buys anything,1
19552,Everything if the don't have a lot of money to spend. It will definitely help with your purse strings.,5
19553,"Messages are broken, login is broken. Previously would lose all account data and require a complete reinstall. Now it just doesn't work.",1
19554,Updated app recently and has 2 days crashing and is very frustrating not able to use app without it closing,1
19555,New version crashes constantly can't acces code to update phone number,1
19556,I have gotten several items via this app. Sellers and buyers are always friendly. kind of like one big flea market.,5
19557,"The app is so slow, it's a pain to use. I love OfferUp, but the app gets worse with every update.",2
19558,"Sometimes it's freeze when I'm typing and can't receive and send messages, then I have to install the app again. It's so annoying! Now I can't even login with my Google account.",2

19560,"Now app not let me up load picture ,so I can't put Post for sale",1
19561,love everything,5
19562,did have any one inquire about it.,1
19563,Auth is broken. Both Google and email based login methods failed. Terrible first experience.,1
19564,It crashes constantly.,1
19565,Idk wat to think,5
19566,Great for budget buying and selling.,5
19567,"(0 Star) use market place or CL. The app is full of bots, scammers and ADs... the app crashes a decent amount and you have to sort through junk from across the country (even if you put a small radius)",1
19568,Slow app.,1
19569,A little glitchy but over all good,3
19570,App won't allow me to sign into my account,2
19571,I love this app but one thing you guys should do is delete posts that are 2 years or older. Or have the seller confirm that the item is still for sale or if they are still active on offerup. For example a seller selling a skateboard that has been up for 2 years should get a notification that they can confirm that they are still selling it and if not offerup will automatically delete the post it so the app wont be flooded with old posts with non responsive sellers.,4
19572,L A G!!!!!!! FIX THIS. I LOVE THIS APP BUT THE LAG RUINS IT,1
19573,Slow and my customer's messages are not arriving live. A lot of delay. It used to be a good market place app now not so much,1
19574,I just wish people that are selling things would get back to others after someone is asking about an item for sell.,5
19575,Trash,1
19576,Very good,5
19577,"Keeps telling me, ""Sorry, something went wrong"" every time I open the app",1
19578,OFFERS UP HAS BEEN SUCH A GREAT PLACE TO BUY AND SELL.REALLY LOVE THESE GUYS!!!,5
19579,Slowest out of all the apps on my phone.,3
19580,"I've been using this app for a few years now since when it was letgo. There are lots of bugs in the app. Sometimes it would get very laggy when sending messages, and I've also had issues signing into my account. Would be a great app if all the bugs were fixed",2
19581,"Horrible app to sell things on. 90% of the time it's low-ballers, scammers, bots, or people who inquire about your item and then stop responding altogether for no explicable reason. Sellers rarely reply to questions either. Not worth it. Go to literally any other selling platform instead.",1
19582,I haven't been able to login into the app at all for the past month,1
19583,search results are not always what I'm searching for. whole layout is difficult to see as pictures are so small. so many time wasters that just say is this available and after a reply never contact you back... even if it's an oops.,1
19584,I love having the app but I've lost money because for some reason the mailing labels never come then it runs out I've already sent the item I lose the money for the item then I lose the money for the sale and then I pay to ship it so I pay them to take it this has happened two times to me,1
19585,I love this easy to operate app. no confusion to deal with.,5
19586,"The app will give me errors about reading my messages or viewing my account settings, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and it works. Until the same issue happened again, and now I can't even login anymore.",1
19587,"Offer is an effective app to use, once you have downloaded your information people will connect with you when you're a seller. I have had four good experiences and one bad experience with offer up. It's fast and simple to use.!",4
19588,Laggy as hell and crashes when exchanging messages. App occasionally throws an error message when trying to view profile/messages/sell and does not allow one to log out to log back in? Only way to fix has been un then reinstalling the app. Now it won't log me in at all.,1
19589,didn't show up. finally gave me a phone number. didn't answer. they called back and sounded like on meth. Said phone was dead. please be aware. trailer was probably not theirs.,5
19590,this seller was more than generous and super informational. replied in a timely manner and helped me transport my purchase. everything was smooth sailing üòá,5
19591,"The app rarely works. It notified me of a buyer for my product for sale yet it won't let me log in. Not the first time, as a matter of fact there are issues every time with this app. They need to get their act together",1
19592,"Offerup removed my account without reason! I had 184 positive reviews 5-star. I didn't post anything prohibited! Send them email and never received answer. They have a lot of scammers at this platform, but they deleted a good customer. Awful support center.",1
19593,ridiculous offers for your goods. not worth the ti.e to post here. constantinf receiving notications for stuff im not interested in and it doesn't stop. I am going to close my account by the end of the month if these notication don't stop.,1
19594,"Huge flaw letting anybody create and post items for shipping only without them confirming any payment details, this app is swarmed with scammers!!! Posting these amazing deals on iphones, drones,etc.. even after they get banned they just create another acount. Why not implement payment confirmation?? If they sell to ship they have to accept payment somehow?? Really offerup think about it.. just look for ur self and buy iphone14 for $500 lmaooo",1
19595,"Posted 3 things for sale, within a couple hours all moved to archive and no longer listed (not my doing!). I sent an email to offer up asking them to unarchive (I tried but it gives an error message) but NO response after multiple days. Stay away....",1
19596,The app is terrible now whatever happened in the last update was terrible,1
19597,Now that I am complaining it will probably take longer to connect to a person that is interested in my item when they click on I respond and it takes more than 30 seconds one time my timed it as 1 minute before I could respond to my customer when it was let go went right there what's the problem I see you don't have good reviews is it because you want me to pay money I will pay you a monthly fee just give me the speed to connect to the customer that is interested in my items,1
19598,I love that it gives you previews on the items.,5
19599,For some reason after the update i can't even see how many views my items have. Even when i pull up each individual item it says 0 views.,3
19600,Constant freezing and account issues since the most recent update have rendered the app more or less unusable.,1
19601,I absolutely love offer up. I've been using for years now and have sold tons of items. The app makes it simple to sell as well as shop. It's easy to navigate and when selling posting is quick and painless. Only complaint I have is the app is slow. Thought at first it was my device but Ive found it slow on all devices I've tried. But 5 stars no problem. Keep up the good work.,5
19602,"It's mostly bots. This app and others use bots to inflate the view count to get you to sign up for their premium service. It is quite literally, if not legally a scam.",1
19603,I had brand new stuff on your site and they found it in ethnic so I will never never use your site again and I will spread it around to my friends in Hollywood Florida and Fort Lauderdale Florida and Pembroke pines Florida,1
19604,Offer up is great all there is for home tools toys furniture crafts cars and home for sale bargain.So the new app is kind of a problems can't send text and can't post or add pictures why,2
19605,Great discount finds and easy to apply search filters... Very Nice!.,4
19606,App you can trust,5
19607,The app is not letting me upload more than one picture right now it's very annoying,1
19608,very decent app of course could improve in ways but also doesn't need to improve all in other ways as if any app for at least satisfied,3
19609,"With all of the changes, the app is not as good as it used to be. We are limited to what we can post. The app is full of scams and we can't find good gigs anymore. The job portion of the app is lame/a joke. No we don't want to drive our personal cars for a company. Give us real jobs that helps the community not big corporations that keep the moms and pops shop down. The app needs to give the user the freedom to post modern job. Jobs that help with metal, suicide prevention, cyberbulling, etc...",1
19610,I really love Opera I'm not just saying that but I do it's a great page so I can sell all my stuff,5
19611,I can't even post any photos of the items any more it just keeps glitching out,1
19612,Messaging buyer/seller stops working and very annoying.,5
19613,App keeps freezing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
19614,"Apps not working, is not letting me click on anything. It's WAY too slow",1
19615,Use Facebook marketplace! This app is slow and admin obviously doesn't care hence so many reviews critical of the same issues. Right at this moment pictures won't upload! Horrible horrible horrible product.......update 6 days later still no fix and photos won't load.,1
19616,IM SAD TO SAY I WAS SO HAPPY WITH THIS APP TO SELL ITEMS BUT NOW FOR 2 DAYS STRAIGHT I CAN'T POST ANYTHING TO SELL WITH ZERO VIEWS. THE APP ITSELF HAS BEEN HAVING GLICHES THAT I'VE SEEN . FOR NOW IM JUST GONNA HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM HERE UNTIL THIS IS FIXED.,1
19617,great app,5
19618,"Too much spam, I'd like to be able to block accounts that are spamming posts. Barely see second hand items, 90% of my search shows posts from resellers and stores at full price which is not what I'm looking for",1
19619,Will not let me add photos to the posting so I can't post anything anymore. Worked fine a couple of days ago,1
19620,Good experience,5
19621,Having technical issues and can't sell anything until I put in my tax information which it won't let me do. Can't get a hold of customer service and I have lost sales!!!!!! 2 days still waiting for technical support to get back to me!!!! Day 3 now I'm locked out of my account!!!,1
19622,"pretty unusable recently, keeps crashing in the middle of typing messages. Restarting the phone, clearing the cache and reinstalling the app had no effect.",1
19623,"Absolutely horrible app in comparison to LetGo .. no expired listings, so I am looking at things from years ago and people aren't even active anymore. No way to block an annoying user, filters are terrible, overloaded with ads, etc",1

19627,Wont load pictures when trying to sell.. Keeps crashing. This is ridiculous.,1
19628,"This app is so buggy, it crashes a lot, and gets really slow, and chews up your battery. It dropped 20% in 10 minutes after opening the app. Also, this is no longer like a 'garage sale' app. It's just another monetized advertising bot. Avoid! Uninstalling. 12/21/21 This app seems to be way too oversaturated now. I don't know if it's because it became too popular, or more so because of all the outside ads, like from Amazon. If I wanted to buy on Amazon, I would go to Amazon.",1
19629,I sell alot of motorcycle parts. You're only aloud one free posting in the motorcycle category per month. Selling an entire motorcycle I understand a fee. isn't ideal but I get it. But now I have no where to post my motorcycle parts besides powersports or automotive. Can you add a motorcycle parts category?!? üôèüôè,3
19630,Allot of scammers and payment system doest work correctly!,1
19631,Great variety,4
19632,"I've been trying for 2 days to add pictures to my new posts. Ridiculously frustrating. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

19634,keyboard breaks on this app every time. only on this app,1
19635,Fair,3
19636,This whole platform is filled with constant scammers and flaky or shady people who message you about offers and then stop responding while trying to finalize deals. I had a horrible experience 2 years ago and was desperate to sell some things before moving and the first message I got was a known google verification scam. Either figure out how to get rid of scamners or get in another business. This platform is horrible and I will never be back.,1
19637,"My apps has months not working, I have send messeges to sellers, and they i guess can't see them, it just says deliver, like 5 diffefent sellers and same thing, I have check my cell setting and everything is okay. Dont know what yo do?.",1
19638,I liked it with out the promoted adds.but still cool my favorites have Tobe the free stuff.,3
19639,Current version doesn't allow posting of any kind. Pics won't load in the post section. You can select them but they won't be added. I can make a video. This is nothing compared to the slug speed of the actual user interface. I'm sure many more people would use this app if the UI simply just worked. Why does this app exist other than ads spam? Need programmers? I'm on irc @ Twisted net #twisted,1
19640,"App works, but it says ""ship product within three business days"" but then only gives you two business days. Lame.",3
19641,"I'd consider myself an ""average/light"" user. Installed, verified myself, need to sell like 4 things. After 2 days I got error messages when trying to post, can't access my account, can't respond to people wanting to buy my stuff. Reinstalled, and it glitches to login screen every time I submit my login. BROKEN APP. Oh, but I get the email adds/spam just fine.",1
19642,The app is broken. I can not post anything. It will not upload my photos. I have uninstalled and reinstalled & still have the same problem on Android LG Velvet phone.,1
19643,App doesn't load pictures when you are trying to sell an item and messages do not come through from potential buyers until it hours later.. waste of time trying to take time to post when it won't let you go to next page and refuses to download your pictures for the items.. so much potential! Update: I logged out and deleted the app and redowbloaded and logged in again. I am still unable to load any pictures to offer anything.,1
19644,This app is always freaking slow so freaking annoying,1
19645,It's the new Craigslist. This app sucks dirty butthole,1
19646,"Too many scammers, too many spammers with commercial sales. And the notification settings for the app suck. UPDATE: Lost another star because I can't scroll for a bit before the app closing out and messaging buyers/sellers glitches a lot!",2
19647,excellent,5
19648,Can't even log in the app.,1
19649,really cool,5
19650,Fix your app I can post anything to sell the pictures don't let me post plz fix,1
19651,awesome app. just be careful there is a lot of scammers on here. But offer up does protect your funds and will give you a 2 day refund and or if product wasn't as described they will protect you then also....so it is worth a try ....,5
19652,Offer up is worthless junk now considering how everything is sold by dealer scammer never by a owner.,1
19653,"App was working ok, now I can't log in. I can log in via the website no problem with same credentials. Just a flawed app making it unusable.",1
19654,Good I find nice stuff,5
19655,THIS IS MY TO GO WHEN I NEED TO SELL ITEMS BUT CAN U EXPLAIN WHY I CAN EDIT PICTURES. I ADD PICTURES ANS PICTURES DONT SEEM TO ADD. I KNOW THERE WAS AN UPGRADE YESTERDAY BUT ITS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING WHEN I CAN ATTACH A PICTURE.,3
19656,"I don't like this app anymore.. used to be easy to use, but since OfferUp and LetGo are together this app is not easy to navigate, don't have button or option (unless you want to pay) for bumping your item on the top of the list. Lately app is not working properly, I can't list any item, can't attach any pictures üòï",1
19657,crashes constantly. won't load my account anymore,1
19658,App stays freezing up for more than a month.,3
19659,This is the best selling app to use ever! Out of them all with my long esperance with different ones u want to make some cash for you items you no longer want ?! Do not throw em out . Post them local or shipping buyers all over are looking to buy new and used items you think would never put your time in to post to sell and watch it sell depending on what it is quick too but some one will take ownership of unwanted items . One flaw!! This app runs to slow!!! Or I'd give it 5 stars if wasn't slow!,4
19660,recently it has gotten very slow slow slow,1
19661,"This app is a nightmare, never works properly.",1
19662,Can't upload pictures. Tried dozen times only able to upload few pics for one item. Other item only got one picture. S22 ultra. Please fix this.,1
19663,Was working fine now I cant upload pictures,2
19664,"Very easy to sell and buy, I love",5
19665,great all around! thank you!,5
19666,"I miss Letgo. This app is buggy and they dont care to fix it and make it user friendly. Bring LETGO Back. OfferUp sucks and is complicated to use. This app needs alot of cleaning up and organizing, and the green color is ugly and depressing.",1
19667,This app doesn't save my location settings. I hate having to put local everytime I get into the app. It always chooses local plus shipping. Also hate when typing a message. I can't see the body of the message.,2
19668,Notifications of messages do not appear. There are only preferences for to edit for notifications of newsletter and searches etc nothing on a sellers option point.,1
19669,good app for found everything do you want,5
19670,App no longer let's you add pictures on Android phone,1
19671,"SLOW. The app is slow since adding Letgo. So annoying. Please fix that issue. And its still slow as of 9.19.22. Took forever to upload a picture as well. Even after closing out, and restarting my phone.",3
19672,"Is it me or I don't see ""dodge""(car maker) as an option in the vehicle area",4
19673,easy money üí∞ü§ë,5
19674,the best app,5
19675,Having some issues posting items to sell and uploading pictures to add for the post. But otherwise everything is great üëç.,4
19676,Having problems downloading pics,1
19677,"Unfortunately, it glitches from the beginning: I've tried to listed some electronics and my items were removed without any notifications. Repeated several times more - no luck. Removed this app and switched back to Facebook Marketplace and eBay.",1
19678,App has been laggy lately with the updates made for searching. Just trying to search has a delay when typing in words. When at home I just use the desktop because it has no issues. Fix the app.,1
19679,"Ever since I updated my phone to android 13 beta, OfferUp and OfferUp only keeps crashing. It happens generally when I and trying to type a message for someone, it will freeze mid type and eventually fill in the rest of what I typed but sometimes I have to press the wait button when the message to close or wait comes up. I have found 0 help online about it. It's making it almost impossible to use the app. Very frustrating to say the least.",3
19680,I love Offer Up!!,5
19681,App is not allowing to select picture to post so i connot proceed with posting items. Re installed same issues,3
19682,Won't let me sign up,1
19683,"It's not working, it does not let me post pictures, I select my pictures but it doesn't work.",1
19684,"The new update doesn't allow multiple photos to be posted. It allow you to select them, but then it doesn't actually upload them when you hit done. I already tried clearing the cache and restarting the phone as suggested in other reviews.",1
19685,"App is generally useful but the keyboard covers the typing field so you can't read what you're typing, it drives me insane. Please investigate, thanks.",3
19686,"fix your app can't even upload photos so it won't let me post , worthless app",1
19687,App use to work Fine Now dosnt let me pose anything whats going on with the App???,1
19688,Never know what you might find whilst helping out your neighborhood people's and lessening the input on adding more rubbish to the landfills & recycling centers$ in a town near you.,5
19689,I am not able to post any pictures. Therefore I cannot actually make a post. Will update this review when problem is fixed. I have emailed customer support with no response.,1
19690,Slowest app ever simply clicking from 1 thing to another take So damn long this app is terrible stick to fb market,1
19691,"Frustrating app. Worked for quite a while. Now it won't let me select photos from my gallery when posting. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Logged out and back in. Restarted phone. None fixed the issue. I can use the app to take photos, but that's a waste of time if you've already taken pics. The help contact option is useless. Keeps telling me my email address is invalid (its not), so it wont let me submit my problem. Found their 1-844 #, but no pick up. Website is private, so no go there.",1
19692,love this APp top notch all the time.,5
19693,"Won't let me upload rite, bunch of pointless notifications, and very cheap customer based",2
19694,They keep deleting my page for silly reasons very frustrating,1
19695,Best app to buy or sale,5
19696,I've found some great deals using it and easily sold stuff too!,5
19697,Great prices!!!,5
19698,The app use to be good but can't attach any photos when trying to sell something. Deleted account,1
19699,You get the app all set up you're going along buying selling that's selling things and all of a sudden they decide what you put on there isn't something that should be even though it's just like other items just got maybe different words in it and then they deactivate you and you lose everything that you had listed even after being on the app for over a year really sucks. They do not even check it out for example a set of pocket knifes that are collectable is a bad thing but bowie knifes are ok,1
19700,"Its still doesnt let me post or even let me message people to buy items from them,/messaging isnt working,post items isnt working",3
19701,"Horrific. They delete your account, won't tell you why. Customer service won't respond. You put in the effort to get started and wipe lose e everything before you get anyone to contact you. They ask for way too much person protected information that is not necessary for meetup sales in public places. Stick to ebay. In 20 years zero issues. With this issues within the first week, twice.",1
19702,App keeps freezing. I can't even add images to my sell posts. I need to constantly restart my phone or the app and sometimes it still doesn't work. The app will also sometimes just freeze when I'm typing mid sentence. I didn't have any issues until recently and it's been a very frustrating experience.,1
19703,"Having issues My pixel 6a running android 13 will not load the photos from my phone once I select them when trying to create a new post. I love this app and had I known their would be issues I would not have bought this phone. Hope you guys see this. Also, I do have the latest patch for Android 13.",5
19704,ridiculous buffering and lag takes me to that new level of anger,1
19705,I have to revise my previous five star review since the app is now broken for about a week. It will not upload photos which of course makes it impossible to post anything new. Apparently the company is not interested in fixing this quickly given the amount of time this has been happening. I have contacted technical support as I'm sure many others have as well.,1
19706,"For some reason, I'm unable to post new items. I choose the photos of the item, but they are not uploaded and I cannot progress without them. Weird. I tried restarting my phone and seeing if there was an update to the app (there isn't). Not sure what else to try. I've never had a problem before this.",3
19707,Great way to buy or sell!,5
19708,this was the best and upfront experience I've ever had on OfferUp.,5
19709,Very glitchy lately and continuously need to force close.,2
19710,Very good.,5
19711,we buyers should be able to leave a feedback for sellers who are interested in not selling items when interested,3
19712,Worst ever google them selves gave me the mail address and u idiots say it's wrong get bent,1
19713,"Ever since corona, the app has been slower. Used to be fast. Only 3 stars, iknow they can fix it but seem they dont want to. APP IS SLOW AND BIGGY",3
19714,It was perfect but now it doesn't let me add pictures so weird it was good the app,3
19715,"Some posts are scams, store advertising that when you go there the prices are not what it says on the post. You guys could have more control over that",2
19716,"I used to love this app but I hate the fact that you have to pay extra to get your stuff noticed, some people don't want the extra cost associated with that. Other than that you have to deal with others stupidity and horrible offers, that is if they even show up.",3
19717,App has been going downhill over time. It is plagued with deceptive sellers and bots with fake posts. There are an immense of fake accounts that posts the same item flooding search results. Blocking the user does not remove their offers. Now jobs can be found on here? App continues to be bloated with unnecessary additions.,1
19718,"Trash app ever,they block my account after 7 years with almost +200 good rating. Without any notice... Now I opened another one but noone sees my posts, never answer my offers ...nobody even receives my messages.... I just uninstall it on my phone.",1
19719,"The only options it gives you to edit push and email notifications are for stuff that doesn't matter. How about push notifications and emails for messages from buyer/sellers? All the emails letting me know some has messaged me keep going to spam, so I'd like to he able to be notified real time if someone if messaging me about an item I have listed. I don't care about the other stuff and I see i don't just speak for myself on this.",1
19720,The app is laggy and slow to respond. Having issues with posting items cause the app wont let me add pictures. App needs to be updated. Maybe its because there are too many ads...,3
19721,the best,5
19722,It's not letting me make posts to sell. Keeps asking me for pictures even though I've selected them and won't let me move past the first step,1
19723,"Great experience, very kind and friendly. Idem sold was exactly as described.",5
19724,"Averaging 1 to 2 stars, but amazingly has a 4.3 star rating. Such a JOKE! Thanks Google, for letting this scam app survive!",1
19725,It's illegal to use a legal name. Read and share the #BCCRSS #IDSILLEGAL #TRUTHBILLBOARDS,1
19726,Keeps glitching can not share any listing. And now can't add more then 1 photo.,1
19727,It's was helpful when I was low on cash,4
19728,"Latest update broke the app. As others mentioned, I cannot upload photos any longer. Cleared cache, reinstalled, restarted device, etc...on and off wifi. It's 100% the app. Please fix it.",2
19729,Not worth the time . Would be shadowban for unknown reason later down the line and no email reply from support .,1
19730,"I sold some stuff, was a good app. Now it just sends worthless notifications you can't stop. You could turn off all notifications but that defeats the purpose of the app.",2
19731,Was a lot better before they got so restrictive as far as all the info they require. Makes me wonder who they're working for now. It's enough with ads already stop trying to control so much as if ......,1
19732,Exceeded my expectations! Everything was even greater than I thought. Highly recommended.,5
19733,The worst online app I have ever seen is this app.,1
19734,"Just applied recent update, can only post cover photo and can't add any additional pictures. Please fix!",1
19735,"Photos stopped uploading randomly, tried reinstalling the whole 9 yards, app is bricked.",1
19736,Too many issues,1
19737,Seriously need to have a filter where we can block stores from putting so much ads. I can find a decent phone for sale because it's always the same business posting. I don't want to buy from a professional. I want to buy cheaper. Not pay full price for a used item. I'd go to a dealer if I wanted that. Ughhh so frustrating! Needs better filters or be able to block people and not see their stuff anymore,1
19738,I don't appreciate your AUTOMATIC MONTHLY BILLING?? That requires me to wait for a month and if I forget' I get billed ?? If I wanted it for 2 months.. I'd pay for 2 months,1
19739,"App wont let me upload more than 1 photo, sometimes it wont let me upload any photos at all.",1
19740,Account won't allow me to verify Puerto Rico area code? PR is a US territory why dent access to our area code?,1
19741,App is good for buying and selling. Definitely a step up from craigslist and also means I'm not using Facebook marketplace. The chat function in the app gets super buggy and slows down to a chug. I have a pixel 6 and typing to people can sometimes cause the app to hang up and fail. I have to close it out and reopen. Otherwise it's a pretty good app.,3
19742,"i have read other reviews and people say I am waisting my time, I have had things posted for 2 weeks , I'm assuming that if you don't pay to ""boost"" it it probably won't sell . I will be deleting my account as of Friday next week.",2
19743,YALL DONT ALLOW ME TO SELL OR POST MY JUNK REMOVAL,3
19744,Such convenience,5
19745,"Does not let you post for some reason, I tried posting shoes but the photos don't load but when I pick a photo of myself or someone I know it does load, only let's human pictures and not the items I want, app has gotten very bad recently very disappointed",1
19746,"Crashing sending messages. I don't often write reviews, but the app has been consistently freezing on sending messages, forcing me to close it and try again. It's frustrating. Definitely a poor user experience bug that should be addressed. Also there are ads inside my messages? That's ridiculous. It just clutters up the inbox area and ia very annoying. The performance inside a message is some of the worst performance I've experienced on any Android app. It's running at a solid 8 FPS or so.",1
19747,I've found a couple things good but now having a problem where the app won't load pictures of anything I try to post to sell so now the app is useless,2
19748,Won't let me add additional photos. Just a cover photo.,1
19749,Excellent to find deal & sell stuff.,5
19750,"The app is hugely buggy when using the messaging features. On an unmodified Google pixel 6 XL, running android 13, the messaging feature constantly freezes, making it impossible to use.",1
19751,will not let me upload photos,1
19752,frequently doesn't work,3
19753,"Just today I tried to list my beautiful vehicle for sale, they offer per month one free listing which they immediately deleted. I then relisted the vehicle at an expense $7.99 and even optimized the listing for another $7.99 only to have that post deleted. I then contacted via email their customer service and they responded that they apologize and that they reposted my listing, showing a snapshot of the listing in my email. I then open the app to find out that my account was disabled. Fraud",1

19758,"Had this for about 3 days. Opened it up to see if my laptop had an offer and apparently I was banned for violating community guidelines. This is everything I have done on this app in those 3 day. Posted a laptop for sale, immediately got a message from an obvious scam saying they'll send me a check over the mail or something. I said I'm only taking cash or electronic payments and it's pickup only. 2 days pass with nothing happening so I decided to lower the price. Woke up this morning banned.",1
19759,App won't load pictures when adding pictures for selling items.,1
19760,Works very good very private and beneficial,4
19761,You cant rate sellers who drop you after agreeing on an offer.,1
19762,They singled me out and banned me from the site when other people were selling the same thing and when I told them I would stop doing it they refused to unlock my account. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I HATE OFFERUP!,1
19763,I always have problems with this site,1
19764,Please please please fix the issue where when your texting someone that the chat does not scroll up when the keyboard appears. This has been an issue for months and I end up just going on the browser instead of the app. Other than that. Just better app performance when scrolling for a bit ( tends to get laggy after scrolling for a while),3
19765,"Full of scammers, OfferUp policy is not effective at removing them. Also uploading pictures stopped working for me",1
19766,Something wrong with appwont let me upload my photos just keeps says please upload photo till I take a new one woth camera. Also in chat it dosent resize the chat box so when the phone keyboard comes up it covers my text box as well as the last few messages really stupid guys please fix it,1
19767,"Useless!! I cant contact anyone abkut buying anything, ive uswd this app alot on tha past, now its just a garbo app takin up space on my phone. This has to be fixd immediately or ill jave to delete, not gone keep a app i cant use.",1
19768,offer up is user friendly and very productive,5
19769,What is going on with this ap In the beginning this app was great. Find some decent used stuff.... sell some stuff..... now it's an ad machine like everything else. So disappointed. App was much better when it was a pick up in person deal... payments not working. . I would just like to see what's in my neighborhood not across the country. Y'all did it well in the beginning but have failed with shipping and doing the payments.please go back to what was done so well. We don't need another ebay!!,1
19770,"Im trying to add extra pictures to a product that im selling, i selct the pictures i press done and then nothing happens??? Super frustrating and i dont kno whats going on",1

19772,Having trouble registering. No support.,1
19773,Freezes after a few minutes of use. Also incredibly slow frame rate.,3
19774,"This app is nothing but corporate swarmed garbage. Don't waste you're time. To admin, up yours. Uninstalled.",1
19775,This app abuses the notification system of your phone to try to convince you to use the app more. It backfired. I am uninstalling the app.,2
19776,"I love this app! It's easy to use, and I've found some real gems on here. Love being able to buy 2nd hand plus it's helpful to the environment. I've sold many things and given away even more.

19777,"It was ok, but the app is glitchy when trying to post something it would show the images selected and not let me move onto the mext section",3

19784,"Why won't it let me add photos to my listings?!!?? This bug has been going on for weeks and I can't list anything. I've already done all necessary troubleshooting. So annoying. It also sucks that even when I have my notifications on, it doesn't actually send them when I get messages (which are like sorta important) but then it'll send me stupid BS ad type stuff (even when my settings are set correctly) Im going back to CRAIGSLIST. (PLUS ads that look like listings should be illegal!) Lol",2
19785,Good,5
19786,Imagine getting dominated by Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist and your answer to stay afloat is forcing new and existing users scan their ID to prove you're a real person. Skip this BS excuse and stick to literally anything else.,1

Navigating between pages is a burden and words I type in the keyboard can take tens of seconds to show up. This is the only app that does this for me and is happening on both my previous and current Pixel 6 pro. Also, the app always resets my search preferences to the widest radius with shipping included which I don't appreciate. I will reset my rating when these issues are fixed.",1

19805,Love it,5
19806,Can't post pictures ..please fix,3
19807,It's not letting me share my items in other platforms,3
19808,good,5

19810,This app has become so laggy,3
19811,total waste of time,1
19812,I installed the app and set up an account but when I try to post it puts me back to sign in and cannot get passed it. Just loops back to sign in.,1
19813,"Offer up is starting to take down my posts for no good reason, and the app is really slow on my phone now",1
19814,Fix the pictures upload option!,1
19815,Super Slow,2
19816,Used to love offerup. It would show me local items for sell that were just posted by people. Now I feel like the app only shows items that you've looked up when you open it and I hate it. Now there's a job search option? Why? There was no need for that for an app that is basically a virtual garage sale.,2
19817,"This is my updated review for 9/22...So after using OfferUp now for a few years, I had stated before that this may be one of the greatest apps ever made! But with updates comes glitches, and now there is a new one. It has to be the worst bug to date! Right now you cannot even load any pictures. OfferUp please fix!",3
19818,Having trouble posting photos for a new listing won't let me post cover photo then other photos to do with the item and I gave several other items posted already and never had a problem why won't it let me post my new items,3
19819,App was working before but now can't upload pics. Sent message to help center but never got a response and the problem is still there.,1
19820,not a good place to sell stuff. takes way too long,1
19821,EDIT: The developer's response can only be described as completely tone deaf and a generic form response. An 'app restart' doesn't explain 40+ cancellation emails. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This app is pure garbage. It takes 2+ minutes to load and when I tried to sell something I got LITERALLY 40+ emails saying I cancelled the transaction when I did no such thing. Avoid this service at all costs.,1
19822,Don't see how they have a 4.3 rating. every other review is 3star or less. Lol. Used to be a good app but now it doesn't save your local search preferences & will not let me post more then 1 picture at a time. I literally have to post with 1 picture then save that then go back to edit & it will allow 1 more picture to upload. Seems like the more stuff they try to ad takes away from what it once was. It's now going on 2 days & they still haven't fixed the pictures uploading only 1 at a time.,2
19823,wonderful,5
19824,"What the heck happened to this app? Constantly force closing, I can't use chat proper without freezing and I was having trouble using photos. That is on 2 different cellphones I tried...",2
19825,Full of bugs and not user friendly.,1
19826,Can't post a photo from my library. Test your app before releasing. This isn't hard. This is a Showstopping bug.,1
19827,great application and awesome user experience,5
19828,needs work,1
19829,always works great for me,5
19830,I think this is a good app. I have found many things.,5
19831,App will not let me upload any photos of items to sell.,2
19832,easy to communicate with fast response. A+,5
19833,It used to be better to many advertisers. It is like Criagslist but safer and easier. I sold a truck and a grill fast.,3
19834,"I have worked for awhile now on OfferUp , and have had such good experiences. They are great to sell and buy on.",5
19835,I really don't like all the ads. just too many,3
19836,"I have to say that overall this has been a very useful app, of course you always have some idiot that has to cause waves. but you have that on the daily everywhere.",4
19837,"Responsive, and helpful with loading. Accurate description.",5
19838,"Everything was fine, I was able to sell and buy but now I can't do any of those and message sellers or receive because it's asking me to join TruYou. I'm not happy or safe having to give my information! Please go back how it was!!!",1
19839,"Recently the messaging part of the app has been super buggy, locks up, etc. Very frustrating. There isn't a way for me to sort or filter based on when the item was listed. I keep coming across items that were listed more than a year ago!",2
19840,"I loved this app before, but I have to say that after upgrading to Android 13 the App just won't work. It freezes, crashes and it's impossible to communicate via messages. Pixel 6 pro user",1
19841,the best app ever created for the people of this country. It allows the freedom to refinance things you spend money on instead of just throwing it away which in turn reduces the waste and you make money!,5
19842,Easy-to-use lots of buyers lots of things to buy good way to make extra cash Give it a try it definitely deserves a five-star rating,5
19843,This app runs very slow and now it won't let me post anything and won't upload pictures for item. Yes I restarted and cleared my cache and still does the same thing. Fix the problem!!!,1
19844,"it was a good experience, person was on time and went smoothly.",5
19845,"The site is INUNDATED with liquidators and companies now, hardly any individuals selling anymore.",1
19846,no way to delete deactivate profile,1
19847,"Good app, needs to be an easier way to get support .",4
19848,"I had left a two star review for a lack of QOL features this app definitely needs, but I am rewriting my review to focus on the absolutely terrible function of OfferUp. Every single time I try to respond to any of my messages between sellers, the app crashes. Every. Single. Time. Extremely frustrated.",1
19849,Had app for sometime now i can upload pictures but I can see that they were selected at the bottom of the page so I can sell product.. big inconvenience,2
19850,It's a trash App I've had it for 3months and haven't sold nothing and that bcs I posted different stuff and till this day it's say 3 to 5 views out of 3 months thought it would've said 200 views it's a wack app since they switched to letgo and offers up it's been trash don't waste time,1
19851,"DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING EXTRA ON THIS APP. I PAID $19.99 PER MONTH SO MY STUFF CAN BE VIEW BY MORE PEOPLE AND I SOLD MY CAR A YEAR AGO AND IM STILL GETTING CHARGED THE $19.99 PER MONTH.

I'd like to have an option to cancel the order both as a seller and as a buyer. Why is it not even an option? If you want to compete with other selling platforms, you should expand the menu of options, including mailing with seller's shipping label.",2

19855,good app,5
19856,"Bro u guys need to fix this app, when u start typing , right after a few secs of typing it starts to freeze the typing nothing shows up on pixel 6 pro with Android 13 even on 12 it was happening it's just I e been lazy to come complain plus I don't use the app that much since it needs fixing, UPDATE after new PATCH problem has not been fixed ... STILL FREEZES UP",1
19857,"this app is a joke for selling stuff, most people that hit you up are spam or just flat out bullshitting smh üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé",1
19858,Doesn't connect to all photos. Any app that doesn't automatically connect to ALL the photos get deleted. You're a waste of time for us all. Fix the app so it just doesn't see our camera roll but all of our pics.,1
19859,"Can't post pictures, DONT USE THIS APP! The developers won't do a damn thing about it",1
19860,have gotten not one offer,1
19861,Totally no problems so far,5
19862,"App should automatically deactivate inactive users. Apart from that, app is good",3
19863,Since last update I have a real hard time using the app. Force closes a lot and takes for ever to message someone. It will freeze halfway through a sentence and I'll have to completely exit app and start over multiple times before getting the message through.,2
19864,Very good,5
19865,I posted four different items and they did not put one on the OfferUp app. What is going on with your so called good App.?????????,1
19866,awesome app,5
19867,good deals,5
19868,Not allowing me to upload photos?,2
19869,Love it,5
19870,"can't even download the app, it's officially broken",1
19871,App is great but should monitor people wasting people's time on here. I know its hard but get annoying. but over all had this app for years and it's pretty convenient and usually pretty helpful buying and selling,5
19872,Reliable and people are a hit or miss with deals but just keep looking. Works well.,5
19873,"Please fix posting issues! I choose the photos but they don't upload and it tells me to do it again. I have logged out and back in, I have also Uninstalled and re-installed the app and still having the same problem.",2
19874,This app has developed way to many bugs. Half the time items won't load or upload and drops network connection.,2
19875,"It turns to a pay service, your posts won't show and you get zero views but they will tell you something wrong so you must have bad connections or restart your device but they will never tell you it's paid member only and if you want your post to show must pay for sell faster service for monthly fee its all about greed and dishonesty really disgusting people.",1
19876,wish items could be pulled out of timed out from not selling to for sale without paying a fee,4
19877,"This app doesn't allow you to upload pictures, you have to take them as you make the post which is annoying an time consuming if you were planning on posting at a later time. And it won't let you move forward on the post-info unless you've uploaded a pic, so good luck Interested buyers? Probably bots. Every msg I've gotten with someone who is interested has either wanted to meet up without offering a price or interest in item or they've wanted my personal information.",2
19878,Won't load my photos. I've tried everything suggested. guess I have to sell elsewhere.,1
19879,I liked it better before they linked UP I don't really know why I'm reinstalling it it doesn't work anymore let go was better but since it paired up with this one it went downhill they don't even delete old post I've seen post for like a year ago and if you reply on anything they don't ever answer back I really wish they'd bring let go back,1
19880,"Very slow and buggy. Adding photos doesn't work, and the built-in messaging is terrible.",2
19881,exceptional,5
19882,It's great love it,4
19883,Tried to upload a few photos for an item I wanted to sell but the app wouldn't let me upload more than one photo. Can't sell an item if I can't show what I'm selling. I'll stop using this app for better ones because this one is no longer for local people either. It's littered with ads from Walmart and such. üëé,1
19884,only can post one car a month .. it would be nice if it was three .. thank about it....,3
19885,"To many ad's app sucks,üëé",1
19886,I have the Galaxy Note 9 and it lags so much when I use the app,3
19887,"The app stopped letting me post an item today. I have trying to post a new item but it keeps telling me to add pics even though it was the first thing I did. I restarted the phone, then the app and have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still pursists. This just started today. What's going on? I can't even post on the browser.",3
19888,this app is slow,1
19889,"Unable to post multiple photos. Not very good, especially if you're trying to sell multiple items, and potential buyers cannot see what you're selling. Tried to restart the app and re-open, only to have the same thing happen.",3
19890,9/15/22 update - 0 stars. Terrible for sellers with multiple items. Drains battery. SLOW. My items are not found when I search for them. Doesn't archive. ugh 8/31/21 - The app seems to work fine. My complaint is that I MUST use the app in order to list items for sale. You cannot post items from OfferUp's website. This makes posting more challenging (for me) and with Facebook marketplace and Craigslist being easier I certainly prefer their platform more. Less wear and tear on my phone the better.,1
19891,"I like it. The Location Field is a bit picky. Over all, a very handy App. B.S.",5
19892,Was not worth the time to install,1
19893,I'm more busy blocking scammers than actually making sales. The app seems to have a bug because I haven't been able to post. Everytime I post it doesn't appear on the home page or it deletes by itself. the app needs more work,2
19894,too many scammers!,1
19895,"Laggy when sending messages on Pixel 6 Pro, terrible after most recent update.",1
19896,New update won't allow me to post pictures,1
19897,"slow , clunky , hard to navigate. full of ads that are dead or fake",2
19898,It'd turned into a lot of scams.,3
19899,No browser search/posting.,3
19900,"Neither pictures, nor ""bottom menu"" appear when I start the app EVERY SINGLE TIME... üëéüèº",3
19901,I can not use my account,2
19902,Needs list view (unless i missed it)...3 cropped square thumbnails per row is terrible on a phone for usability.,3
19903,Scammers,1
19904,"amazing app, have sold thousands of items throughout the years of using OfferUp. sell more then twice as much then on Facebook marketplace. Just saying!",5
19905,I hate how slow it is. Takes such a long time just to open one message. Got me so frustrated I almost threw my phone. I've erased cache and Data stored on my phone and still slow. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Same thing! It's not my phone or internet because all other apps work grait!,1
19906,"Can't add images to my posts. Have tried clearing cache and uninstalling/installing but still doesn't fix the issue. Devs, please look into this.",1
19907,Great so far I love it ...224,5
19908,Hi l am trying to reach customer support can not upload pictures to my ads. It has been couple of days and have sent 4 requests if someone could get in touch with me. I have been with offer up for many years,5
19909,I feel like I've spent money two or three times on offer ups extra product view offer and it really didn't seem to pay off...I have at least 7 or 8 things posted and very few interactions with any potential buyers. It's very disappointing.,1
19910,"I used to really like this app (from a 5 star to a 1 star rate) here is the reason why: With this new look style update it's not as smooth as before, i used to be able to double tap the pics to zoom in, now it doesnt work, you have to make sure you pinch it out really good because then you cant transition to the next picture Also whats up with all those scam posts, people ""selling"" cars for $1,200 (scam obviously) its really annoying; developers fix it please",1
19911,Put all dealerships cars separate is annoying to see all thatt uggly salvage and expensive cars all the time,2
19912,very convenient to find what you need for a good deal,5
19913,"Honestly, i dont like the app. People either don't respond after they see you, or message and dont buy. It sucks, can yall have the decency to just say ""no""? Like, christ....",2
19914,"Like many of you, I don't really ever write reviews. Most reviews are completely biased towards either really liking or disliking whatever is being reviewed. This is the latter. In the most basic form this app does not work, -posts not being posted -messages between seller and buyer freezing -randomly being unable to add photos It's appalling, almost fascinating how something so popular with so many downloads does not function correctly in the most simple ways Not worth your time",1
19915,I'm having a VERY HARD TIME uploading pictures. It won't actually load. I have this app for a long time already so I know how it works but unsure why it isn't actually LOADING more pictures. The most is 2 pictures. & yes I did got off the app n then came back on...I even restarted my phone too. So still nothing has change so it is the actual app),2
19916,"There is not a way to post & sell on the website version. This makes it only available to people who download the app on your phone, making it inconvenient to buy & sell. If they fixed this, the website would be worth my time.",2
19917,Awsome,5
19918,Can't select options on the search bar ?,4
19919,works great and Amy was awesome very nice person,5
19920,Good,4
19921,not impressed always push for more money to promote product. Sad that they ask for more money to do the job they get 13% for.,3
19922,"ok app. when you click one item, that is all it wants to show you. just leave it alone. if I click on an item, it may look interesting but I don't want to see 200 more of those.",3
19923,"Everytime I go to Post the app will not accept my images and am I stuck. I've selected the images, used my camera. All to no avail. I even cleared data, logged out and logged back in. It shouldn't be this difficult to post an image.",1
19924,nobody ever gets back to you after you message them,2
19925,Can't post! Can't upload pictures!,1
19926,Err... This recent update is buggy on messages. Message input constantly fails. Type a few works and the input just stops working. Have to force quit the App to get typing working again. Seems to be problematic after completing the first line of text input. App relaunch gets slower each time.,1
19927,Loop error with choosing a photo. I chose the photo why does it loop with no commit.,1
19928,too many scammer..and most people don't answer back,1
19929,What's up with OfferUp lately? It's been down for the past 2 days! Please hurry and fix. So the site IS STILL DOWN for some reason even after all this time to fix it has past by! I don't know what's going on with OfferUp but I'm deleting the app today. At this point it's taking up space because the app STILL DOESN'T WORK!,1
19930,"app is very glitchy especially when your texting back and forth with the seller. You can't see what you're texting because the dialog box disappears to the bottom and you have to minimize the screen. Sometimes the app gets stuck and you have to restart it. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S20FE , not an old phone.",2
19931,Awesome deals üëç,5
19932,"Great app. However, I think the messenger can be improved. Another thing, I cannot default my search profile. I am only in buying locally, no shipping. I cannot default my search profile to be local only.",4
19933,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Slow. Won't send messages. No notifications. Can't block. Reinstalled and nothing changed. This update ruined the app. Very disappointed and frustrated.",1
19934,"Last update sucks. it freezes, it won't let me reply to new messages or even search for items",1
19935,slow and long loading,1
19936,"Just use the website, the app is insanely slow and laggy",2
19937,Can't not upload photos what is wrong with this app all of a sudden. Pixel 6 Pro Android 13,1
19938,"Worked fine for a few years. All of a sudden will not let me add any pictures. Checked app permissions, nothing has changed, just broke. Uninstalled/ reinstalled. Still broke. Oh well was a decent app for a few years. Don't have time for this headache in the future. Vaya con dios amigo.",2
19939,I sell alot on here but sincd you guys merged with let go. Your app is slow so slow yhat i wang to quit using offerup all togegher,5
19940,I forgot how stupid this app is don't waste your time.. every click take 20 minute's to fkn slow,1
19941,Bought my first car using this app I'd say it's pretty good.,4
19942,I love offer up been selling for years. I appreciate the platform it helps me sell extra merch .bless up to everyone hope you sell more and more,5
19943,App has been having issues lately. Laggy and sometimes notifications do not come through.,3
19944,Runs really slow. Push notifications not available for in-app messages. Search notifications don't work. Won't save search preferences. Developer responses here are lip service.,1
19945,"offer up is great üëç!!! just too bad for some people who are not to experienced with using credit card to pay, it would be much easier if people could post cars and bikes for $2. and click on a step by step simple process!!!",5
19946,DO NOT SHIP THRU OFFERUP!! beware!!! I lost out on my item and money!!! They don't bother reading or investigating the claims thoroughly. Don't trust the buyer protection.,2
19947,Why is half the app broken? Clicking share nothing happens. If it manages to work it's just message without link. Got a developer response. I sent an email. Not sure if the share buttons work for anyone but they didn't for me.,2
19948,"When uploading new listing, I am not able to upload more than 1 image. Issue has been occurring since 09/13/22",2
19949,find lots of stuff can sell easy,5
19950,"2 stars. 1 for my successful selling history, and 1 for my seller rating. Withholding a star for the app's dementia which never remembers my search preferences, and occasionally forgets where I live. Another for sending me unwanted inbox notifications, and the final for taking over Letgo, a much better platform.",2
19951,good,5
19952,Not sure yet,4
19953,Good stuff,5
19954,There seems to be keyboard issues. I had issues trying to backspace and delete or just make corrections. Almost missed out on a deal. It would not allow editing of my credit card.,4
19955,"I signed up and made offers to 5 vendors to buy a bike. They messaged me, before I could reply offerUP archived my account and asked me to submit truYou verification. I tried doing it twice, verification failed both times. Now the vendors are messaging me and I cannot reply. Horrible app.",1
19956,App keeps crashing when I go into notifications. Also crashes when i go to post an item. Wont allow pictures to upload and then cant post the item. PLEASE FIX!!!!,1
19957,nobody uses it anymore,1
19958,HORRIBLE APP CAN'T USE MY PHONE NUMBER THIS IS STUPIDITY APP DON'T GET IT,1
19959,Will not let me upload my pics,2
19960,The items for sale can only advanced by paying to have it promoted.,4
19961,It doesn't even last a minute without crashing. What did you do to it? It worked fine until like a month ago.,1
19962,Love it,5
19963,"Ads are never expired, so you waste time contacting people who sold their items in some cases years ago. In addition you can limit how far away you want to search but offer up results give you items thousands of miles away that were sold a year ago. I personally wouldn't bother to download this and have removed it from my phone",1
19964,"This app suuucks. Doesn't save when posting. Doesn't save when editing. Randomly deletes posts. Awful. Edit: I did reach out to support and got about 4 auto responses. No one reads help tickets unless I email a specific ""social"" address? No thanks.",3
19965,App keeps closing when trying to check messages ! Slow very slow app and always has been,2
19966,I wish the description section will go back to where it was so I don't have to keep going backwards to get to it,5
19967,App keeps not responding and is getting extremely difficult to use so please fix ASAP!!! Then I will give 5 stars as I love and Need this app!!!,1
19968,Just made an account and it was instantly deleted when I didn't do anything,1
19969,"I used this app alot and had great results. Lately however I am never getting a response from a seller about if an item is still available or accepting an offer. I get the push notifications but that's it. Until recently I would get a response back from a seller in less than 12 hrs, now I never hear back from them at all, even on listing that were put up the same day. Something has got to be going on with the app.",2
19970,"OfferUp failed the job before even showing up to interview. Instant fail. Just installed, nothing shows up in app after trying to hit the ""sell"" tab at the bottom. Now nothing loads, no matter how many times I force the app to stop or reinstall.",1
19971,the fact you can only really post by phone is annoying. the fact that all my sales are public is also a huge negative.,1
19972,Very good,5
19973,works well for me to buy and sell,5
19974,My photos will not upload this is very annoying they used to upload and I really depend on this app to sell things,2
19975,"Frustrating - won't upload photos despite all permissions given. Logged in/out, deleted app, reinstalled...still won't load photos.",1
19976,"None of my posts up! I have tried posting under 2 different emails. First one I spent so mich time adding one after the other and at the end, nothing shown to be posted or archived. Once I got it to post one or so it seemed, but when I refreshed and/or went to another tab and came back, posting was gone. Other email won't even let me get through bc it's showing I am not attaching an image... even though I've been trying... Have tried contacting support, no answer/resolution.",1
19977,Learning,3
19978,"Found what I was looking for, and delivered on time. Good seller.",5
19979,Good,5
19980,Love it,5
19981,Absolutely ridiculous everyone thinks they have gold bunch of garbage at high prices! It's all overpriced stuff and I haven't seen one deal It's like everyone dosen't want to sell anything. I'd rather buy it new then at these ridiculous prices. Honest opinion don't bother wasting your time with this garbage app! üëéüèºüëéüèº,1
19982,This was good before all those annoying ads and it is full with scams and i don't see nothing been done about this situation I reports a bunch of this scams and nothing still there it is not trusting on what it is posted on it getting worse than Craigslist and at bunch of old listing that never been erase and went you search for something you only find old stuff and this app is not trusting anymore because those tracking ads getting your information and scams calling you every day bay OfferUp,1
19983,this app sucks !,1
19984,"This app started out excellent! It has become a joke. The majority of posted items are either ads or are located half way across the country. The notifications received state that there are new items related to your searches, but when you look, there is nothing even remotely close to your search items. Almost always, when you go to message on the rare item you actually see, you get a ""something went wrong, we're working on it"" message, which obviously defeats the purpose of the app. DELETED!",1
19985,filled with too many scammers and flakes.,1
19986,Time killers,5
19987,love this appt. just got my house less then 3 month's ago and have been able to fully furnished my home spending half the money I would've if I had shop in store's. great idea and great apt as well as great people with kind heart.,5
19988,"very easy, great communication product was as described.",5
19989,why can't you key word search your listings on the app and or why can't you make multiple price drops on your posted items for sale more conveniently?,3
19990,"Brand new to the app, first thing it did was archive items for sale on the same day, unable to unarchive, then had an update, no notification of update, yes that fixed the issue, poor communication, time will tell if experience is more positive.",3
19991,no results,2
19992,Absurd that you can't post more than once a month without being charged. Not allowing me to post an item because your category of item is wrong is also horse s***.,1
19993,"great app, if only people would be reliable.",5
19994,"It was a low price for a quality 52-inch T.V, in excellent condition. Deal of the year. It was my pleasure to do business with him Carry out to my car..Friendly, a very nice gentleman.",5
19995,Excellent selection of items with good prices,5
19996,Something is wrong with the inbox. Majority of the time the app freezes when Replying. Have to close and start over,2
19997,"While OfferUp is one of the primary resources I use when selling items, the hoops to go through to find items like electronics are absurd. Since there's no owner vs dealer filter like on Craigslist, there's so many companies that misrepresent their prices with ""rent to own"" monthly payments. I wish there was some way to block these accounts so that they're listings do not appear in my search results. The current block function isn't enough to solve this.",3
19998,"Where to begin, the hoops you have to jump through just to sell your belongings, and even after I jumped through all of them my post were still not put up for people to view, very poor app, I wish they never acquired letgo it was by far a better app than offer up",1
19999,Stops loading up images,2
