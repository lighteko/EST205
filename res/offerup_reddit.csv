i bought a mac mini and the day its supposed to arrive, two hours before my mailman gets to the neighborhood, i get a delivery notice through the app portal saying it had been delivered.if i manually type the tracking number into the USPS website it says slip generated but no package in the system. also for 48 hours the app would not let my file a dispute. it would kick me out of that part of the app. i sent screenshots to customer service and even a video of my mailman explaining the delivery. notice could not be real because time delivered is two hours before he gets to my neighborhood.
customer service gave me the runaround. telling me to get a formal letter from the post office.they dont so that. even went to a branch and they dont do that. never refunded me and i disputed it with my bank and was also denied. but told me i had to send a snail mail letter requesting their rules for reasons for denial.
offer up is trash. the way the customer service treated me was shameful, never once acknowledged any of the proof i sent them. then the closed the case. i am not wealthy and losing $310.48 is a big deal.the brazen behavior of customer service indicated that they were instructed from an executive level to behave like that. the fact that they know and ignore it when customers need a refund is proof of their complicity. an aggressive prosecutor might call it conspiracy to commit the interstate fraud and get them on a RICO case.im more pissed off at OU than the actual scammer.

We ended up having another kid and quickly found out, this is not the furniture we need at this time in our lives. Definitely not kid friendly.
My wife's recliner was the cheapest at about 1700. The couch and recliner, which is what were trying to sell, is in great condition with plenty of add ons but I have no idea what return I expect on it. I believe we spent a total of 4-4.5k on both. They're beautiful pieces and are in great condition. We're going to go up to La-Z-Boy and get a bill order for exactly what we paid for.

A vast majority of used listings are priced only 10-15% less than new. Why would anyone in their right mind drive across town to meet a stranger for something used with no warranty or return policy, when they could pay $10 more to have a brand new one delivered overnight to their front door?
There is no way anyone is buying this stuff. I see listings that are 3+ months old and I'll send a reasonable offer and the person still won't budge. Wouldn't any sane person rather have $60 now than maybe $80 one day, but probably not since it's already been 3 months...
And on the other end, I never list items for more than 50% of the new price, no matter how ""excellent"" the condition. And many items will be less than 25% of the original price. I'm consistently lower than the other listings but they'll sit there for weeks and months. Wide variety of items - appliances, Apple products, tech items, clothing, household items. Everything no more than a couple years old and in good working condition.
None of it makes sense. I guess these platforms make all their money from advertising so they don't really give a shit if things are actually selling, but it's frustrating because I like to buy/sell used for eco reasons too. I just can't justify spending nearly the same to be inconvenienced and potentially run into problems with no recourse.
It's a shame. A thriving, well-balanced used market would be great and help prevent a lot of landfill waste.

Are they possibly hacked accounts (I know that happens a lot with facebook)? Or maybe one is just copying and pasting the other's pics because they are lazy?
Weirdness aside, my main question is how reliable are the offerUp ratings? Can they be faked easily (ie fake exchanges so a cohort can leave a positive review). I use the facebook ratings to determine legit and trustworthy sellers, is OfferUp's ratings less reliable?

When I'm shopping and see something (finally after hours of searching) I want to contact the seller using my own words since I know all to well that asking if it's still available will most likely result in the seller not even bothering to reply.
Anyone who thinks different is an amateur at using OU.
So when I'm thinking of spending $500 on a pair of speakers that are known to develop specific issues after many years, I want to ask if they've been serviced or if the surrounds are still in tact.
My message is this;
I'm very interested but have a few questions, have they been serviced since new and are the woofer surrounds still in tact?
Then the message pops up telling me I violated the rules! Exactly what rules have I violated?
Then they wonder why nobody bothers to ship there anymore? When you're clearly blocking messages for no reason on top of delaying them for no reason, and you're doing other moronic things like not showing your posts to everyone right away, you're hurting sales for everyone
Whoever makes these idiotic decisions to only show new posts to paying users hasn't even considered the fact that once you post something it's only in the top position for a few minutes before its drowned out by other posts that are posted after it.
What that does is limits the amount of possible buyers to only those few (from what I've seen very few) paying users and then within a minute it's already moved out of sight so the rest of the users (who by far outnumber the paying users 1000 to 1) probably will never even see the post unless they try using the awful search and then probably still won't see anything they are looking for.
The constant fucking with everyones sales and messages is exactly why the number of sales has diminished to practically zero now. I don't understand how they can't figure out what they're doing has been 1 wrong move after the next. I know for certain that I could have taken the helm at OU when they got new management and I could have made it into the one and only choice for local sales nation wide and still could have made everyone happy while turning a profit.
None would have felt forced into paying, they would have been glad to pay a small fraction to keep seeing sales results continue as they were at that time. The moronic display of greed and micromanaging has destroyed the app to a point where there is little to no care about even bothering to check messages any more.
I know it used to be the most important thing I did each day and now I really have no reason to even look. If I do have messages they're most likely from hours earlier and I never knew they arrived. Most times I see nothing at all for 3 or 4 days.
When I try to make contact with people, the delay if 12 minutes make it look like neither of us are actually going to reply back and will forget about it, then 2 hours later I'll check messages and see they have been repeatedly sending messages that I never knew arrived.
Why even bother posting to a platform that is making it this hard to use?

But what documents need to be handed over aside from the title? I see some sites recommend a bill of sale; do you use that, or is it just extra hassle/not important?
Also, how should I deal with potential future contact (months or even years later) if the buyer reaches out because something went wrong with the car? Is it a good idea to block the buyer in like a week or so after selling the car to avoid any future contact?

I'm new to offer-up, and just listed a GPU with the shipping option enabled. Within about ten minutes I received six identical messages almost instantaneously saying the same thing ""Hi, is this still available?""
I assume these are bots, and thus also assume they are scams. I'm guessing that they're going to try to get me to ship it before getting payment or something (which I wouldn't do). Just wondering how they might try to scam me.
Kind of annoying because it looks like I'll have to disable the shipping option to avoid being spammed, and to filter the bot messages out from the genuine ""Hi, is this still available?"" people. Since.. That's actually what I write sometimes when making inquiries about buying something.

If the item isn‚Äôt shipped within 5 days, the transaction will automatically cancel and the buyer's payment will be returned to their original payment method.
I contacted offerup support, explaining its been 5 days and nothing hapened.
No message from seller about shipping
No response from seller when I ask whats happening
No automatic cancellation
Offerup supports response is to cite the policy and say they cannot manually cancel.
Has anyone ever seen this ""automatic cancelation"" work the way the policy describes?
Or is the only recourse to contact your credit card company and dispute the charge?

I mainly shop offerup from my iPhone. I would like to find a good app for making/sharing a saved list with another person.
I have used Trello in the past, but the Trello share-to-app functionality is sorta lame.
Using the share function from an offerup item always results in ‚Äúcheck out this item on offerup [link]‚Äù regardless of where you are sharing it to (iMessage, Trello, etc).
So it would be amazing if (insert dream app here) had the ability to set up an automation: after the manual trigger (share to app), then it would: open the link, grab the relevant elements from the listing (price, title, description, maybe the main thumbnail), and create some sort of card or object that represents the listing. **I am not experienced enough in programming to write this kind of code, but I do know enough that I could plug it into an app‚Äôs API, if someone has already written it!
My reality is in check: I do NOT expect any solution to provide automated updates (i.e. if the item is sold, changed price, etc). I would open the links to offerup, and change or delete items from my list manually as needed.
Obviously I can just share to a Google doc, and manage the list of plain links completely manually. But I guess I just feel like SOMEBODY must have found a better solution be now???
