0,"Sold my car in under a week!: I listed my used 2007suv with a broken excel in under a week for asking price on Craigslist! The ap was very easy to use, the pics looked great, and I only paid 5 bucks for the ad! It WAS going to be for a month, but Craigslist is everyone‚Äôs go to for just about everything second hand I sold it in under a week for asking price (I over priced it so a ‚Äúpotential buyer‚Äù could feel as if they talked me down) I got texts within an hour of posting on a Sunday night and a Atleast 2 texts a day asking about the truck. ) people were coming to see it Saturday and 3 people were supposed to come see it Sunday. One girl wanted really bad (lac of low mileage decent American made 4x4 for sale at a FAIR price) I told her that the first one to come with cash that will have it out of my yard by Monday can take it. Long story short- The girl got it, I brought it to her and everyone‚Äôs happy! 
Craigslist was easy to use for both buyer and seller and who can‚Äôt afford five bucks!",5
1,"Decent app, except for when you have to log in. Again.: Their mobile app is a reasonably well-streamlined mobile interface, though not quantifiably more so than the existing mobile web site. Integration with your default mail app is different and one could argue is better, assuming that you're not using the Gmail client which is already part of the problem. There is also a way to save credit cards for payments, though I have no idea why you'd ever want to do that. Not once have I bought anything directly from Craigslists. Is this really a thing?

Anyway, there is bad news: the login and authentication process is needlessly cumbersome. Logging into the mobile website if clearly more convenient as it doesn't obstruct you with its lukewarm integration with the password manager. Alternatively you can log in with email if you don't mind doing that every single time. The clunky authentication mechanism would be that much of a bother if I didn't find the app demanding my credentials so frequently because the auth tokens seem to only last a couple of weeks. This forces regular manual logins which usually require password changes because the app thinks you don't have a password saved. That last part is a genuine PITA.

All in all it's fine, but unnecessary. You can easily live without it just using their fine mobile web site without feeling like you're missing anything, because you're not.",3
2,"Makes listing easier. At what cost?: Craigslist may still have the same scammers they‚Äôve always had so you still need to be aware of those. Follow craigslist suggestions by always taking cash, never except a check in the mail (common scam), never click on a link from a text message to ‚Äúconfirm your a real person‚Äù, and most importantly meet in a public safe meet up place. I it‚Äôs difficult to give suggestions for those that are moving and need to sell several large things. I have found it beneficial to meet them at the corner of your block. This will allow you to meet and document their car and even their identity. Have your large couch or dresser, etc. in your driveway or at least in your garage. Always best to have a buddy with you. 
Expect no-shows, beware of phone scams and people just wanting your identity, likely for creditors or further scams. 
Very useful to use a burner SIM card to avoid future phone spam. As many pitfalls as there are craigslist can still be the most effective way to sell your items quickly. 
Now you‚Äôve given Craigslist much of your personal info, by installing the app and using. Other than ease-of-use you still may want to just use the website.",4
3,"Better results than FBMP: Tho the initial user interface still looks like it‚Äôs from the ‚Äò90s, anything retro ends there. I only have put 2 properties, one house, some Dyna-Glo heaters, one set of tires, assorted furniture, and an RV on here just recently. I almost always post on Craigslist first just to see what action may be out there. For every item, except one, I closed the sale in 1 to 4 days. The exception were my BFG/AT tires. I put them on FB after inactivity here. I had anticipated dropping the price at a loss, but what I did NOT anticipate was being a victim of a Zelle scam on FB. Out $300 permanently plus drop in price of tires. Live & learn, I guess. Strangely enough, Craigslist is where I was more skeptical, biased, & looking for scammers. I am aware scam artists are everywhere. However, I must admit that after the few items I have advertised and closed, I feel safer, and more personally secure for myself and my money. The prospective buyers from Craigslist are very courteous. From different sales platforms, the people conduct business with, shall I say, less civility and professionalism. In summary, I now admit to being a Craigslist convert when it comes to selling. As for being a buyer, that‚Äôs another review!",4
4,"Craig‚Äôs List is great: Updated: April 1, 2023‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not sure what has happened but I haven‚Äôt been able to access my account to post anything or renew existing items. I tried to get a hold of someone at Craigslist and their website apparently is also down (maybe) I‚Äôm not sure because I‚Äôm not computer savvy so I‚Äôm not sure. Update: As of Feb. 2023‚Ä¶ Clist App has done an update. It still works great. I do think that the Renew Option should be removed until items need renewing. And the font should be changed to regular block lettering. So categories are more legible. I realize you want the Craig‚Äôs List pages to stand out. That‚Äôs just my thoughts. Thanks! I like Craig‚Äôs List. So far the CL App let‚Äôs me post, renew, delete items On The Go or while on Vacation so my items are always out there unless I remove them üòä. There has only been one glitch a while back that had. And it was fixed almost immediately. I have zero complaints.

Update May 3, 2024
 Everything has been working great. I do wish I had the option back to upload pictures of items I‚Äôm selling. So I can renew & provide more pictures if buyers request it. 
But overall everything is working great. üòä",4
5,Needs a Fix: I‚Äôm enjoying using the app to look for some side gigs to make money on the side but it‚Äôs starting to become very annoying. I don‚Äôt actually think I‚Äôll be recommending the app to anyone especially not friends due to one simple thing. I‚Äôm tired of seeing full time or part time jobs and ads posted in the gigs section. There is literally a jobs section. I‚Äôm trying to find the rare gigs that pop up and it makes it difficult to find them when most of what I‚Äôm scrolling through are job ads. Things that require dedicated time to on a normal. The gigs section should only have the one time work options that people need help with. Like helping someone move or somebody needing just a single lawn mowed rather than a mowing company needing employees or the gigs where someone needs help taking down an old shed or cleaning their roof off and things of that sort. If I was looking for a job then I‚Äôd go to the jobs section. Pls Craigslist fix this because it‚Äôs making it difficult to use the app for that. That is the only reason why I‚Äôm not recommending this app to people I know and why I‚Äôm not giving it a 5. Some of y‚Äôall may have a different view but to me this is a major issue.,3
6,"Posted= SOLD!: I had not used Craigslist for selling anything before and was hesitant as I had no clue how to post, add pictures or even describe what I was selling. Oh WOW, it was so simple that even a grandmother who rarely uses the internet could follow the easy steps!
I did have someone contacting me that felt very scam like, but Craigslist had made available what to look out for in cases like this. Much like a dating website, if someone shows interest but happens to be out of town at the time and wants your information, üö© RED FLAG!
In only 2 days I had the PERFECT BUYER and a huge heavy piece of furniture removed from my home without me having to lift a thing! My suggestion to anyone selling an item is, GO WITH YOUR GUT, post honestly and state your exact stipulations for the sale. My post covered that this piece of furniture would require two strong people and a truck or trailer, that my $200 fee was non-negotiable and when I wanted it gone by. All my stipulation were met!
Good luck!

7,"Finally an Official App!: Used CPlus for years. Glad they finally put out an official app. 

-1 star for what's always been an issue with Craigslist, regardless of platform. Abuse and lax enforcement. Most people on there are fine, but occasionally you run into unhinged people, and there is no help or recourse. I understand it's a small (and often free!) operation, but there are solutions. At the very least, they should be scanning for ads which are substantially the same and not allowing them. The most recent abuser I got didn't like that I took 45 min to respond to his text and got it in his mind that I was a scammer. So he copied my entire ad, including pictures, and added ""this is a scam"" to it, in multiple places. The pics at the very least, particularly in the same city, should be enough to flag based off some hash and prevent them from posting. I emailed the contact us for faked ads and never heard back. I didn't get any responses to my ad for a week until I could flag it enough times from different connections and devices to have it removed. Not cool. Imagine for people who have their contact info revenge posted.",4
8,"Craigslist is great!  The iOS app?  Pretty OK: There‚Äôs nothing really objectionable about the app.  It functions.   It‚Äôs not intuitive in several places.   But it gets the job done.  
The big trade off of course is with the mobile app photos are ‚Äúright there‚Äù ‚Ä¶ no transferring or emailing-to-oneself.  But typing is much easier on a keyboard at a ‚Äúreal‚Äù computer‚Ä¶.so if the app were more appealing it would mean a lot. 

Minor annoyance, it‚Äôs not possible to select a town or an area on mobile.  Only able to select a radius from a point on a map, VERY unlike the web version of Craigslist.  So some of my multi-city searches for certain things are crazy tedious to do on mobile.  (Search for specific thing in ‚ÄúLos Angeles‚Äù for example, but leave all search terms the same and switch city on web to ‚ÄúSan Diegos ‚Äù and bingo, you found it!).  Not possible on mobile.  Grrrrr.  So if you are traveling out of state, and wanted to see if the local cities had that esoteric collectible, you would have to use a more onerous approach or bring your laptop.",4
9,"Sold: I‚Äôve bought and sold stuff on CL for years‚Ä¶.Probably since it‚Äôs beginning! This last sale didn‚Äôt disappoint. Sold a car in less than 24 hours. I guess CL is still good! I was amazed at the number of responses considering all the other platforms, but like I said things went quick and easy. I asked fair market and got it! So NO I didn‚Äôt give it away. Makes me want to post more stuff. 

Also, CL is my gauge for anything in any category. I usually check here before I go anywhere else, not to mention I‚Äôm always looking on here anyway? It‚Äôs funny how people that know me wonder how I always run into stuff buying or selling and I do it with such ease. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm missing something? 

In closing I‚Äôve adopted a philosophy of: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy anything that I can‚Äôt sell down the line‚Äù I don‚Äôt think that would have ever have happened without CL?",5
10,"Unusable: Not only is this app glitchy (problems navigating the site with a VPN and issues loading the app), but it also doesn‚Äôt let you sell electronics, apparently. I listed a game system on this site and was then later told that my listing got removed. ‚ÄúThis posting has been flagged for removal. [?]‚Äù Not sure why my listing got taken down. All I did was upload a photo of my item, wrote a description, put down a price, the city, state, and zip-code of my location, and went through all that effort only to see that message several hours later after posting. I am NEVER using this marketplace again. I have better luck selling stuff on FB MARKETPLACE over this hunk of junk. Go ahead and accuse me of WHATEVER wrongdoing you think I‚Äôm up to. But I‚Äôm just a normal guy trying to make some extra cash to pay my rent, which is due next week. The least you guys could‚Äôve done was warn me about it and take the time to resolve the issue through customer service, but you guys don‚Äôt even have that as an option! Thanks for making my life a lot more difficult than it needs to be. I do not recommend this app nor this website to anyone. Thanks a lot for nothing.",1
11,"Rental listings: The listings are well organized but craigslist doesn‚Äôt screen well enough for unscrupulous people using fake listings who are scammers looking to get your personal data. They want all your credit info. - they say this for Before they will meet you to show you a property, and they have nothing to do with the actual Property. They say they are having you pay for a credit check to a company but it is a scam company- the money you pay is not credited towards the rent since there is not actually a rental- and they take that money, along with your credit data to access more of your money. Make sure who you are dealing with are real people with an office and honest credit check company. If the price seems too good to be true- be wary. They often have multiple listings in multiple towns with different names and phone numbers. But some of the descriptions are almost word for word identical and sometimes the photos looking outside the windows don‚Äôt even look like So Cal landscaping- they look East coast trees and shrubs.",3
12,"Lets face it, not what it used to be: Sadly Craigslist had been drowning in the noise of FB marketplace, offer up, and other services and ita really anmoying because we‚Äôve shifted feom local back to national or global which basically pushes everyone back to ebay. We dont need all the other apps and facebook couldve nought craigslist instead and integrated it. 

I only use CL or eBay and id give this 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt a dying app. Selling locally should always be free and Craigslist should consider changing it to compete with eBay by allowing local pickup ads to all be free for personal and charging similar rates to ebay for the item that sell through the app that get national or global exposure.

So basically those ads CL would‚Äônt allow any local pickup. Theyd get a cut of the postage, get 5% across the board for all national and global ads and if a person attempts to undermine the paid ad they are blocked from sharing any email or phone number and must use in app communications. 

Personal contact info wouldn‚Äôt be displayed or accessible in the paid ads like it is in the local ads. 

Similar to eBay but the choice to sell local for free is available. I know it would revive the CL platform. 

Imagine if ebay made a local area ad possible that had no fees? Craigslist would become non-existent. This is why they need to do something now beforesomeone else does.

I hope they do something id like to see this idea implemented I know it would be a success.",3
13,"Good free advertising: Sold a few items on here! Amazing how everyone wants things for nothing but there is people that have a appreciation for things and know what they cost. Met a lot of great people on here but some scammers too!
Had a few higher end items on here and it shocked me how many scammers I came across. Did some reading up on the subject which helped and I saw through most. Some scammers were just like what I read about to the letter. On the most part people on here are honest but there is a few that messed up some things with the scams. Found some good deals myself in the process. I put things on here then with some spare time I would search for certain things and to my surprise I found them or even something better at a good price. After all, one person‚Äôs junk is another person‚Äôs treasure, sometimes!",5
14,"Craigslist is my go to place when I want to give away good stuff and no hassels: Whenever I‚Äôm wanting to get rid of things I don‚Äôt need anymore, or the kids grew out of‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt donate to charity, (they charge too much! I donate to my community by posting it in Modesto Craigslist free stuff, I just box or bag it up, post it as a curb alert, and someone who‚Äôs in need comes picks it up! That simple no hassels, but my number 1 rule of thumb is‚Ä¶ I never give what I wouldn‚Äôt receive. In other words, I don‚Äôt post about ‚Äújunk‚Äù if it‚Äôs stained or something I wouldn‚Äôt want.. I throw it away, I always post good items that are clean, working order. There‚Äôs nothing worse than going to pick up and you realize it‚Äôs just dirty trash! So always remember to give what you would like to receive. Craigslist is an awesome outlet to do the good works you need to do

15,"Works Great!: Easy to use and looks good, better than using CL on the browser. There‚Äôs easy tabs for navigating and you can easily manage postings and see which are active and renew with one click. Photos upload easily. Switching around photos to change which is the primary is MUCH easier on the app than in browser where you have to do touch screen acrobatics to move photos around. My only issue isn‚Äôt with the app but Craigslist in general and that‚Äôs the vague rules about pet posts and ‚Äúfree to good homes‚Äù, whether they‚Äôre allowed or not and there‚Äôs some algorithm that either deletes rehoming posts immediately based on certain words? or users are allowed to spend hours just flagging any ads that compete with their home-based animal rescue. Either way, the real victims are the animals that people end up abandoning because there‚Äôs no easy way to find good new homes.",4
16,"Great ... would love a couple of updates: I would like a way to keep the same filters when I move the map to a different area. Sometimes this works but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs by default. Also, it would be nice if there were a bit more vetting going on with regard to contacting sellers etc. The fishing is truly out of hand. It seems some of the scammers are hiding behind what used to be solid security measures. Perhaps a consumer/seller rating system would also be of use. Reinvention is the mother of transparency. Old complacent ideas make room for all kinds of mischief. Maybe a simple ‚Äúwe‚Äôre you able to getting this seller/merchant on the phone‚Äù pop up. Then yes or no. Several ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù would lead to bad ratings and perhaps some pinpointing and further eliminating this round of scammers who‚Äôve infiltrated the system. 

Thanks so much. Otherwise, great app.",4
17,Flayed: I posted a listing for rehoming my kitty‚Ä¶ I follow Craigslist‚Äôs rules‚Ä¶ I asked for a $25 rehoming fee because I got her fixed chipped and her vacations‚Ä¶. I got a message from a guy saying he is interested in getting her‚Ä¶ we made plans to meet up at a public place‚Ä¶ once it came time to meet he would say that he isn‚Äôt sure if he should get her and he would text me like crazy like he knew me and wanted to date me even though I told him I‚Äôm married‚Ä¶ when I didn‚Äôt respond back to him right away he would blow up my phone asking if I‚Äôm ok and that I need to answer him right away because he was worried‚Ä¶. So I blocked him and he kept flagging my post and I had to keep reposting my ad‚Ä¶ so I had to wait for a couple of weeks to repost my post‚Ä¶ I kept trying to contact Craigslist and they never got back to me‚Ä¶.

19,"Decent, Useful: I turned to this app bc my preferred app for navigating Craigslist does not function properly anymore. I was happy to find an official CL app. While it does not have all the features I‚Äôm used to, it is a decent app that is very useful. The one improvement that it really needs is an alternative way of handling seeing more ads by the same user. Once you click that option and see the ads by the same user, removing that filter doesn‚Äôt return you to where you were in the list of ads you were originally viewing. Rather, it boots you back to the top of the list. That discourages me from using the option to view other ads by the same user bc I don‚Äôt want to then have to scroll past ads I‚Äôve already seen. To the developer: please find a way to preserve viewing location when this filter is removed.",4
20,"Everything that I listed has sold. Cars, trailers and ATV: It is very easy to list an item. When adding pictures the app walks you through step-by-step. It is user-friendly, even if you‚Äôve never sold anything before.. I‚Äôve probably been using it 10 years sold over a dozen & half cars, trailers, ATVs, and a few other items. You do have the occasional scammer wanting your information, so they can ‚Äúsend you a certified check. Just tell him you only communicate through the phone and only take cash.  I put in the listing we will meet at the sheriffs department here where I live. Most law enforcement agencies actually have sections in their parking lots for people to buy and sell items to make sure neither of you are a victim of crime. I Highly recommend this app!",5
21,"An excellent resource: If you into being patient and looking through a bunch of the same thing over and over until you find awesome unique items, materials and like a glittering gem in the dirt you spring on it like a rabid badger‚Ä¶ yeah it‚Äôs like that.. if you can wait for the items you want but would rather not buy new, you can almost always find them cheaper and sometimes you can get them free.  Also seasonal loads of cute farm animals for (often) very good prices.  

As a parent of young kids this app has been invaluable on so many occasions, art supplies, toys, art supplies, sports gear‚Ä¶.art supplies‚Ä¶.very often large lots from other parents clearing out the stuff their kid used 1 time. Often free‚Ä¶ so you should look at the free stuff like 2-4 times a week seriously",5
22,"Too many multiple duplicate dealer adds: There are way to many dealers allowed to fill CL listings with their multiple adds for the same vehicles. They purposely inflate the values and spread their overpriced vehicles so much that it makes it hard to find the actual real people trying to sell real actual normally priced vehicles, they can try and sell their over inflated price vehicles but they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to purchase so many adds that it makes it almost impossible to even sell a regular vehicle for a regular price because people never get to see the real non dealer junk adds, there should be some limits especially to dealers, this isn‚Äôt the Sunday paper where one can just spend money on advertising. Dealers should pay more and NOT be allowed to run duplicate adds. Dealers should have to follow the rules and should have to register as a dealer. And if they run adds then it should be labeled dealer and treated as an add at an additional advertising cost.",2
23,"A Wonderful Sale-&-Purchase Website: . .  and Nationwide !  I like the initial anonymity with potential buyers.

I have had much success recently with the Craigslist app in market research, commerce, and business. Though Craigslist still censors the sales of certain legal items, they do not seem to exhibit the same political censorship propagated by the tech giants. I am grateful that there is an outlet that wagers less political agendas and focuses more on fair business practices (although there is still something missing from their market...)

When selling buying, they do not add advertising in any of their platforms nor Monthly subscription, we the customers should value this greatly. Hope they do not change their company Culture.

I‚Äôve gotten most of my day jobs from replying to posts on Craigslist. Jobs I have stayed with for years and made good money with. I‚Äôve also bought and sold items. 

One thing that does bother me is that dog breeders post on CL even though they are not supposed to. We have a MAJOR problem with pet overpopulation and we don‚Äôt need greedy animal exploiters adding to the problem.

Then a friend suggested Craigslist, so I figured I‚Äôd try. I had a number of potential buyers inquire that were knowledgeable and knew what they wanted, then I had a guy call that knew exactly what he wanted, he came over, checked the bike out, took it for a ride and we made a deal on the spot.

Keep items out of the landfill and out of junkyards, by giving away to people in need, sometimes make a few bucks. I‚Äôve used for many farm animals and household items.

30,"Craigslist works GREAT: I have used Craigslist for many years now to both buy and sell items. Unlike other online marketplaces Craigslist is simple to use yet has all the features needed. And best of all it does NOT have any advertising AND it is free.
The one drawback, which is true of ALL online marketplaces is that every buyer wants to negotiate a lower price to pay for items, it‚Äôs NOT like a store where there is a sticker with a set price. So, I recommend that you increase your asking price in order to have room to maneuver.
And just use common sense, like, meet in a public place, maybe have a friend with you, things like that.
Craigslist is a GREAT way to buy, sell and find all kinds of useful items.

I have bought and sold so much stuff using it that I have become a daily shopper (albeit window shopping for the most part). One major complaint: previous versions allowed starred, or favorited, items to remain in the favorites list AFTER they were sold. While still visible, they were marked as sold, so that you could see that your favorite guitar or wood stove got away from you before you could pull the trigger. Not anymore. When something is sold from your favorites list, it disappears. And everyone knows you can‚Äôt see what isn‚Äôt there. Worse, you can‚Äôt remember.

All jokes aside, and in complete honesty, I‚Äôm a big fan of Craigslist. Especially the app. The recent update to search a larger radius to your location is one off my favorites. It seems like a lot of people view interactions through this site/app as being super sketch, but my experience over more than a decade has been anything but. Sure, there‚Äôs some oddballs out there. But the ability to barter, buy, sell, or just give away with people in your region and beyond is unmatched.",5
35,"I am getting obsessed using the app!: Long time using CL web page; then found a sellers app, and slowly i became lazy to post things in CL as it was not as practical as the competitor app; last week I noticed the app option, decide to try it, and i have been posting AND SELLING more than with the competitor. I am becoming addicted. Even though it can be tiring t repost if an ad expires, i do think it keeps CL cleaner and updated. Plus if it does not sell, it is an eye opening and the price should be lowered; if a seller forgets to reply to an active post, the expiration helps clean up CL sellers from useless to those actually interested. Oh, and i am still finding tricks around the app that are so helpful. Thanks.",5
36,"Multiple business postings: Craigs list works great for selling personal items that still have value. However, allowing businesses that sell on your website, even though they pay a fee, should be limited to very few multiple listings of the same item. Allowing automobile dealerships to list 20 or 30 of the same vehicle, one posting after another, only creates a site where searches are annoyingly cumbersome. This behavior most likely won‚Äôt produce greater sales and in fact, is so intrusive, it probably creates more of a backlash against these businesses. I would never buy from a company who‚Äôs whose business practice is to advertise the same item countless times on your website.",5
37,"Gigs: For years I‚Äôve used Craigslist‚Äôs. It is literally one of the most useful app on the whole internet. With anything from wares to furniture and more, it provides a place for you to barter confidently. On top of that, it allows you to shop for available apartments or homes which I‚Äôve utilized multiple times. My favorite aspect of CL is the the job and gig section. Here you are able to post and ad or search through ads from other peoples postings. It can either be a day, couple of days, or a new position all together, still, being a person who‚Äôs relied a lot on many cash jobs over the years, Craigslist has literally kept me paid. For that I say, Thank you. You are truly a life saver. Amen.",5
38,"It‚Äôs great having a dedicated and well-featured iOS Craigslist app: Having the ability to create an account to consolidate your listings certainly makes Craigslist much m more approachable and simple to use compared to the old way. I haven‚Äôt decided if that‚Äôs a good or bad thing, but Craigslist is far from the top of the list of privacy concerns feel i should address. 

The chat is helpful and easy to use as well. I understand not allowing any web links in the chat, but i do wish internal links to other Craigslist ads were allowed. The only time i found myself asking for the chat recipients phone number in order to bypass the chat was to send Craigslist links. 

If you use Craigslist then this is probably the best way to go about that.",4
39,"One of my most used apps: As someone who is a huge scavenger, I LLVE craigslist. I could scroll for hours looking at all the random free stuff, the plants and animals for sale in farm & garden, the things people are willing to trade in exchange for ______ (whatever they‚Äôre looking for), and the different houses and apartments for sale. I also believe that all but one of the jobs I‚Äôve ever had, I found on Craigslist. There‚Äôs something for everybody. When I found out they had an app, I was so excited. I finally don‚Äôt have to type in their site (just kidding, it‚Äôs bookmarked) & re-select my area every time I want to scroll through the site. I open it multiple times a day, and it‚Äôs the first place I look for almost anything. Thanks for the great app.",5
40,"Find what you need sell what you don‚Äôt: Craigslist still works good. There is always going to be people that try and ruin a good thing. Just be aware of the scammers. Once you know how they operate it‚Äôs easy to detect them . Don‚Äôt let them keep you from selling your stuff. Not to worry they usually aren‚Äôt selling anything just trying to get you to ship whatever your selling to  them with all kinds of excuses. I have met lots of real nice people just from buying & selling items, just use your head and if it sounds to good to be true it probably is. 
Thanks Craigslist for having such a place you can find just about anything you want and sell whatever it is and it‚Äôs all for free!",5
41,"Craigslist: The Craigslist app is very helpful and convenient. We responded to an add about a puppy and received a response w the same day within a few hours. To be able to find the product and or service I need locally and in surrounding areas makes shopping for certain services and products more attainable. We love Craigslist and we will continue to post our products and also buy the things we need. It saves money. It is a convenient way to shop. I can get home from work, lay down in my bed and shop. That‚Äôs huge. Many times the things we need can be found here on Craigslist. I can price them and find the right bargain. It‚Äôs great. Thank you Craigslist.",5
42,"This App Is Nearly Perfect: I use this when I have something that‚Äôs perfectly serviceable that I no longer need and I have to part with.

I don‚Äôt know what price to sell them for and I detest haggling, so I put them on the free forum.

The app streamlines the posting preparation to achieve the results I want:

1. Directs me to provide common information (like dimensions) so that the reader can easily find and verify whether this will meet their needs.

2. I provide as much personal information as I desire. If I want, I can say ‚Äúfirst one here gets it‚Äù and leave the item out so that I don‚Äôt even need to be home processing a stream of emails or phone calls. And they make it trivial to remove the post immediately so others don‚Äôt waste their time.

3. I live in a hard to find location. The app addresses this by letting me place a pin precisely on a map. 

I try to use this app as conscientiously as the developers were in piecing it together. I have made friends with people who found items they‚Äôve always wanted but never thought they‚Äôd have. This app has made my life better.",5
43,"One big complaint: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for many years and I‚Äôve watched the platform  develop to be very organized and stay user friendly.  I really appreciate the content and use it often. But I have one big complaint that seems like it would be easy for you to fix on your end.  It is the duplicate post found in some categories.  The car and truck sales is the worst. I‚Äôve seen a dealer post the same add over 30 times.  Actually I just thought of another complaint. Post that have something for sale but instead of putting the for sale price they put a rental cost in this field. To trick people into opening up there post.  Knock it off people. 
Ok that‚Äôs it
Thank you Craigslist",4
44,"Absolutely brilliant!: I live abroad and recently returned to my previous US city to clear out a storage space. Using an eSIM & craigslist, I was able to find specifically interested takers for a wide range of used items. 

The app works flawlessly, combining all the functionality of the craigslist website from 10 years ago with new features and functions (like chat) that made listing and connecting even easier.

As a social service, it is tremendous. Instead of dumping useful items in the trash or on the street or the thrift store, I was able to quickly place them with people who needed them. Keep up the great work, craigslist!",5
45,"2005 Audi A8 Quattro L: 2005 Audi A8 Quattro L in mint condition. Very nice car for someone who has time to fix a couple minor things. Engine and transmission is very strong and reliable. New brakes and rotors, new timing belt, new water pump and thermostat. Ac and heat just serviced so that‚Äôs perfectly working. Rear suspension just gave out, radio comes on and off which is most likely an Mmi piece ( est 100$ ). Needs to be smogged, minor leak causing failure. I gave the car to my 17 year son for his birthday and I‚Äôm selling basically to get him something more feasible for him to drive everyday and not worry about fixing a German automobile ‚Ä¶ asking 5k or best offer. Car just needs to be detailed via carpet, also has 20 inch Dub rims on it ‚Ä¶. Contact me for viewing",5
46,"Craigslist is great for buying cars too!: I bought the best, most reliable used car that I have ever owned on Craigslist about 3 years ago. It was my first experience with the service and I have been as happy as a lark. That must be really happy because my Grandmother always said that expression when comparing people showing happiness. I was 52 years old when I purchased that car. Best auto purchase ever, new or used! And I may be looking for my next car purchase which will probably be a Mustang. I‚Äôve always wanted a fast, if not collectible Mustang. I already have my eye on a Mustang SVT Cobra. Thank you to all the folks at Craigslist from Rick Lancaster. You guys are the best!",5
47,"My post!: I‚Äôve always had good luck with Craigslist! I‚Äôve sold pretty much everything I‚Äôve ever listed! You must beware of people wanting to give you any kind of check or C/C! Because anyone can dispute transaction anytime 2 months from now & then you may have to go to court or pick up your merchandise because the banks have the Power to pull it out of your account! Good luck with that!!! If they say they got a check or C/C I always said, good go cash it & bring me cash!!! No matter how convincing Just Say NO! If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre screwed period! Good luck to you they‚Äôre Crazy out there! If it‚Äôs something very valuable? Get a Lawyer period!
A warning to the wise is sufficient! Good day!",5
48,Sold my Mountain Bike in a couple of hours on Craig‚Äôs List: I listed my mountain bike on Craig‚Äôs List this morning and immediately got contacted by 5 people wanting to see it today. The first person who came bought it. It was a good deal but I had it listed for a few days on Offer Up and FB marketplace. Lots of interest but only a few people followed through and 2 offered to buy it at full price then tried to haggle me down once they came to see it even though I said the price was firm. I do not know if this is because of where I listed or not but the Craig‚Äôs List response was swift and the people who responded were genuinely interested in buying it. Thank you!,5
49,"My eternal  go to: I started using craigslist when I first came out it must‚Äôve been freaking 20 years ago and it‚Äôs been nothing but a pleasure all the buying and selling and people I‚Äôve met by such interactions in all of these years. I remember when Craigs list was getting so good and some white on the present that local newspapers like the San Francisco chronicle is losing its revenue from buying and selling and even relationships on  newspapers; but let‚Äôs face it even for an old timer like me that all technology didn‚Äôt really work in this quicker more efficient world. My hat is off to you Craig, thanks for having such vision and continuing to deliver such a fine product!!!",5
50,"Give Aways/Curb Alerts: Other than the usual spam and scam criminals, I‚Äôve always liked Craigslist for its simplicity and I‚Äôve always given things away easily. They text and say they want it and we set it outside for them. No worries about having strangers inside your home and less trips to donation centers for me!  I don‚Äôt do social media platforms so Craigslist is perfect for me. People are usually looking for something specific so it‚Äôs easier for them to find it on here rather than scouring Goodwill and thrift stores. If I do sell something, for safety,  I make sure my husband can be home when the buyer comes to get it. Don‚Äôt go away Craigslist!!!",5
51,"Craigslist is great: I have used this service since they came out. Saves money and time of listing in a paper. I do wish they would move more toward facebooks market place ( I don‚Äôt have a fb account and will never as it‚Äôs garbage) or add features like Offer up where you can see how many are interested, but other than that cannot complain.   

Since this review was left CL now charges 5$ for autos which is still a good deal but I heard the reason for the charge was to cut down on bots and spammers but I still had several so just be careful and only deal in person - no money transfers unless you personally know the individual.",5
52,"Easy Ad placement - successful transaction: I hadn‚Äôt tried to sell something on Craigslist in many years and gave it a try here, even though I wasn‚Äôt sure of how successful I‚Äôd be.  I didn‚Äôt post ads anywhere else.  As a word of caution,  I found my ad to get attention immediately from a scammer but I was able to figure them out when they asked me to ship the item (which I explicitly said I wouldn‚Äôt) and they wouldn‚Äôt pay cash.  On the plus side, I had several real buyers interested and found selling my item very easy in the end.  A lot of people still peruse Craigslist quite a bit (something I wasn‚Äôt sure of before posting)!",5
53,"Craigslist. Org works!: I just moved into a new apartment in the city. I had a number of things I needed to get out of my apartment because it was no room for everything. So I put everything out on the sidewalk and put up an ad and labeled everything and within a day everything was gone except one folding table and the next day the folding table was gone. One of my housemates joked that it looked like there was a full living room sitting on the sidewalk! So I went to craigslist, looked under sales, and went to the for free section. It was great to see that my things that were still useful being taken by people excited to have them.",5
54,"An option to find various things to do.: This app has been around, and it has gotten better. Some may feel the need to dismiss the potential in this app, however I urge you to reconsider. This app has great potential to be even more versatile given that it is free to use, and those who implement it in their projects and tasks to reach out to like-minded individuals, can achieve more, once a common ground is established. Be mindful of the warnings provided by the company, and do good, and this app and its purpose can provide many benefits to all who incorporate it into their routine, without hindering each other in the process.",5
55,"Smooth and Successful Sale of Camper Trailer: I recently sold my camper trailer on Craigslist, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the experience. Although it took some time, the process was straightforward and effective. The platform allowed me to reach a wide audience, and I received several inquiries from serious buyers.
The communication tools provided by Craigslist made it easy to connect with potential buyers and arrange viewings. I appreciated the ability to manage my listing and update it as needed. In the end, I found the perfect buyer, and the transaction went smoothly.
I highly recommend Craigslist for anyone looking to sell their items. Patience and persistence paid off, and I‚Äôm thrilled with the outcome!",4
56,"Thought I would never switch from the beloved web: Over the last ten years, CL has done a great job of keeping their webpage simple and functional during a UX arms race, even as they ad functionality. So I thought that I would never switch to the app. Now I find myself using it more and more.

There are a few features that really sing in a touchscreen environment. For example, if you‚Äôre looking for an apartment, dragging your search area on the map is a wonderful way to look exactly where you want. On the other hand, you can‚Äôt see a thumbnail of your future apartment from the map view, so there is still a lot of room for improvement.

If you use Craigslist, get the app. It‚Äôs as simple as that.",4
57,"Skid Row of the Web: After almost 20 years of being notoriously known for aiding in the sex worker/ human trafficking nothing hasn‚Äôt changed for Craigslist. 2 nights ago I made 2 posts offering to provide vital business information for entrepreneurs they were both deleted. Of course I will have to be paid for my services and information. Yet, Craigslist DELETED both posts. 
   Out of sheer curiosity I scrolled to see what they DID PERMIT on their platform. Lo and behold , COUNTLESS solicitation posts. Even add telling people how the Feds/Cops monitor Craigslist and how to get around them . They also provided the WEBSITE to use instead. 
    Your reputation hasn‚Äôt changed because you refuse to change what you‚Äôre doing. Which indicates to me that you are okay with solicitation and human trafficking. You‚Äôre not okay with professionals trying to make legitimate business transactions. Disgusting!",1
58,"Selling garden tractor and other items: It‚Äôs funny everybody told me to put all these items on Facebook marketplace. In the past I have been very successful with craigslist sewing things that are home related. Furniture mostly. But my husband passed away earlier this year and I have the responsibility of selling tools and equipment, that I‚Äôm not that familiar with. Consistently I have done very well w Craigslist.  I am particularly fond of the free stuff. So many things I would‚Äôve had to of paid for a dumpster and taking the time to load the dumpster. I put it on craigslist free stuff and it‚Äôs gone usually within hours. Love it love it love it",5
59,"Sold Womens Schwinn Bike.: Craigs list was easy to use and to upload photos as well.   I made use of the range in miles listing knowing that people would not travel great distances for a low cost bike.  This is a good feature and kind of screens out unneeded inquiries that are too far.  Case in point.  One person who expanded their search range contacted me but realized it was way too far as that person didn‚Äôt have a car for pick up and realized riding a bike from NY City to South Central New Jersey did not make sense.  Anyway, Craigs List works well and is free except for cars, RV‚Äôs etc.  And that small fee helps with keeping out scammer listings.",5
60,"Me & my little cousins made a million bucks on CL.: At least I think we did. We were drinkin ice cold beers and got stinkin Drunk. I seem to remember we made a million bucks selling sexy photos of our big fat beer potbelly's on Craigslist to some super models visiting from France that wanted to score with us. And then we spent every dime of that sweet $krilla on more of those good ice cold beers and got even drunker. 
But maybe all that didn‚Äôt happen. Maybe I wet dreamed it. I just don‚Äôt remember because I was stinkin Drunk. However I do know for a fact that my binary stepmom came over and took a big dump on our couch because she was mad we drank all her ice cold beers too.",5
61,Renting a room couldn‚Äôt be easier: CraigsList is a terrific service. It is easy to add images and text to your listing and best of all it gets many views. It is also easy to fine tune and repost to get more hits as its rankings declines through the week. Biggest issue finding renters are the renters themselves. After they contacted me potential renters were more likely to choose an appointment time they couldn‚Äôt make then they could. Repeatedly I waited over an hour for them to arrive to see the room.  The person that I chose to rent the room was the only one that actually did arrive on time.,5
62,"Good not quite perfect.: Pretty simple to post however contact information may not be obviously displayed. Tried checking the post after posting but when opening Craigslist website with chrome on my phone, it automatically started the Craigslist app. In the app I couldn‚Äôt see my post to check my contact info. Asked my wife to check the posting on her phone via the website and saw the posting so not sure if the app is buggy or there‚Äôs a delay before the post shows up on the app. Asked my wife if she saw my contact info but couldn‚Äôt find it so not very obvious. Anyway sold my item quickly so happy for that.",4
63,"Craigslist still number ONE!!!: They say that the simple things in life are the best. And what could be simpler than using Craigslist?  I get so tired of the other sites that can be so convoluted and difficult to use, with their passwords, downloading apps   etc.   Craigslist is the perfect tool for - reaching out to your local community. Give me Craigslist over FleaBay any day. Uh Oh, there seems to at least one flaw, I can‚Äôt post this review unless I have a nickname and everything I try is already taken. Hmmmm. Guess why I don‚Äôt have vanity plates on my car?  Craigslist say it ain‚Äôt so- you‚Äôre wasting my time aaaargh.",5
64,"Works, but needs improvement: I‚Äôm pleased at some of the changes CL has made to Craigslist in general but it could use more especially in regards to spam, scams, and garbage posting. Especially in the gigs section. A simple solution is requiring payment for all posts listing employment or for sale items. And of course gigs. If someone has to pay something for an add it‚Äôs less likely to be fraudulent. And by having to provide some personal information if you‚Äôre up to no good more information could lead to prosecution of these individuals. Lets clean CL up for the safety of its users. We‚Äôve all heard about what can happen and the multitude of scammers using CL. I fell victim to one, fortunately I didn‚Äôt suffer to much and recouped my loss.",3
65,"Please restore the DATING  section: I'm writing to express my disappointment regarding the removal of the dating section from the Craigslist app. As a longtime user of your platform, I've found the dating section to be a valuable resource for meeting new people and forming connections.

The dating section provided a unique and accessible avenue for individuals to explore potential romantic relationships, friendships, and social connections. Its absence from the app has left many users, including myself, feeling a sense of loss and frustration.

I understand that there may have been reasons behind the decision to remove the dating section, but I believe that its restoration would greatly benefit the Craigslist community. Not only would it enhance the user experience and increase engagement with the app, but it would also cater to the diverse needs and interests of your user base.

I urge you to reconsider your decision and restore the dating section in the Craigslist app. Doing so would demonstrate your commitment to meeting the needs of your users and maintaining Craigslist as a versatile and inclusive platform for connecting people.
Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to seeing the dating section reinstated in the app soon.",1
66,"Generation X!: Despite the influx of spam and false positives, Craigslist remains an effective platform, especially for those from my generation, Generation X. In my experience, buyers and sellers from this era are still sophisticated and reliable leads. 

While there may be a bit of a standoff as you get comfortable with each other, once a connection is made, it's solid. You know you're not dealing with a child. Craigslist is still my go-to platform when I need to flip something on their marketplace.

Thank you, Craigslist, for continuing to provide a reliable space for serious transactions.",5
67,"Rental Property For Rent: Craigslist has come a long way in its rental property advertising.  It is now my go-to ‚ÄúFor Rent‚Äù advertising platform.  Once my ad is posted, I begin getting inquiries almost immediately.   They have created a new app for IOS that is first rate.  I can do all my property management from my iPad.

And lastly, I like the feature that automatically emails me Craigslist links to my saved search criteria for competition rental properties in my area.  It‚Äôs my #1 way to judge market conditions of rental properties.

My only negative is that it does not save uploaded pictures in archived posts.  They must be reloaded.",5
68,"Sold my 2004 xterra!: Craigslist was a great way to sell my vehicle! First thing I‚Äôve ever sold online & went well. Only cost me 5 bucks & took about 5 minutes to upload my info & pics for the add. It‚Äôs secure & easy! I like the ‚Äúchat‚Äù feature‚Ä¶great if you don‚Äôt look at your emails too often. Post lasts for 30 days. Renewed it once & just sat & watched the offers come in! My husband & I got to review the offers & reach out to the ones we felt comfortable with. Happy with the end result, sold our car & would do it again with other items! Thank you for this service ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
69,"Best app for CL that I‚Äôve used: This app works very well and gives me no problems after years of use. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is a few small things could improve. Auto-capitalization in text boxes seems to not work (even though it‚Äôs a built-in iOS feature the app seems to override that) and I think it could use a fresh coat of paint in terms of design. A little UI touch-up to modernize would go a long way. Not saying go overboard but but touching up the apps text design and formatting would be nice. Still solid for the core Craigslist features one would want with no crashes, even on beta versions of iOS.",4
70,"Thankful for Craigslist: In the middle of a move and Didn‚Äôt realize I have a lot of stuff to get rid of.I started taking pictures and posting on craigslist to help pay for my move with the stuff I don‚Äôt need any more. It is really easy to post stuff for sale and I‚Äôve had no problems with buyers. It‚Äôs Super easy to renew listings and make changes if needed. Best seller site I have ever used.I‚Äôm able to post everything from clothing, trampoline, speakers and more. I highly recommend craigslist. I have also bought unique one of a kind items in the past. Can‚Äôt get much better.",5
71,Really good appü§òüèøüôèüèø: I‚Äôve had this app for a while and have been using Craig‚Äôs list for a while before that when I didn‚Äôt have the app and I actually bought my first car but there is one thing though if you don‚Äôt know how to use the app there is a lot of spam of car rims which is very annoying and this is just me but I‚Äôd personally like you to be able to search farther than 250 miles maybe like the whole USA because I like to look at cars from all around but in conclusion really good app I‚Äôd recommend to anyone my friend also bought his first car there and it is also really easy to use.,5
72,"Can‚Äôt knock the original marketplace: This app is super user friendly versus trying to use Craigslist from a browser.  I have not had any issues with this app and I‚Äôve used it almost daily for 10+ years.  

I love Craigslist and the fact that it is still essentially a classified ad and best of all it‚Äôs still free.  Unlimited postings and the ability to hide your contact information and use anonymously.  

The only issue is with people misusing it and double posting, incorrectly listing an item or location spoofing.   Otherwise, it‚Äôs just as solid as day one.",5
73,"Unexplained Flagging and Removal of listed items!: It has been very frustrating trying to list items on Craigslist recently. For some reason when I list my golf cart for sale, within a few minutes Craigslist flags it and takes my listing down without any explanation as to why, whatsoever.  I have been a faithful Craigslist user and supporter for decades and have no idea what their complaint is, I use all of my own pictures, I am not a dealer, and I write all of my own descriptions, etc. I have absolutely no idea why CL keeps doing this. I am almost to the point of no longer using Craigslist. Does anyone know how I can talk to someone in administration to resolve this dilemma? Thank you.",3
74,"Lost prospective clients: Craigslist! I love ya and I‚Äôve been buying and selling with you for a long time.. that being said, a lot of your followers have left and gone to other platforms, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed, do you know why? I‚Äôll tell you, it because you got greedy and started charging for ads like selling cars. If you wanna charge the dealerships that‚Äôs cool but us little guys came to you and we‚Äôre loyal for so long because of the free ads. We feel betrayed, we‚Äôre not mad, we‚Äôre just disappointed. You let us down
We still love you but you need to be better",5
75,"Preferred way to sell stuff!: I still love Craigslist despite its past history of scammers and idiots. I just try to use the relay email address and I always email back with an email I‚Äôve set up for selling; not my personal email. I usually get at least one or two buyers asking questions, and once I‚Äôve emailed back and forth and feel I can trust  them, I set up a location like a nearby shopping center to meet to show the goods I am selling. And always ask for the cash before you hand over the merch. I have been successful this way. I now even offer delivery for a limited range and add‚Äôl deliver fee of $20 to $30. Great extra cash.",4
76,"Thank you: I like your service. Wish it was easier to log in online. But appreciate the security. Do get a lot of scam/spam messages when I first post an ad. They ask for codes and want to send cashiers check and they all say the same thing and usually see from out of town numbers that can‚Äôt be traced. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything you can even do about that just thought I‚Äôd take the opportunity to let you know. 
But thank you. Craigslist is how I make a living. I have a small farm and I have a scrap pick up business and a resale business so I couldn‚Äôt make it without you guys. Thanks again",4
77,"if you have patience, craigslist is great!: I have been selling things on craigslist for many years. I know other people may have had trouble with scams, but I have never had that problem. I guess I should mention that I have also been buying things on Craigslist for many years too with no problems. The reason I say having patience is that many times it takes a month for me to sell something. Sometimes I have to relist it and sometimes I have to drop the price. I have always been able to sell on craigslist.",5
78,"Great app, except for setting range and maps...: I like the app a whole lot, but the range selection for distance from location is a bit counter intuitive and uses unusual numbers... instead of hitting (+) to increase range, (+) increases zoom on the map.  Instead of going in say 10 or 15 mile increments, the increments are not so logically laid out.  They probably make sense in some mathematical way, but I haven‚Äôt looked for the relationship yet.  Other than that, it is easy to use, delivers pertinent results and a well laid out format.

Another issue is that it doesn‚Äôt interface with Apple Maps very well unless a specific address is already provided.",4
79,"Great app to sell stuff: I have been using Craigslist online for years to sell my stuff. But it was always a bit problematic to update my postings using the internet version. Especially when my schedule was too busy to get onto my computer. 

I still prefer to post new items on my computer, because I can have a record of what I sold. However, I really love this app for several reasons.

First, it‚Äôs great to be able to check the text of the ad when someone inquires about something. I can double-check the original cost of an item as described in my ad. And I can verify my asking price.

Second, I can renew ads that are already posted. Or I can delete an ad once I sell an item. And I don‚Äôt have to log onto the internet or access a computer to do it. 

Third, I don‚Äôt have to remember my login and password. I just enter them one time after I install the app, and then I can access my account at anytime. Online, I have to remember both every time I access my info.",4
80,Posting: Craigslist has been an amazing site for me to be able to post things. It‚Äôs kind of old school which makes it easier and user-friendly for people my age. The only down to it is that it‚Äôs not monitored enough in the community and the pet section that people decide that there‚Äôs competitors so they report the ad. And prevent good animals from finding good homes. That‚Äôs the only change I would like to see is a moderator that looks into things instead of being we‚Äôre just anybody can report an ad to have it removed.,5
81,"The only place I advertise my apts when they are available: I have had 100% luck using Craigslist to advertise when I have an apt available. As a landlord you should have rental applications , some type of lease agreement. I run credit checks and background checks , references. How careful you are is up to you! I had over 30 applications for one apt this time 2022, and you have to act early to be considered in this rental market. Biggest concern is can the person afford this high rental market? 
Ask for proof. There are very few apts available in our area. Good luck!",5
82,Great way to sell: It took 10 days and a half dozen potential buyers but my box trailer sold. Craigs list did a good job of connecting me with potential buyers who were diligent enough to get past all of the high priced trailer dealers who listing appear first. It was difficult for me to find my own listing because of all the noise from dealers. There were also two people who contacted me saying that wanted to buy my trailer who actually just wanted me to remove my listing. Presumably to make their listing have less competition. Beware of anyone offering to mail a cashier‚Äòa check without having see what you are selling.,4
83,"Super helpful site, just be smart: Craigslist can be an incredible resource for helping you find all kinds of things in your area. Just be smart about spotting fake ads and bot replies to your ads. If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it probably is. Although that being said, I have gotten some absolutely amazing free stuff through craigslist. If they ask for any of your own personal information, or ask you to go to a third-party site, it‚Äôs probably a scam. Otherwise, craigslist has been an incredibly valuable tool for finding resources.",5
84,"Craigslist vs the up and comers: I have used Craigslist for several years intermittently whenever I needed to see something that would work better for someone else. I am not a professional ‚Äúonline seller‚Äù.
Having been told by a ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù that CL was old school, I thought that I would give the others a try as a seller. 
They fell short compared to CL. The security of CL, from it‚Äôs platform design to the excellent advice to avoid scams made me feel more comfortable.
Especially important is the quality of buyers I have met. The serious ones are like good neighbors. They use their real names! I have always welcomed them to my home to complete the sale.
The other apps seemed to bring some very dubious characters, hiding behind contrived identities. I do not conduct business with fake identities.
Last but probably most importantly is the chance of selling. Again, CL has always been the most successful selling platform for me.",5
85,"So much better than FB Markteplace!: I have had a lot more success with Craigslist than other social media marketplaces. The app makes it very easy. I like that there are not auto reply options, because marketplace gives me a lot of messages that end up going nowhere because everyone is just clicking the canned replies. Craigslist tends to attract the more serious buyers, and it has been successful at selling my larger, more expensive items. I highly recommend. In fact, I am going to tell my mom to list her patio table on Craigslist and not FB!",5
86,"Great App: This app is great. You only find what you are searching for as opposed to the Facebook Marketplace app, which gives search results no where close to what you search for. For example, type in ‚ÄúHalfbike‚Äù in the Craigslist app and most of the time you won‚Äôt find anything because a Halfbike is a rare item. With Facebook Marketplace you‚Äôll get bikes and bicycle accessories and maybe a Halfbike somewhere down pages and pages of what you‚Äôre not looking for.
Too bad people have gotten away from using Craigslist to sell stuff.",5
87,"Flagging: Sells can be done quickly and efficiently if everything wasn‚Äôt flagged. You may have to repost something multiple times before any success. It doesn‚Äôt give you any help as to what can stop it from being flagged or why, just that it‚Äôs against some rule. Which one? Who knows. It would be a great app if flags were reviewed and notified the poster why before being carried out. There is no rhyme or reason or effective system in place. You can literally go through and flag anything without cause and it‚Äôll be removed. Anyone can do it. I also think flagging privileges should be revoked after so many false flags, or that you are only allowed to flag so many a day/week. Anything is better than what‚Äôs going on now.",2
88,"Security: I like the process you have made on providing security against hackers. Recently before changes were made I was hacked by scammers and to reluctantly change my phone number after having it for approximately 16 years. I had to notify all my customers & had to order new business cards at a $40 expense. 
I like the email notifications but they could be delivered to sellers sooner also if your app had an alert to seller features that would be GREAT. I tried setting up a yahoo mail alert but unfortunately it alerts for ALL emails including scams. Hope this helps
Thanks",4
89,Super Site!!!: I am using this site to sell new and used items to avoid clutter at my home. Its been very successful for me and I came across many like minded people with same values as my own. Its an effective and prudent way to monetize assets that otherwise could become an overwhelming and space occupying burden at home. I highly recommend Craigslist app to every household . Try it and see for yourself how your piggy bank will get fatter and more space will become available for new items to be added to your home environment. A+++++üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•,5
90,"Easy to use, scam posts everywhere tho: Super handy to have an app instead of using the website. I have run across posts that stay ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the app even when they are deleted on the website so there is some lag there. Unfortunately CL also hasn‚Äôt found a way to identify scam posts very well. It‚Äôs especially concerning for housing ads because people looking for good prices for good housing can be too easily snagged by a scammer with stolen images of a property. Come on CL figure it out! Build a separate, more secure housing app or integrate with the others so people can avoid that crap it‚Äôs so annoying.",4
91,"Great service, app so so: I think Craigslist is an amazing service. I use it all the time for selling items. In general I find that things so much quicker than on Nextdoor. I find uploading pictures to be quite finicky both on the computer and using the mobile app. Often when I upload pictures the program turns them sideways for reasons I cannot understand, and the app does not allow me to fix the orientation of these photos either using the computer or the app on the mobile phone. I also find it uploading information on the app is much more difficult than uploading it on their website.",3
92,"Facebook Marketplace: So Yes I sold my Klipsch KSW-15 Sub! All original and in 99% perfect condition. But, I had to breakdown and drop the price two separate weeks. Nowadays it seems it‚Äôs nothing but LowBallers out there. Thankfully, the Guy bought it was a nice guy and he wasn‚Äôt a LowBaller. He benefitted from looking after the two price changes. Craigslist needs to figure out how to get some traffic back. Seems Facebook has taken some luster away from you. I don‚Äôt deal with them anymore. I cancelled my FB acct

Though this wasn‚Äôt an issue Per se, but he responded to picking them up after I gave him the address, but communication stopped after I told him what time? I asked him three times.. then half an hour later he responded. It was getting late, I wanted to make sure he was coming, otherwise I‚Äôd have to bring all 8 stands back in from the cold. I left them at driveway and he came. Kudos to Craigslist for keeping everyone safe with all of our transactions.",5
95,"Easy to buy and sell: Only complaint is the people trying to scam, spam and defraud you. Watch out for them. Great app, easy to set up, only issue I have seen so far is it‚Äôs tricky up loading images, I don‚Äôt have the issue memorized well enough to describe in detail but if you chose the wrong option to up load pics the app won‚Äôt see them. Also it‚Äôs easy to shuffle photos around once you have up loaded them, you can chose which one you want as your lead photo, touch and drag to move around.",5
96,"Craigslist is a wonderful community: I really enjoy using Craigslist for buying and selling within my vicinity.  The Craigslist community helps to reuse and reduce waste, and turn many things affordable.  The app has a Craigslist signature simple no-thrill user interface and is easy to navigate.  The reason I don‚Äôt give 5 stars is because there are merchants listing their services or items over and over and over again.  The software engineers at Craigslist should write repeated listing detection algorithm to prevent such people jamming the pages.",5
97,"Just DON‚ÄôT GET LOGGED OUT‚Ä¶: You‚Äôll have all your saved searches deleted.

At first blush, searching & browsing is simple and intuitive‚Ä¶a pleasure to use‚Ä¶but I haven‚Äôt dine much else, except contact some sellers. What I miss, and what prompted me to refresh my ancient CL account, is using the anonymous CL mail system as a shopper‚Ä¶used to be able to do that on the web, when logged in. App just opens your mail app, but doesn‚Äôt even select your CL account email‚Ä¶gotta do that manually. 

ALSO‚Ä¶what caused all this trouble just now was the UNINTUITIVE app config menus‚Äîtrying to figure out how to use the anonymizing system‚Äîbacking out of options that don‚Äôt behave as expected‚Äîand w/out warning, got logged out!!! BUGGY!!!",3
98,"Still great after 25+ years: I‚Äôve been using the craigslist site since the late 90‚Äôs but I love the app now. Very easy to list things right from my phone and I appreciate the detailed listing options that offer more granular control. For example, I just listed a garage sale and it was so easy to help people find me. It allowed me to highlight dayes and times as well as pinpointing my address. A great experience all around and still free (except a few categories like real estate and car listings)!",5
99,"The ‚Äúpromise of technology.‚Äù: I remember the first Apple computers back in the ‚Äò80‚Äôs and the big push to bring the Internet to everyone in the ‚Äò90‚Äôs. Technology was going to be the solution to all of our problems. ‚ÄúThe promise‚Äù didn‚Äôt really come true, in general, but there is one place online that generally completes the deal: Craigslist. It‚Äôs been a solid resource since the early days of the Internet. Thanks guys! CL made my life better, saved me resources, distributed goods from TP rolls to real estate, and connected me with like-minded communities.",5
100,"Always Successful: I am very appreciative of what is afforded me the opportunity to sell goods that others can still enjoy and get more out of. In a time where people can buy things so quickly and so expensive, why waste money on something that can still be found here and for so much less money.  Not everything needs to be new. It‚Äôs a lie we tell ourselves. This technology is actually good for all, and saves on needless landfill waste for products that can still be beneficial to others.",5
101,"My car posted for sale: My car posted started a little slow at first, and I had a car salesman mentioned to me to post it on CarGurus or Autotrader or a larger platform saying that Craigslist was to small and not enough people would see it, basically saying that I need to spend more money on the bigger sites to move the car!!!  Well he was WRONG!  After a little over a week or so I started to get hits from all over the south, southern and southwestern part of the U.S.  Car sold in 12 days!!!!!!",5
102,"Best experience out of others: I tried selling my computer in Facebook MarketPlace, OfferUp and eBay, and I had nothing but nightmares w/MarketPlace and OfferUp. From no-shows, to people demanding I send texts instead of communicating in the selling app; to people phishing and trying to sneak info out of me, it turned out that Craigslist was the only place where I encountered sincere and decent people.

103,"Craigslist.: I look a lot on here for pets and I‚Äôm looking for a pontoon boat for my husband.

You can tell by the way they are written also a lot of them have the same pics of the dogs they are selling ! Weird. !can‚Äôt Craigslist pick these out?  Otherwise. I have not complaints at all !! THINK ABOUT IT CRAIGSLIST!  Why do people have to post an ad to warn others of a scam. Isn‚Äôt that your responsibility?  
Anyway, thank you for the rest. GOD BLESS YA‚ÄôLL",4
104,The list is awesome: However there is someone that keeps removing posting for no apparent reason. The listing does not violate any rules of Craigslist having read the entire listing of what is not allowed.  Craigslist needs to step up and stop allowing removal of posting by who ever is doing this. There could very well be folks who would ban together for a class action lawsuit against Craigslist for violating its own terms of what can and can not be posted. It‚Äôs time for Craigslist to stop this activity.,5
105,"Works for me!: Craigslist is great for selling or giving away stuff you no longer want. I post things that are too big to ship, and usually have it gone within a few hours. Great place to post Curb Alerts too, always gone the same day! This platform has been around a long time and as long as you‚Äôre smart and meet at a public place or have the items in front of your house for pick up, then you will be happy with the quick turnaround!",5
106,"Long Time User 20+ years: 10 years ago Craigslist was the to go place to sell your stuff or buy stuff.  I have noticed more people use other platforms.  Less items are listed and it tougher to sell anything on Craigslist.  In some way I believe traffic has been on a serious decline.

I would like to see CL advertise their App more and focus on improving it.  Ban posts that include too many keywords.  For example a car dealership listing their vehicle for sale and including all the brands.  

You should bring back some old adult features that were removed with proper paid verifications.",3
107,"Now with more taps üòï: Why do developers not think about the fact that adding Taps / Clicks to established navigation is a BAD thing? It is the single most annoying thing about any update that there could be (next to the app just crashing).

For years the navigation to go back to the Saved Searches was a single tap, now it is several. Now if someone does several searches and then taps back, the navigation goes back one search. Another tap back and the navigation goes back another search.

The back button is no longer a back button to where you were in the App (like it has been for years), now it is just a search history button! Why would I ever want to go back to all the unhelpful search results I had just changed several times (because I didn‚Äôt find what I was looking for)? The answer is, I don‚Äôt!

If I tap back, I want to go back to my list of Saved Searches to check another saved search! Now I have to tap Search at the bottom again, then Saved Searches again at the top to get back to my list.

Please change it back!",1
108,"The best way to find and sell stuff: I have bought and sold 100‚Äôs of items off Craigslist 
It is better than Facebook marketplace. Way better, better filters. CL Ad‚Äôs have time limits and expire. Just be smart about when and where to meet people. Large sales go to banks and let them check to bills. Only take cash and read about what fake bills look like. A bank found one fake bill now motorhome sale, which was by random chance not on purpose by buyer.",5
109,"Spammers and low ballers: The biggest issues with Craigslist continues to be: 1) fake posts not getting removed. 2) people who low ball you making an offer sight unseen (response spammers). 3) incorrectly categorized posts. 4) no golf cart category. 

The third one could easily be fixed by having an optional pay-to-post with a matching filter. Sellers could choose to pay $1-2 per post and then users could filter out unpaid posts. As a buyer having the knowledge that someone paid for the post would tell me they are real and I would exclude everything else in searches. Selectively charging for some categories just causes sellers to intentionally post in the incorrect category.",2
110,"Very good, could make one huge improvement: App is very good, not glitchy as far as i can tell, but there could be one huge improvement: 

Real-time push notifications when something gets posted to a search you saved. I know there‚Äôs a feature for this, but i have seen one notification in the past three days (for like 50 new postings), and I would like it much better to have a notification for each posting. Can make a huge difference when multiple people are looking for the same thing. Thanks!",4
111,Craigslist car sale experience: Not a bad experience compared to other similar websites.  Dealing with the con artists can be challenging in the first two weeks. Set price slightly high then come down incrementally. The market will determine the price based on the increase in buyer responses you receive.  Don‚Äôt budge when you arrive at the true market price.. Make your item as nice as you can without spending too much. Clean things up before you list and be honest with people.,5
112,"Great place to post: Overall, I like craigslist as a selling platform as well as a buying platform. They allow a lot of photos and cover large sub areas within the county of Los Angeles. 

I do wish they would update and improve they are app so updates could be done more quickly. For instance, it would be great if we could select all of our postings and renew in one step rather than having to renew/delete individually. Hopefully that option will be available soon.",5

114,For sale by owner: I am an avid buyer on craigslist I rely on it for many things as I have had a lot of success in the past but as a seller and also have noticed this as a buyer there is currently a lot of hacking and scamming going on throughout craigslist. Never in my life have I had so many disgusting text and phone calls ever I have to say I did not have a pleasant experience in trying to sell some thing I was forced to go to another platform where I had a very good successful experience. It will not stop me as a buyer but I do not know if I will continue to use this platform in the future as a seller.,3
115,Well worth the five bucks!! Vehicle went fast!!: I was having few bites with fb marketplace and I had a very nice Jeep for trade listed.

122,"Craigslist needs a new design: Craigslist needs a complete overall. Making a new UI so it looks more attractive to the users. Creating an easier way to post things. Like Offerup and Facebook Marketplace do. Changing the app icon to a more appealing/attractive design to attract users to use Craigslist. I feel Craigslist is directed really toward older people but with a newer UI everything would change and attract new users to sell their items.

I give it 5 stars because it's still good for selling items! But would be again easier to navigate to what you are selling, and what u are looking to purchase. A more flashy, modern design/UI would bring Craigslist to the top! 

I do hope my review is looked at by the Craigslist team and taken into consideration cause Craigslist has been around for a very long time.

I'm writing to express my frustration and disappointment with the removal of my posts. I believe some were unfairly taken down, and I'm not alone in this experience. As a genuine seller, I feel that your protection policies prioritize buyers' safety over sellers' rights.

Scammers often copy my images and ads, then report my original post to be removed. This is not only frustrating but also harmful to honest sellers like myself. It's not fair to penalize us for the actions of scammers.

I urge you to reconsider your removal policies and implement measures to protect sellers from fraudulent activities. We deserve a safe and secure platform to sell our items, just like buyers deserve protection from scams.

Please look into this ASAP. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a more balanced approach to protecting both buyers and sellers on Craigslist.",4

I don‚Äôt have FB and don‚Äôt ever care to, apparently that marketplace is where people are going now but I still consistently find what I‚Äôm looking for on Craigslist from sellers who are mostly rational humans and most importantly I don‚Äôt have to deal with the garbage pile that is social media.",5
139,"Works well to Sell Things: And get rid of free things. Some things take more time to sell. There is a fee $3 or $5 for some services. that was just the public radio interview about the free papers and how craigslist cutting on them, taking away some of the classified ad revenue. I kind of miss those old print ads and free papers. They were so interesting!!
   On craigslist you can load roughly 20 photographs and most ads are free. There‚Äôs a phone app to help you navigate at all.",5
140,"What‚Äôs not to like?: How can anybody say anything bad about Craigslist. And if all the newspapersüóûof the world were balloonsüéà full of hot air, then Craigslist is the pin üìå popping it.

I‚Äôd bet 4 out of 5 newspapers went out of business because Craigslist made all the classified sections like the 8-track or Beta.

I don‚Äôt remember the last time I saw üëÄ a ‚ÄúThrifty Nickel‚Äù or a ‚ÄúQuick Quarter‚Äù that looked like a newspaper, only smaller, like local newspaper üì∞.

It was going to happen anyway and I think it‚Äôs better to rip the scab off and pray you don‚Äôt bleedü©∏out rather than slowly in a constant state of decline due to a dying art that is bleeding to death, drip by drip.

We‚Äôll always have newspapers but, I‚Äôm inclined to think ü§î üí≠ they‚Äôll be more ‚Äúcommentary‚Äù (like FOX News) than of ‚Äúunadulterated content‚Äù because it‚Äôll be the spokes-piece for whoever pays the bills",5
141,"Review and question: I‚Äôve had pretty good luck selling some items on Craigslist. The ones that didn‚Äôt sell might have just been the item I was selling, no fault of Craig‚Äôs list. My question is about buying. I browsed Craigslist all the time and I see so many scam adds. When I see them I make a point to flag them. Then I see the same adds pop up again and again, then I flag them again and again. Is there anyway Craigslist can flag adds that keep getting flagged over and over automatically.",4
142,"Great app: Great for what you need.  Super glad they finally updated this to be able to work in landscape or portrait displays.  The only gripe is I still wish you could sort your favorites (price, distance, etc.) rather than just getting it based on when the listing was posted.  Other than that, it is exactly what this type of app needs to be.  No sponsored results in the middle of your list or things you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be interested in; only things you actually were looking for.",5
143,"No other site is as successful for selling stuff and finding apts: I‚Äôve used Craigslist all of my adult life (I‚Äôm in my 40s now). I‚Äôve moved to San Francisco, LA, NYC and Austin using it. I‚Äôve sold countless furniture items on it. I‚Äôve found French lessons using it. The list goes on and on. It‚Äôs one of the most successful sites for selling stuff and finding apartments. My only concern is that when you list your phone #, marketers and bad actors get a hold of it and you have to be very careful bc you will have people contacting you trying to con you. 

Craigslist should do a better job at somehow screening the people who join it and protecting people who list their phone #.",3
144,"Keep high quality photos: I have been a user of this app since it came out, and I‚Äôve used craigslist for 10 years now. I like the app as it is and now I hope they do not change anything in it. It is pretty quick for me to post a new listing and add photos as I need. Of course I cannot put in my phone number because of the spam and scam callers, but that is the nature of selling in an anonymous platform and does not pertain to the app.",5
145,"I sell and give away stuff on this app almost exclusively: CL has been around a long time, and what seemed obscure and edgy is now the go to place to sell, for me.
You hear about the nightmares, but probably the worst thing I have experienced is no-shows when I try to sell.
It‚Äôs easy to use, there are no ads nor clickbait.
There will always be amoral and criminal folks, but thankfully, people are mostly good.
Still, be smart, as in any transaction anywhere.",5
146,"I love Craigslist: I am always searching for French Provincial furniture. To me it is the most beautiful and elegant furniture you can buy. Craigslist has my eye candy. 

When it comes to opportunities Craigslist again. I found an ad offering a mentor to learn real estate investing. So I‚Äôm going to shuffle off to Buffalo and look for homes that are quality construction that a person can afford to buy. 

Craigslist has a lot to offer especially when you are killing time. Denver woman",5
147,"Love it. And did you ever see the Craigslist movie?: We are all so lucky that Craig created this super useful, well organized, no frills service for us. Over the years we have used it in so many ways, and we've met so many nice people when we've aquired new/used things or sold the stuff we no longer need. Plus, there was even a Craigslist movie! Which we also loved. But anyhoo, the app. Has every feature we need. Easy to use. We're very, very appreciative.",5
148,"Puppy Love: One month ago, I found a puppy crying in my backyard. Since we don't have animal control in my neighborhood, I let the puppy in. After posting about the puppy on Craigslist, I was able to successfully find it a new home. I received over 20 inquiries from people interested in the puppy. I am very thankful that this platform was available for free. The new family was emotional and happy when they received the puppy for free. I can't express how appreciative I am.",5
149,Tried and True Sales Platform: Sometimes you don‚Äôt need all of the bells and whistles to be an incredible place for sellers. It‚Äôs also Completely free to sell items without any trickery. Watch out for scammers though! It‚Äôs not Craigslist‚Äôs fault but anyone can messages a seller. Be sure to never ever give out your phone number. Especially if it‚Äôs the first question a buyer asks. Once a scammer knows that info they can easily begin stealing your identity.,5
150,"Life Staple: How did we ever live without Craigsllist??? Not many days go by that I don‚Äôt browse C/L for something or another.  It‚Äôs so user friendly, helpful, and just plain fun! I love the saved search feature and notification.  The early bird gets the worm and this makes finding specific items easy peasy!

My only suggestion is I wish you could add a ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù category for Christmas, Easter, Halloween goodies and everything that goes with seasonal items from decorations to costumes to ????",5
151,Scams everywhere: It would be great if Craigslist could offer a verification system like most apps do so that it‚Äôs users can avoid scammers. It can‚Äôt be that hard to implement and since so many use Craigslist to find housing it would be nice to know that the post is actually valid and that person posting actually owns or manages the property. There‚Äôs nothing stopping anyone from screen shorting images from other rental sites and then pretending to own or manage that property to collect application fees and even rents and deposits. If Craigslist won‚Äôt update this feature then we will all stop using it for Zillow or other apps that actually took the time to implement a verification system.,1
152,"Some of the best of the Internet: Craigslist is one of the few places where I feel like the Internet got it right. Yes there‚Äôs the human trafficking, scammer haven, and illicit drug selling. But these were around long before the Internet. And Craigslist has tried to cure at lease some of these ills (ex. Removing the ‚ÄúLooking for _______‚Äù and section).

But as far as an almost-free-for-all Classifeds publication, I love it. The simplicity and fact that it hasn‚Äôt changed much in the last few decades speak volumes to it‚Äôs usefulness from the start.

And not to mention that without it AirBNB probably wouldn‚Äôt exist (google for a cool story). 

I‚Äôve sold furniture here, bought equipment, and even found a few roommates. It‚Äôs made my life better and I love using it for both business and personal. Thank you for being around Craigslist!",5
153,"Sold a couple items recently: Within the past two weeks I have posted two ads on Craig‚Äôs List for a trailer and a propane tank. Both drew several responses. Both items sold for the asking price. Without Craig‚Äôs list, these things would still be sitting in the driveway. 

The site is easy to use. I had to update information several times on one ad. It was easy to do so. Could not be happier with the sale experience.",5
154,"Fantastic app: I need to use this app quite often, to get an idea of what is out there for me.  Unfortunately there are reasons beyond my control that I have had to move every year-two years.  Like right now my rent and utilities are outrageous for my income.  Needed to move in here due to hip replacement and old place was no conducive to having a hip replacement. 
I do find that the app has different results for my searches than the one on my computer.",5
155,"Craigslist App helps this mature fart do well.: I am sort of technologically challenged. I grew up with something called a tube television which was, wait for it. . . .  . Black and white ONLY!
I can find the most amazing things I know I‚Äôll never really need but still want them. ü§™
It‚Äôs easy to navigate with the app and easy to find what you‚Äôre truly looking for and need, not just lusting for it.
I have to say the developers are awesome for keeping the site free for those posting.
Thanks Craigslist, for having awesome people on your team!",4
156,"The original and still the best!: Yes , Craigslist started it all, and then moved aside for more ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù platforms with a more ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù like platform. Now it‚Äôs been years for me away from Craigslist in favor of more promising and popular apps‚Ä¶ but now I‚Äôm back, and for good reason!  I just recently posted a car on something that rhymes with shmoto-smrader and other very popular mediums, but good- ol‚Äô Craigslist sold it, and with the most ‚Äúreal‚Äù people asking. I‚Äôm sticking with the OG‚Ä¶ Craigslist.",5
157,"Not what it used to be.: I tried using Craigslist to find an apartment, but the majority of the listings were fake and also for prostitution. So I gave up and found an overpriced apartment via rental-only websites. However, once I was in the new apartment, I posted again for a roommate and was successful. There are real people using Craigslist and you can find them by limiting responses to email via Craigslist only. Do not post your phone number to speed things up.",5
158,The new app is so convenient: I used cl for decades. The latest app is so convenient and just in a few days sold a big item.  There may be some slight improvements needed in adding pictures. I didn‚Äôt have a problem putting pictures up by just snapping photos and upload direct from my iPhone. But some navigation buttons could be better for pics. But overall experience is excellent.  Great place to sell and an established community already for many years,5
159,"Great a little problem connecting sometimes: The app is great. But, sometimes when I do not have Wi-Fi service (and wifi disabled) and my cell phone is connected to a cellular network, the app cannot connect to the server - but other times it can. I have not noticed this when I have Wi-Fi turned on and I am connected to a Wi-Fi network. The app does have permission to use cellular data in my iPhone settings. whether the problem is with the app or on the server side, I am not sure.",4
160,"Craigslist works: I just bought a car on craigslist and had a great experience. Now I just sold a car for my parents on craigslist and had another great experience. Some people only want to use Facebook because they think craigslist is full of scammers, but I have the opposite experience! It‚Äôs well worth the five dollars and it gets posted everywhere; you don‚Äôt have to pick different groups. Ask they didn‚Äôt",5
161,"Is there any support for the App Chat???: Is there any support for the App Chat??? I get notifications of someone sending me a message through the App Chat, but when i go open it there is not message. This keeps happening not the first time. At first I thought the person sending the message deleted the message they just sent. But there is some other issue. Can this issue be fixed. How can I access those messages sent to me via app chat? I don‚Äôt even get an email notification about this message or a copy of it in the email. I completely lose the person information or way of contact by loosing their message. Could this be fixed??",1
162,Woks great! Hasn‚Äôt changed! Simple and quick: I love that it has maintained the same format since it started ! If it isn‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it! Fb market is so over ran with new ads and people making false postings that are true good to be real and that‚Äôs exactly what they are scams!  Here it‚Äôs simple and you have to meet the person to get the product keeping your money local is also important these days. Fb can learn from this app!,5
163,"JUST GRATITUDE!: Craigslist to be quite sincere to myself as much , notwithstanding or disregarding whatever issues or concerns and not so good stories has saved my life in many situations and till date . I plan to even use this platform as a prospective contract hirer for diverse jobs !

164,"Another successful sale: I have been using craigslist for many years to sell various items and also to find things I needed and I have had mostly successful interactions. Of course you have to become skilled at listing without necessarily putting your address or your direct phone number so that you can ensure your safety, however, I have not had any major issues at all, so I highly recommend this app.",5
165,"I forgot Craigslist was even a thing: I recently remembered that Craigslist existed, as I‚Äôve been struggling to sell off some stuff. I refuse to get Facebook for marketplace, because I have a modicum of self-respect. And eBay hasn‚Äôt been kind to me for the large items.

Anyways, posting was really easy and I got a couple responses within a week. Just sold my first posting tonight.

It did what I needed and nothing more, which makes it basically perfect.",5
166,"iPhone successfully sold: The Craig‚Äôs List ad allowed me to pair my extra iPhone 6s with someone that needed it and put a few extra dollars in my pocket. Immediately I received a couple of texts trying to get my personal information, but after texting them back that I wouldn‚Äôt share that information they went away and I received inquiries from interested, actual buyers. Thanks Craig‚Äôs List for the sale and the privacy warnings.",5
167,"Craigslist changed my life: Through craigslist, over the years, I‚Äôve found 9 amazing roommates. 5 of those have become lifelong friends. I found a job that led to a wonderfully successful career for 12 years. And countless deals on secondhand furniture + free stuff. Laughs while reading missed connections. Easily selling things I have no use for... the list goes on. The app is pretty slick - much easier than uploading photos to computer first. 

Thank you mr. craigslist!!",5
168,"My preferred choice out of all of the CL apps: Main downside is not being able to filter by city. The app uses a radial search filter where you outline a circle of radius X onto a flat map, which is well-designed and easy to use but you might not be willing to drive to certain areas due to local topography or other factors; being able to filter strictly by city like on the CL website would be nice too, or maybe allow the radial search tool to filter out certain cities.",5
169,"Great resource for selling!: I used to sell my stuff on eBay but the excessive fees and hassles became unbearable. You must be careful selling on Craigslist but ‚Äúthings‚Äù being what they are nowadays, what is safe!
I never meet anyone unless it‚Äôs at a well traveled public location, like a supermarket parking lot, police station etc. 
I never reply to an inquiry that wants me to call or requires me to go ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of Craigslists email system. 
I always require in person meetings and strictly CASH ONLY!",5
170,"Scammers: I like craigslist and I would give it 5 stars if it were only about the service. However, the thing that really give me a bad feeling are the scammers. The moment I posted my couch , the scammers started. If I would send them my ‚Äòrandom‚Äô google number, if they could send a check, if this, if that. This went on for two days. After a week the serious buyers showed interest and I sold my couch. 
The moment Craigslist could do something about this sales flaw, that would be the moment I would give them my 5 stars. Thanks",3
171,"2010 HHR: Thank you for being available.  Unfortunately many bogus offers come out of the woodwork.  They ask questions that are answered in the listing.  It makes you wonder about bots doing some of the contacting.  The great thing, everything we list seem to go pretty quick with honorable people, it‚Äôs just dealing with the dozen other empty offers.  It‚Äôs pretty easy to figure out how to list being a senior citizen, so that is appreciated.",5
172,"Vast improvement!!: I had used Craigslist for many years since the beginning. For the past several years thought, my usage has dropped. In some ways was becoming the last resort app to use. Until recent platform updates, it has become another great tool to use for buying and selling and with so many great added features making it likely my new favorite to use. Fantastic üëç",5
173,"Easy and effective: This is such a no hassle system for me. I have something ‚Äúextra‚Äú and I do the simple work of description and a few photographs and very quickly it sits on the shelf of craigslist. It‚Äôs either very quick or after I‚Äôve sort of forgotten about it that I get the reply that sells this item for me. We meet at a business parking lot and it‚Äôs done. Easy and effective! As long as I am honest in my descriptions, there is no trouble.",5
174,"Too many dealer ads/spam: Craigslist used to be great back when was used just by people trying to sale their own items. Now it‚Äôs full of dealerships or businesses overly advertising the same product over and over again, which drown all the other ads and it makes it so hard to find the postings of the local average person. Which Craigslist would do something to address the issue.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on all the scammers‚Ä¶ you would think Craigslist would‚Äôve done something about it by now.",3
175,"Easy and efficient app: I come back to Craigslist to check after long time not using it and what a surprise! when finding this easy and efficient and excellent app. Nowadays we have many opportunities and apps for almost anything, many people forgot about how good Craigslist was, but now after I checking it. I just want to continuing using it. I hope more people will join, so there can be more offering and possibilities.",5
176,"Best app ever: This app is simple and exactly what you need.  No stupid designs or ambiguous processes.  Probably not the most important attribute but something I greatly appreciate is the login process.  You just enter your email they send a confirmation email instantly with a single button to push and that‚Äôs it!  No stupid password or nonsense.  

Craigslist and Wikipedia are my two favorite websites because they are free of ads and provide an immediate service to everyone.  I find that extremely rare these days.",5
177,"Great app but don‚Äôt add you phone number and here‚Äôs why:: Great app and works nice, but don‚Äôt add your phone number to listings or else scammers, and telemarketers will use it to call and text you over and over. They love to steal people google verification codes. So don‚Äôt text them any codes. Also don‚Äôt answer any emails that want to send money orders, and don‚Äôt reply to emails that say they want to email you at a different email address. They are scams. Goodluck on here! Craigslist is my favorite place to list stuff.",4
178,Needs a chat option: Super super easy to use and it has helped me sell items however the lack of a chat option makes it super difficult to communicate with people. Not having as much success because it‚Äôs all through e-mail while other apps like Facebook Marketplace and Offer Up have in app chats that are quick. I feel that would lend to an easier purchasing experience and bring a higher volume of customers if chat were available.,4
179,"Review of App: Craigslist is a great concept to share information as a marketplace among neighborhood and surrounding areas. The app is relatively easy to use. However the navigation is not as intuitive, the look and feel also quite out of dated comparing with simple elegance of many other modern mobile apps. 

Overall, we have been used Craigslist for years even if only posted very few items, it is still my number one choice when I need to sell.  Truly hope this app and concept can sustain and survive among fierce competition.",3
180,I really love this app!: When this Craigslist app came out I was so excited because I had been wanting them to make an app for a very long time and I wondered why they hadn‚Äôt yet. This app is very easy to use and maneuver. You just log on to your Craigslist account and you are able to do anything you‚Äôre able to do on the website. It hasn‚Äôt yet malfunctioned or glitched since I have been using it and I‚Äôve had it for about a year now. I hope this review helps.,5
181,"Best I've CL found to date: Update Jan 2024- still my favorite. Very simple to create, manage and delete posts. Saves favorites. Just works. 

 Feb 2021- I can keep the favorites in sync across devices when signed into this app. Let's me search and post and manage postings. If not logged in, lets me edit postings by requesting a link. Unlike the others, it's not continuously asking me to pay again and again for a CL ""Pro"" version.",5
182,"Another Successful Sale on CL: After posting my RV Travel Trailer with a thorough description and competitive price I received 5 inbound inquiries - 4 of which were totally legitimate.   Taking the ‚ÄúFirst Come - First Served‚Äù customer approach I was able to determine the 2 most interested prospects and staged the inspection appointments an hour apart which provided clarity at the end of the process.
Quality knowledgeable candidates and a sale with both buyer and seller satisfied and happy.",5
183,Great App To Buy and Sell Stuff: I love this app! It‚Äôs easy to use it‚Äôs updated and it‚Äôs probably my biggest go to app on my phone since my wife and I are always buying and selling things. I love craigslist because I pretty much can find most things that I want and things that I am discarding or selling. I always find a buyer or even posting things on the free section. Someone is willing to take it and use it which I love the up cycling.,5
184,"So Easy: I‚Äôve used Craigslist a number of times in the past and it‚Äôs been great.  Since I‚Äôve discovered the dedicated app, it‚Äôs even better.  So easy to quickly post things.  Guides you through the whole process and consolidates all your posts in one place.  Only improvement would be if you could chat with buyers/sellers right through the app.  Looking forward to using it more in the future.",5
185,"Good ol‚ÄôCraigslist, quirks included: Overall, the app works well and still retains that Craigslist charm we all love/hate.

Things that bug me:

1: After choosing a posting, if you swipe from left edge to right it takes you to the previous posting. I expect it to take me back to the search results. Instead, I have to reach all the way to the top of my oversized screen and tap the back button. IMHO, I don‚Äôt think most people want to swipe through each listing one at a time. Please change this, it gets me every time!

2: When you ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù one of your posts it adds it to the Archive tab. That‚Äôs okay, even though I ‚ÄúDeleted‚Äù it, no big deal. However, it seems silly to add it to Archive every time I have to repost something. So you could end up with a whole bunch of duplicates in Archive and there‚Äôs no Permanent Delete to clear things out, or a search field if you have a lot of past posts. 

Thanks for a good start though!",3
186,"Pet Post: After telling the scammers how f**led up they were for trying to scam me, my posts were flagged within 15 minutes. I had an extremely hard time getting my posts to stay up and even tried to pay to post so they couldn‚Äôt flag my posts. Giving the public access to flag their competition and those who don‚Äôt/won‚Äôt give out codes to scammers has made it nearly impossible to get an ad to stay up. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs time for a new place to post that doesn‚Äôt allow just anyone to remove your post.",3
187,Auto texts after posting an item: Craigslist is great. But scammers are annoying. Five seconds after creating post I get a text asking if I still have item and a second post saying they would buy it with cashiers check and once check is cashed and so on......other thing that‚Äôs annoying is typing in a Colorado city search for a car part and getting complete car listing from some junk yard in California. Other then that Craigslist is awesome.,4
188,"Works fine: I‚Äôm a travel healthcare worker and need a new place to live for 3 months 3-4 times per year. Every single time I have used Craigslist and it‚Äôs always worked well.

No problems with the app and, as a bonus, we‚Äôve met some cool people who either sold us something or bought something from us.",5
191,"Heads and shoulders better on a phone than using the website: An excellent, simple app that is a far better way to access CL from a phone than the website, while still integrating well for when you use the site on a desktop or laptop. Managing posts and searches are easy and being able to save searches is awesome. Recommended if you are at all more than a casual CL user.",5
192,"Endless Login Issues!!: Clumsy Interface overall but core problem with this app, is that you can never login. It constantly forces password resets. Then, if you do get back, in it will log you out the moment you put the app down. So every time I open to manage a posting or search for something, I have to waste time logging in‚Ä¶ which again repeatedly fails with my (correct) email & password, as well as via the password link which opens in browser not the app. I‚Äôm just so fully over Craigslist, it‚Äôs so much easier to just post/buy/sell on FB Marketplace.",2
193,"Not very pleased‚Ä¶: 1. Listings from all over the place show even when I‚Äôve got the search buttoned down to my chosen city (+ no miles).

2. Today, trying to find one of my own posts: it doesn‚Äôt show up in the app. *So weird.* I‚Äôm using the same search criteria as for the desktop site on my laptop, where it does fall out in results, but it does not appear in the app - even when I ‚Äúsearch a wider area‚Äù. Again - same exact search terms / location used.

After trying to find my post with those same search parameters in the app, I tried probably 30 different combinations of location / breadth of search area & search terms‚Ä¶ still, doesn‚Äôt show up in the app‚Äôs results. I‚Äôm at a loss as to why this is happening. It's disheartening, as I can only assume that my paid ads aren‚Äôt showing for prospective customers using the app, either.

And clearly it still has a great network of people using the site/app because people find me when buying my items.

I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the site. I hope it continues long into the future!",5
202,"Take it with a grain of salt: While I was absolutely skeptical of CL, I actually landed a wonderful job about 8 months ago from CL listings‚Ä¶ Now, the company I am working has offered me not only a decent wage, but also affords me 3 scores of meals Monday to Friday, health insurance, retirement benefits, incentives for further education, and more importantly complete job security‚Ä¶ thanks to CL‚Ä¶ but users still must exercise extreme precautions while using CL as  scammers are still rampant‚Ä¶ good luck people",5
203,"Easy Squeasy: I never, ever write review! The Craigslist App is an exception because the software engineers have made a REMARKABLE tool! The app allowed me to easily set up an item for sale. Photos uploaded easily without any problems and many photos were allowed. So many options when setting up the ad, and very easy to edit. Totally easy to post. Finally, EVERYBODY  looks at Craigslists because Sellers provide quality items with honest marketing, pricing, & sales of their items. Bravo!",5
204,"Craigslist is furnishing our house: Moving from a small furnished place to a larger unfurnished one has its challenges. Craigslist to the rescue! We are still in the process, but now instead of living on ( not just out of) cardboard boxes used as nightstands, computer desk, speaker stands and chairs, we have furniture! Some will need upgrading at some point, but most is fine and the place is functional and looks pretty good thanks to Craigslist.",5
205,"Photos Don‚Äôt Post When Ad is Relisted: As above.  I‚Äôve used Craigslist for years without issues.  When I tried to reattach my photos, my photo library in Craigslist contained only 6 photos of a different item. Could not access or click & drag after many attempts.  Starting from the original posting email did not work either.  

In desperation I went to Facebook Marketplace.  The app automatically navigated me to ‚Äòsettings‚Äô to allow access to all of my photos. Ad was done in 10 minutes and item sold the same day. Sorry-No more Craigslist for me!",3
206,Still a great public service despite spam proble: Craigslist is a great service but it‚Äôs gotten much worse over the years. The amount of spam that shows up makes it very difficult to find real listings. if I search for something it‚Äôs quite possible that I might find what I‚Äôm looking for but that means having to scroll through 90 odd spam listings full of keywords that have nothing to do with my search. Developers please PLEASE come up with a feature so we can filter this %#%@$&! out. Thank you.,3
207,"Ok but could be better: This application is OK but it could be better if it was more intuitive and if communications between buyers and sellers could run through the app. I am getting a lot of scam messages for things I am listing for sale. They want my email address, telephone number, offered to send me a cashiers check, offered to pay additional money for holding the item, and additional money for movers. The check never comes. I assume it is an attempt at identity theft.",4
208,"Quick sale, happy with experience: I had an office chair I really liked but couldn‚Äôt fit in my new, much smaller room (converted office). I was having trouble finding a business that would buy modern office furniture so at risk of throwing out a perfectly good, expensive leather armchair I decided to try craigslist. Sold it the very same day! I get enough to buy a smaller chair and my old chair found a new home. That‚Äôs all I wanted!",5
209,It‚Äôs OK: The app is OK. I mean it‚Äôs Craigslist‚Äôs on an app so not that high of expectations. But definitely needs a revamp with the design elements and the way everything is laid out just feels and is confusing and tacky the app could be a lot better. But it works and it gets the job done so it is what it is. Just really wish they‚Äôd take the time to do a major revamp on the app design and the layout elements. But other then that I can‚Äôt complain. App doesn‚Äôt crash for me but in all honesty I rarely use it. Overall it‚Äôs like I said it‚Äôs an OK app that gets the job done.,3
210,Love using this app vs the website!!!: I used to use Craigslist on the website but ever since they came out with this official all it has made selling/buying things such a breeze! I would highly recommend this app to anyone that enjoys purchasing/selling items/services online with ease! All you have to do is snap  a few shots and the make a few taps on your phone screen and then VOILA!!!,5
211,The best venue for selling local: I have been using Craigslist successfully  for over 10 years. The APP is awesome and a breeze to use and the my selling success rate is great. There are scammers that venture on once in a while trying you get your email address or phone number but it‚Äôs not the fault of Craigslist and they are pretty easy to figure out. I love the concept of Craigslist & it beats all the local selling APP‚Äôs. Thank you CraigsList !,5
212,"Needs updates features & user guidance: Why does every new listing default to lowercase letters when you‚Äôre writing Title and Description? That‚Äôs so annoying and makes listing look less attractive.

Also, you should encourage people to not simply ask ‚Äúis it available?‚Äù What does that accomplish except wasting everyone‚Äôs time? People post things because they‚Äôre available‚Ä¶Encourage users to reply with an action item (i.e ‚ÄúIf this is available, I would pay X and pick up tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Äù). This will enable quicker sales.",3
213,"I trust Craigslist to buy or sell: Craigslist is a very reliable source to buy or sell that allows sellers to post much more photo pictures than facebook. More pictures mean reliable to buy ‚Äúas is‚Äù product without hesitate. 
I found facebook forces you to pay fee even though just $3 for few days, otherwise facebook blocked your item from buyers. 
Don‚Äôt waste your time at facebook. 
Love Craigslist.",5
214,"Selling or renting for less: American People don‚Äôt trust each other which is why prices are too high.  My mission is to teach people to work together and cut out the ‚Äúfat‚Äú.  Lawyers, realtors, title companies, taxes, etc., making affordable housing available, anyway possible. Craigslist is a vehicle, contributing to achieve this goal.  We must be Leary of our judicial, self-preserving system that has unethical ‚Äúbehaviors‚Äù built in.  Trust Craigslist but observe the scammers!",5
215,New category for Equal housing opportunity: I‚Äôve been looking for a place the last six months unable to find one every time I go to meet with a property manager or landlord it ends up my credit being a problem and if I would know that I wouldn‚Äôt even apply or even waste my gas going there.I do thoroughly read the descriptions but they don‚Äôt mark in the descriptions that there is a requirement requirement if there was it would pretty much expedite my choices and I‚Äôll probably be getting into place a lot faster,3
216,"Simple, effective: It works very well.  No algorithm trying to guess what you want.  I have used it for years, downsizing my house, clearing out my parents house, looking for parts related to hobbies etc.  Meta for me is a sinkhole for time.  In Market place, I indicate what I want, and it shows me dozens of pages of what I did not ask for.  In Craigslist, it simply says ‚ÄúNo Results Found ‚Äú.  Yup, Craigslist is far better for me.  Buying or selling!",5
217,"Happy shopper/customer: Craigslist is still my favorite local online shopping site! The mobile app interface workability of Craigslist looks good and has always been easy to use i feel! Call it luck or whatever but after way too many transactions to remember, I have only dealt with good people who have never given me any reason to be upset! Thank you Craigslist, your the best!",5
218,"Things for sale: As always I have had good experiences with this place to sell and buy things. It‚Äôs a great way to save some money on things needed, and great place to get rid of things we no longer use. And it‚Äôs free section has let me and lots of people  give away stuff instead of just tossing in the garbage. There‚Äôs always someone needing things for free in this day and time when thing‚Äôs get tough!!!",5
219,"App is good but not great‚Ä¶: It‚Äôs great for shopping for items but difficult to use for managing posts.  I use the app for searching for stuff all the time.  Almost like using it over the browser version.  But for managing ads, not so good.  Can‚Äôt figure out how to do thing I do in the browser version often, such as deleting and reposting an ad to get it back to the top.  Only seem to be able to ‚Äúrenew‚Äù an ad which doesn‚Äôt put it back at the top.",4
220,Awesome App: Super easy to use for both buyers and sellers! I have found multiple items that I had been looking for at great prices and have posted a bunch of items for free as well as for sale and received tons of interest and have been able to get rid of everything I‚Äôve posted really quickly and easily. I love and recommend this app and website to people all the time!,5
221,"My recent sell on Craigslist.: I hadn‚Äôt posted anything for year , because I wasn‚Äôt getting any results , therefore decided to sell by other v√≠as , however, I told my self : try it again , maybe you‚Äôll have luck , after all , many years have gone by , and Bingo! In less than a month ,  I was able to sell my items . I will vontinue to sell stuff , for now Craig has gotten more organized üòä‚ô•Ô∏è",5
222,"Selling my personal car via Craig‚Äôs list: I sold my parents‚Äô two cars and my own car on Craig's List. Every person I‚Äôve dealt with has been nice and true to their word. I read all the cautionary advice about shady dealings, and happily so did my cars‚Äô buyers. We were all on the same page to make sure the deal was correct, the financials were on the up and up, and the transaction was fast and satisfactory. I love Craig‚Äôs List!",5
223,I sold my vehicle: I was able to sell my vehicle after three weeks after my post. I did initially receive some scammers asking for me to go to a site to retrieve my history. Don‚Äôt do that because the site they state always want money. There is a safe site to go to and it‚Äôs absolutely free. Another one was a potential buyer stating they would send an agent to pick it up. Best way is to do the transaction in person so you can meet and show them your product.,4
224,"Limited and buggy but so glad it exists: The official CL app is missing features that exist on the website, such as searching within multiple categories, and there are bugs like being unable to open links in iOS browsers like Firefox, but I‚Äôm really glad that this app exists. CL is a million times easier to use than Facebook Marketplace, and now that there‚Äôs a Craigslist app, it‚Äôs even easier.",5
225,"All good things‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è: I'd rather pay the meager $5 & have an efficient, no nonsense platform at my finger tips when I need it out of the blue. If you dont pay one way, you pay another way, I always say. PLUS having an archive of ads I ran in the past is very useful, not to mention the nostalgic factor. I got huge response, unexpected, from outlying areas, considering the nasty weather we've been having. CRAIGSLIST is a GEM & a LFESAVER.",5
226,"A love it: I am new in United States, and I check many resources to find job. Many applications made really well, but what sense of this  if you can‚Äôt find job for you, and also how annoying when you get a  hundreds email messages! Maybe for somebody it‚Äôs ok, but personally for me no. I prefer simple design, location, contacts and that‚Äôs it.
It‚Äôs really comfortable and anybody can find the job!",5
227,"Selling on Craigslist: I must say, I haven‚Äôt posted for awhile. Other platforms were easier especially when including pictures. I came back and will be once again my main platform to sell on. Easy. And you can load more pictures than others, at least the ones I have been on. Thanks CraigsList for making it a breeze to sell on.",5
228,"Works smoothly and quickly: Liking the new app, but think I am missing something‚Ä¶‚Ä¶maybe not as many filtering choices when searching?  Can‚Äôt remember.  Also, looks like we no longer have opportunity to list the neighborhood / specific area in our posts.  Oh, well, as long as I can get a sale, I‚Äôm good.  Wish the photos were added last instead of first.",5
229,Fast and intuitive: The app is what I would come to expect from the streamlined Craigslist experience. The app looks better than the site and has a useful night mode. The one feature that bugs me is the geographic tracker that keeps saying my coordinates are in another city. I have to override the city each time for a new post and can‚Äôt see a way to make my actual city the default.,5
230,"Good app: Very easy to navigate app for sellers and buyers.
Useful editing options, you can post almost anything on the app.
I wish there was an options to communicate through the app instead the e-mail. Not everyone checks their email often enough or has e-mail app to respond in timely manner which makes little more difficult to sell your things.
Overall good app.",5
231,Craigslist is the best: I‚Äôve been using craigslist since they first started way back in the day and it‚Äôs been very good to me. I‚Äôve made thousands of dollars of income from it and it‚Äôs pretty easy to use and I like how it‚Äôs very popular with everybody in the world to find my items for sale. I highly recommend using this app for anything and everything. Please bring back the erotic section.,5
232,Love Craigslist App: It is so much easier to post and manage listings via the app than through the website! Very happy to have found this option as it can all be done from a mobile smartphone. It would be better if it was able to process listings quicker. When renewing multiple listings the app will notify me that ‚Äúcraig cannot keep up please try again later.‚Äù That may also be case with website so it may not be fault of app.,4
233,"Need an internal messaging system: Craigslist is great, but I always run into the problem that people don‚Äôt respond to emails either at all or several days and by then the item that I am trying to buy is sold.  Providing a phone number should either be mandatory (you can find a way to encrypt it so we don‚Äôt get each other‚Äôs real numbers) or craigslist should find a way to have an internal messaging system, such as on OfferUp.",4
234,"Good experience always.: Whenever I hear people say something negative about craigslist I tell them they‚Äôre full of it. For the last 20 years I‚Äôve had nothing but good experiences with craigslist. I‚Äôve bought property in Costa Rica bought and sold cars, sold my property in the states and countless other transactions, and I‚Äôve had no major issues other than some people just lie. William Shearer",5
235,"posting to finish easy this time.: Craigslist is full of flaky users, but downloaded the app which was quite easy, posted my free item, and got rid of it three hours later, no nonsense. Although it is not craigslist fault but a lot of the users of the service are not dependable and it is often a difficult experience dealing with them. very happy today though.",5
236,"Easy to use: I think it‚Äôs an easy to use platform. However, I would recommend an easier way to communicate such as a chat to directly connect with the seller, instead of having to email or calling them. Sometimes I just want to ask a quick question and not release my information by having to call or email due to the potential fraud out there even on alotnof these selling platforms.",4
237,"What A Value!!: Been using CL for decades. Bought and sold a ton of stuff over it.  The ads are simple to create and if you care just a little bit, can make a great looking page.  
The only downside is the junk you get, but there are SIMPLE ways around that such as adding a little photo of your contact info so the auto-bots don‚Äôt bother you, but serious buyers can still reach out.",5
238,"Does it‚Äôs job!: I‚Äôve used cregslist for a few years now selling some livestock, and it works great! I‚Äôve only ever had one no show, but they can‚Äôt control that. 

My one problem is that it‚Äôs a bit buggy sometimes, especially with the renew ad feature. I understand it‚Äôs a free app, and only so many resources can go into it, just sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work. 

I‚Äôd definitely recommend this site! besides the little glitches, it deserves a 5star.",4
239,"Selling my sports products: Craigslist is very handy and is very prompt to their posting. I have had a good response from buyers and you have to learn how to set up this posting in craigslist once I know how old it‚Äôs done it made me want to post more things to sell craigslist. You‚Äôre the bomb very nice very expertise very well done but there is a problem and that‚Äôs dealing with scammers on craigslist, but other than that craigslist is number one in my book. Thank you, Eric.",4
240,"Always & Forever: Thank all the selling gods for Craigslist. Every single time. I‚Äôve tried the competitors and‚Ä¶yeah. Always an issue of some kind or the scammers, etc showing up in droves. But my experience with CL - especially selling locally - has been great. Not to say that there hasn‚Äôt been an occasional issue, but it‚Äôs usually on the human side of things & not the platform. Will always be my go-to selling platform",5
241,"My post on Craigslist: This was my first posting on Craigslist. Although I did not sell my item on the site the person who bought the phone found my listing here and also on Facebook. Either way it created potential buyers and in the end I sold the phone. I would recommend Craigslist to anyone and everyone. I give them 5 stars , a thumbs up and a thank you!",5
242,"No Visible Date: App is a nice change, only problem found- individual posts not dated while scrolling thumbnails. Example: if user searches through categories ‚Äòfor sale‚Äô+‚Äòfree‚Äô filtering by date ‚Äònewest to oldest‚Äô, every thumbnail will appear yet not show individual dates of when post was created, requiring user to click to find out.
Other than that I have no opinion.",5
243,"Great exposure: The Ads in Craigslist have provided me greater exposure than other venues.  Most sellers and buyers are honest people helping each other.   The problem is created by a minority of hackers and identity thieves that will come down with ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù offers as bait and some naive people becomes easy victims.  Following Craigslist advice to avoid scammers is a good way to avoid been rob of your money, items or worst yet, your identity.",5
244,This is how I sell stuff: There are several apps out there to sell things you no longer want but Craig‚Äôs List is still the best. When I heard they were going to start charging for ads I thought it was the end of an era. They charge like $5 for an ad that reaches millions of people! And they let you run it pretty much as long as you want to.   Cheap and effective.  Pretty hard to beat. Thank you Craig‚Äôs list!,5
245,It‚Äôs a great app but there‚Äôs always room for improvement.: The only thing that I see that needs a little improvement is to make the app more user friendly to post pictures and to provide the ability to rotate a posted picture if the need be. Other wise a great app and not only will I use it again to sell things I‚Äôll be looking here first to buy before I go to the store to buy an item new at a higher price.,5
246,Sold my pool table: Everything went well. My advice is always talk on the phone with the person and get to know your buyer before you give your address and agree to meet. I sold to a fellow union worker but I would have never known without a conversation. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to talk and let you know who they are and what they do just forget it and move on to someone else.,5
247,"App makes Craigslist even easier to use: Longtime CL fan, glad it‚Äôs still going strong. The app makes it easy to search, post and manage. Just used it to post my old iPhone. Sold it in less than 48 hours. Was able to message the buyer from the app in realtime without going through email or giving out my number. Made meeting up easier than ever. Love it.",5
248,"Renew or else: There are times I have to renew a posting before the 45 day deadline. The ad is tossed out without me knowing which one it was. Then I have to go look for it and separately find the photos to upload. Sorry, but some things are so niche that it takes a minute for someone who wants it to respond to the post. Otherwise, the app works well. Taking to account it‚Äôs working around an established website, it‚Äôs pretty good and easy. Thanks",4
249,"Thanks: I have used Craig‚Äôs list for many years.  I take the time to establish a fair value for what I want to sell as well as offer items in good condition described in detail.  I always remind my audience to bring correct change and first com first serve.  
I have enjoyed many people who come to purchase items and have had some wonderful experiences.  
Craigs list has been a very good resource for me.",5
250,"BMW sale: I have used craigslist since the very beginning of 2008. I have had more success with craigslist than I could ever have with a car dealership. I save sales tax. I didn‚Äôt get a good deal. I can sell product at a good deal and I have never had a problem. I will continue to use craigslist until someday it may not exist but until then, I will always be buying and selling on craigslist.",5
251,"Successful Sale of Property: We had two adjacent uncleared mobile home lots in our family for over 40 years. We had done nothing with the lots, they had just been sitting there.

I posted on Craigslist, had several responses and a handful of offers. We ended up selling to a sweet family who lived nearby. They were looking for a larger space to place their mobile home.

PERFECT FIT!",5
252,"The OG Market Place: I have always had a good experience with craigslist especially with the free listings I‚Äôve posted. I have met incredible people that made me glad to be a part of the human race. If you are listing things for sale, be prepared for a bevy of scammers who say they want your item and will give you extra money if you give them information blah blah blah. Once you delete those you‚Äôll get some good connections.",5
253,Good: I still do t get why Craigslist won‚Äôt ask for peoples driver license and keep it safe ?no minors and that way of someone is selling a car or showing a apartment it‚Äôs safe . I actually walked to  apartment once and was going to die . The lady and man locked doors and asked 500 bucks and I gave them 20 all I had and they said call police and will find you and left . I flagged the ad and it‚Äôs back in again unbelievably,5
254,"Craigslist app is great: I am using Craigslist to find a room to rent. The app makes the information quite digestible, and I love the saving favorites option that automatically puts rooms into a separate space in the app. One thing I‚Äôd like to see change is that I don‚Äôt want the app to fill my feed over and over again with places I‚Äôve already looked at. If I‚Äôm looking at all of the rooms for rent in one city, it would be nice if it saved my place somehow.",4
255,"A great way to sell stuff: I live in a town of 1750 people, that is located in a large county of 25,000 people.  Newspaper ads are expensive, and reach a very limited audience. An ad on craigslist however, will reach 50 miles in every direction.

When I am looking to purchase an item, I can limit the amount of ads I see by picking the proper category. Therefore, I use craigslist for both buying and selling.",5
256,"Money in My Closet: Who knew that I had $100 bill sitting in my closet this whole time. I just sold my like new softball glove that had been catching dust bunnies for the last decade or so. Now it goes on to live another life with a very happy owner and I have cash in my cash app. 
It took a few minutes to make the post. I let it soak online for a few days and boom... she‚Äôs sold. And now I‚Äôm sold... what else can I sell? üëÄI like this...",5
257,"Great website: I‚Äôve used Craigslist for years, mostly to hire people for short gigs like building a low brick wall or a deck. Sometimes to post items to give away‚Äî‚Äòfree stuff.‚Äô I‚Äôve always had lots of responses and good results. I‚Äôve made a few mistakes on hiring people, but found some great folk as well. I just downloaded this app, and it‚Äôs much easier to use than the old website.",5
258,Super Easy and Well Functioning: The app is a lot easier to use it kind of streamlines the whole process my browser would never remember my login creds and this does so I can get on go straight to my posting start a new one all without logging in. I haven‚Äôt got to use the chat feature yet but I imagine that would be easier than digging through my emails.,5
259,Super Cool: It‚Äôs the same basic and highly functioning tool I‚Äôve long since used via web page now perfectly adapted to an app. There‚Äôs still some more cool ways to improve but as it stands I‚Äôm thoroughly satisfied with the use of this app and it‚Äôs call for feedback. I wish they‚Äôd try the dating thing again but understand why not seeing as how it got inundated by pimps and the like.,5
260,"Always There: As we say in New York, ‚ÄúFreakin‚Äô Awesome!!! Craigslist has a little something for everyone. I gave away my treadmill for free on Craigslist because I needed the space. I posted the treadmill, and within 30 minutes, many people responded to the post. someone got an awesome treadmill for free, I got my space back and everyone was happy in the end. Thank you to Craigslist for being there for us all.",5
261,"Great but has its flaws: Great place to buy and sell local not so much beyond that. Also there are issues with people trying to scam people both buying and selling, so beware. Besides that no fault to craigslist but people just annoy you with lowballing and that just makes the experience hardly worth the effort. So if you read this and your one of those people just stop. Nobody is making millions and using this to sell their stuff, be fair and honest.",4
262,"Great app and a great way to sell unwanted stuff: I‚Äôve used Craigslist to sell my lightly used and usually like new gadgets for almost 10 years and it‚Äôs been great. The official app that finally came out has been awesome and makes selling even easier. Glad that even after all these years, Craigslist is still one of the most populated places where people go to look for bargains.",5
263,"Great App & Site but I have a suggestion: I love craigslist and I use it anytime I need to buy or sell a used item. The simplicity of the app and website makes it incredibly easy to navigate and use. However, I think it would be useful if the app showed you statistics on how well your posting is doing. For example, the number of views, engagement, replies, etc. Other than that it‚Äôs a great app.",5
264,"Good port to the iPhone: Nicely ported app for the iPhone.  Has most of the functionality of the desktop app.  Allows you to create an ad right on the phone and add pictures taken with the phone.  Easy editing of content.  Makes it easy to create an ad on the fly.  The only issue is that when adding photos, there are several extra steps that need to be taken, which are not quite straightforward or intuitive.",4
265,I found CL app easy to use and (so far) I get results: Thought the layout was intuitive and easy to navigate. But it was nice that it also retains the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the original CL website. Doesn‚Äôt have all the ads and bloated crapware. It‚Äôs super fast. And due to the stripped down and no frills design and layout ‚Ä¶ well I trust CL. So refreshing these days. I recommend this app for these reasons and so many more.,5
266,Always works: We have used Craig‚Äôs list for renting a room in our home for the last few years. We have mostly found very nice decent people. The ones that were not as good were few and I would have to say it was our fault for not checking them out completely. Craig‚Äôs list always lived up to their end. Definitely would continue using.,5
267,"Way better than Communist Facebook: I used to buy and sell on marketplace, but for no reason at all I was banned, I made another account under a different name, somehow it linked it to my original account.  I was given no reason why I was banned probably for political reason.  Thank you craigslist I appreciate that you provide society somewhere we can buy and sell.",5
268,"Enjoyed for years: Going to be honest, I love this app. I‚Äôve used it for years from buying/selling cars to renting Apt‚Äôs and everything in between.  I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but this one has earned its praise over the years, great online market! Just be careful, lots of scammers on here trying to take money, use common sense, talk to the person on the phone always and never send money sight unseen. Enjoy!",5
269,"The app provides good service: For the most part I like the app. I dislike very much how they allow users to FLOOD the app with repetitive posts. Exactly the same, maybe a minor word difference. They might also be posting daily the same post. This way you get annoyed looking at their posts & have to struggle finding the good & honest, available posts that are from reliable users. Otherwise I like finding good buys for apartments.",4
270,"Rife with scammers: I posted a vehicle for sale w/9/7.  Within seconds of completing the post I had two responses both of which turned out to be scammers.  The following day we got three more similar calls offering to buy the vehicle for full price and in one case, send an extra $50 for ‚Äú my trouble‚Äù.  These we all deals too good to be true and when I questioned their requests they got very defensive.  The following week I received a legitimate call and sold the vehicle.  Craigslist works but beware of the cheaters.",3
271,The Sale: It started as a simple thought though it seemed almost as if I could no t do it I managed to find a way. Take action is what I did posting a simple photo of the 1999 mazda Miata MX-5 I began to wonder maybe there is more to the name i remember the history so I endured on the simple but difficult for some task input the information and within days a proper gentleman by the name of T√ñNG went on with the purchase.,5
272,Best Selling Site is Craigslist!: I tried selling on other sites. Not 1 real person contacted me. Not here! Craigslist does not charge a fee which is awesome. Its easy to use. Its real People selling great stuff that they don‚Äôt need or no longer use. No big stores like Wayfair selling on Craigslist like they do on OfferUp. I have never had a problem with any sale. Buyers have been honest people. Highly recommend selling on Craigslist!!!,5
273,I recommend posting on craigslist: I have posted a few items for sale on Craigslist over the past couple years. I have always had a positive experience posting on Craigslist. The potential buyers can always get in touch with me easily. Craigslist respects my privacy by only listing my email address & they give me the option of listing a map showing my general area. Posting is easy & fast!,5
274,"Best Community App: I have been using craigslist since it came out and everybody doubted about craigslist. To me, it‚Äôs been nothing more than a perfect tool to connect myself to others in my community when I need to find services, sell, help others or even just to read about events. I know some people think it‚Äôs outdated but to me is still one of my favorites app.",5
275,"Craigslist app is cool.: A great tool for the community. It is great for recycling things you don‚Äôt need, getting them into those that can use them; I just gave someone some baby food jars that would have ended up in the trash otherwise. It is also great for selling items which 
I‚Äôve done for years.

The app is great for communicating with buyers and ads are now so easy to manage.",5
276,"Used to love this but‚Ä¶: I‚Äôve had a persistent issue where I am in the homepage under ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù items and when I hit search, it moves my search to jobs or housing. Annoying as heck. Today I am searching for an item ‚Äúsecurity screen door‚Äù and keep getting vehicles in my search. I understand the term might be fine for cars, but when I go to filter results, almost ALL filter options are for cars! Mileage/odometer, year, make and model. I want to filter OUT vehicles. There is no option. Maybe it‚Äôs time to just use the website.",2
277,"Selling car: I got near immediate responses from over 10 prospective buyers.  My only wish is to find a way to get a rating about how legitimate the buyer are. There were some possibly shady inquiries.  It would be nice if Craig‚Äôs List could come up with a way for honest buyers to register and be rated like sellers.  Too many scammers out there.  I ended up having no problems, but feel vulnerable to scammers.",5
278,"Four out of five, because: I gave it a four out of five because I like everything about it except that if you have an ad running that goes 30 days and you forget to renew it, they take all the photos out and then you have to go and try and find new photos or pull the item back out and re-take the photos. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great free app.",5
279,"No way to receive support: I am a local rescue and everytime I posted my animals it would get flagged and taken down immediately. This significantly impacted my ability to foster and rescue. My posts never broke any guidelines, I tried to contact craiglist for support, they have NO number you can call to get help and they NEVER reply to emails. Craiglist only still exists because we all use it, but based on the terrible user experience and support, I know they are going to be replaced very soon. I am personally working on a app right now.  And I‚Äôll make sure you can get support and don‚Äôt get falsefully flagged consistently",1
280,"Good Stuff: Easy to use, reliable, and very helpful. Just be careful of the scammers and stay away from stuff that looks too good to be true. Once people start contacting you over the phone - buyer beware. This is coming from a computer IT professional who appreciates what craigslist can do and knows where craigslist can go. Post with confidence, don‚Äôt share information unnecessarily.",5
281,Frequent user: I am a frequent user of Craigslist and have both bought and sold items there. This app is very convenient but could be improved by having your way to change the location you are searching. So far I haven‚Äôt figured out how to do that on this app. if you are looking for a rare item sometimes you have to search areas beyond the scope of your current location.,4
282,"Dependable: I live in the Show Low area and I‚Äôm looking for a second vehicle.  Everything I see up here is over priced or a scam.  When I started using Craig‚Äôs list I found an area where cars and trucks are affordable, appropriately priced and lots of them.  I am so relieved to find Craig‚Äôs list.  Also Craigs list gives lots of room for descriptions and NO SCAMMERS Allowed.   I don‚Äôt know how they do it but everything is legitimate.  I can depend on Craig‚Äôs List.  Thank you Craig‚Äôs List.",5
283,"Craigslist review: Craigslist changed their format again, and I hate it again. It‚Äôs been a year since I last posted because the last changes they made we‚Äôre also frustrating to adapt to and made it hard to post ads. Today I wanted to post a couple ads to help get rid of some stuff in my driveway. Posting the first ad went pretty smoothly. When I went to post the second ad I was unable to add pictures to it because it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to go into my photo gallery. So irritating. But on the bright side, that first ad with the photos worked perfectly within a couple hours.",1
284,Easy way to access Craigslist on a phone.: Works great - no complaints. You can save your searches and even have it notify you if something comes up that you‚Äôre looking for it. You can also list things for sale - that works very well too. I‚Äôve been using this app for several years and have never had a problem.,5
285,"Still most reliable: Despite all the rumors, if done with safety guards in place, this is the best app to buy and sell. I‚Äôm happy with the newer format making it very easy to post and maintain postings. I see some very low fees I didn‚Äôt need to apply, but well deserved. You have been providing excellent free service long before many new apps that attract non serious readers. Thank you, Craigslist.",5
286,Great app and developer: I switched over to this app for some time and it has been great. Submitted a request earlier for the ability to synchronize saved posts between iOS devices and one day that feature just shows up. So it appears that the developer(s) for this app is listening to feedback and do take action on them. Highly recommended!,5
287,"Craigslist Rating ‚≠êÔ∏è: I love that this app is so much easier to be able reach out to people but also very very easy to save posts that you want to come back too later! 
Plus , The screen is very easy to read instead of the text being so small an seeing so many posts at once and it being overwhelming! 

Anyways , It‚Äôs definitely a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è/ 5‚≠êÔ∏è !!",5
288,"1000x better than OfferUp: I‚Äôve posted probably 20 different items on offer up in the past few months and never once got an offer‚Ä¶ not even a view of my post. ALL of my items have sold through Craig‚Äôs list. I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for years and it‚Äôs always successful. Love the new app too, makes posting and editing so much easier.",5
289,"New chat I love it: New chat is safer in ways and My sale was easy thank you Craig‚Äôs List. 
Furniture is always an easy sale on this site. I‚Äôm not even a buy and sell person to make money , just accumulate over the years. 2nd house and other properties sold with can‚Äôt up keep anymore, someone passes away times are tough. You have help a lot. Thank you again.",5
290,"Useful: I‚Äôve heard that craigslist gets a bad reputation, but in my opinion, it has always been very useful to find and buy items that I may need for my life. Perhaps a suggestion would be to post some screens or some sort of notices in Craigslist to show what are the steps to be safe when dealing locally for buyers that are inexperienced. Other than that I am very happy.",5
291,"Don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get it sooner: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist since the early 2000s. I remember when I got an iPhone in 2008 and waited years for Craigslist to release an app. It only took like a decade but I‚Äôm glad they released this. It‚Äôs much better and more user friendly than the regular website. 

This is a must get app if you use the website even if it‚Äôs seldom.",5
292,"One of the best tools I know of: What an incredibly green thing! Over the years this service has enabled so many people to more efficiently advertise and seek others; whether goods, services or so many other things that Craigslist staff have diligently been aiding this process is commendable. Of course, I believe there‚Äôs a lot of data that is aggregated, so that‚Äôs a benefit to CL.  Well, thanks folks! So well done!!",5
293,"Many great things from Craigslist over the past 15 years: I‚Äôve sold and bought countless items, found apartments and joined a half dozen bands from my time on Craigslist. A glorious surviving entity from the early internet where we weren‚Äôt all being squeezed for every last engagement metric and advertising dollar. 

Zero ads, great communities, great outcomes. And the app is top notch. 

Thank you Craigslist!",5
294,"Plenty of scammers: I wished Craigslist did something to authorize the seller because there‚Äôs so many scammers on here! I‚Äôve been wanting to get a puppy since forever, and today, I found a cute puppy. Texted the person, and they scammed $400 out of me, by using emotional words, like they want me to take care of it because it was their ‚Äúdead dads‚Äù pet and made me write a paragraph to see if I could get it or not. Little did I know, they only did that to make it seem like they are ‚Äúreal‚Äù sellers. I ended up getting scammed, and they were going to scammed me $750 more, but I caught on. 
Don‚Äôt ever buy anything on here, you‚Äôll never get it.",1
295,"Tile saw for sale: I was amazed how quickly the responses were coming in.  Sold the saw the day after my posting.  Putting items on your site was easy.  You made it very clear how to post the item.  Your instructions were easy to follow.  Not complicated in any way.  will recommend you to all my family, friends and business associations.  Thank you.",5
296,"Posting worked great. Communication poor.: The posting worked like it was supposed to. After a couple of weeks someone contacted me and I sold the item. 
My complaint is that originally a posting I put up was taken down without any communication. And when I tried to find out why it was removed there wasn‚Äôt any way for me to contact anyone.",5
297,"Washer/dryer set sold within hours of posting!: We had ordered a new set, and was going to have to pay Home Depot to haul old ones away. I talked husband into letting me try to sale them instead. I posted and had 3 responses within 1 hour. Two of them were wanting to pickup that day. I said who gets here first takes it. It‚Äôs gone and now we can get room ready for new one!",5
298,"Thank God: Thank God for Craigslist. I‚Äôm nearing the end of my life and Craigslist is a medium, a connection between the world and myself, enabling me to make important changes in my life, the economy and the health of the earth. By giving away my belongings for free, I‚Äôm able to provide some financial relief to those in need while taking the financial burden off myself and alleviating the impact of excessive waste. 

Thank you Craigslist‚Ä¶",5
299,"Good app - needs easier verification: Pretty good app but could use with two major improvements. 1- auto fill your location and even categories for selling. Having to go through the selection for every item is annoying when it‚Äôs all the same choices. 
2 - skip the CAPTCHA if you‚Äôre already logged in. The photo captcha is hard to use especially on a phone screen. Log in or two-step validate should be able to skip it! 
Thanks otherwise very good",3
300,"My Craigslist App Experience: My Craigslist App Experience was as simple as I could have ever dreamed. Absolutely flawless! I first used Craigslist 15-20 years ago and I thought it was good then. Now I have to say it‚Äôs GREAT! The ad management ‚Äúthing‚Äù made it easier than expected. I also like the way searching for items has been improved. All around a wonderful, painless experience!",5
301,"The gold standard: There is nothing quite like Craigslist, and when it comes to functionality and convenience, this app makes it easier than ever to browse and search and sell and connect with others in your community. Don‚Äôt waste your time with other forums, and definitely don‚Äôt waste your time with other apps‚Ä¶",5
302,"App is great just one little amendment: The location part, tell your developers to change the way it is to lists of states where we get to choose the part we want to browse and not that I have to think of city or zip to input, not all of us know how to spell some city‚Äôs name. Please change it to list instead me typing and the app guessing put all the states and city there where users will just have to choose not using the map the wrong way. Fix this asap !!!!!!!",3
303,"Old school ads and good community: I equate Craigslist‚Äôs old school approach to the words of Officer Malloy:  ‚ÄúJust the facts, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù  No silly razzle- dazzle, mumbo-jumbo or advertising...thanks team CL.  And kudos to the CL community...super scale in Bay Area makes it my go-to shopping app...Seriously.  And in my 20+ yrs using the app I‚Äôve come across notably few scammers or deadbeats...I know they‚Äôre out there but the bad apples haven‚Äôt spoiled this basket.  Keep it up and keep it simple.",5
304,"I had a thing and forgot to return it: You know when you buy a thing and forget to return it and it languishes in sadness and guilt in your home?

Yeah. I found someone who needed that thing via CL.  Easy to post.  Easy to communicate with interested parties.   Sold it within a week of posting it.  Don‚Äôt forget to renew your postings if there‚Äôs no activity.  That worked!",5
305,"Keeping good stuff out of waste stream: I don‚Äôt generally buy or sell on CraigsList, but I have found homes for many items valued by others that otherwise might have ended up in the dump. Just today, I was able to pass on my mother-in-law‚Äôs unused wheelchair to Sergio, whose worsening mobility challenges may be relieved (even if only slightly!) with this new-to-him mechanism. Thank you, CL!",5
306,"Easy to post and swift responses: Each time I have something that needs a new home. I open this app and get to work.  The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, and once I get a few responses I can easily take down the listing, where it remains in my archives for re-posting or simply as a reminder of what‚Äôs been sold or given away.",5
307,Employee wanted: I put an ad in about a week and a half ago for my dog daycare business. It‚Äôs hard to find someone to work these days and especially for a job like this where there is danger and fun. I found the perfect person after about a week! I would suggest using it because you just might find the person you need!! Thank you,5
308,"My craigslist ads: I have been running dozens of ads since my daughter passed away on Halloween 2021 unexpectedly. I have been both selling things and giving things away. Running ads on craigslist has been helpful. However when an ad expires and I go to repost it after 30 days, I don‚Äôt understand why my photos have disappeared. Then I have to find the item and take new pictures.",4
309,"Best of Craigs list: I‚Äôve tried the other software, the quality of the photographs is by far best, and not having all the irritating locking that I‚Äôve found recently on other Craigs List software finally told me it was time to go!
I‚Äôve made a lot of purchases and don‚Äôt really want a lock up just when I‚Äôm getting ready to purchase something.",5
310,"Better than the website. Prefer the app.: The website is not as intuitive as the app. Appreciate the ease and learning curve Craigslist did. But just be warned, there are definitely scammers, and if they ask to ship a bank check, don‚Äôt do it. I only dealt with cash, but someone offered double my asking price for a product which sounded too good to be true.",5
311,"About as good as Craigslist can get.: I‚Äôve had a problem with CL over the years not being able to search broad areas easily. I was under the impression it had something to do with eBay buying an interest in CL to limit competition or something?  
Well this app works better than SearchTempest at least. Sadly OfferUp and Facebook market are coming for CL",5
312,"Excellent results!: Sold my Volvo XC 70 within 24 hours at a fair price. But beware of the scammers, they dominate this site. Anyone who wants to send you a certified check through the mail is a NO. The certified check is bogus, it clears your bank initially but is bounced at the corporate level. In this game it‚Äôs CASH, ACH, ZELLE or WIRE TRANSFER, nothing else. 

Craigslist $5 can‚Äôt be beat!  The legitimate buyers are out there, you can reach them.",5
313,"Only 1 concern: Lately I have been able to sell more items craigslist than I have on OfferUp. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about craigslist is I wish they would not allow people to post unless they have a phone number sometimes it‚Äôs very hard to communicate without phone numbers and people don‚Äôt respond to their emails as much.
Phone calls and texts are a lot quicker",4
314,"Doin‚Äô the right thing the right way - but‚Ä¶.: Society needs an online ‚ÄúFor Sale by Owner‚Äù that replaces the old newspaper listing. Craigslist is fantastic at filling that need, but can stand to police the businesses that set up a virtual canopy and run a small business. Small business need a place to sell online, but should be separated from the ‚ÄúI got an old one of these that you might want‚Äù group.",5
315,"Pretty good: It‚Äôs nice to be able to use craigslist without always getting automatically signed out of my account like I do on the web browser. However, when posting a new ad, the camera options are limited and I don‚Äôt feel like results are excellent. It would be better if I could just access all the features of my phones camera through the app.",4
316,"Time and true again: We are in the third diplomatic tech era I must say the transition from Web to app, especially on iOS is marvelling. you can count on this platform time and time again, more than its evil child Facebook marketplace. There are no scams on craigslist other than phishing For voice inbox and card info,but I would seriously consider.",5
317,Great: Well thought out app. Could there be a function to display all new items from saved searches at once? When returning to saved searches (from viewing a search) can your position on the list visually be saved and rendered? Can the distance on the map be ‚Äúlocked‚Äù so when dragging the map around it doesn‚Äôt shrink?,5
318,"CL is Still the best: Craigs List gets your add out to a very to a large audience. They don‚Äôt charge a fee or try to make money off you by charging extra to put your add at the top of the list. 
One bit of advice though‚Ä¶ if you include your phone number in the add use words for some of the numbers so that robot technology can‚Äôt detect your number and try to scam you.",5
319,"Beware of scammers: Helpful to list my item on this site but be weary of scammers who may contact you. Two individuals who contacted me had spelling errors and wanted to pay with bank checks for more than the cost of my item so I could pay their mover?!!! Clearly, those sakes did not go through. A third lovely buyer came through, laid via Venmo, and picked up the item. Just be alert to scans though responsible, honest buyers are out there.",4
320,"They Finally Did It: I have no idea how long this app has been good, but years ago it wasn‚Äôt. I downloaded it within the last 6 months and literally use it every day for one reason or another. They really got it right. Smooth, easy, and simple. Not some over-complicated, ad-ridden, spammy, gimmicky, constantly-crashing trash. This is well done, and works great on iPad also which is a huge plus. 

THANK YOU, CRAIGSLIST",5
321,"Craigslist has gone down hill: I sell appliances and listed a few on this website and all I get are the same scam offers. After two weeks of getting scam emails I deleted the app (not one legitimate offer), you can‚Äôt delete your account. shortly after I continued to get texts from the scammers, they say they will mail you a check and then have you ship them the product. I‚Äôve seen this done before they write invalid checks. When seeing all these 5 star ratings I was shocked, this site has been overrun with scammers and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a lot of these reviews are fake.",1
322,Good so far: I haven't used Craigslist for awhile I didn't know what Craigslist is. Until now yeah the app works great. One thing to change is that they ask too many things when selling a bike I can't even sell my bike here because of all those questions they ask which I don't know how to answer then. So if you know all those questions when selling a bike then you shoukd be OK. But like I say I have no clue what those questions are.,4
323,Better than Original: The IOS App is better than original website.  Only issue that comes up is when you click on photos. Sometimes gets stuck. Otherwise really good. Not only for buying but also selling. Putting something up for sale with your smart phone is really easy and works very well.,5
324,Seems to work better than Offer up: We always seem to get more hits and sales than offer up because they push our listings down if you don‚Äôt pay extra to boost your posting. Craigs list doesn‚Äôt push a bunch of internet site retailers like Offer up too. For a smaller town like ours I think CL just works better.,5
325,Better results: I consistently get better results on Craigslist for selling vehicles than with social media classifieds. More serious buyers who know what they are looking for and are friendly and pleas to deal with. I‚Äôve been on Craigslist since 2000 and have always appreciated the community and generally positive culture around buying and selling on the site.,5
326,"Craigslist for Everyone: We‚Äôve used Craigslist for many things over the years.  We have sold, bought and given away many items.  It‚Äôs a great way for up cycling and keep things out of the land fills.  It feels good when you get something for a great price too.  I have the app on my phone and find myself checking it daily.",5
327,"Nice features: As a person who uses Craigslist to buy a lot of used items, particularly cars and furniture (the latter of which you can save a bundle), I just got the app, and it has some very nice features. Besides the obvious time saving on getting to the site, the saved searches and notices when new items you are seeking come up are pretty cool.  Heartily recommend.",5
328,"Great way to sell my nice stuff: Craigslist is such a great website! It is user friendly and safe.  I also appreciate the advice on how not to be scammed.
The only thing that I don‚Äôt understand is why when your post expires you lose all of the photos and have go find them in your photo file or retake them.  Also when my post is about to expire, why can‚Äôt I repost before it expires?
All in all it‚Äôs great!",4
329,"Always reliable response: Bought a new dining room table and chairs and needed to pass the old table and chairs along.  Posted pics and narrative on Craigslist and as usual, sold them in a week.  I always use Craigslist to sell my ‚Äòlike new‚Äô stuff because the people who respond are just good, honest people looking for a bargain. At least that‚Äôs been my experience!",5
330,Sold on Craigslist: It has been awhile since I used CL to sell something and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the new app. Fairly quick and easy. I did receive quite a few request from people who texted my number and then asked for me to email them. Wish CL could do something about these scammer‚Äôs. Overall satisfied with listing service tho.,5
331,"I use it very often!: I use this app very often. I don‚Äôt care for the searching on this app! I used to use CPlus app, but I think Craigslist is blocking them from being able to interface with them now‚òπÔ∏è! CPlus had a much better and more user friendly search function, I‚Äôm not happy! I may just quit using Craigslist all together! Right now I can not filter out ads by dealers, so I have to go through several hundred tractor dealer ads to find the few garden tractor ads and I can‚Äôt search by city either! Boo Craigslist!",2
332,"Good results with some effort: Only thing I wish was that the search results offered more options outside your search area‚Ä¶ like, these are all the conversion vans that are within your area but, here are some more that you might be interested in outside your search area‚Ä¶ then the results are sorted closest from the search area to the furthest.?.?.",5
333,"Craigslist hit or miss‚Äîstill a great app to go back to: A great way to sell and buy used stuff. I have had success with Craigslist for over 10 years for finding roommates, selling items, buying items, and more. It‚Äôs nice they now have an easy to use app as well! A great one to come back to when other competitor apps just aren‚Äôt the right platform.",5
334,"It‚Äôs been great: So far all the interaction I‚Äôve had purchasing things have gone great. I‚Äôve bought a car, sold a car, video game products, furniture, and many more have went smoothly. Just to give people heads up though because I‚Äôve had my fair share of scams. When it‚Äôs too good to be true it‚Äôs usually is. But every good purchase will always be able to show you the product.",5
335,"Good for buying not for selling.: Craigslist is great to find items to purchase and for Wanted ads. But it is difficult to sell from. Many people typically are finicky and want things for nothing or virtually nothing. This is not good if one is selling, even selling within reasonable price ranges. And item can sit there for weeks not being purchased, even when prices are lowered. Besides compared to selling on eBay and Mercari ( I refuse to use  ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù Book Marketplace) Craigslist, at least around here, is about dead. craigslist needs to be revamped I think.",2
336,"Love this app: I started doing a metal work 2 years ago and I was trying to save money so I started using Craigslist for scrap metal. Almost all the metal I have was from Craigslist. I‚Äôve used this app to sell my car too and it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôve gotten instruments, workout equipment, tools, furniture, and god knows what else. I‚Äôm also yet to meet a sketchy person or be put into a bad situation.",5
337,"Seems to not be working now - was good in the past: Have used this app on and off over the years to search Craigslist and always found it useful and efficient. But today, it just doesn‚Äôt work. I can enter a search but no results come up, or just a warning that results are 6 or 4 months out of date. Not sure if this is linked to the recent iOS 17 release or something else. But just not working at the moment.",3
338,"This app revives Craigslist!: I‚Äôve had a lot of success with Craigslist‚Äôs app! Being someone who doesn‚Äôt use a ton of social media for buying and selling any longer (not a Facebook/meta fan) I was thrilled to see Craigslist had finally built an app - super easy to use with good features which make communication secure yet user friendly.

 I highly recommend!",5
339,"I wish I was Craig!: I wish I were Craig he made this list to make it easy on people like us who wouldn‚Äôt know the first thing about posting a free washer and dryer, it connects us as a community by a few stokes on the computer. I wish I was Craig and I wish I would have thought of this 
List. Karen‚Äôs List? No that shows so clich√© like someone was attempting to fly on Craig‚Äôs shirt tails, like Angie‚Äôs List‚Ä¶",5
340,Marketplace seems to be full of scams today craigslist rocks: I have sold on marketplace and I have sold on craigslist and it seems like today every scammer everybody trying to steal from you is on marketplace. They are the wild wild West they don‚Äôt care they don‚Äôt deal with scammers and craigslist has been up and up and I S√©lignac plus I can sell my life stock and livestock equipment with no question.,5
341,"Great way to search used stuff: I use craigslist almost daily as I am always searching for a great deal on a project to keep me busy. There are a lot of great deals to be had and it is a great way to search. You can narrow your search to specific price range, year, make, model, transmission, ect ect. Easy to use. I like that you can search up to a 250 mile radius.",5
342,Stop using Facebook get back on Craigslist!: Getting zero sales on marketplace? Let‚Äôs get everyone back on Craigslist. Way easier to list things. Upload more pictures. Easier to manage your listings. And you won‚Äôt get terminated for violating ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù. Been using CL for 20 years. This app works well and I‚Äôm getting more calls from CL than FB.,5
343,"Great app! Best method for local sales!: I‚Äôve found Craigslist to be the best way to sell items locally. I‚Äôve been selling many items while I‚Äôve been preparing to move‚Ä¶most listings were immediately successful! And I find that using the app is a quick and easy way to get your listings posted‚Ä¶WAY easier to use, in my opinion, than FB Marketplace. Thanks, Craigslist!!",5
344,"Mr Mac: I like Craig's list as it is affordable to list items. I want to be able to search the whole interior United States for items. Also, I would like not to see things posted fifty times in the first few pages. But other than that, I like Craigslist, and I know what to look for in scammers.

Also, when a deleted posting expires on would be nice to be able to see what it was afterward for at least a week.",4
345,"Love it: Such a great resource and outlet I‚Äôm thankful it has not been shut down like other sights. The only issues I face is when people think I‚Äôm a scammer but I‚Äôm not, the only time is if u try to post to much or something in different locations. I throughly enjoy using Craigslist but wish it didn‚Äôt flag people as scammers Bevause majority thsts getting flagged burnt a scammer lol but I still love you Craigslist!",5
346,Worth the tiny fee: Sold our vehicle within a few weeks. The magic to selling at good price to another private party is being fair and honest. I didn‚Äôt like the texting feature but email tends to create delays. To each his own. I recommend always ask interested parties put my name in their responses to help weed out the lousy spam.,5
347,"Modern day classifieds: Nothing compares to Craigslist for selling your stuff locally.  This app is great solution for your mobile device.  Makes it a breeze to manage your items for sale and contact sellers.  I‚Äôve used other ways of selling, but despite the problems, it‚Äôs still the most cost effective way to sell your items.",5
348,Excellent way to unload stuff!: We needed to find a home for two sofas and within three hours the sofas were picked up and taken to their new happy home. I was a little skeptical at first thinking that no one would respond but everything went perfectly and I am so thankful. I will use craigslist again and again from here on out.,5
349,"Try Craigslist first.: Often when I am selling my accumulated home wares, tools, etc. I think and use Ebay. Unfortunately Ebay has become more expensive and cumbersome. The smart way to go is to try Craigslist first. Often items will sell while I am busy doing other things! It has been a good community sale site for me, for many years!",5
350,"So far so good.: Got a few contacts had to low ball the car to get it into the right hands. Needs the money badly. The setting up with the photos was a bit frustrating, it doesn‚Äôt let you update without starting all the pictures over again. You loose the ones already posted to add a few more.",5
351,"Better than Marketplace: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for over a decade and the app for about 3 years now and I list items on both Craigslist and Marketplace. I sell anything from trucks and boats to handmade goods and antiques. I have consistently better results with Craigslist. Sales are faster by far. It seems that while you might get more views on Facebook, you get the more serious buyers on Craigslist.",5
352,"Reliable and Fast: I had an impulse buy that I put online for free, and within 24 hours, someone came to pick it up. This is much better and much faster than those other apps that make you wait a long time for a post to be approved. Craigslist just trusts you to be an adult, and I‚Äôve always appreciated that.",5
353,"Great way to sell!: Easy to use, easy to post, and no hate comments to load up your personal feed on here. People contact you if they want the product and people‚Äôs negative opinions stay to themselves. Also, I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt get a bunch of spam from here anymore which makes it a please to use again! Thanks Craig‚Äôs List!",5
354,"My recent craigslist listing: I found craigslist to be very user-friendly and posting my item for sale was straightforward and easy. My Item sold within a week and both myself and the customer were pleased. In the future, I will definitely use craigslist again for any item that I want to sell.",5
355,"Craigslist Monopoly/ Flagging For No Reason: Community is a place were you cannot pay. Craigslist often don‚Äôt allow legitimate postings to go up. For no apparent reason. Or they get flagged for no apparent reason. And Craigslist often ghosts the person who has legitimate ads being flagged.

It‚Äôs been impossible for me to get Craigslist to respond to why we‚Äôre all these ads flagged. And why were other ads denied from ever going up at all. 

Others post ads exactly like the ones I tried to post. How is this happening?",2
356,"Great way to sell: I‚Äôve used Craigslist and FB Market Place to sell several items recently. The items I‚Äôve sold on Craigslist have been worth more (garage doors and a snow plow), so I‚Äôve asked for more. People on Market Place are generally looking for less expensive items and weren‚Äôt willing to pay for these items. Craigslist also creates a broader audience.",5
357,"SOLD!: This app is by far easier to use than the desktop app/mobile browser. No longer are the days of creating multiple accounts when you forget your password, but now I have a list of items I have sold over the years!

Get the app. Save yourself the headache from the web browser!",5
358,"Feature request!!!!!!!: App is pretty good but I wish the following feature existed:
On the starred items (favorites), I wish It would show you the item that sold or was deleted.  Instead the picture and description get replaced with ‚Äúposting has expired or been removed‚Äù leaving you wondering what the item was that you had originally started and saved as a favorite.",4
359,"Good for everything buying and selling: You will come across a scammer so beware but other than that a great way to buy and sell stuff!  If somebody wants to send you a check for more money than you are selling your item for and they ask you to deposit it and then send the excess money‚Äôs to the person that is going to pick up the item, do not fall for it it is a scam!",5
360,Get what you need Find what you want!: Craigslist has been my go to for many years. They always have great products you can localize your purchases so you don‚Äôt have to drive far or if you can‚Äôt find what you need and you really want it you can search nationwide one of the best apps for getting the job done.,5
361,Retailers and auto dealers: I‚Äôve always checked Craigslist on a daily basses. However I‚Äôve noticed that now auto dealers and furniture dealers have been posting on the ‚Äú for sell‚Äù section of Craigslist. They seem to have taken over most the postings and have blown up the adds with their adds. It‚Äôs very annoying to have to go through all their adds just to find common sellers.,4
362,"Easy to use and no ads: Unlike other selling platforms, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúfeed‚Äù. The landing page starts with categories and subcategories. There‚Äôs no promoting specific items or users. You can save searches and set notifications when a niche thing your looking for gets posted. For that, I give the Craigslist App five stars.",5
363,"Finally an app!: I always loved Craigslist, but the website was tough to navigate on a mobile device. I am very excited to have an app, and the built in chat feature is fantastic! No more searching through and responding to emails when I am trying to offload something. Very glad to have Craigslist back in my life!",5
364,Craigslist is ACTUALLY still relevant!!!: Posting my ad was a last ditch effort finding a Fur-Ever home for my sweet cat and her new kitten litter. I‚Äôm so grateful and literally shocked at how many people reached out in such a short amount of time‚Ä¶..DEFINITELY the way to go when you need to reach a big audience for personal sale items! I‚Äôll for sure be back with more ads! Thanks Craigslist!!,5
365,Be careful: I feel like there‚Äôs more people on here than with OfferUp. I don‚Äôt like the whole promoted thing. It‚Äôs almost like if you don‚Äôt pay to promote things on there then you don‚Äôt get traction. Here you get more traction without paying to promote your stuff. We‚Äôve met some pretty cool people on here. But be careful no matter where you post. There‚Äôs crazies all over.,5
366,"Buying a bed frame, head board and foot board.: The bed was beautiful,  took over a month but wife found what she wanted.  Great people that we purchased it from. It was an hour drive up and back,  rented a u haul all went perfect.  I as a rule have good results using this site.  Now I will list a 1 yr old box spring and bottom frame for free on same site.  Very pleased,  John and Micki.",5
367,"It‚Äôs Craigslist: We all know how it works. Some customers/sellers are better than others. Take a chance, make a new friend! App works well for everything instead of the website where you have to prove you are not a robot just to get the contact information. Really easy to post and manage listings as well",5
368,Stopped working.: Was a little clunky but worked okay. Now it barely works at all. It‚Äôs very laggy takes up to two minutes for it to register an action. Not worth having until they fix the bugs. It‚Äôs just a frustrating mess in its current state. If they can put out a patch soon ill download again,5
369,"As usual, a successful posting and completion!: Seems like I always have success when I use Craigslist, and this was no exception.   Rather than have excess plywood and lumber go in the landfill, through this ad I was able to get it to a college group who was looking for materials to complete a project because they didn‚Äôt have any funding.  A win-win...thanks, Craigslist!",5
370,"Removal or ‚Äúblocking‚Äù: My posts were often removed due to  not following the rules. But I can‚Äôt help bu think my posts were removed due to another seller marking my post as inappropriate, when it was not. Finally one day my post remained untouched. And given that I did not break any rules, there would be no reason for Craigslist to remove. I wish there was a better way to police reported posts.",4
371,To much pornography: It used to be a great app but in the last 6 months it has become unsafe to shop on it. CL has a lot ( even 1 is to many. There is WAY more than just one) of raw porn pictured. I used to like using CL but e we it‚Äôs the filth being advertised it really isn‚Äôt safe for anybody to ever use. I do not recommend using CL. You will run way to much risk of ruining yourself morally and a whole lot more.,5
372,Easy to review: I enjoy the app quick and easy to review whatever you need. Live how it returns to the same level of page you were previously on. Unlike the web it goes to the top of the page and you have to scroll down to get back to the section you were viewing.,5
373,"Using Zillow was a mistake?: Did I try to post on Zillow? Huge Mistake? Sure I got tons of calls? People requesting application? Everyone requesting a time to come view the home? Only one problem? Almost nobody would show up? Sent tons of applications? Yet none would come back completed? One person do their part the other people listed blew it off? 

You need a office staff just to wade through volume of red tape?

Craig's List please just keep it simple?",4
374,"Craigslist has always worked for me.: Not everyone is on F-book.  Marketplace is probably fine for a lot of people, but Craigslist . . . Call me a romantic, I like an application that does one thing well.  I don‚Äôt have to deal with anything but posting my ad, no distractions.  And I‚Äôve always had good results, both buying and selling.",5
375,"Still the Best: Craigslist works, it‚Äôs still free and has good search results when shopping, without demanding money to prevent your ad from being buried at the bottom when selling.
There are commercial ads placed by dealers who flood the page with multiple ads but they are jerks, and not Craigs fault. Its clean, easy to use, and Still the best!",5
376,"App Works Great: App does one thing and does it exceptional well. The craigslist ad is Simple, Easy to use, navigate, and post ads. One of the features I enjoy the most is the ability to store and reference a credit card so that we don‚Äôt have to continually re-enter information every time we wish to place an ad.",5
377,"Great website except the scammers: Yes scammers run rampant on Craigslist, for awhile it seemed they had gone but they are back with a vengeance it seems Wanting you to respond , thus they get your email and next comes the SPAM on my Gmail Still where else is like Craigslist? Don‚Äôt say Fakebook, the scammers are there too So, Craigslist isn‚Äôt so bad, it would be great if they could filter out the scammers that prey on the people using it",4
378,"Minimally functional: I only use this app for the few local buyers and sellers that haven‚Äôt switched to other platforms yet. I do occasionally get a sale here or there, but nothing like I used to 10 years ago. 

Functionality is not fantastic. The app works probably 70% of the time; the rest of the time there is some random error that keeps something from working. Still easier than using the website though.",3
379,"Much Easier than Website: The app makes it easier to communicate with buyers and post items right from your phone. It could be improved by allowing you to respond to all messages in the app not just those who used the app to message you, like better integration with your account. I still have to go to email to respond to most people.",4
380,"Great Classifieds Service: I have bought and sold numerous household items and vehicles in the past decade on Craigslist. There is a lot to sift through but the filters make that easy. You can even save searches. 
There are no ads and no harassment. Just be smart about the information you share. 
This is my go to non-retail buying / selling spot",5
381,Very convenient: If you need something and you‚Äôre not trying to go to the store if you want it cheaper this is definitely the app because you can find people in your community who are selling items for a lower prices than the store and even though it‚Äôs used it‚Äôs still great quality I love this app!!!,5
382,"Roomate- cost of living: I could not have stayed in my beautiful home with my cat,  if it wasn‚Äôt for Craigslist I would not have found 2 amazing roommates for the past two years I have been able to sustain the lifestyle I want to live‚Ä¶ & there are great people out there‚Ä¶ you have to try, make an effort‚Ä¶ and go from there!! Good luck to future renters & roomies.",5
383,"Does what you need, no more no less: It‚Äôs refreshing to have an app without fluff. When it comes down to it, this app does what you need and not much else. Craigslist is still the best community to sell things to people who actually want to buy, and buy from people who actually want to sell. Keep it up Craigslist team.",5
384,"An example of the internet at its best: One of the last remaining free and ad free online services. Works well and is a service to people near and far, an example of what the internet can be. No manipulating algorithms, no signing your rights away with ridiculous user agreements, just a way to connect to goods and services via the internet. An A+ service and app.",5
385,"top tier app design: words can‚Äôt express how much i repect craigslist for keeping this same, simple, quick app design. no frills or animations it‚Äôs just SOOO simple and so easy to use it gets me every time !!! like it‚Äôs just so fast to do what you wanna do. obviously the listings are hit or miss but ya gotta love craigslist for keeping their same old design on both the site and the app !!! got dam!!!!",5
386,"I love Craigslist: Love love love it. I‚Äôve been using Craigslist on the web since 1997. I resisted installing the app because I‚Äôm old and stubborn and cranky and i hate change. But I finally bent to the ways of progress, and I‚Äôm so glad I did. Of course Craigslist, always sans bells and whistles, made the easiest and most user friendly community focused app ever. Thank you Craigslist! XOXOXO",5
387,"Finally Sold: I had an unusual product that took a long time to sell, but finally someone needed them and cleaned me out. I had a lot of Rubbermaid bins like TSA uses at airports. I would not have gotten much for them if I just dropped the price quickly, but I dropped the price slowly and the buyer was tickled pink to get them for 1/3 of the online price.",5
388,"Sold Motorcycle: We had an actual human interested in the bike. We advertised other places and got lots of interest, but nobody showed up when promised. The person on craigslist reached out, showed up, and made things easy. I‚Äôm definitely glad we used craigslist. They got a great deal on a beautiful bike and I have my garage space back.",5
389,"Search is broken = App crippled [fixed 25Feb2024]: After the latest update, the text entry field for Search function doesn‚Äôt accept text unless you type VERY quickly. Requires stopping and starting the app. The app is essentially unusable until this is fixed.

Edit: As of Feb 25th, this has been fixed",5
390,Awesome: This app is easier to use than the actual desktop computer way. I usually always prefer to do everything on a desktop computer but this app is hands down the better way. I will only use this app for anything craigslist related from now on. It practically does it for you.,5
391,"Craigslist ‚Äì still the best: I have rented apartments as both a tenant and landlord, bought a car, sold a car, bought and sold guitars, surfboards, stereo equipment, the list goes on and on and on. Nothing compares to Craigslist. Free to use, and so unstressful.
The only thing I don‚Äôt use Craigslist for anymore is buying concert tickets ‚Äì too easy to get scammed.
But otherwise it‚Äôs amazing!",5
392,"Great functionality, couple features missing: I like the app a lot, the way you can select a radius as opposed to a list of areas is nice. I would like an option to save listings where the ad is saved on my device, and remains there when expired. I would like to see what gets sold and when, instead of just having the ad disappear from my saved list.",4
393,"Been using Craigslist forever. The app makes it even easier: I‚Äôve had great fortune finding just what I want at the right price, and selling my expensive stuff so I don‚Äôt lose tons of money. Craigslist has been very good to me over the years and the app makes certain functions much easier. Five stars all the way",5
394,If it weren‚Äôt for scammers I‚Äôd give you guys a five: It‚Äôs not craigslist‚Äòs fault that there‚Äôs so many crooks in this world. The app is easy to use. Easy to list my items and post photographs. The only dilemma is opening up your self to people that are lazy and want something for nothing. The people that buy the items I‚Äôve listed over the years call me on the phone and are genuine human beings. Thank you craigslist.,4
395,"Love it!  Much better than FB Mktplace: I like the Craigslist app much better than FB Mkt place because even when you filter to only see local, you still get a ton of new products that show up, scammers with very low priced items, etc.  Craigslist is exactly what you expect which is people in your area selling used items!!!",5
396,I love Craigslist: Craigslist has been great! I‚Äôve listed and sold dozens of items as well as bought lots of items. It‚Äôs nice to keep the transactions somewhat personal too! I have made friends with some of the people I‚Äôve dealt with. And isn‚Äôt that what‚Äôs life is all about? People are the most important thing in the world! Thanks Craigslist for enriching my life.,5
397,Still one of the greats: What do you have the surprise Craigslist app where is very well. Locations work correctly. it‚Äôs not over run with ads and it‚Äôs my go to over the dreaded FB marketplace. Scammers are everywhere. Facebook is overrun. Craigslist seems to get the real people that want to sell the real product. Thanks for hanging tough Craigslist.,5
398,"Great except...: The one feature this app lacks, forcing me to use the website is that on the app I can‚Äôt select which categories I want to search. It lets you select either one or all the categories. This is a huge problem because (as well all should know) the cars and trucks category needs to be unchecked in order to find anything.
On the webpage, I can unselect ONLY the cars and trucks category which is a huge help.",4
399,"Found it on CL: I‚Äôve had nothing but good luck on Craigslist, I‚Äôve found and purchased a lot of hard to find parts for vintage hot rods from coast to coast. Also have been successful with selling vintage parts on CL. I‚Äôm on CL daily looking for the deals,and have found some good ones. If you‚Äôre a car guy, I would recommend the app for sure.",5
400,"Works GREAT for Me!: Found my last three great condos for rent by owner on Craig‚Äôs List. ALSO- that‚Äôs where non-traditional (not looking for illegal!) gig jobs are posted where it‚Äôs a quick temporary positions for great cash! Aka event work!
Gone is the PennySaver-type newspaper free every week with same type stuff! 
Happy there‚Äôs a platform for the unique & unusual. Would miss Craig‚Äôs List if no replacement.",5
401,"Amazing & Functional App: Really well integrated with the notifications, it‚Äôs clear that the people who work on this app use it. I love being able to zoom in deep into a hyper local location and then save a search that notifiers me when a matching product pops up. Facebook Marketplace is garbage for anything local. 

Great job folks!",5
402,Most Up-to-the-minute listings ‚Äî responsive & reliable: I‚Äôve relied on craigslist for years and still do today to have the most current sale options local to me. Listings don‚Äôt last for years they move quickly and so you know you‚Äôre getting some thing that‚Äôs available now.,5
403,"Craigslist FOREVER!: I love craigslist. It is the people's marketplace.
This app is a little low rent haha but it works and in a world of slick apps trying to sell you something... craigslist refreshes and reminds us that the diy, the local, the community based, it's all the best things.

Use safety whenever doing transactions. Many libraries and police stations offer public places to do trades.",5
404,"Excellent with the largest selection: Always find what I‚Äôm looking for and CL is a consistent sourcebook for me to go to first for local goods. I do not like the fact CL offers personal sections like for dating, escorts and the like but the items for sale sections are always useful to me. Any social media platform can be abused and misused but if used the right way, carefully, CL is a great resource.",5
405,"Furniture Sale - Response: Creating and posting my article was very easy and I was able to make a sale at full price within 1 day. The buyer was on time and professional.  The communication between buyer and seller using the Craig email notification system was very timely and was very useful in facilitating the sale. 

Thank you",5
406,"For sale posts: Craigslist has fallen off pretty bad over the years. I used this site for all my buys and sells. Now it‚Äôs the worst site to pull in business on, and now they want to charge you for it when all others are free‚Ä¶ This will be the death of CL unless they change things up. Not sure how they think they‚Äôll be able to compete with FB market place, offerup, ect. With that business plan. It‚Äôs starting to be a waste of time to even make a post because I rarely ever get a buyer on here anymore. Advice get off your A$* and make some productive updates!",1
407,"Dear Craigslist: I been using this app for 1@ years it‚Äôs been great but since Craigslist it‚Äôs been charging for private sellers to sell a car or motorcycle I really prefer other sites ,, you should take off that fees $5 for a single post ?? We are not a dealers ,, I hope you understand that thanks again for been there for us Craigslist",5
408,Could be a bit better: Wish there was a better search layout there needs to be a better way to contact someone like get rid of the old school email have something to where u can ask a ? Or leave a message and there notified emails get lost then both parties loose out,5
409,"Craigslist: My only complaint is that I wish it was easier to hide certain search results when searching for jobs. Yes, DoorDash, I know I can make $22 an hour delivering for you, I saw the other 17 posts. Other than that, I have never used a service better than my friend Craigs' list, the app just made it that much better B)",5
410,"Why is craigslist not the best app in the world: Nobody in flying the plane !! 
What I want is to sell my stuff for some quick money to someone like me 
What my customer wants is to get a deal on something Im done with. The problem is car dealers and business people getting in the middle. They need their own app. We should  not have to be trying to figure out if were dealing with a business",5
411,"Only gotten better: Need a place to live Craigslist, need to sell some items to come up with the rent Craigslist, need to find a job so you don‚Äôt have to sell any more of your stuff Craigslist. Need to find more stuff to buy Craigslist Thank you Craigslist for being my go to place, when I need a place to go.",5
412,"Easy & successful!: I have never sold anything on Craigslist prior to downloading the app this last week and making my first post. It was easier than most other selling platforms I‚Äôve tried, and I made a sale within 24 hours. Will be using it again for my future listings!",5
413,Sold Thanks to Craigslist: I count on craigslist for buying or selling any kind of item locally. I appreciate their email system although I prefer to be contacted by phone call or text & I‚Äôm grateful they have this option. I‚Äôm quite successful selling on Craigslist and I Search Craigslist when I‚Äôm looking for items I need or want.,5
414,"CR App is Awesome: I‚Äôve been using the app for a few years now, and the functionality from my phone is absolutely fantastic. Everything is easy to access and creating posts and managing them is easy and intuitive‚Ä¶ or maybe it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve  been using it for a few years. Ah, either way üëçüèΩ",5
415,Chisel Plow: I started getting responses almost immediately. Granted the first ones were because I listed my phone number and it was scammers wanting to take over my telephone account but once I remedied that I had serious buyers offering to come look at my plow the first day. It‚Äôs sold within a matter of days. Very happy with craigslist!,5
416,"Recommended: It does what it says on the tin and is pretty functional. Would like the option to filter searches into multiple sub categories instead of having to choose one at a time. For instance, search ‚Äúamp‚Äù in electronics and musical instruments and general for sale. Currently I have to select one at a time, run through those results, and then select another.",4
417,"Fantastic for Buying or Selling: The only problem with CraigsList are all the scammers.  ‚ÄúI love your [motorcycle] but I am out of town.  I would like to send a money order for an extra $500.  Please give my agent change, keep an extra hundred for yourself.‚Äù  Certainly not CraigsList fault, just be careful.  But for buying or selling this app can‚Äôt be beat.",5
418,"Good app: I like the Craigslist app because it shows the pictures without having to view the listing. I wish that there was a better way to filter results, though. For instance, I'm looking for a pet, but I specifically want a dog, and there's no way to refine that without putting it into a search bar that only uses that key word instead of including all terms like ""puppy"", etc.",4
419,Great Response to my Ad: I got multiple responses to my ad within a few minutes of posting a sofa bed for sale. Buyer is sending a cashier‚Äôs check. All looks good. First response was fraudulent. Be careful!!! Second offer paid cash and took the sofa bed. Worked out well! Once again‚Äîbe careful! Only accept cash and in-person delivery.,5
420,"Excellent!! Sold fast!!: In the last few months I have listed two vehicles on CraigsList. Great platform and easy to create a post. The first vehicle sold in an hour and then the one I recently listed late in the evening sold by noon the following day. Both were priced fairly, which of course helps and found the right buyer. Thanks CraigsList!",5
421,"Worth the wait: While I did wait what felt like 8 years (maybe it actually was?) for a functional iOS app for Craigslist, this one is at least worth the wait. I do wish my favorites would sync across devices (they don‚Äôt) but honestly this is still so much better than anything we had before.",5

I just installed your Official iOS app on my iPhone 11. My software is up to date. Is is because I‚Äôm using a VPN? If so, why? Your Privacy and Security statement says Craigslist is secure, doesn‚Äôt sell ‚Ä¶ Odd thing is this: Opening your Official iOS app, trying to connect, a message appeared stating that ‚ÄúSafari cannot connect‚Äù, because it is Restricted?

I‚Äôm not impressed at all üòï May uninstall ‚òÆÔ∏è quickly‚ÄºÔ∏è I never have felt Secure using Craigslist, just wanted to give you a second chance üò£",1
423,Amazing: Don‚Äôt have a bad thing yet to say about it. I used third party apps for years but was never satisfied but this one does everything I want. Notifications are super fast which was always something other apps struggled with. Love that you can select search area based on mileage from your location.,5
424,"OG Craigslist üëçüèΩ: I love that there is an app for craigslist. Because between all of the other places to sell stuff online, marketplace, all of these weird new fangled apps I still prefer to use the OG online selling platform. It‚Äôs a great app the only thing I would add to it would be the ability to easily flip back to the prior page without having to hit the back arrow. Otherwise fabulous.",5
425,"Works great without stealing my attention: I don‚Äôt know what would be my life like without Craigslist, the app is a beauty. As someone concerned with privacy and the amount of ads everywhere, I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better service. I deleted my Facebook years ago and never really had a good experience there. I hope the simplicity never changes, it‚Äôs what makes CL unique.",5
426,"Great interface, room for improvement: I prefer this app to any of the 3rd party ones I had tried. 

There are a few glitches that I‚Äôd like to see worked out (i.e., ‚Äúmore Ads by this user‚Äù buttons don‚Äôt work) and some improvements could be made (such as search within multiple categories simultaneously).

But it gets the job done fine.",5
427,"#1 source to sell/buy!: Over the years, Bought my last four vehicles from private owners through Craigslist!  All of them turned out great used cars that last 242k+ miles!

428,"My cats: I posted help for my cats to be placed in a new home. Things changed and I no longer was able to keep themüòû I placed an add for help asap. And the community responded in the first hour. My cats are with the new family. The new family said they will keep me posted.

429,"‚ÄòFree‚Äù engine and transmission: Listed for one dollar was an Austin 947 engine and transmission. Within 3 days a Dad and his son arrived to take it home. The Dad was using it as a project to do with his son.

Craigslist just made the entire process so simple‚Ä¶thanks to everyone!!",5
430,"Best Platform for Selling: I‚Äôve had excellent success selling items on Craigslist. If you are not having luck here, check the components of your posting. It is important to select the proper category, to post accurate and complete descriptions, to take well-composed & well-lit photos and to price fairly, based on similar competing ads.",5
431,Craigslist: Craigslist has always been my ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù for selling items locally. They have definitely improved their website over the years for placing ads. So much easier to load and post photos of your items for sale compared to five years ago. Keep up the good work. Thanks! Linda,5
432,Craigslist app is good!: I have used the Craigslist app many times. It seems well organized and useful. I do wish we could select our region by cities however. The map circle is not so helpful here in the Bay Area. I would really like to be able to choose the exact cities I want to get ads from. Bridges are expensive and waterways can take up a lot of the MAP!,4
433,First sale: I used this app for the first time when I had a last minute change of plans and could not attend a concert the night before. I was able to easily post the tickets for sale and respond to I queries by email to get the tickets sold. Will definitely use this app more often.,5
434,"I‚Äôm the user of the website: I started to use the website more than 10 years ago and have been very happy with it, but most of the time I only use it with PC.  Recently, I decided to try the cell phones version and found it was equally user friendly as it‚Äôs PC version.",5
435,"App not as good as internet browser: A lot of the time, when I am searching something specific in the app, it says there is no results. When I use my internet browser and search the same exact thing in the Craigslist search bar and it magically has so much. (Distance is always set the same, as well) Also when a phone number is hidden within the app, there is no way to show the number only the email but if you are in the browser it gives the option to show phone numbers.",1
436,"Consistent Results: I have used Craigslist for many years - for renting out houses to selling things to offering stuff for free.  Also have purchased several boats and other miscellaneous stuff.  I find it easy to use as a seller and buyer. 

I‚Äôm not a Facebooker so have never used Marketplace so can‚Äôt compare but have no complaints!",5
437,Sale: App works great. Thanks!!!  It‚Äôs getting harder to find people who are truly interested in buying something from you without trying to scam you. I do appreciate this app especially since many people truly are wanting to have a place where they can actually buy and sell!,5
438,Posted a car and sold in less than two hours: The app was very easy to use and to post a car.  It was very effective. I received 4 at nquiries in less than an hour after posting my ad. Sold the car in less than two hours after posting.,5
439,"A great first go to: When I‚Äôm thinking of buying anything. This is where I check first. And when I‚Äôm selling anything it‚Äôs the first place I post to. 
Craigslist might be the O.G for selling and buying. But it still works! Have gotten and given many furniture items and child related items through Craigslist. Long live the list of Craig üòù",5
440,Coastal Barn Estate Sale: The sale was up in the foothills in Cloverdale and quite isolated. But once I got the news out via Craigslist to assorted areas - even as far away as Vancouver- folks came. I was able to show photos of the great inventory and leave descriptions that brought buyers from near and far. Thank you Craigslist and the good people that follow it.,5
441,"Quick and easy selling!: This app makes it so easy to attach images, add descriptions, set my contact preferences, edit, and update/delete.  All my posts are easily organized.  And I can access everything immediately via my max/pc online.  Craigslist sets the bar for buyers/sellers.  I‚Äôm a power user.  The Craigslist iOS app simply ROCKS!",5
442,"Brought traffic to my garage sale!: Solid! I found it easy to advertise my garage sale with multiple pictures. Then, with the sale in progress, i freshened up my advertising presence by crafting a new version, with a new headline and improved directions, based on feedback from actual customers.  All for free. Bravo, Craigslist!",5
443,Better than Offerup: This has so many more great features than Offer Up I‚Äôm glad I tried it and now I‚Äôm using it and I never knew how great it was.I really like the way Craigs List works. It's got a lot more features well maybe Not a lot but a really important one for me when it comes to Helping your neighbor with a garage sale,5
444,"Why aren‚Äôt there a kids section AND adult section?: Craigslist was an amazing free dating site and was amazing but I don‚Äôt live close to any major town or city so, having a further reach to meet new and interesting people was totally cut off when craigslist stopped the hookup ads?
I am a single 35 yo man trying to post ads on craigslist but EVERY single ad I post, is taken down and I‚Äôm really getting tired of my ads being removed???
Since you guys aren‚Äôt thinkers or doers, I‚Äôll give you a simple idea, POST a picture I.D. to enter the adult section? Poof, problem solved!!!!!",1
445,"Sold motorcycle locally, easily: Had my bike listed on both CycleTrader and Craigslist, and got far more action from Craigslist. 

Only quibble is all the scammers who go after the car/motorcycle ads. I had five of them respond to my ad (‚Äúlet us send you a check, then we‚Äôll have someone scoop up the bike ‚Ä¶before the check gets returned‚Äù üòÆ)",5
446,Needed feature: A feature that would be nice is a simplified message system between users. Maybe something as simple as price offers and acceptance/counter offer. This would eliminate the need to post personal info and have all the scammers contact you. Facebook marketplace is making CL less user friendly. But us non FB users need a better system.,4
447,Love the Craigslist system that keeps out the scammers: Your system is so good when they have to go through craigslist I gave up on craigslist a long time ago because all I got was bad people trying to scam me for my phone number and other bad things now when I go through craigslist system it‚Äôs amazing,5
448,"Success!: I don‚Äôt sell items much on Craigslist, offer up, etc., usually a household item here and there. But when I do, I place the post on the Craigslist app and also on two other local listing apps. Every time, my Craigslist ad sells first at the best offer. Even sold my little Mazda commuter car (with 100k miles) for asking price in less than two hours!",5
449,"Best online selling service available: Much better than facebook marketplace. People show up, people don‚Äôt ask ‚Äúis it still available ?‚Äù. They supply real buyers for us. Suggest u get their app. Better than the other selling services. I‚Äôve had good luck with their motor vehicle and power sports, and it‚Äôs only $5.00.",5
450,"Craigslist: I enjoy craigslist not only for looking for items to purchase, but also I use the job app. I have no problem always everything‚Äòs working well again I use not just the jobs but for buying things and and and many many options.",5
451,"CRAIGSLIST IS THE BEST: have been on craigslist since 2001 not only I‚Äôm a huge fan but I have to thank Craigslist for the many jobs opportunities that offered me through the years!
Motion Picture Editors Guild in comparison is a joke!
I‚Äôm a member and they NEVER found me work 
they do not offer a platform like Craigslist does for crew and creative gigs!
Thanks Craigslist! I absolutely LOVE YOU",5
452,My experience with Craigslist: Have had great success with items I‚Äôve bought and sold over the many years I‚Äôve been registered on Craigslist. They continue to improve their site using improved techniques and technology. It has been a great experience and at the right price.,5
453,Craigslist vrs Facebook: I listed my Lexus on FB for over 2 weeks and the only activity I got was people asking to lower my price $4000 to what they believed KBB value was. I removed it from FB and listed it for $2000 higher on Craigslist. Sold the car for higher than the FB listing. Very pleased with the results and amount of inquiries from Craigslist.,5
454,"Craigslist worked, and fast: We posted yesterday afternoon and closed sale of our car for the price we wanted before noon today.  The beauty of the Craigslist Application is that it is easy and quick to create a very attractive high quality post in minutes ‚Äî and it worked!",5
455,"Craig list is great: What I like about craigslist is that it has new items every day where I go onto other apps somebody's selling stuff from 4 to 6 months ago you're not even sure they have it.  
Plus if you're selling something it's a wider audience for you. What like always you Gotta watch out for scammers",5
456,"Always works for me: I was helping my stepson move. He and his wife didn‚Äôt want to move a piece of furniture 1200 miles to their new home. 
I thought how about a free item posting on Craigslist.
I‚Äôve gotten rid of a few items this way. 
It always works for me.
This armoire was gone within 2 hours after the post.",5
457,"Quick and easy: Was able to sell 4 items pretty quickly on here and all the buyers came to my house to pick them up so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with mailing it or meeting someone in a random location. 
5/5 stars and I‚Äôll definitely use it again if I have more things to sell.",5
458,"Great for selling cars: I sold my car on Craigslist for a $5 ad. Totally worth it. Had it listed on Facebook marketplace too, and that was ‚Äúfree‚Äù but they want you to pay to ‚Äúboost‚Äù your ad. Facebook did not generate as many replies as Craigslist did. Have listed on auto trader in the past also, with little success. Craigslist is still the best.",5
459,"No fee selling site: I was able to sell my tires from my home that would have otherwise been sitting in my garage taking up space for who knows how long without seller fees,I didn‚Äôt have to set up a social media profile just to make a post on marketplace and the buyer came to me with cash. Good experience.",5
460,"Easy to use Craigslist now!: This app makes it super easy to post and find things on craigslist now. There are a few things that I wish were a little bit better, but overall this app is pretty awesome. As always, take care when meeting somebody that you don‚Äôt know for a sale.",5
461,Craigslist has been great.: Been selling for the past month. So far gone off without a hitch. P.S. little tip. I don‚Äôt share my number on the posts and request a phone number with each email contact. I‚Äôve had no spam problems this way. I posted my phone # in the past and had all sorts of trouble.,5
462,So convenient and environmentally friendly: I have always loved Craigslist for its environmentally friendly aspects. It helps build your local community and allows you to reuse things versus getting entirely new ones!! So great. And the app makes it insanely convenient. It performs well and makes it easy to check as frequently as necessary and post new listings. Nice work Craigslist!!,5
463,"Avid craigslist user: I‚Äôve been using craigslist for more than 10 years to help giveaway clutter around my house, buy and sell my cars, buy and sell household items and more. The craigslist app is simple: functionality is straightforward and easy to use no gimmicks. Craigslist user for life. Thank you.",5
464,"CL still works!: I‚Äôve been on CL for many, many years. Other listing sites come and go, but it‚Äôs still one of the best sites out there. It has its share of scammers, but they all do and you just have to be smarter than them and shut them down when they contact you. It‚Äôs still the most effective site out there so I‚Äôll keep coming back.",4
465,"Apts for rent cape cod and Boston Area's: Received more inquires than my posts in Boston south shore area but I think Zillow is taking most of the R. E. Leads ! Zillow is charging people for credit checks and not telling people sometimes the landlord STILL want to do their own so the people get charged twice, once by Zillow and then again by the landlords ! Alot of landlords like to do their own credit reports.",4
466,"Great Way to Buy & Sell!: I‚Äôve used this app for several years now, and it‚Äôs become almost my full time source of income! It‚Äôs so easy to post things you want to sell and extremely easy for communicating with buyers now even through the app too! I love this app and can‚Äôt recommend it enough! :)",5
467,"Love this app: People who aren‚Äôt using Craigslist - especially with this app if using their phone - are really missing out. I recall in earlier versions being able to search in more than one location (you could even search every listing in the US, which I once used to buy something from Hawaii). I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs possible with this version, unfortunately - which is why I rated 3 stars.",3
468,"Solid: I‚Äôve gotten timely responses from every user I had questions for, even if it was letting me know a sale or trade wasn‚Äôt going to work out and that‚Äôs much more preferable to no response.
Also all the transactions that did happen were positive and smooth, truth be told I‚Äôm pretty new on here but so far so good",5
469,"Most views: I always reach the widest audience with this platform. Whether I‚Äôm selling something or renting out a room in my house, I always get so many responses. When I am looking for something on Craigslist, the filters really help me zero in on what I‚Äôm looking for and how far I‚Äôm willing to go to get it and what I‚Äôm willing to pay for it. 
Love it!",5
470,15 years of using!: I‚Äôve been using craigslist for over 15 years now and I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs my go to when I‚Äôm trying to find a good deal or try to sell some thing that I no longer need. Who knows what opportunity you might find next when you‚Äôre searching craigslist,5
471,Very easy to list an item for sale and it is free!: I have been using Craigslist all these years! With skepticism at first but turned out everything I listed sold within few weeks some items as fast as few days! Who could ask for anything more? I wonder!,5
472,Still the original ads listing app: Sure there are other ‚Äúads‚Äù listing apps but Craigslist has always been the original. I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for over 20 years way before the internet was as big as it is now. Haven‚Äôt had a bad sell or buy yet! A+ app and service.,5
473,"Craigslist still the best: I‚Äôve tried FB Marketplace for buying and selling and it‚Äôs a pain for both (besides the egregious privacy issues!). Freecycle is confusing. By far, I‚Äôve found donating things through Craigslist ‚Äúfree‚Äù is the easiest method to use and attracts the most communicative buyers. The app makes it super easy to post and edit listings.",5
474,Way better than using the browser version: I‚Äôm only giving it four stars because I just started using it today but my first impression is it‚Äôs much better than posting things with the browser version. No needing to do the back and forth through email and everything just kind of flows a bit better.,4
475,"Craigslist still crushes the other wannabe apps/sites: I am so successful with Craigslist in selling my items and obtaining items I need that I am surprised anyone would use anything else. 

For all the folks who don‚Äôt like Craigslist out there, let me ask you:

How much effort do you put into your post? You only get out of it what you put into it. Sure, you can use the other sites, but they are for people who don‚Äôt think so far as I am concerned!  Make good posts! Make compelling sales! Put yourself in your potential customer‚Äôs shoes and ask yourself: would I buy from this post based on its content?

Craigslist is Great!",5
476,Successful Sale of my car.: Weeding through scammers and dreamers that make offers on pennies to the dollar are annoying and a waist of time but at the end of it all some one came through with a cash offer that is reasonable like a real buyer should. CL still a great format to sell Facebook and offerup get people with no motivation to buy and BS‚Ä¶,5
477,"New app: Actually thought something wrong - nope an update ‚Äî did I say ‚Äúeasier to use - layout cleaner‚Äù definitely give this a plus as an app upgrade. So wish the other app was just done with taken me a few days or so to even think ‚Äúhey maybe, there is an update or something.‚Äù  Now we know.",5
478,Amazing app: It allows you to sell with ease what I love the most out of this app is the fact when you sell you have an option to be contacted by cellphone which is fantastic as some apps don‚Äôt push notifications I am able to answer quickly because I am all the time on my cellphone,5
479,"Great app. Bad spam buyers.: I love the craigslist community. It‚Äô wonderful to put things that I have enjoyed into the hands of a buyer that will give them a second life.
I hate, yes that‚Äôs a strong word, the scam ‚Äúbuyers‚Äù. No one is stupid enough to be fooled by them, but it is a waste of time to get  text from the scammers. I wish something could be done about it.",5
480,"Craigslist has always been good to me!!!: Sold my washer and dryer in about 24 hours after posting. You may or may not get bot text but honestly who falls for that.
‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm out of town but I‚Äôll send someone to pick it up and I‚Äôll Send you a check in The mail ‚Ä¶ yeah right!!!
 Love Craigslist it‚Äôs great just don‚Äôt be dumb and you‚Äôll love it too!",5
481,"Let‚Äôs catch them & do something!: I loved that I was able to sell my item on Craig‚Äôs list, but I gave a 4 star rating because I had so many scam artists trying to manipulate the sell of my items. I think the FBI should get involved with the calls and text of those trying to scam the seller. Smart phones can read their phone numbers and where they are from.",4
482,"Loving the app: Saves lot of time. Easy to search, manage postings. What I liked most being, now I am able to expand the search area scope from the map itself. On the browser, we are expected to put city name (correctly). Now with app it is a breeze. Select the interested area from the map and viola.",5
483,Craigslist is the GOAT: I am one of the biggest Craigslist fans. I have found many rentals through this app! Currently living in a house that I love thanks to Craigslist! I was able to move here because of a teaching job I found on the app! I‚Äôve furnished my entire place and I‚Äôm constantly upgrading by buying and selling items! One of the last true forms of free market! Enjoy!,5
484,"GR8 app 3 years running: Still using this one without bugs. Very easy to put up my items for sale or look for stuff for myself or others. And this app has kept up with Craigslist‚Äôs changes. 

Tried 4 other Craigslist apps. 
Using iPhone 14 & iPad mini. 
Running iOS 17.x with no issues",5
485,"better than facebook: Recently sold a vehicle via CL, worked great, way less fuss than facebook!!! Posted same item on FB and got daily lowball offers and rude people. Everyone who contacted me via CL was seriously interested. Much prefer the simplicity of CL!!! Let‚Äôs all quit wasting our time on facebook and sell on CL.",5
486,Craigslist works: Craigslist is still the best app for getting rid of stuff for free. I have had a lot of success getting rid of stuff that I didn‚Äôt have to pay to remove with Craigslist. The right people see it and made it happen. You must be very specific so that part is on you.,5
487,Same job post Allowed too many times.: The app is awesome the only thing I would correct is that 1 job post comes out 20 or more times in a row. It should be limited allowing people to see a different Job opportunity in a faster way. Everything else seems great.,5
488,Way better than Facebook Marketplace: Don‚Äôt fix what‚Äôs not broken. Craigslist is still the best when it comes to buying and selling used goods. I kept getting nickled and dimed on Facebook and refused to settle. I finally posted on Craigslist and had a cash buyer at my full asking price in about two weeks.,5
489,Love Craigslist: I have made a lot of sales on here more then 5mile and offer up. I have also purchased my surface pro on here and my ps5 for cheap! Been using Craigslist for 15 years and never had anything it smooth transactions and I sell things faster on here then anywhere else even fb marketplace.,5
490,"Jack Russell Terrier/ Chihuahua: I had tried to post my puppies since they were eight weeks old people kept flagging my post, but I was finally able to rehome the last puppy today. I truly appreciate craigslist and everything that you guys do for people. I will definitely use your site again.",5
491,"Craigslist review: I enjoyed using the Craigslist Service to sell my vintage clock, because it was so easy to set it up.  It took a little bit to get it posted, but before long I was getting several inquiries per week.  I will continue to use this service when the time comes‚Ä¶",5
492,"Bad Reputation with Great Results: Despite the rare bad experience I hear about from friends and the few scammers, I‚Äôve always had great success buying and selling items on Craigslist.  That includes items like cars to sporting event tickets.  Use common sense and always remember the adage that if it sounds too good, it‚Äôs probably a scam.",5
493,"Helped save my pup: I lost my home due to Covid, I thought I was going to have to turn my dog over to the pound. I called every Shelter from here to New Mexico   No one wanted a pit. I posted my dog here to find a safe home for her. She was rehomed within 24 hours, thank you craigslist. I can now sleep at night, knowing my dog is safe. Absolutely grateful",5
494,Craigslist is my trusted favorite: We have been using Craigslist for years to rent the rooms upstairs in our house. We have a serious as for people that are serious renters. We have been very pleased with the results from Craigslist. Thank you Craigslist for giving us the tools we need to find the right people.,5
495,"Craigslist still getting the deals done!!: I'm giving CL App 4.5 stars. The missing .5 is due to the fact of not being able to control scammers and how they make listings successfully and get people to fall for them. Tigher algorhythym may help, but then again, CL is allowing people to list and sell for free...can't really complain at all. So, I still use and trust(to an extent)...Craigslist App!!",4
496,Love selling on Craigslist: I‚Äôm a pro handyman by trade and musician by hobby and I naturally come into possession of a lot of unwanted goods that people either don‚Äôt want or are upgrading. Craigslist has made it possible for me to recycle these items and potentially keep them out of the landfill while earning me a good chunk of money. The community is great and love buying and selling on Craigslist.,5
497,Love: Craigslist is one of my favorite places to shop for almost anything. They have everything ranging from furniture to stuff for your garden! If you have been wanting something that is a little out of your budget then check Craigslist. I‚Äôm sure they have something that you would love.,5
498,"Easy to use, quick to load, has it all: I buy just about everything off Craigslist: furniture, cars, motorcycles, kayaking gear, you name it. The soo is smooth to use and ideal for saving items you want to think about and come back to. Easy to change location and doesn‚Äôt crash.",5
499,"Great App but Search Results Differ: The craigslist app is very convenient and it is more convenient to post something for sale through the app than it is through a browser. 

My only complaint: if you search for something through the app you will get less results than you will get searching through the browser.",4
500,Craigslist‚Äôs the original: Forget about all the others tryna to come up in the ‚Äúonline garage sale‚Äù business. I always sell my stuff fast usually within 48hrs of posting. Never have I had a problem with people meeting me at the meet up spot. Like other Apps do. Don‚Äôt look anywhere else. Download the App today you‚Äôll be happy you did.,5
501,"STOP giving Craigslist a bad rap‚Ä¶.YOU GUYS/GALS/LBGTQS ROCK!!: I just want to take a quick moment to give Craigslist the props I feel they deserve!! I‚Äôve not EVER had problems using this site. I‚Äôve ALWAYS met my goals whether it was buying, selling, searching, etc. I‚Äôve met nothing but amazing people, whom I‚Äôm sure would say the same ;-) Anyway THANK YOU CRAIGSLIST YOU ROCK‚Ä¶please keep UP THE GOOD WORK!!",5
502,"Very effective: This app is extremely useful. Posting of items is very straight forward due to the intuitive design. Posting of images works well, even with sketchy internet connection. The security of the site and the fire walls provided help to protect the user from scammers. Over all an excellent app.",5
503,"Have been giving away many items: This posting was for some 200 maps. 
I‚Äôve met many nice people and found homes for very good items that needed a home.
I just can‚Äôt put things in a landfill when someone would like them. It makes me feel happy !!!!",5
504,Works great but prefer desktop: Works as always and I still prefer craigslist after all these years.  A few different options now to use in order to sell or give things away.  Good to use more than 1 if wanting ad to get seen more though.,5
505,"Very rapid rehoming of bunnies: We were able to find a new home for our rabbits through Craigslist in less than one day.  Excellent response and the new owners are thrilled with their new bunnies and all of the cages and food.  Thanks, Craigslist for providing a very valuable and important service for my family.",5
506,"Thank you!: Thanks to Craigslist, I was able to find homes for kittens I rescued.  I was Leary at first because of warnings from the SPCA website.  The families I met were very nice and I feel the kittens have good forever homes now.  Thanks to those families the kittens have a chance now.  Also thank you Craigslist for making it possible.",5
507,"Will be deleting and never using again: I tried to create a post so that I could rehome my kitten but it immediately removed my post and I have no idea why. I‚Äôm not asking for money, I just want her to go to a good home and am including everything I have for her completely free. I am unaware of any reason why my post would be immediately removed. I would love to find her a home before Christmas. It looks like I‚Äôll be using some other app to do so. I‚Äôll never recommend this app to any of my friends or family. Thanks a lot!",1
508,"Bitcoin for Financial help: Yes, thank you craigslist believers the one who had faith in me and believed in themselves. I needed help financially and put an ad on here and lot of people doubted this but a faithful believer has his bitcoin that I promised for helping with $600 fee. Now I'm good! Just a tip.... Not everyone is corrupted there are some of us with integrity. I asked for help and I got it. Enjoy that Bitcoin Scott. Yessa!",5
509,"The app is easy to use: I‚Äôve use craigslist for years, and I think my browser ended up forcing me to the app on my phone and it‚Äôs much easier to make postings this way. I dread me making postings on my computer and it just takes a lot of time on the website. The app makes it 123.",5
510,Posted a room for rent on craigslist: today I posted On craigslist and unfurnished room for rent in my home. It wasn‚Äôt even 30 minutes later that I received inquiries regarding the room. And had a successful occupant come for an interview within the first three hours. I hope things work out. Craigslist was great,5
511,"Ads are kept current unlike OfferUp: Ads on CL expire after 2 weeks and then the poster will have to repost the ad again. This keeps ads current. OfferUp is such garbage, filled with paid advertisements (CL doesn‚Äôt have this) and ads will languish in limbo for months and years. CL all the way!",5
512,"Craigslist is old - but it works great!: The app isn‚Äôt amazing, but it works waayy better than most apps. 

Including ones for my expenses that my company pays for (concur)‚Ä¶ it is riddled with so many bugs, some screens don‚Äôt have a way forward‚Ä¶ it is off screen on a standard iPhone‚Ä¶ they are so dumb. 

Anyway - Craigslist- I salute you!",5
513,"Patron: Most items I list sell quickly with a little problem Has a large number of viewers, I do have a lot of difficulty being able to list items to sell,  I wish I was the only one then I know it‚Äôs just me. Look at how maybe could improve thank you.",5
514,"Works well enough, but beware: The first time I installed and attempted to search it would constantly prompt me for my Apple ID and password. BEWARE this app developer may be attempting to steal the credentials. 

After I killed and opened the app again it stopped asking and things seemed to work. Like most things on Craigslist be careful, this is a shady place filled with crooks. This app is no exception.",4
515,"Thanks Craigslist!: This totally free service is one of the few things on the Internet that doesn‚Äôt spam you with ads, isn‚Äôt trying to make money off you, and offers a valuable and simple service.

I‚Äôve used CL to find and furnish homes, buy and sell bicycles, furniture, tools, and more. 

Thanks Craigslist!",5
516,"A good experience giving away free stuff on CRAIGSLIST: I‚Äôve been with craigslist for many many years. Both buying, selling, picking up free stuff, and giving away free stuff. Another successful giveaway today. It‚Äôs nice to know that some people will be able to use what you choose to no longer keep. Pass it on!",5
517,"Great Transaction: I have always found Craigslist great for selling things. With the exception of a few questionable inquiries initially which were obvious scams, transaction went great. My local police also provide a meeting location at the police station that keeps everyone safe and only serious buyers follow through.",5
518,"Easy to use: Very easy to post an item to sell with a user friendly app. Sold my desired item in less than a week. Have used in the past and will continue to use in the future, the features keep getting better. Download the app for simplicity",5
519,"Good one guys!!: I‚Äôve been using this app for years, almost from the get-go and never had a bad thing to say bout it and I‚Äôve made a lot of moola along the way!! Keep keepin it real (free) Craigslist, way to go! And I‚Äôve turned numerous ppl on to your app over the years too‚Ä¶.yeah for you I suppose, lol!!! 

P.S they didn‚Äôt pay me to say that either‚Ä¶hint hint lol!",5
520,"What‚Äôd I do without Craigslist!!: Have bought, tried and sold 3 bikes in the last year on Craigslist. As is the case everywhere, there are a lot of flaky people - but if you can smartly weed them out, you‚Äôll find CL a great platform to buy and sell. I‚Äôve even found very valuable advice in response to my posts. Love the community!",5
521,"Craigslist has been helpful...: I am an animal breeder and I use it to buy sell and trade animals often. Never accept any codes or follow peoples email, all of that is scams. Meet only in person and cash only and in a public location. Always think safety. Outside of that I enjoy Craigslist it makes things easier for me.",5
522,"It would be nice to listen and last two weeks: 5 stars aways. 
It would be nice if the listing last two week or one month. But I guess a week is fine at least people can still find it. But it‚Äôs just very troublesome every single week onto the app and relisting.",5
523,"Craigslist is easy to use but:: I don‚Äôt like the way the renewal is set up. You take it away after so many days and it‚Äôs too soon. Also the ones that expired I cannot find them anywhere to relist them, maybe I don‚Äôt know where to look but they just disappear.",5
524,"Happy seller: Happy and very satisfied in being able to sell my item through Craigslist. I had the same item advertised in Offer up, and wasn‚Äôt able to sell it at all through them. I gave Craigslist a 5 Star and highly recommend them. Thanks Craigslist.",5
525,Two easy sales in 2 weeks: This site has gotten significantly better about filtering out scammers and I was able to sell and truck and a scooter in two weeks with no problem. Definitely recommend you revisit this site if you haven‚Äôt for awhile.,5
526,"Selling my car on Craigslist: I have been using Craigslist for over 20 years, however there are a lot of scammers on trying to take advantage of people, I enjoy using it because I know how to protect myself, however I would be reluctant to let my daughter use it. There is much room for improvement and I hope this helps.",4
527,Great app for local selling and giveaways: Have posted in the app several times for selling and unloading free stuff. Always find someone who wants them within hours or a day! The app is easy to use and saves past posts to remind you of what worked before. Highly recommend!,5
528,Best community site & app: I‚Äôve used Clist for many years but only got the app now. So far it‚Äôs great. Pretty easy to use and NO ADS! It‚Äôs a real community tool. But as with any other online activities WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS who try to get you to send them private google codes and such. Other than that Craigslist is the best thing out there.,5
529,"A little balky: But compared to the only other major option-FB-CL seems to attract a better class of buyer. Have advertised two items on FB recently, got responses almost immediately but they were from scammers. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever had that issue with CL. Very satisfied with my experience here.",5
530,Awesome App: Craigslist is the best website and app for the sale and purchase of any item that other people are looking for I tried to sell on EBay then I get a message that EBay does not do business with my bank imagine that !! my bank has over 50 locations with a 25 million dollar surplus !!,5
531,"Blocked‚Ä¶: Every time I try to post anything on this crappy app‚Ä¶ it blocks my posts!
It‚Äôs completely worthless‚Ä¶ and, I have no idea why everything is blocked!
I tried to get some feedback as to why? But no answers from the idiots in San Francisco that run the stupid thing. It‚Äôs completely worthless to me‚Ä¶ and just plain pointless.
Deleting it forever, because if you can‚Äôt make a post to sell anything you have‚Ä¶ then it‚Äôs just trash on your phone. Goodbye, and never again gonna waste my time dealing with this crappy app‚Ä¶",1
532,Getting a ride: It could be touchy on craigslist but if you‚Äôre willing to put in a little time and effort you can find the right match with the right guy trying to make a couple extra dollars and saving use some as well good for both because it‚Äôs cash in the pocket,5
533,Farm Life: I give Craigslist a five star due to the fact that you meet some really good people and children as well when they come to pick out their animals. The downfall is that is some of the nuisance of hackers trying to get you to send money. But all in all good place to sell your live stock! Thank You Craigslist,5
534,"Craigs List always comes through: Hi. My name is Ryan. I am a Generation X descendant that has experience with everything the shill world has to offer. Above them all is Craig‚Äôs List. While other stages find ways to irritate CL has yet to fail me. Within an hour of posting my car was sold to a very deserving person. For five bucks. 

Salute.",5
535,My car sold in less than 5 minutes!: I posted my car for sale & a buyer surfing Craigslist inquired with a phone call within 5 minutes after the post went live. Buyer drove up from Jacksonville the next morning & bought it on the spot.,5
536,"Never any problems for me: I‚Äôve done at least 15 transactions (buying & selling items) and never had any problems. A no nonsense classifieds app that I like using, especially for items that I never use and want to sell. I get a little $ and the local landfill has a little more room.",5
537,Truck sold in a cpl hrs: Been having a hard time with Fb and selling stuff. So decided to try Craigslist again.  Despite the $5 a post charge.   Glad I did.  The first truck sold in a  Matter of a cpl hrs for almost full price.   Glad I gave them a chance  and definitely will continue to use them,5
538,"Still the best.: Been doing CL prob since 2004‚Ä¶ basically, still the best place to make things happen. Some sales are better than others, but out of all the places I‚Äôve posted, nearly every successful attempt comes from this site. Please be around for many more years.",5
539,"Awesome response. Sold for sale price‚Ä¶FAST.: Received immediate response after placing AD. BEWARE of many scams by fake buyers, including counterfeit cashiers checks being sent via Federal Express, where buyer sends you more money than actual sale price, asking you Zelle money, etc to ‚Äúmovers‚Äù of the buyer, for cost of the items to be shipped. Many SCAMS out there!!!",5
540,Super easy to use: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist on my desktop for years. This app has all the functionality of the desktop but in the palm of your hands. Super easy to use whether scrolling for items or posting a listing. Would definitely recommend.,5
541,"Run by customers: I‚Äôve made about 20 interactions on Craigslist, and they‚Äôve all been with nice people. The only problem is people forgetting to delete their listings and not responding when you email them, leaving you stuck in a state of limbo when you try to decide if they‚Äôre just responding late or if you should move on.",5
542,"Reliable and easy to use: Built for the user in mind. Lots of filter and search features, just like having the website up. Only issue I have with it is battery goes faster when I‚Äôm using it, and that hasn‚Äôt been an issue. Highly recommend downloading for the save/favorite feature alone.",5
543,"Great for recycling items that still have life in them.: Craigslist is great for cleaning out stuff that can be recycled. I just put it out at the curb, post it as a ‚ÄúCurb Alert‚Äù and ask people to text me for the exact address.  That way I don‚Äôt have to deal with a bunch of people all showing up.",5
544,Great app. Safe: Oh this app is a good solid fast option. Do it in a well lit public place the security cameras which are everywhere. And you‚Äôll be fine. If people act weird trust your gut don‚Äôt pop don‚Äôt bother with them because I swear all the weirdos move to Facebook this rock app rocks I‚Äôll bring back the personal.,5
545,"Circular saw: I used to use CL more often. Switching to FB marketplace. More replies but more scammers and bottom feeders. I can‚Äôt list on FB because I made a mistake in a listing.
Still don‚Äôt know what I did wrong? So back to CL. I listed the saw last night and have the cash already! No quibbling about price.
Great Transaction! Thank you.",5
546,"Not bad. Can be better.: The app is good enough; It does the job. A good chat function will help tremendously. We are still communicating using email. Which is fine until you want to meet up. Email, at that time, becomes cumbersome. 

I gave it 4 stars. I will give 5 stars, once they add a ‚Äúgood‚Äù chat capability. 

In all cases. I thank all the people who made this app possible.",4
547,"Selling your item: A great place for selling your unwanted stuff and make a little extra money. I wish we could relist stuff more, but still a great site. Also it‚Äôs great to find good deals. Sometimes you can find things that you wasn‚Äôt looking for that you might need too.",5
548,So useful: Probably the most useful app on my phone lately. Being able to scroll through images related to posts really streamlines the process of searching and finding what I need fast. Quickly adding photos from a phone is a snap. I‚Äôm very thankful for this app.,5
549,Items sold fast: Sold my items in a reasonable time!  Craigslist over the years has always been reliable for me. I really like this app and website.  Less noise and hassle than FB marketplace and not as many trolls.  Thank you Craigslist for being reliable as always!,5
550,"Does the job, but shops are ruining Craig‚Äôs list: Whenever you look for an electronic device, you realize that there are more people asking you to sell them the device rather than those that want to sell theirs. And they flood the whole freed. Would be awesome if there was a way to get rid of that",5
551,"It‚Äôs Craigslist: From time to time I sell some items on here, I just recently sold my car through here. The app does everything I need it to do. Just like any other app, you‚Äôll need to learn how to navigate the app. It‚Äôs Craigslist, just in the form of an app. 5 stars for doing the job and doing it right.",5
552,"Still works beautifully!: I know I‚Äôm supposed to try all of these other sites for selling furniture and kids stuff, etc. but I just automatically put things on Craigslist first because that‚Äôs what I know, and it always works!  I‚Äôve made at least a dozen transactions and I‚Äôve always had a pleasant clean transaction experience!",5
553,Great site: I usually sell on another site but I have to give you a great review as things have changed and the old rumors that I heard about didn‚Äôt happen to me posting was easy and uploading photos was a breeze and I plan to keep using your site again,5
554,Craigslist still there when I need it: Craigslist is still better than Facebook marketplace I think just because there‚Äôs not that many scammers because there‚Äôs still a lot of people using craigslist that you do not think thank you craigslist,5
555,"Reliable and helpful CL app: I have been using this craigslist app for years. My favorite thing about it is that you can scroll listings by region, rather than buy city. You can also create alerts that will be emailed automatically. I have not found anything better for searching craigslist listings, and I highly recommend it!",4
556,My go to place to sale for years: All I can say is thank you Craigslist for facilitating a place for me to buy and sell since my introduction to the internet side of buying and selling.  It has been what seems like 15 years or better. Thank-You from the bottom of my heartüòä,5
557,"Best Website Since Day 1: Craigslist has always stayed true to its roots, keeping a platform for people to generate income, re-use items, sell original pieces, and everything between. This is the best website company to come out of the Internet age. Not a greedy grab bag company. Like others of its generation.",5
558,"Love Craigslist: I repair, restore, buy and sell used tools full time now. I use Craigslist and two other used marketplace apps. People who tend to buy on Craigslist seem to be of a higher quality and are almost always super friendly. Easy to post, no adds and it‚Äôs FREE!!! You can‚Äôt beat that!",5
559,"Bought and sold on craigslist: Craigslist is a good spot to look for deals. If you‚Äôre trying to remodel your house or even get parts for snow, mobiles bikes cars even buying used cars I bought him a couple on here and have gotten good deals even for a 2012 BMW I got for $600 because it needed to remove catalytic converter‚Äòs.",5
560,"Oldie but Goodie‚Ä¶: It‚Äôs been 20 years since Craigslist was cutting edge and even then it was a novel idea with a simple execution.  What it lacks in tech it makes up for in function.  Best of all, it‚Äôs not Facebook marketplace harvesting all of your data and selling it to anyone who will buy it.  Here‚Äôs to Craigslist for not being Facebook (meta)!",5
561,"Always amazing: I know a lot of people have moved on to other apps, but Craigslist has always been efficient and easy. It is still a great way to sell things and I feel like it will be for a long time to come. Thank you for staying true to the community you serve Craigslist.",5
562,"Good place so far..: While I always hear about being cautious on Craigslist, I haven‚Äôt had a bad experience with them yet.  If you follow the rules, don‚Äôt tell anyone your location, give them personal information and if you make sure you let them know you only do business in public, it is a good place to sell and buy.",4
563,My favorite app: This my favorite app. I never write reviews. This app makes it so easy to create postings/sell things but also shop for things. I never buy anything new anymore if I can help it. I find some real treasures on here. This app is so great I‚Äôll never try to use Facebook marketplace ever again. I love Craigslist.,5
564,Sold our motorhome: I received many offers from potential buyers and made a quick sale. Received calls from all over my region. The listing was easy to set up and easy to edit and manage. Highly recommend Craig‚Äôs List for this and other types of listings,5
565,Quick Reuse: Done with my move and seemed such a waste to throw away wardrobe boxes. Within hours of my posting I had two takers and more offers later in the day. Finding others on Craigslist who can use things I no longer need is an Excellent way to keep from wasting!,5
566,"Easy platform to use: Always easy to use, wide coverage area and good safeguards. Every time I use this site to sell, I‚Äôve been successful. Do your due diligence, read the rules and suggestions and it‚Äôs easy. Will use again as a seller. Also purchased many items using this site.",5
567,"Terrific for buying and selling!: I‚Äôve used Craigslist for several years for buying and selling as an individual, not a business. My only complaint at all is the constant deluge of scammers hitting on the ads, but they are easy to identify and ignore.
I highly recommend Craigslist and will continue to use it.",5
568,"Site and App much better now.: For being mostly free with exception of listing autos its a good service. Craigslist started off great, about 10 years ago the flagging issues started where your listing would just disappear or you posted too many too soon. But it seems adding listings is mostly unlimited now and Im having no issues.",4
569,"Love Craigslist forever, always have success here!: I‚Äôve sold literally hundreds of items and purchased many items from CL. I absolutely love it and it easy to manage and search and post things for sale. Never had any problems and I‚Äôve been on here since it first began.",5
570,Classic car sold within 3 days: Craigslist posting was so convenient and effective comparing with other on-line car sales or auction. The results were immediately obtained with visits in person and buying on the spot. I recommend to list your car for sale using Craigslist.,5
571,Easy to post‚Ä¶ Reasonably priced‚Ä¶ Very effective: Posting an automobile for sale on craigslist was easy‚Ä¶ They made it easy to put a description and pictures together‚Ä¶ The amount of Response had was outstanding‚Ä¶ Well worth the five dollar investment‚Ä¶ I will gladly use them again,5
572,"Much better option than Offer up for selling stuff: Craigslist is the best!!.Tried using Offer up to sell some stuff and what a piece of garbage that is, my post didn't got any views or got any inquiries but they kept pushing to pay for going ""premium"". Nothing like good old Craigslist!!",5
573,"2003 Mustang GT For Sale!: I‚Äôm Craig and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our many experiences with Craig‚Äôs List!

We‚Äôve purchased (or sold) probably 10 cars in the past 20 years and have always had a great experience.

People sometimes ask me, ‚Äúare you the Craig from Craig‚Äôs List?‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm willing to negotiate!‚Äù",5
574,"What a pile of dreck: Years ago this was a great app for rising craigslist. everything after that is a pile of steaming craigslist. I don‚Äôt know what the heck is with the little pins completely moronic!  you have to zoom in and zoom in and zoom in and zoom in. Pull your heads out of your craigslist, and make the original once more. It was  a nice organize list of everything that you searched for with a photo and a short description that you could highlight. Nope nobody ever makes anything better they just make a craper.",1
575,"Sold Mission Style Recliners in 2 hours!: Successful and pain free transaction from posting to pickup.    Our price was likely a bit low, but they were great chairs which was easy to see in the photos.   Two calls in the first 2 hours, and then 8 more inquiries before they could drive to pick it up.   Easy to pull the post and we are happy.",4
576,"Great way to advertise and sell: I‚Äôve used Craigslist for years to sell and give away items we no longer needed but are useful to others. Great way to get back a little bit of the purchase price of goods, help others, and avoid sending useful stuff to the dump.",5
577,Makes posting ads easy: I‚Äôm amazed at how simple it is to post an ad.  It‚Äôs also easy to delete the ad once the item is sold.  I‚Äôve found wonderful things on Craigslist and sold things on Craigslist.  This ap just makes the who process much more efficient.,5
578,"Ok but overrun with bots and scammers.: This last item sold but my previous 3-4 did better on offer up. The Craigslist app seems to be overrun with bots, scammers, and commercial interests. I still use it some but much more guarded and infrequent than I used to. Craigslist needs to verify users more and restrict those that post 500 times the same thing‚Ä¶
My two cents‚Ä¶
T",4
579,Easier than web site: Have not used in a long time and to pay to post is new otherwise 5 stars. Easier to use than the website can manage everything right from your mobile phone but again it was a real shocker to say I had to pay to post on here oh the good old days,4
580,great staff: i‚Äôm really happy for the way the posting came out I have lots of request and the room is rented within no time I look forward to working with craigslist again I recommend it to anyone who wants to rent a room a closet Academy dog do use craigslist as a number one essential factor without scamsüíü,5
581,Nice app but how to respond to interested buyers: Am I missing something? I have received several Craigslist text messages to my post for sale but how do I respond effectively to them with the app?  I love viewing items and seeing what I have posted but can‚Äôt see a way to respond efficiently. Thanks!,5
582,"Craigslist rocks!: Great app that makes it easy to buy and sell things, and also protects your personal e-mail. Unlike Facebook which is a stupid privacy stealing nightmare (and hard to use), Craigslist is none of those and it is my favorite place to buy second hand stuff!",5
583,"Found a room to rent!!!: The world is crazy and it‚Äôs impossible to buy your own place these days. As my landlord is selling the house I rent a room in, I turn to my old friend, craigslist. Within three days I had a response from a legitimate person who rented me a room. I‚Äôm very happy craigslist is still productive.",5
584,Thank you Craigslist: I‚Äôm sure I speak for everyone when I say thank you Craigslist for making this available for all to use. You guys are the OG ‚Äúoriginal gangster‚Äù before Craigslist everyone had to pay to put an ad in the paper. Paying by word. Remember that? Well I‚Äôm old and I do.,5
585,"The newer app: This is quite good, although I find the older app easier to navigate. No matter what I do in settings, I get sales from all over the place in no particular order. The older app would separate sales, etc, into different cities. It‚Äôs much better than the other one, however, for managing your account.",4
586,"Great app: Works great, stable. Easier than the internet.  When returning from looking at a post, it returns to the location you were viewing and not the top of the page which was a pain.  There does seem to be a lot of duplicate post, which I find easy to skip.",5
587,"This app is awesomely awesome!: Hey mom I wanted to let you guys get the Christmas card for thanksgiving and thanksgiving day at the beach center for Christmas‚Ä¶ is what you might say if you let your iPhone auto predict type for you. Don‚Äôt be like the iPhone auto predict and do what everyone else is doing, download this app right now!",5
588,iPhone App Works Amazing: I found the iPhone version of the CraigsList app to be rock solid. It is very organized and easy to navigate. In fact I found the app to serve my interests more efficiently than the web based interface. I highly recommend mobile users to download the app.,5
589,"Good old CL: Everything you could want from Craigslist - simple, effective, connecting you with all the things you never knew you needed until you saw the curb alert. So much better than those paid and advertisement filled crap apps. Thank you for keeping it real.",5
590,"Much easier than the website!: I have been using Craigslist for years and have had great success.  Using the website was a bit inconvenient.   With the app I can walk by something, decide to sell and post in minutes.    There are slicker apps however you cannot beat the Craigslist community",5
591,Would be great but‚Ä¶: I use Craigslist but not this app. Here is the reason why: This app forces you to choose an area by radius. The Craigslist website lets you select neighborhoods as an option. As a Bay Area native I know what areas I may be willing to drive extra miles to in order to make a purchase but also which ones I won‚Äôt. Change that option and I would gladly regularly use this app.,3
592,CL is great: Some people get Pissey because there are scammers and crapheads on CL. Welcome to American society!  I‚Äôve used CL for probably 8-10 years and have sold many items that probably would be a tough sell otherwise. I tried running ads in various papers and websites ($$$) but can say I would rather deal with the occasional lowballer or scammer than pay for other sites.,5
593,"Craigslist is a sellers dream: I've never used any of these apps before, but now I'm selling my home of 17 years and needed help emptying it.

I've now tried several and Craigslist is the easiest, no nonsense way to go. I've sold over 50%'of my postings in less than 10 days!!! And everything and anything seems to sell.

Thank you Craigslist, you've made this painless.

BTW, it's not just caveat emptor, the seller needs to be careful too! Following Craigslist's warnings and cautionary statements saved me lots of time and trouble.  The simple fact - take only cash or ""Venmo"" and don't listen to sob stories. And stay away from cashiers checks - they are not safe!",5
594,"Craigs list: Is a good site, sell just about everything. Wait long enough and you can find about anything you want. I use this site for you can use site just about anyway. Highly recommend. I normally do not give reviews but this site is worth it. John, Oak Forest, Illinois.",5
595,"Craigslist is the best, it‚Äôs like no other!: I hope this incredible utility for people never changes or goes away. I‚Äôve used Craigslist for years just like so many others, very grateful for this simple program / app / website. It always works, thank you!",5
596,"Essential: Without this app I wouldn‚Äôt have had housing, dreams come true, and things to fill my new home with. When things get crazy, this is an ESSENTIAL tool to connect the community as a whole and gets more work done and helps improve the economy moreso than any government program.",5
597,"Great App !!!! 6 stars is what this app needs !!!: This is such a great app to use, I almost gave up on craigslist, but they‚Äôve pulled through and this is one wonderful heckuva app. It‚Äôs easy to work with. It‚Äôs easy to use to navigate through. whoever developed this field deserves a raise! I would give it 6 stars if I could !!!",5
598,I have never had a bad experience: I‚Äôve been using CL for years never had a bad experience! I just wish some of these people would act right and not try to scam others that are just trying to make a lil cash selling things around the house!pepesi41,5
599,"Excellent app: I used to use C+ for craigslist app, but that was glitchy so when I found this app by immediately downloaded it and have since sold several things without any problems. Easy to list, especially photos. Highly recommend.",5
600,"Bow sale: I‚Äôm glad that CL allows a person to list a bow for sale beings as so many other social media sites deem them ‚Äúweapons‚Äù and therefore can‚Äôt be listed. While in the truest sense, a bow is a weapon, so is a kitchen knife, and those can be listed. Glad Craigslist hasn‚Äôt gone the way of the other social media sites.",5
601,"Clean and no-frills just like the web site: It‚Äôs Craigslist, hasn‚Äôt changed in 20 years but that‚Äôs a good thing. The app works well and is preferable to the web site, allowing for saved searches and I believe syncs saved listings with your account on browser/desktop as well.",5
602,"Love CL app: We all know how much you can do, and ding on CL. the App is perfect for anything you have to do.. Never had any problems, with the exception of scammers trying to reply to a posting, or posting themselves, but that‚Äôs not CL‚Äôs fault.. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. My only wish is that you could pick multiple places to post at one time, instead of having to do individual areas.. Enjoy, Jammer",3
603,Great marketplace for buying and selling!: I appreciate having Craigslist as a resource for buying and selling items. It has helped me many times over the years and seems to have a higher caliber of furniture than other online stores for gently used items.,5
604,Save the trees! No shipping boxes! Reuse!: Most of what you find in my beautiful home I have sourced from Craigslist. So resourceful. Love Favorites and using the Map feature especially since I travel a lot. OMG being able to search by Location without ads and posts that require shipping makes CL the best really!,5
605,"Easy to search: Great for searching local events and business.
The only drawback is when you post something and Follow the guidelines, if someone doesn‚Äôt like the way you worded something, they can flag your post and it‚Äôs deleted from the system without being given the chance to edit the post.",4
606,"It‚Äôs good for what you need it for: Only major downside for me is the fact deleted posts of listings you no longer need aren‚Äôt permanently deleted, they‚Äôre just put into an archival state. If there was an ability to permanently delete them, then it would be a lot better because you‚Äôd have the app take up significantly less storage space and be a little less cluttered.",3
607,Sales: We have used Craigslist to sale many items over the last 5 years.  It has been a real help when we needed to downsize for a move. We have also sold 2 campers !  We will continue to use this site for our buying and selling needs.,5
608,"Best overall Craigs List experience: Much easier to list items than a web browser or 3rd party apps. Has the normal minimalist CL feel. Could be better. The manage postings link is buried on with other settings, which seems odd. Annoying that I have to re-type my phone and address with every post.",4
609,Antique doors: Correspondence this time was very direct and very honest from the buyer but in past ads that I have placed a lot of flakes a lot of telemarketing people to email them back because they don‚Äôt have a smart phone which is a lie and I wish that craigslist would filter some of those idiots out,5
610,"Good Sale: I use Craigslist 10-15 times a year - and probably about 150 times in total.  Sometimes as a seller sometimes as a buyer. 

Other than once or twice a person not showing up like they said they would all other transactions have gone very smoothly.   
   When selling I try to take good pictures, give measurements, accept only cash and meet at a local place such as a McDonalds or popular gas station where there are plenty of people around.  
   When buying I also only meet in a public place and try to take a person with me.  
   I recommend using the site and I will continue to use it.",5
611,"Cozy apartment rental: Couldn‚Äôt have gone better, couldn‚Äôt have gone quicker than I could have imagined, thank you Craig‚Äôs list for making my job easier. Tomorrow I‚Äôm posting another in a more challenging location and I pray that it goes just as well, best 5 bucks I‚Äôve ever spent.",5
612,"Another Successful Sale!: Despite all the new avenues to your items to sell in the marketplace, Craigslist time after time always comes through for me!
Been using Craigslist for years and years and it‚Äôs still the best way to sell something (anything) for free!",5
613,"CL is an institution: What's to say about this app, everyone knows it, it works great. I buy and sell all of my vehicles (bicycle, motorcycle, car) on here as well as any gear for new hobbies that I want to try out (binoculars, cycling shoes, etc) it's a terrific community and I've never had a negative experience  with a sale or purchase.",5
614,"Thank you - we emptied an entire home ‚Äî nothing went to land fill: We listed our ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù the night before and the entire house was emptied in 5 hours!
Nice people, good samaritans, retirees, young families. 
3 bedroom 2 bath home and nothing went to the landfill (!) 
Was great to have the good energy flooding the house! Thank you CL as always.",5
615,I know everyone finds Craigslist kinda sketchy: This the first time I ever post stuff on Craigslist. Honestly I thought I would get murdered when the people showed up. But I sold everything I listed in just a few days! I‚Äôm still living and breathing lol and everyone I sold to was very nice and on time!,5
616,"It‚Äôs Craigslist: It‚Äôs Craigslist, the site we‚Äôve known and loved for a million years now since practically the dawn of online sales. The pinnacle of classifieds in many states, their app does the job and works well. It gives you just what you expect and want from the classic Craigslist experience üëç",5
617,"Greatest recycling organization in history: I am So grateful for the massive number of useable or salvageable things that CL keeps out of landfills, and for all the people it helps. The idea is pure genius! Thanks to all who invented it and make it go for your generosity of spirit and all your work to make it safe, respectful and available to all.",5
618,"Great App: great app! 
I would love to have slightly larger list view and a much quicker way to report obvious fake ads (you know, the ones that put their email into their pictures and sell something for 1/10 of the price). 
over all enjoyable to use and is a useful tool.",5
619,"Sold!: Was a little iffy about selling my stuff online using Craiglist. And I did have a few weird responses from people. But ultimately - if you know not to accept checks and state your sale terms upfront, you will definitely find somebody to purchase your item. So easy and wonderful!",5
620,"Use of Craigslist: Once you establish an account it is incredibly easy to post your items for sale, trade or free. Great way to transfer things you don't need or use to someone who can benefit from them. I use Craigslist on a regular basis. Never had a bad encounter. Be wise how and where you meet. Blessings...",5
621,"Still Great results despite FB marketplace: I find that many items sell more quickly, and more smoothly, and my listings get inquiries from a more serious audience on Craigslist than on FB marketplace.  I routinely experience frustration dealing with unsophisticated or annoying inquiries when using FB marketplace.",5
622,Been using Craigslist for years: Not much to say really. This app has sold many items of mine through the years. I‚Äôve also bought a few things as well. I noticed about a year ago I had to pay five dollars to post my motorcycle for sale. That was a small price to pay to get it sold.,5
623,"Great app, if you prefer it on a computer then use √† computer: This app is great for browsing ads, changes categories easily, if you want to look for things in another region the map tool is super slick (that‚Äôs probably my favorite aspect of this app), and posting ads on it is a breeze. I really mean 5/5 since I don‚Äôt see any downside.",5
624,"The original, the best: Craigslist has remained almost unchanged in so many years, and that‚Äôs what makes it so good. No gimmicks, no invasion of privacy, no nonsense. The app works well, syncs with browser account seamlessly, and makes it so easy to list your stuff or browse endlessly for what‚Äôs available. Love it",5
625,"Convenient: The app is convenient for shopping and managing postings. Especially if I m out of town, it‚Äôs easy to check the listings for that area. For posting it‚Äôs great since I take photos with the phone then it‚Äôs easier to upload for a new listing. I do wish there was a way to link it to making and receiving offers, or at least notifications of offers.",4
626,Craigs list is the best.: I sold my Kayak in less than one week.  Got 3 offers.  The best thing is I didn‚Äôt have to release private information for buyers to contact me.  It was all done thru Craigs List.  I will always list exclusively with Craigs List.  And my listing went out far and wide.  Perfect.,5
627,"Good old Craigslist: I still prefer doing business on Craigslist. First of all the application works‚Ä¶Marketplace is really lacking in functionality and bugginess.  Second, I find the community of buyers and sellers to be more respectful. I hate that FB seems to be winning in nothing more than its weight",5
628,"Easy to use‚Ä¶safe features: Easy to use app to quickly sell things and buy things online. Safety features are enabled to hide your location and personal info when communicating
about your items.",5
629,Glad Craigslist Is Still Around.: I‚Äôve never had a problem with Craigslist customers. It‚Äôs great for me when I need to get rid of stuff. I have more traction than any other social media platform. I look forward to continuously list stuff in the future.,5
630,Sold item.: Craigslist is the real deal when you want to sell something I had posted my gym on other platforms and in a week had nobody even wanting to look at it but I posted ad quick and easy on Craigslist and 1 day sold gym. Thank you Craigslist. Matt,5
631,"Craigslist is the best thing on the internet!: From penthouse apartments on the UWS to some of the best roommates and now friends along with incredible vehicle finds! Not to mention the best place to find something for your home, or someone to work on your home, or someone to help you work from home. Love CL. Thank you! üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº",5
632,"No scams this time: I only had one response, a nice kid who came as promised, paid cash, and took the table with out complaints.  Best Craig's list experience ever.  There was no one telling me that that they would pay me extras to hold their check or ask me to give them some sort of number",5
633,"Price is right: Not user friendly. It always takes-up half my day to remember how to download photos for my ads. Tap, tap, tap on the photos you dummy. As you can probably tell I don‚Äôt use the service enough to remember all the ends and outs of publishing ads. Maybe a tutorial may help. Like I said the price is right.",4
634,"Great place to up cycle!: Instead of many items ending up in landfills, CRAIGSLIST gives us a platform to up cycle treasures that have lost their usefulness for us but will be invaluable to others.  I have found many useful items on CRAIGSLIST for free or below market value.  Thank you CRAIGSLIST for this platform!",5
635,Simply Rewarding: The format of Craigslist makes finding and purchasing an item a breeze. The process of communicating and getting familiar between buyer and seller before a transaction creates the experience it is a transaction of friends at the time of purchase. Have been loving the experience.,5
636,"super useful tool but beware of scammers: I‚Äôve used Craigslist for years, in multiple locations ‚Äî it‚Äôs helped me find renters, buy things at reduced prices, and get rid of lots of stuff I didn‚Äôt need. The only problem‚Äîwhich is sometimes a big one‚Äîis that parts of it are infested with scammers.",5
637,"Thanks  for Orange CL: Thanks very nice and sold fast but please be careful because some scammers tried to manipulating me but I didn‚Äôt share anything with them 
They tried to show they‚Äôre out of state or town and asked for address and full name to send cashier check!! And pick up later 
Just be careful 
Thanks",5
638,Better than eBay: I prefer to sell on Craigslist now due to the ridiculous fee‚Äôs imposed by eBay or other on-line selling platforms. The money saved in shipping costs is worth it alone. Every item I‚Äôve posted I‚Äôve sold within a weeks time with no issues. Great app!,5
639,"Why so many scams?: I love the app, except for the hundreds of $600 mountain bikes, e-bikes, and pelotons that are posted across the country everyday which are fake and simply trying to gather phone numbers from people. 

There is usually one photo, it usually has a phone number printed in the photo, and the descriptions don‚Äôt match the photo.  These bikes are usually worth far more than the ~$600 being asked. 

Why am I limited in flagging them, when these are clearly scams?  Why are they allowed to post these every day by the hundreds?  

Please fix this and make Craigslist better for everyone.",5
640,"Good app finally for CL!: I‚Äôve been using CL for... decades, maybe since it was first active or shortly thereafter. The lack of a mobile app always irked me and I‚Äôm really glad there is one now.

Ive bought furniture, electronics, and tools and found housing rentals; and sold furniture, clothes, electronics, tools, and raw materials like lumber here. 

CL is the for sale and wanted section of the internet newspaper.",5
641,"The gold standard of classifieds: Craigslist has and always will be the best classifieds of all time. I have been using Craigslist for 20 years and have had 95% good meetings and done a lot of buisness. Sold a lot, and bought a lot. My love for Craigslist is undying. Thank you for years of faithful service!",5
642,"Good app, vehicle sold quickly.: Have had this app for a long time and mostly used for buying.  Was easy to post my vehicle and easy to edit ad later.  Reason for only 4 stars is it has been glitchy in the past with some searches and it was hard to find my vehicle after I posted it for sale.  Luckily lots of other people saw it and it sold fairly fast.",4
643,"Craigslist works: Been using Craigslist for years, it works to find or sell things just fine. The app is easy to comprehend and use as well which makes us the users want to come back to use it. Will continue to use it.",5
644,"Easy to use and very effective!: Craigslist is great for local sales and freebies.  All of the people I‚Äôve dealt with have been honest and very appreciative for getting good value items for little or no money!  The app is straightforward and easy to use, and track your items.",5
645,Constantly ads getting pulled down sick of it!: I‚Äôve read all the Terms. I‚Äôve read all the forums. I‚Äôve searched every article I can on the topic and I cannot figure out why I can‚Äôt keep an ad posted. There are glitches in CL‚Äôs hyper sensitive flag algorithms and once they tag you it‚Äôs impossible to do much of anything. Even when you pay! So screw them. Their platform only attracts bottom feeding low ballers anyway. I‚Äôm doing way better on the social media platforms. Fix your algorithms CL or get obsoleted!,1
646,"I love Craigslist!: Craigslist is awesome! I have had so many success stories, and easy to work with! I have had only great customers the many times I‚Äôve sold things! I do believe it is one of the safest most friendly selling website today! Thank you, Craigslist!",5
647,"Uniquely wonderful service: Craigslist is still, incredibly, as wonderful and nearly as useful as it was in the Good Old Days at the dawn of the internet. Spam and scams are interfering with some uses, but it‚Äôs still the best way to buy and sell junk with neighbors:) Kudos to them for keeping the dream of the 90s alive!",5
648,Great App: Love that you can reply right from your phone and it keeps track of who you‚Äôve already texted. Makes it easy to organize who you‚Äôve contacted. Easy to navigate each sections and change the area of where you‚Äôre looking.,5
649,"Craigslist app is awesome: I have used the craigslist app and sold several things. Safe transaction through email until I feel comfortable with purchaser or seller. Always meet at neutral location, safe and secure and better than sitting on stuff someone else needs.",5
650,Not sure what I‚Äôd do without CL: I‚Äôve consistently had great luck with buyers showing up as promised and not trying to haggle me on the spot but bribing cash in the agreed upon amount and being friendly and courteous. I‚Äôm so thankful CL offers me a way to offload my used items to people who want them !,5
651,"Helpful: After a few changes to my post I got a few good contacts and one great/successful  one and I will have to say a few bad ones. overall my experience was great it worked out and I can‚Äôt think craigslist enough for the contact I made. 

Thanks, Craig",5
652,"Location: Craig‚Äôs List doesn‚Äôt offer North Bend as an area, so I had to pick Seattle East Side.  Although I stated in my ad, NORTH
BEND. Some people were rude about it. The person who agreed to p/u the fridge sent an EM that she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want it anymore‚Äù, after I had been saving it for her request from 11:45 PM the night before, just after I posted it, until 10:45 AM, when she changed her mind. It‚Äôs complex trying to keep texts, EM‚Äôs & calls in a fair order & those who don‚Äôt even answer my response. 

Thankfully a nice man arranged to p/u the wheelbarrow, loved it because it was metal & happily took it away. The fridge should be p/u @ 7 PM tonight. 

Thank you for your service.",4
653,"Craigslist app: Craigslist has been the go to since way back in the day. New age new technology , same consistent straight to the point craigslist. Can‚Äôt stand the offer this offer that so I can let go of my stuff for Pennie‚Äôs only to never make a sale on other sites!",5
654,Successful auto sale: I have sold 3 cars I have owned using Craigslist postings. Two sold within 24 hours and the last one took a little longer - one week at full price. I have priced them right but not the cheapest. This is my preferred method for selling my vehicles by far!,5
655,"Great work: Dear friends out there allow me to express my gratitude for all you do and did for all of . I know few friends of mine who would have been going through much hungry Time and you were there to save the day . Some time you came to rescue me too , thank you so much . 
Dr joe",5
656,"Craigslist Review: Thank you for not charging any additional fees as does every other site on-line. Those fees add up quickly when you are already selling things at a lower than average price. eBay will shake you down, Facebook does, but you guys are keeping it cool. Much appreciated!",5
657,Good site: Sold my boat in two days. It works. The only thing u need to watch out for is the check scammers. I can‚Äôt come pick the item up but I have a service that will. Say no it‚Äôs a scam. And the scam I‚Äôll send u a check let clear scam had both those tried on me the first day.,5
658,Many results: The craigslist was very clear and easy to use of posting my add for housing available. It asked me questions I hadn‚Äôt considered while creating it. Which helped bring across information to the viewer. I had 30 people contact me. It was a huge success!!,5
659,Four star is a good thing: I‚Äôve had some issues with craigslist. But they seem to be fixed now. Craigslist really helps me with my business. I‚Äôm flipping furniture. I find some really good deals on furniture on craigslist and then sell it at other sites and through other means. I find it a fun way of making a little extra cash.,4
660,"Craigslist made easy: If you're tired of uploading photos on a computer and going through the motions to post stuff, fa get about et!

The app makes the process so streamline you can post something in like a minute. Its rad. A friend suggested the app to me, I used it, it worked, so you should use it!",5
661,"my experience: Craigslist in our life for over 15 years. We have bought, sold & given away in free stuff. Very convenient to use & could not live without it. Use the precautionary tips & be honest in describing your selling items & it will all be good. Oh & take many & good quality pictures. Thank goodness for Craigslist.",5
662,"Wow! That was fast.: Just opened this account, posted pictures and discrimination, and within 4 hours sold my first item. Smooth and fast transition for cash. Everything was said and done in less than 24 hours. Not bad for the first time!",5
663,Great application: Was able to post and sell... I hope they make the interface a bit smoother but otherwise this application and the site has been more effective than Facebook marketplace! More than once!! In my case always!,5

Also very easy way to sell items, just about anything- my go to before buying anything via traditional retail site or store.",5

666,Craigslist is easy to use: I like Craigslist for buying and selling things. When I‚Äôm searching for specific items it only searches my word search and not wasting my time like you know who. Easy to use and effective for buying and selling,5
667,It just works!: This is a great amp. Fast and responsive. You can do a search on the fly. You don‚Äôt have to scroll to the top of the page to enter a search title. It improves searching over just opening the web page. Recommend,5

When I wasn‚Äôt to take down a post, I couldn‚Äôt find ‚Äúedit post.‚Äù I had to choose ‚Äúcreate post‚Äù and it took me to the spot to edit/delete my post. Other than that, it works great!",4
670,"Good for browsing and posting: I use the app almost every day for browsing. I can search, copy email addresses and paste into my gmail easily. 

I just used it this week for posting and everything worked the way it should.",5
671,App works great for selling: I sold a used vehicle in a week and a half using this app. It was easy to post and easy to delete. You just need to be aware of the people out there who wish to separate the fool from his money. No complaints about the app. Very easy to use.,5
672,"Like Craigslist itself, simple and functional: I‚Äôve used this app now as both buyer and seller ‚Äî in both cases, it does everything it needs to do. It will not wow you with graphics. But buying and selling are made convenient and straightforward. An easy five stars.",5
673,"Simply the best: Craigslist is like the internet used to, and still should, be.  No greed.  No ads.  Just (mostly) honest people selling their stuff just like a garage sale.  I have bought and sold many musical instruments and other neat stuff on here, and probably will until the day I die.  LONG LIVE THE CRAIGSLIST!üòé",5

675,Success every time: Every time I‚Äôve posted a big item on craigslist I‚Äôve sold it. It is so easy to post on this format and people are responsive. It takes a little work to sell a car and pay to sell objects but it works. Thank you Craigs List.,5

677,"Easy to use: Posted some items and sold them in a few days. Craigslist is easy to use for posting. But i tried to figure out how to do it on C+ craigslist, and i font think there is a selling option. Use plain old Craigslist for posting",5
678,üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ: I'm very happy with Craiglist. I've always had good experiences every time I've used them. They never ask you for money or give you rules. They allow you to make lasting contacts instead of regulating everything you do. I highly recommend them.,5
679,Received very good leads; issue w/email thru CL-did not work well: Recommend adding a note for your leads to provide their contact info. The CL email system was not working. None of my prospective tenants received my reply correspondence through the CL email protected system. I had to reach out to those who provided their contact info.,4
680,"Good Site: I use the ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù often to downsize, and occasionally to pick up something that solves a specific need.  I use the collectibles site to sell my extra coins; I rarely use that site to buy coins, because except for my postings most others are way overpriced.",5
681,"My go too App: Craigslist has always been my favorite place to access apartments, items for sale, meeting people traveling on the road etc etc.. it‚Äôs nostalgic for sure !!! It practically perfect just wish they had a system set up to automatically weed out the con artist!",5
682,Works most of the time.: I like posting on craigslist because you could pick the location that you want to advertise in but the bad side is when you list something you get a bunch of unsolicited contacts with fraudulent people who want your email. I wish they could screen those out.,4
683,Your website service: I have sold many items on Craigslist and the only reason I don‚Äôt give it a five star rating is because there is no easy way to stop the false responses from people who really don‚Äôt want to buy the item but keep asking about it and then not show at the saleü§î,4
684,Easiest app to use for selling: Even better than Facebook Marketplace! I can add more pictures and better category choices! I had inquiries for my post within 30 minutes of posting. And I can still share it to Facebook for more exposure!,5
685,Good advertising: Fast response . 1 hr after I advertised I got calls and emails . Good system to use on selling cars . Great idea to have in the bck of ur mind . 2 thumbs up cause I sold  other things & items  and it work for more then you expect . Thank you for letting me use this service . Yes yes and yes again .,5
686,Craigslist is Fantastic All the way around: Reason I like craigslist so much is because it gives so much opportunity for everyone and anyone with the day of the workers or the work ease it‚Äôs so simple to stay connected I am going into some new opportunities thanks to craigslist,5

688,Very smooth and easy to use!: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for years and just started using the app. Super easy to use no matter what you are looking for.

689,Filter out scammer: Hello sometimes when you‚Äôre on craigslist looking for something and you come across a deal did you say wow this is good been reality videos all a scam is there such a way that when a person goes on craigslist post whatever they want Craigslist can filter them out and find a legit  or phony .,5
690,The last good thing on the inter webs: I appreciate the way Craigslist has remained so pure after so many years! So many sites that used to serve us have become cluttered with ads or inundated with tracking systems that steer us in ways they think we want to go. The subtle updates such as this app have been well done too.,5
691,"Super convenient: I love checking out Craigslist before I buy something new. So often if you‚Äôre looking for something someone else is ready to part with it. The app is a better option than navigating to the website, and the formatting and function has been great on my phone. Thanks!",5
692,Sold my couch and bought so much more: This app has gotten serious usage. The great SF exodus has meant those choosing to stay have been able to clean up getting so many new (to us) things. It‚Äôs saving the environment and helping us improve our living space. Thanks Craigslist!,5
693,Selling my stuff: Always seem to find someone who wants my stuff eventually. When selling; Look at similar items for sale and play with the verbiage and cost on your post accordingly. You‚Äôll sell it if you keep tweaking your post.,5
694,Lawn mower: It was great instructions were understandable from page to page and the posting and you can see the people that inquire about the items being sold . It made contact information easy to do.,5
695,"Craigslist, still good after all these years!: I‚Äôve been using craigslist around 20 years now and their app on the phones simplifies the whole process extremely well actually working better than some of the companies which are much larger. Way to go craigslist.",4
696,"Great app, great service: I love craigslist and continue to use it, despite Facebook marketplace and Nextdoor and all the others. Nothing delivers like fine folks on craigslist in Los Angeles. This app is easy to use easy to post easy to search easy to download. Go ahead and do it now.",5
697,CL is back!: I was really turned off to Craigslist and started using other sites.  But they now have greatly improved messaging and other sites are now crawling with scammers!  I like having the choice to message through app or email.,5
698,This app helps me sell items: Every time I post on Craigslist it sells. I‚Äôve tried offer up and letgo but nothing ever sells. When I post the items here they sell. Yes you will get unwanted reach outs by unscrupulous people but there are truly real buyers here as well and the items will sell.,5
699,"Great marketplace place: I have sold my very first item on craigslist. I had the item posted for less than a day, had several people interested and sold it in less than one day I cannot recommend craigslist enough to buyers and sellers.",5
700,Love the new chat option: I decided to give Craigslist a try on my phone today on Saw a option for chat it is nice to see there is another way to message people other than email great alternative to offer up,5
701,"Simple & easy just like using the website: Simple to use, easy to save searches and set up notifications for new posts for those searches, not a slow app, overall it‚Äôs just like their regular website (I think)",5
702,"Craig‚Äôs list is the best: Easy and efficient to post items for sale or look for items to buy. I‚Äôve bought and sold furniture and sporting goods on Craig‚Äôs list and it‚Äôs always a good experience, including nice buyers and sellers! A good culture and community. I love the simple low tech finesse of the whole platform. Nice!",5
703,Great App but be careful a lot of fraud too: A lot of scammers use app to hook you in to get your personal information. Don‚Äôt fall into there traps by asking you if you take cashier check or use Vemo. They will want you to send them a code..DONT BE FOOLED ITS A TRAP! It‚Äôs not the apps fault which works GREAT! Don‚Äôt let the leeches out there fool you‚Ä¶.,5
704,"Would be great if they did anything at all about spam: The app works pretty well, but certain searches will come up with the same spam postings over and over again, which you can laboriously mark as prohibited, but if craigslist would lift a finger to remove these themselves, which should be trivial because they‚Äôre so repetitive and basic, it would make search results a lot less full of garbage.",2
705,"Weld job: Needed someone with a portable welder. Received a timely response and they got the job done. This is the 2nd job offering I‚Äôve submitted to Craigslist with stellar results so far.
I would place an ad again for services needed and recommend Craigslist for the jobs you need done as well",5
706,"Easy to use, prefer the app to website now: For a wile I preferred the website over the app, for the last coupe years I have been able to do everything on the app. Everything thing seems to work as it should.",5
707,"Five stars: Craigslist is a good place to buy and sell stuff. I have done both. Mostly with success. Of course nothing is perfect. Some times things sell quickly, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt sell at all and sometimes just part sell! I like Craigslist.",5
708,"Impressively fast results on Craig‚Äôs list: Sold my IKEA bed frame and dresser in no time at all. Impressively fast results - less than a week. A few other items that I posted are still on the site, but those are of Lower value than these two items.",5
709,Sold: My favorite saying of all thanks to craigslist I was able to sell most of the office furniture and within two days. Thanks again for supplying and offering the service to help those of us trying to sell things. Thanks again.,5
710,"Sold my Utility Trailer: First time creating the post was easier than expected, simple to select pictures from my phone library, ad posted In about an hour and had response right away.  Sold in a week thank you Craigslist üòÅ",5
711,"Good app, could be better with a couple changes: I enjoy the app. I enjoy the freedom of limitless combinations of options that help me sort through everything. However it would be nice to have a much larger search area and it would be nice if the app saved my search filter settings. Great job though",4
712,Not able to return to the same scroll down position: The user is not able to return to the same scroll down position if they click on an item and then click on the seller‚Äôs link to look at additional items on the seller‚Äôs site.,4
713,"Using the app: Until now I was using my desktop computer and digital camera to place ads. My first experience using the app with my iPhone has been great. It‚Äôs very simple and seamless, so much so I want to post even more stuff I have been meaning to sell.",5
714,"Simple and effective: CL remains our go to for buying and selling pre-owned items. We‚Äôve furnished a house with used high end furniture (Four Hands, Room & Board, DWR) at roughly 20% of the cost of retail. And it‚Äôs been great to keep things that we and others no longer have use for out of the landfill.",5
715,Useful tool but‚Ä¶: Craigslist has always been a useful tool - when used by buyer and sellers. This was my first time using Craigslist to post an item for sale. I received 5 ‚Äúinquiries‚Äù of which one was an actual person. The other were fraud scams I read about. Beware!,5
716,Craigslist still successful: I had forgotten about Craigslist for a while.  I was posting in other pages until a friend reminded that CL is still around.  I‚Äôve had plenty of success when posting my items.  Just be aware of scammers reaching out to you.,5
717,"Very Well Organized: It is fantastic.  Stellar when compared to web site. Wish they did a better job of screening duplicate ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù postings, and they should require equipment year of manufacture and serial numbers be stated in posts for all equipment other than perhaps VIN numbers of highway autos/trucks.",5
718,"CL is awesome in every way: There are probably things that could be better or more modern about the interface, but it works perfectly, does everything exactly the way I want, and I won‚Äôt say a single negative thing about it because I love it so!",5
719,Thankful Customer: Thanks for letting me list on your site  It has helped me sale my farm animals and my working dogs I would recommend this site to everyone thanks again and please continue the wonderful  service you preside to our community Thanks and GOD Bless       Linda Phillips Title thankful customer,5
720,"Nice - one suggestion on login: Good job!  Clean interface, easy to use.  A perfect compliment / enhancement to the website.   One of those few apps that does what it needs to do without a lot of unrequited fluff.  

Suggestion - The login is archaic:  too frequent.   Should take advantage of touch and facial recognition.",5
721,Sold bike: Let‚Äôs just say the app does its job with posting it‚Äôs easy it‚Äôs editable during the post. Ultimately done it‚Äôs job. The only problem is dealing with the window shoppers and stupid questions because people don‚Äôt read and understand the post? Lots of yes I want it and I will be there and then cancel. So quite a relief to have sold my bike and remove the add.,4
722,Easy to use and quick sales: This app is great. I love the new chat feature that allows potential buyers to contact you directly in the app. Much better than handing out personal info such as telephone number or email address.,5
723,"Very good when not using your desktop or laptop: I‚Äôve used craigslist for many years, primarily for buying used items. But I had always used the web version on my laptop. I‚Äôm currently shopping for a used box truck to convert into a tiny house, and a used SUV to tow behind it. Decided to download the app so I could use it on my phone and I‚Äôve been very pleased.",4
724,Still a tried and true resource after all these years!: Always so helpful when you need to reach out to many people quickly! Interface is still simple and very easy to use !,5

726,"Better than the web interface?: It‚Äôs great to be able to post from my phone, save listings, and set the search radius. Still simple and basic like the website. Thanks Craigslist. New chat feature might be good too.",5
727,"Craigs list delivers: I listed on Facebook marketplace, roomies and Craigs list. By far i received the best candidates from Craigs list. The other two, although you get replys,  they aren‚Äôt serious. They respond once and don‚Äôt get back to you. Craigs is also more user friendly.",5
728,Great App: Lately I‚Äôve been having better luck selling items on Craigslist app compared to the major selling platforms. Less scammers asking for my personal email address and to send them codes these days too. Keep up the good work.,5
729,"Great way to buy & sell!: Really enjoy this app! We‚Äôll organized so it‚Äôs easy to find what I need. When selling things, I don‚Äôt get a bunch of scammers like I do on the Facebook Marketplace. The buyers are legit people. It seems like Craigslist has a better system for screening out the scammers.",5
730,"Works great!: CL is an honest platform. You can post and find pretty much anything.
I use it a lot for selling and buying things locally. Just don‚Äôt let things be shipped. It‚Äôs an east way for scammers to get you. Use common sense and meet/communicate in person, then nothing goes wrong.",5
731,"The Best!: Selling and buying platform, email call or text options keep you in control for what you‚Äôre offering or purchasing. 5 star cuz us who know the yard sale/classifies market value the expectations with the good and bad that‚Äôs out on the vast unknown ocean depths that there is appreciate the CL tool!",5
732,I love Craigslist I should get sponsored by Your corp.: I love Craigslist 9/10 of the items I have come from here. From cars to household items you can find anything on here at a price your comfortable with.. very good app to get what you need. I have not one complaint about Craigslist I love it!!!!!!,5
733,Personal: I enjoy your marketplace app. I‚Äôm able to find great items! Keep it up and going! There is only thing I don‚Äôt like. That is people and companies posting their products over and over again! Thank you for listening!,5
734,Review: Craigslist was very useful I‚Äôm really thankful.  I was able to get rid of items furniture  where otherwise I would‚Äôve paid lotts of money that I didn‚Äôt have  .   Not even the local non profits thrift stores would respond I tried three famous  good will Salvation Army  even HOPE  THEY ACCEPT AL DONATIONS BUT I MEEDED  PICK UP .. ü§òüèªpeace sing,5
735,"The best of its catagory: Let‚Äôs not confuse the app with its users- aside from some minor tweaks, the app is clearly better than all the competitors.  Yes, about 15% of the users you will interact with are flakes who haven‚Äôt learned how to communicate as an adult yet, but the volume of good people and bargains make it worth while.",5
736,"Seller: The app itself works well and is easy to use. But I think craigslist doesn‚Äôt get enough attention or popularity in order to attract buyers. Items that usually are sold in two days on offerup, it will take six months on Craigslist if he ever gets sold.",5
737,"Love CL: When I need to sell something i always get great results. But there are times when I am in need. Like recently,  when I needed bedroom furniture and did not have the cash to buy it. Put up a post and my bedroom was filled with the furniture I needed within 2 days. Amazing",5
738,"Good experiences with this app: Craigslist is and has always been the best place to sell and buy things online within your local community. No ads, fast and easy to use. 
Wish more people were using this site still!",5
739,Craigslist works!: I just sold a wheelchair. And I‚Äôve completely furnished an apartment with beautiful furniture at a fraction of the price of new. But the best part is the world has enough stuff - if we are better about reusing and finding new homes for things there is a lot less waste.,5
740,"Good app: There is one Minor ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with the app. If there is nothing that fits all the specifications, it should show the closest results. Also it would be nice if when the search results for cars wouldn‚Äôt have the dealers most expensive cars at the top.",5
741,"Sold my car in a week: CraigsList certainly helped me to sell my car in just one week. I did not find it to be that user-friendly, but I searched on line to find answers to my questions about how to use it. It took me a while, for example, to figure out how to add the photos of my car.",4
742,"No gimick, Easy to use: I like how easy it is to put filters and location when searching. And that it shows the prices on the search results. And the fact that you can swipe to the next item.",5
743,"Great things to do, see, that leas to experience and more: I love craigslist because I‚Äôm able to find the connect I need for different items online and without it I‚Äôm not sure I could‚Äôve been able to find certain apartments in my life even.",5
744,App is an improvement over the Web version: For me at least. I was getting tired of the new security checks via email. Now I can keep track of my auctions a little easier. Now if anonymous messaging was a little easier I‚Äôd be super happy.,5
745,Easy to use: Love the app way easier to use on mobile. Just wish the payment options didn‚Äôt require info over and over again. But the mobile app makes posting way easier then scrolling through the website...,5
746,App is functional but enter face could use some user-friendly upgrades: When I list the posting I have trouble accessing my full library of photos. The last two listings I‚Äôve had to take Live Photos as opposed to digging out better photos from my photo archive on my phone. Perhaps it‚Äôs just a setting I might have mistakenly changed on the app but I have not been able to find how to change it back.,2
747,"Success with ease: Once again Craigslist has provided a platform for successful sales! I don‚Äôt sell much... but every time I do, it works seamlessly!
To add additional accolades to CL; Today I purchased a canoe from a Craigslist posting at a very reasonable cost. 
Bottom line..all other web based selling/buying services just don‚Äôt compare.",5
748,"Good service: USE COMMON SENSE: I did get scammed once when buying, however that was entirely my fault, and i was not being careful or using good judgement. This app is great! Use common sense, meet in a public place, cash only, avoid shipping (shipping is an easy way for people to scam), I've sold and bought many things using this site, and it works well, again, use good judgement and you wont ever be scammed.",4
749,"It‚Äôs cool but...: Whenever I go to email reply to an ad straight from the app, I‚Äôm not permitted to do so. I end up having to copy the contact info, go to my email and paste it. Sure, it‚Äôs just a couple extra steps but the reply button isn‚Äôt doing what it was designed to.",5
750,"The always dependable Craigslist: Tried some newer fancier app to sell stuff but I am back to the old dependable Craigslist. After all, I like the old-fashioned neighborhood feeling and this is the place where our once-loved and gently-used baby and kid stuff find good homes.",5
751,United me with my best friend: I was scrolling through the pets section and stumbled across the sweetest and most loving dog I‚Äôve ever met. I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in contact with his wonderful dads and I wouldn‚Äôt have him as part of my little family if it weren‚Äôt for Craigslist. 10/10,5
752,Easy to use and Give away Free Stuff: Craigslist is great! It‚Äôs easy to use. I upload pictures and provide users where my free stuff is via a curb alert. I‚Äôve always met very nice people through craigslist. It is such a win-win opportunity to recycle or reuse items.,5
753,Great app: I‚Äôve always thought it was super easy to sell on Craigslist for the most part when eBay and reverb and others want to charge you tons of moneys for the same thing. Just use you smarts and be careful everything would be pleasant.,5
754,"Still simple: I have used so many apps over the years, and lately I haven‚Äôt had much luck when clearing out garage items until I remembered good ok‚Äô Craigslist. The simplicity is what makes it great. Looking forward to selling more items on it!",5
755,RV ad: I am an occasional user of craigslist. I like the email style anonymous hidden name communication. And I would say over 90% of the users of craigslist are wonderful people looking to get rid of something terrific and wonderful people looking to buy something terrific. Craigslist fills that role.,5
756,Great services: I‚Äôm pleased. I just wish there weren‚Äôt so many people trying to scam you. Like the people trying to purchase with‚Äùcashier‚Äôs checks. There are so many scammers on the site but I don‚Äôt know if there is anything Craigslist can do about them????,5
757,"Great Tool: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for years, using my person discretion, I have never had a bad experience purchasing or selling items using the tried and true platform that is Craigslist. I hope it never changes.",5
758,"The OG is still the best: Oh boy Craigslist, I love you. Over all these years other person to person platforms have risen and fallen, but here you still are, as great as ever. Facebook marketplace is a hellscape for rentals and resale, and classified sections in newspapers are lucky to get a full page. 

Well done. Thank you.",5
759,We found our studio guitar player on craigslist: Everybody told me listing on it could not be done and that craigslist was a waste of time but yet we found a quality session player.  It can be done and they are out there. Thank you Craigslist.,5
760,"Wonderful Resource to share the wealth: How amazing. Just creating a way for seekers too find what they seek brings such value to seekers and to those who have (or are) what is sought.   And so humanity has a new way to make more value with less waste.  It is a public good.  A resource for the community. A blessing. 

Yohan Morgan",5
761,App experience is far better than the desktop version: Saving searches and generally the interface makes searching and finding things so much nicer over the desktop version.,5
762,Good selling app: App is still relevant but one improvement could be a button where you can press sold and what your account shows buyers reviews and ratings of you so that you can tell if a seller is a good one to buy from and so you can show others you‚Äôre a good person to buy from,4
763,"Ok, but there are frauds: I encounter many fake postings: some within the housing market and they all basically want the same . To set up a online payment for a credit check. Idk how Craigslist will do it but I believe they have the ability to extract these situations",5
764,"Excellent, consistent over the years: I have had multiple years of successful purchases and sales on Craigslist. The platform is stable and reliable. The app makes searching and posting both easy and convenient. A+",5
765,"Expanding search possible?‚Ä¶..: Wish Craigslist search can be expanded to the whole nation.  There was an Craigslist app that let me search the whole nation at once and buy a lot of hard-to-find items, but it was taken by OfferUp later‚Ä¶..",5
766,"LOVE THIS APP: Very clean and clear, streamlined -well organized and user friendly!! A MILLION TIMES BETTER than the website!! It‚Äôs not all muddled with a million of the same ads back to back that cause you to give up and look for an alternative before you even start.üòå‚ù§Ô∏è",5
767,Easy to use: I want to be able to post thing in just a few min and I never felt that when I used the desktop. When I started using the app that changed. Much easier and comparable to any other selling app.,5
768,"Get rid of the scammers and fake accounts!: Please crack down on the scammers and fraudulent accounts you allow on your platform.  They are very frustrating and annoying to deal with. They make want to switch to Facebook marketplace, eBay or another selling platform.  There are a lot of them!  Otherwise, great site! Thanks",4
769,"Who doesn‚Äôt love craigslist?: Perfectly functional app, you can tell this wasn‚Äôt some crappy port but that a lot of care went into making it workable and easy to use just like the website. Never change, craigslist.",5
770,"Will always use Craigslist: With all of the selling apps available, I will always turn to CL first. Everything I‚Äôve listed has sold. I realize that descriptive words and great pictures are important, but the fact that CL is free and helpful is such a huge plus.",5
771,Easy to use!: Craigslist has improved over the last few years. It is Much better than it has been in the past. Very intuitive and user friendly. We use it often with good results.,5
772,Nice app: I just started using the app. It feels less overwhelming than online. I do hope they find a way to help cut back on ppl who over list because that would save a lot of time. I do like the hide feature but I can‚Äôt tell if it is working.,5
773,Play structure sold: I posted this play structure for a week and sold it the following weekend.  Great experience.  I did NOT have a similar experience with potential buyers on a different app‚Äôs ‚Äúmarketplace.‚Äù   But Craigslist came through again!  Thanks Craigslist!!!  See you next time‚Ä¶,5
774,I love Craig!üòÅ: Craig‚Äôs List is an easy and effective way to buy and sell almost anything. I sometimes enjoy just shopping the different categories when I‚Äôm not looking for any thing specific just to see what others are trying to get rid of.,5
775,The OG of Selling Your Stuff: When moving apartments the Craigslist app was the best place to sell the stuff I wasn‚Äôt taking with me. App is easy to use and I sold most things very quickly (within a day). And absolutely no spam or suspicious emails. What more could you ask for!,5
776,"A little buggy but mostly functional: Able to list my listings and got someone right away. Perfect for finding new roommates or finding someone to work for you. Make sure you make the right choices and don‚Äôt blame the app or Craigslist. You can find good people on Craigslist, just be patient and reasonable.",4
777,The app is good.: I gave it just 4 stars cause my first two post where unsuccessful due to people flagging it for no reason. When using this app make sure you check your post daily to make sure it hasn‚Äôt been flagged. Do this and you should see results. So far I‚Äôm overall happy with the results of this app.,4
778,"Craigslist app great: I like the CL app. I use it a lot. It‚Äôs probably one of my most used apps next to text, email, safari, chrome, iG and Google maps. 

I wish they would chang the sort search a little. Back in day on the web browser version you could sort by mileage (for vehicle shopping).  Other than that it‚Äôs great! 

I use multiple times a week.",4
779,"This is an app that I love, but won‚Äôt give 5 stars because...: I‚Äôve noticed that stores are posting massive (but exaggerated amount of postings) ads of their goods which makes it difficult to actually look for second hand stuff or things that actual users post. Craigslist should definitely do something about this as it is really annoying.",3
780,App rating: Find it very useful. Am finding Craigslist still to be most reliable for actual  sales. Once get past first couple of scam calls others are usually productive. Unlike social media sales pages where get 100‚Äôs of inquiries and maybe one serious call. Thanks again.,5
781,"Room rental: For over 10 years, I have used craigslist to rent out bedrooms in my three bedroom two bath home‚Ä¶ I asked that the perspective Renter send me a text message or email first so that I know who they are and I have been very successful in renting that room out to very good people.",5
782,Great app Too many tire and wheel ads repeat cloggers: Craigslist is a great app but there are quite a few scammers on here too many ads for tires and wheels you type in any car make and model number to show you every we‚Äôll ever major then why not just advertise by yourself I‚Äôm not trying to trick people to senior ads because they‚Äôre searching for something else.,4
783,"On the road again: Within 12 hours of posting my trailer sold. No problem with buyer, good way to clear those items from your backyard and let others enjoy their purchase.",5
784,"Successful sale: Posted two gates and they sold in 9 days.  This site and app were very easy to use, hassle free and offered simple and easy communication via email.  I would highly recommend this great service to others!!!",5
785,Finding exactly the right people: Craigslist is great for roommate searches.  We have very quirky permaculture homesteader needs.  I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs another search tool that works so well for us.  We live ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù and search ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù!  Craigslist is great.,5
786,It does exactly what its supposed to: Craigslist does exactly what it is says it will do. Without the horrific monetization schemes or terrible user interfaces that other apps offer. Craigslist hasn't changed much in the last 20 years but if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it,5
787,"Craigslist is great, but app has some problems: The app keeps ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù my login info and making me re-login. It‚Äôs really annoying and inconvenient! Also, the reposting of the same ad after it stops being renewable is a lot more trouble than it should be. It‚Äôs hard to tell what posts still need to be reposted vs what is just an old outdated version.",3
788,Much easier on app: I find it much easier to search for items on the app than I can online. I use Craigslist mostly for garage sales and I love how I can enter the date and I don‚Äôt end up finding garage sales after they are over!,5
789,"It‚Äôs not what it used to be.: I purchased lots of recording studio equipment through Craigslist years back and I did it successfully and safely. It‚Äôs gotten harder to find good equipment, seller are selling junk or trying to scam you. I haven‚Äôt found a good deal in years. Also the community section is full of fake people, nothing like it use to be. Despite all the negative i still search hoping to find something of value.",2
790,Little Improvement: I wish it was a little easier to upload images for a posting and also just to maybe link Venmo to an account that included a purchase agreement. Just a small safeguard dealing with the sales of items. Otherwise I still like the app. Thanks,4
791,"I‚Äôve used for years: A helpful classified ads site/app. I wish there was more security to block scammers, but it is what it is. I‚Äôve used Craigslist to buy and sell all sorts of items over the years, even a few cars. Generally a great experience.",5
792,"Good ol‚Äô Craigslist: Years ago Classifieds App was a lot better but then it was hobbled and then turned into something useless. The Craigslist app is okay, but the more expanded features I used to be able to take advantage of are no longer around. I still give it four stars, though. I use it all the time.",4
793,"Omega Speedmaster: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for quite some time and will continue. I find it easy to use, and have always had good luck with it wether renting my properties or as in the case , selling personal items 
Listed this watch and sold it for only slightly less than asking in 4 days üëç
Thanks üòé",4
794,"I luv Craigslist: I‚Äôve been selling everything from cars n trucks to fishing gear on Craigslist for years. You cant beat it for making connections to buyers. Items that are over $1000 i do the financial end in my bank lobby. I never let anyone in the house, garage only.",5
795,"Craigslist is for old timers.: Craigslist is essentially dead. Facebook Marketplace is the new Craigslist. Every once and a while you find a good deal and that‚Äôs why I still use it. That being said the app is glitchy and they now make you pay to list a vehicle. It is what it is, but Craigslist just isn‚Äôt the same like it was 10 or even 20 years ago.",3
796,It‚Äôs so dumb: I‚Äôm trying to post something and they‚Äôre telling me to put my email down and I did now their asking me for my password saying that it‚Äôs invalid but I never even had an account on craigslist. it‚Äôs so dumb because it‚Äôs like how about ask me to create an account because I don‚Äôt have an account. never in my life I had an app that was so dumb.  I even used another email address that I have and it still didn‚Äôt work. How can I even post what I want on here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This app is dumb,1
797,"Love it!!!!: The app is amazing! I love it so much better then using it on the internet, I love getting notifications when someone responds, it‚Äôs so much more helpful and swift then having to check my email all day, should have made this app a long time ago!!!!",5
798,"Works well overall: Works well. The layout is fine but it‚Äôs a little hard to follow. But maybe it‚Äôs just newer to me so I have to get used to it. I can update the review later after several months of use.

The FB app works a little more smoothly, rather it is the ease of use. Overall, solid CL app.",4
799,"Great app, with greater results!!!!!!!!!: App works great for creating, searching, selling and buying whatever you might like. I have also had great experiences over the year with both buying and Selling. Never been exposed to a scam or dishonest people. Been using for years.",5
800,Crazy easy: We just moved and it has been crazy easy to sell stuff on both ends. It takes literally second to snap a picture and post and it‚Äôs incredibly easy to edit posts and renew them. Life changing app!,5
801,"Expansive exposure for free!: Every time I place an ad on Craigslist I find myself asking ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù. Well to the best of my knowledge there isn‚Äôt one. Who said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no free lunch‚Äù? These ads get the stuff your selling out there fast. Price it right, tell them what is, be honest and it‚Äôs sold!",5
802,Great place to sell your stuff.: We are always successful in selling our things when we place it on Craigslist. Simple to use and always quick and easy. We have even met some very friendly people. Thank you Craigslist,5
803,"Not the same: I use to use this app for everything, now it has changed so much can‚Äôt even post to rehome and save a dogs life. Keeps getting deleted because the very intelligent PETA people have made it impossible for people to post here. And of course like a sheep this app have to comply with the powers that be PETA. Also if you think your going to add a service that you provide (construction, mechanics‚Ä¶) there is a charge now‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt see craigslist going any further no more crash and burn üî•",1
804,Simple and easy to use: Great app that aligns well with the website. Only complaint is that ‚Äúshow contact info‚Äù only gives email address even if website shows a contact phone number.,5
805,"Craigslist Moves!: I use Craigslist to sell or give away stuff I now longer need, and am successful moving the stuff.  The app works great so I can snap a picture, write the description and post.

Craigslist app also helps me scan for things I need without much effort.  

Great app!",5
806,A quick sale of my car: I used Craigslist exclusively to post my car for sale. I had several inquiries that resulted in a sale less than a week from the initial post. You can‚Äôt beat the price $5 to run an add for 30 days. Thanks Craigslist.,5
807,Cell Phone: I had first went to offer up to sell my cell phone and was getting no responses what so ever! So I downloaded Craigslist app and with in days of the posting I sold my cell phone! I would definitely use Craigslist again for anything I sell! Thanks JM,5
808,"2005 Lexus ES 330 Low Miles: The post was very helpful, I received a lot of inquiries about the car and I was able to sift between the people who were interested and those just fishing. I met with a potential buyer and the process went very well. Thank you Craig‚Äôs List for your help.",5
809,Great response rate on listings: I have sold several items now and had a good response rate on my listings. I just wish it had an option for getting notifications through the app when someone replies to your listing. It‚Äôs an extra step to have to constantly check my email.,4
810,"Wish more people used: Wish more people used this instead of Facebook marketplace - for those of us not wanting a FB account.  It can be slow selling since FB marketplace became popular, but I still sell most things eventually",5
811,"Successful Sale: I am always happy to post on Craig‚Äôs List, as I am 
successful with finding a buyer. This time it was 
my shop vacuum. It sold to someone very friendly, who didn‚Äôt quibble about the price, and was willing to pay cash and pickup n person!
Thank you, Craig‚Äôs List!",5
812,"Could be better: I know this might come off as lazy, but when posting there is no auto-correct or auto-capitalize at the beginning of sentences. CL seems to keep things bare bones, but something like that should be standard in 2021. Hopefully this is received as constructive criticism, not just complaining. Otherwise, great üëçüèΩ.",4
813,Much easier to use than website: The app is so much easier and user friendly than the mobile web version. If you frequently go on Craigslist this app is a must,5
814,Craigslist app getting better and better: Have been selling on Craigslist for several years. I like their overall platform. The app continues to get better and glad they finally have their own app.,5
815,"Free stuff: I love craigslist, and whenever I have something that I would like to get rid of that is of limited value to me anymore, I love to use their free stuff category.
Keep stuff out of the landfill, and what is useless to me anymore can be very useful to someone else.",5
816,Craigslist app works great: I have once again had success using the craigslist app to recycle (aka: get rid of) unneeded stuff. Was very easy to take picture of our unneeded bunkbed and post it under for sale by owner / free stuff. Bed found a new home within 2 days.,5

818,"Always works well: I‚Äôve used the site and app for over a 100 years and it all works well. I wish more people would use the chat function in the app. It seems to work well, but haven‚Äôt used much yet‚Ä¶",5
819,"Still the best way to sell/find things: There are many new apps on the market but this one is still the best in my opinion. I‚Äôve had hundreds of great, successful and easy interactions. And without all the data collecting and gimmicks. Thanks Craigslist",5
820,"20 Years on Craigslist: Over the years, Craigslist has helped me find jobs, apartments, instruments and music-related gear- and also sell instruments and furniture. I‚Äôve relied on it and it‚Äôs never let me down. Long live Craigslist, the country-wide classifieds for a new generation.",5

823,"Simple but it works: No bells and whistles, but it‚Äôs Craigslist, no need.  Simple, easy to use interface that never crashes, no annoying bugs or glitches, and Ad free.  Less is more.  A long time internet staple, never change CL, you be you.",5
824,Positive Sale: I don‚Äôt understand why CL doesn‚Äôt have better control over their website.  I know anytime i advertise an item for sale im going to have to deal with scammers.  i‚Äôve even seen people running ads warning against ads being scams.  i personally have flagged many scams.  why is it the responsibility of the customer to police this website ?,3
825,Great app - sold item in 30 minutes: Posted an item (car) and it was sold within first 30 minutes for setting up the post. I recommend using this app if you really want to get things sold.,5
826,"Make it usable!!: I haven‚Äôt been allowed to post anything with no explanation. It gets taken down before it even posts. It‚Äôs obviously going to look like ‚Äúspam‚Äù cause I have to keep reposting since you always take it down. Craigslist has been unusable for me for months. Maybe if you actually told me what was wrong with what I‚Äôm posting, I could fix it. Feels like you guys are just having a power trip and taking things down just cause you can. Fix it!!",1
827,Successful Sale: I had a successful sale. I hope that Craigslist will stay competitive with Facebook Marketplace and work to make it even more user friendly. It is a little difficult to manage postings and edit. Hoping for Craigslist‚Äôs long term success.,5
828,"Fantastic!: Our company upgraded lots of office equipment and furniture.  Put it on Craigslist and it was gone, better than pointing and having the junk people take it away.  Felt better too since it was all in good condition and it did not end up in the dump.",5
829,"Search Feature Could Be Better: This app is easy to navigate and generally glitch-free. However, the search feature could be improved so it doesn‚Äôt default to ‚ÄúServices‚Äù so often. Other than that I like how easy the app has made for me to buy and sell stuff.",4
830,Results within the hour: Worked perfect with calls coming in within 10 minutes and the transaction within the hour. Thank you craigslist,5
831,"Such a service to the community: I have given away numerous items via the Craigslist app with remarkable success. It helps me get rid of unwanted items, and it helps someone else with a need. All that and it is totally free to everyone. As I said, what a great community service!",5

835,Keep using this site.: Craigslist changed the world. Sure it closed down about 1000 newspapers but it has been a great alternative to paid and spammy sites.  Please continue to use this app so that classified ads will remain free for future generations of online users.,5
836,"Better than the website, needs improvement: This makes it so much easier to edit my listings, however it is a little difficult to navigate.

837,"Excellent Craig‚Äôs List experience: This is the first time I have sold anything on CL and I couldn‚Äôt be any happier with the overall experience. From the ease of creating a post to the customers response, everything was smooth and I felt secure going through CL.  I would definitely be a returning customer.",5
838,"Great resource to use to sell things!: We have successfully sold many items, including a car, with this website. Love the location option and multiple photo options.",5
839,Favorite app: I Love Craigslist! I‚Äôve used it for years. It‚Äôs a great resource for recycling unwanted items and even better for finding cool stuff from all over the map. You do need to use your noodle when posting (don‚Äôt give out too much personal detail...etc) but I‚Äôve never had a problem.,5
840,Craigslist is the future: Currently downsizing and the only way I will get more crap moving forward is through Craigslist. Makes life much more carefree and I can search for what I need versus going to a store and having them tell me what I need to buy. Thanks Craigslist for making life simple again :),5
841,"Still needs some work...: I love Craigslist, but I wish it had a few more features. It would be great to search within certain groups, not just within miles. 

There is also a problem with contact phone numbers not displaying sometimes. It has happened that I can‚Äôt see them from the app, but I can see numbers when I search through Safari.",3
842,Easy to list and get quick interest: I was able to create my listing in two minutes and post it and have three legitimate interested parties within a couple hours.,5
843,"Craigslist is a classic: Craigslist will always go down in history as a classic board to post, jobs, services and inquiries. Find lost things, take classes. Etc. They seem to have a team who is always updating. I am always satisfied.",5
844,Free - works really well.: Ten minutes after posting my ad ( lawn mower) the customer inquired and It was picked up in less than 1 hour.  Yes it was functional but had one drive wheel not functioning.  Other than than a good deal for someone.,5
845,"Posting: It is really straightforward, if you are capable and willing enough to comprehend the basic components of the process, then it should be a breeze to get your items listed. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help. I can‚Äôt wait to keep exploring!",5
846,Why am I being flagged?: This used to be pretty good now every time I try to post something it keeps flagging me and removing my ad over and over it is very irritating and you can‚Äôt even get anything sold because people keep lagging you when my ad sounds just like exactly like the other ones I read word for word I copied itand I got flagged while the other ads are still up. Please fix this. It is very annoying and makes me not want to use this app.,1
847,Craigslist over Marketplace all day any day: Sold my car on Craigslist within the week I posted for my asking price and didn‚Äôt have to deal with any of the children or tire kickers from Facebook. Well worth the $5 to make the post.,5
848,Sold my car through Craigslist in less than 24 hours: Craigslist is a great way to sell items from cars to microwave ovens to exercise equipment. I just sold my car through Craigslist in less than 24 hours! Love it!,5
849,"SOLD SOLD SOLD: I have always procrastinated selling tools, equipment, miscellaneous items over the years but in the many times I finally get around to it I have never been disappointed. The vast majority of my sales have always been with Craig‚Äôs list",5
850,"Necessity: This app is always here when I need it wether for housing, vehicles, hiring employees to entertainment. A lot of the bots are gone with random posting clogging up my search and regular locals are the top feed now. Always use. Better than Facebook marketplace as they are flakes.",5
851,"THUMBS UP: The original market for online sales. Nevermind the failed software, gimmicks, and over advertising such as OFFER UP. Craigslist is, and has always been the simple solution for easy old school transactions. If it aint broke dont try to fix it",5
852,"Free listings, etc: Craig‚Äôs list does a lot of work for the users. Localizing the search and the market. 
Free listings can go fast, as can quality bargains. 
A patient buyer can wait for the right local listing 
Your personal information is not part of the revenue stream",5
853,"Easy to post: Very easy to post your goods or services through this application, very flexible and you have the opportunity to post endless items that other apps do not allow, highly recommended.",5
854,"Glad to have a service like this: Overall it‚Äôs been a fantastic service that‚Äôs easy to use and had never failed me. Like anything, there are scammers out there but use common sense and deal in cash you‚Äôll be fine.",5
855,"Craigslist is awesome!: I am a fan of Craigslist. There was a time in my life I did everything through Craigslist: sell, buy, find a job, find housing, and much more. I love you Craigslist! Now that I‚Äôm older and wiser, I use Craigslist to sell my furniture. Never had a problem.",5
856,Got multiple offers and my price in 6 days.: I filled in Craigslist‚Äôs information form completely and got one qualified buyer in less than an hour. Sold it in 6 days but was out of town 3 days. Can‚Äôt beat that for results!,5
857,Headache with success: 2 months of ppl trying to scam me and hit on me. 2 days before my lease was up UREUKA I FOUND A PLACE! sooooooooo it was a success but came with a lot of bad ppl online trying to take advantage of me. Wish there was a way to weed out the ‚Äúunwanted ‚Äú but u found a new place tht I am happy with me. So long story short it all worked out.,4
858,"Goes against their own policies.: It‚Äôs as simple as that. Massive information harvesting which could be resolved very easily resolved with identification. instead expect to be immediately berated by moderators who have no sense of the industry, sale of goods, or services offered. I realized things were going downhill several years ago. It‚Äôs hit a rock bottom. You can still find the same vehicle scams unmoderated, but cannot advertise tutoring or lessons if you‚Äôre not lgbtq. Note that it is ok to advertise personals for lgbtq.",1
859,Easy way to sell: Not a regular Craig‚Äôs list user.  I found the process easy and quick. Was a lot better than the old classified ads.  Allowed for an exchange of information with potential buyers.  Will use again.,5
860,Craigslist always comes through for me: It may take a little while to sell an item but CL always comes through for me.  I know some complain about it but what the heck do you want for free. Your my number one sells sight. Keep up the good work.,5
861,"Yup, the app is legit~: Forever used the website on my phone, but after refusing the app for years, I finally tried it out. 
The posting process is way more convenient and helps maintain your posts way more efficiently. 
Definitely give it a shot ~",5
862,Much better: The newer version is much better. The older one was saturated with spam. I‚Äôm venturing back into the world of Craigslist again. Hopefully the folks at Craigslist will crack down on the multiple duplicate spam listings that are cancerous to these platforms.,5
863,Free Curb Alert: It usually takes less than an hour for items to disappear from my driveway after posting them on Craigs List free stuff. I love that these items are picked up by people who want them instead of going to land fill!,5
864,Definitely THE app for Craigslist: This is better than the CL app I was using before. I just have two suggestions: 1) managing items be placed higher on the list on the accounts page. 2) That iOS give notifications that the 45 days are up so I don‚Äôt have to renew every week. Thanks.,4
865,Old school still works: Even with all the ways we can sell now it seems that old school Craigslist still works best. Thank God there‚Äôs an app. So easy to upload pics and take down posts once items sell. Thank you Craigslist!,5
866,"Trailer sale.: I haven‚Äôt used Craigslist in years. After a quick look recently I decided to give it another try. I am pleasantly surprised how clean the app is and how smooth the process was. Thanks people, I will be back to buying and selling on Craigslist.",5
867,"Add Picture feature problem: App works pretty well, although, if I have a choice I prefer using a computer. When posting, I often can‚Äôt choose the pictures that I want to use. The app only retains pictures from previous posts, and I can‚Äôt access the photo gallery. Not sure if this is a bug or is I‚Äôm doing something wrong.",3
868,Scams get through and real ads get flagged.: The report system is trash. Most scam ads get through and all the real ones get reported within minutes. Super frustrating. And makes this website and app not worth using.,5
869,Great way to pass on free stuff: The Craigslist app has made clearing out our house very easy. I always seem to have ads in the free stuff section and have met lots of great people while giving away useful items that we no longer need.,5
870,"Nice app: Works good and easy to use for posting and searching.  I‚Äôd like to see the app spell check and properly capitalize the first word of each new sentence when entering a description, right now it‚Äôs all lower case and you have to remember to capitalize when 99% of all apps do it automatically.  Otherwise great app.",4
871,Better than expected: The web interface is quite good and has a lot of useful features but I find it much easier to navigate and organize while browsing within the app.  Great job!,5
872,Easy to use: I like using Craigslist as it features mostly local items from other sellers passing on items they can no longer use.  Why buy new when you can find slightly used for great prices.,5
873,"Very improved: I had not used CL in a while. I must say it‚Äôs vastly better. Narrowing search was a bit clumsy but may just be me!!! 
All in all, CL is still my ‚ÄúGO TO‚Äù for almost any service. Real people selling their service is as good as them showing up at your door!!",5
874,Still one of the best: Still one of the best options for selling locally. There‚Äôs a lot of spam but your posts don't get lost in a sea of ads like Offerup. Also looks better and less clutter on app/web and service in general. Prefer this and nextdoor but ND requires a lot personal information and your identity isn't private.,4
875,Thank you Craigslist: Thank you for staying as you always have been - simple and clear and useful while never trying to sell me more than I wish to consume. You are a star in a world of wet blankets and I appreciate you. Please don‚Äôt ever change. :-^*,5
876,"Stick to the site not the App: Craigslist is a great place to get things done. The site is easily a 5/5 and is very useful. But this is a rating for the app, not the site. I think the site is not as easy to use as I would expect from Craigslist. I will continue to use the site on my desktop, but I will probably stick to apps like OfferUp and others on my phone.",3
877,"Does the trick: There are some little things about the interface that are a little bit...nonstandard. But hey, Craigslist is pretty nonstandard! Overall, a really good app. Much better than trying to use the web interface on your phone!",5
878,"Craigslist: I‚Äôve used Craigslist since it first came out, I really like it, I like the improvements you made. It‚Äôs the BEST out here too use if you ask me. It‚Äôs simple easy to use. I barely ever see the site down which is great. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs free.
Keep up the great work guys and gals!!!
Sincerely a LOYAL CUSTOMER !!!

879,"Great Deals ! Awesome People !: I have found great deals using Craigslist on items that are like new or in very good condition.

882,"Great and simple: At a time when everything is packed with thousands of ads, Craigslist is exactly how it used to be: a little weird, but very useful. My only complaint is that there are too many duplicate posts.",5
883,"Great: As expected, to the bone / raw iOS craigslist app, does the job well. Are push notifications available for new search result posts in the week? That I did not see, feels like a missed opportunity if it‚Äôs indeed not available",5

To: Craigslist Admin‚Ä¶.
Please place a notice for sellers informing them of fastest reply is by text. 
Thanks",5
887,FYI: I use Craig‚Äôs list to book jobs for my boyfriend‚Äôs moving company and it seems to have frequent traffic so most of the time it is easy to find a job to do. I would recommend them. Also I would recommend his company Iron Man Moving.,5
888,"Excellent Local Resource: I enjoy being able to post things of value to someone else perhaps, which I no longer need.  Also to find valuable services from local providers.  Thank you Craigslist!!",5
889,"Keeps getting better!: Many moons have passed since I started using CL, the little tweeks over the years has made it great. The only gripe is the folks that over post their listings. Maybe some day the CL team will make a way to stop them!!!",5
890,Patio Furniture: I posted my patio furniture on Craig‚Äôs list and I had two scammers try to purchase them. So be very careful with who you deal with. The third person who contacted me wind up buying it the next day. He was very nice and was delighted to get such a bargain! He is for sure one of a kind buyer!!,5
891,"GET THE APP üëç: The app is so much easier and quicker to navigate. It even lets people chat within the app if you‚Äôre interested in something. The problem is I think a lot of people still haven‚Äôt caught on. 
I highly recommend it.",5
892,"Craigslist allows to sell pets: I love the fact that Craigslist allows the selling of animals, which is great because I love to buy animals, from the site and it‚Äôs the only type of site, (that I know of) that allows you to sell your animals.",5
893,"Car sale: The page was very effective in connecting me with car buyers. However, i still get scammers and would advise people who uses it to be more careful. Over all it was good because i got the chance to sell car!",5
894,Quick Sale: I posted an add in the farm and garden section.  The post was very easy to make.  The posting was published quickly.  I had interest within a few hours and sold the item within 48 hours.,5
895,"Car: I sold my Maserati in 6 hours ,first person came bought the car ,it‚Äôs been two week on OfferUp and only received ridiculous offer and people don‚Äôt show up , ty Craigslist I‚Äôm having a class of wine on behalf of you :)",5
896,Better than web browser: The app on iPad works far better than the simple browser. I find the searches are better the results are better and the interface is fantastic.,5
897,This is now better than using the site: Happy to have a well functioning and streamlined dedicated app; it is almost completely replaced my desktop craigslist to use. Starred items sink across CL account. Thanks and keep up the good work,5
898,"Quick, supportive housing: Was able to find what I needed, connect with other social platforms for safety without bogus fees we shouldn‚Äôt be paying to find housing. 
Safety first, but this has improved my Craigslist opinion compared to other housing apps.",5
899,"My favorite app to buy and sell: I Always buy and sell everything on Craigslist. Especially cars, but I‚Äôve bought and sold home, appliances and bicycles too.
I‚Äôve used Facebook market place and offer up, but Craigslist is my favorite.",5
900,Lincoln Zepher: I placed an ad on your website to sell my Lincoln Zephyr I received many request about it and it has been sold from your your listings it was easy to list and very easy to remove thank you very much for your systems and selling my car,5
901,"Much improved app!: Updated App is so much more efficient than original app.  The only negative is that when a listing expires and needs to be manually relisted, the photos have to be uploaded again.  Wish they stayed with the archived listing!",5
902,Great functionality: Love the search alert features! One improvement would be showing the list of results in map view without having to zoom all the way in‚Ä¶,5
903,"Wider search: I wish there was an option with unlimited search radius. So you could search the whole United States with one click.

Also paying to post your add is dumb and going to just send people to other platforms to sell there stuff. Then leading to less browsers on Craigslist",4
904,Craigslist RULES!: I‚Äôve had great luck with buying/selling/trading on Craigslist. You should vet all your interactions before you head into a deal so as to avoid scams and the like but once you do you‚Äôll find that most people are there to make that deal happen!,5
905,"It‚Äôs Craigslist: The app is user friendly and straightforward. It allows you to do everything you want to do on Craigslist. Obviously the issues with CL are still there, always be smart and careful when seeking or buying on CL. But the app works well.",5
906,"Works fine for an app!: I prefer to use Craigslist on my desktop because I use a lot of tabs and go through a lot of listings, but this app is much better than using a browser on the phone. Well done craigslist!",5
907,"Well Made: Very useful for mobile use. I don‚Äôt think of going into safari to look at Craigslist anymore now that it‚Äôs a part of my home screen and the app runs so fluidly. I really have had no issues with it, and i use it frequently. Highly recommend üëç",5
908,"GOAT: Thank you craigslist for being. Simple, easy to use, never a fee! Easy to sell or search and buy some thing. 100% success rate for both actions. Easy to find labor for Home improvement jobs. Easy to find service providers for all your needs. Keep up the great work!",5
909,Two identical couches: Received a call on Wednesday morning that new furniture was ready for delivery. Put an add on Craig‚Äôs list for the 2 couches we are replacing on Wednesday night.  Thursday morning was contacted by interested party.  Thursday evening just helped load the couches into the truck of the new owners.  What a GREAT experience with Craig‚Äôs List,5
910,"The ability to quickly change locations is great: I can look for fairly rare items like full size bus conversions just by dragging the location radius around, and then bookmarking what I find. 

It‚Äôs also easy to post something for sale from my phone.",5
911,"Same philosophy- good experience: Not to mistake with the web experience or with a mediocre version of the desktop one. It‚Äôs dry, simple and - after few minutes - really intuitive. The only minus I‚Äôve found is that your favorites are not synced among your other devices or browsers.",5
912,"Easy to use: This app is easy to use whether you are buying or selling. I have never had a single issue with. To the developers, thank you for putting out a functional app that Is easy to use.",5
913,"Craigslist is great. But watch out for flakey users.: I love craigslist. It‚Äôs a great place to buy and sell oddities. I only wish people would be more respectful. Too many users don‚Äôt follow through with their communications.  Be responsible, people. Respect your Craigslist neighbors.",5
914,"Best app. Just works.: Same than the desktop we are all familiar with. 
Very much the same look and feel. Exquisite simplicity that works. Filters work. Easy to use. Fast. Reliable. 
Really wish all apps were like this one.",5
915,Selling stuff real fast: I have always had excellent results on Craigslist by pricing items reasonably and taking and posting high quality pictures. One item to be aware of is scammers trying to go outside Craigslist normal communications.,5
916,"Replies: I always have an issue when I want to reply to the message, often times it is unable to do so, so it‚Äôs always hit and miss- I wish it was clear cut or published numbers were mandatory- fortunately, I was able to contact the last ad as it was super important and it worked but like I said most times it doesn‚Äôt",3
917,"I love the app so easy to use: When I‚Äôm looking for new reptile stuff or trailers, Craigslist is one of my top choices up there with offer up. Definitely a good experience with the people who I meet with and the app having a wide range of supply that I want.",5
918,A good public place to exchange: I like it because this is for the community to find something or get rid of something so stuff will not need go to the dump. It is also a good public place for people to buy or sell items to facilitate the exchange.,5
919,"Always sale what I‚Äôm listing: Over the past 10 years I‚Äôve sold cars, jet skis, boats, wheels and tires, and I‚Äôm sure other items. I‚Äôve always sold them on Craigslist and I‚Äôve never had a problem. I have a 100% sale rate.  At least 10/10.",5
920,"Fast and easy to sale or give away items.: Now charities are hiring 3rd party movers and they charge to pick up any heavy items you can‚Äôt take with you. But here in CG, items move fast after posting. Great help during a relocation.",5
921,Good but could be better: The only thing I would like to see is how many people have seen your item. This gives a seller an idea of changes need to be made to help sell item better.,5
922,"Does the job: I really like craigslist I have been craigslist user for over 15 years! Other than the scammers, which you get anywhere on social media and apps these days it‚Äôs a great app would recommend to anyone!!!",5
923,"just ‚Äòshopping‚Äô for dreams: motorcycles: I would recommend it highly to those of us who
Enjoy browsing items for sale‚Ä¶Also, i believe it also instills a sense being a part of the local Craigslist community.
  respectfully,  chuk‚Äôs",5
924,"IT‚ÄôS NOT PRETTY BUT IT WORKS: It may look like Craigslist hasn‚Äôt changed their website since about 2001 (because they probably haven‚Äôt) but that‚Äôs what I like about it.  It‚Äôs simple, straightforward, and free to use.  I always check it first before facebook marketplace.",5
925,"Great results from my ad posting help needed: I posted an ad for help needed for loading a pinball game into my truck and had five people calling me within an hour.

I really expected it to take longer to find someone to help me out.",5
926,Easy to use: The ability to set search parameters makes it convenient to find what I want in the area I would be willing to travel. Saving found items is a good feature too.,5
927,"I love Craigslist: And you should too! Read about the history of this organization/website/app/platform, use your brain when connecting with people, be safe be smart and this amazing tool will serve you very very well.",5
928,"Great app: When this app came out I immediately switched from the CL app I was using and never went back. The radius works great. Just wish the spammers weren‚Äôt allowed to over post the same items in other regions. It clogs up the page. 
Freecon",5
929,Definitely needs a makeover: Can you please have a renew button for all? Would be nice to just hit one renew button option for all listings.  Also please please put thumbnail pics where we manage our postings. It‚Äôs so much easier having a photo with it instead of having to read all the listings . Put picture thumbnails!,3
930,Best community app: 4 stars would give 5 but they need to work on their flagging system better . I get false flagged by other people even when I‚Äôm not violating community guidelines Craigslist should actually verify im violating community guidelines and not just take down your post but other than that it‚Äôs great !,4
931,My opinion: I  enjoy. Craigslist it a great app for the community.    !!!! A lot of people say bad things about Craigslist app but.  I thought no it‚Äôs all about how you use it and. How you want to judge it.  After you use it.   No app it‚Äôs perfect.     But Craigslist it‚Äôs all good thumbs up. Sincerely Angel vilchis,5
932,"Craig lists for selling used items: The app works very well for setting up and managing listings online. It‚Äôs a little tedious with adding photos sometimes, but highly recommend for anyone looking to manage and update postings rather than using a web browser. Happy Thanksgiving to all!",4
933,The Genuine Article: Craigslist is a shining example of a website that has stayed true to its roots thru all of the changes over the last 20 years or so. It found a formula that works and stuck with it. Thank Yiu craigslist for being there.,5
934,"Still Craig: Other apps add bloat becoming unrecognizable shadows of their humble pasts. Craigslist stays exactly the same or makes small improvements. 

Imagine if they went with the crowd. We‚Äôd have a Craigslist feed, stories, massive ad tracking, Craigslist Messenger, etc. 

We don‚Äôt deserve you Craig. Thanks!",5
935,"Rmove Posting: I posted on craigslist then my post was removed but I don't understand craigslist have been a very good app ever for selling and buying, but now I don't like it anymore, because your post can be removed anytime without you knowing.",5
936,"Craigslist: I‚Äôve sold on here for about 16 years. Yes, there are definitely modifications to be made to bring it up to date so more of the younger people would use it instead of marketplace but it‚Äôs served me well. Interested in working for Craigslist to update.",5
937,It could be a lot better: It could be a lot better to where you‚Äôre only able to make an account if they are serious and to filter through who is real and who fake,5
938,"It‚Äôs a great app: Just don‚Äôt like that people get to delete your ad ""red flag‚Äù it‚Äôs supposed to be for inappropriate items BUT they do it for competition. They really need to do something about this, just because we‚Äôre selling the same item???? It‚Äôs not cool",5
939,Even Better Than CL on a Browser: No exaggeration. The mobile app is better for scanning Craigslist listings than using a full feature web browser on you desktop computer.,5
940,Stacking washer and dryer: I sold the stacking washer and dryer in less than three hours after going through three scammers. I sure wish you could do something about these annoying people that are trying to scam everyone.,5
941,Better than online: This app is helping me so much better than the online version! I‚Äôm using it for looking for a place to rent and there‚Äôs a map option and more ways to filter and sort. I‚Äôm grateful for the app!,5
942,"Worthless filters: Searching auto parts for a specific location is pointless. Scrap yards that are 1100 miles away are showing up in my limited search area because they simply pin multiple areas as their ‚Äúlocation‚Äù. This is a regular occurrence and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any interest in app maintenance to correct this obvious and long-standing issue. I enjoy Craigslist, but in hindsight,  this support app of the site wasn‚Äôt worth the time of the free download.",1
943,User friendly: I have used Craigslist for years on my computer. I recently discovered the app and it is so much easier to navigate. We are preparing to move and the app has made posting and managing my ads a breeze.,5
944,"5 Stars: - Very easy to post things
- Very safe to use and respond to people 
- I would recommend to others, and also advise to be specific as possible in ads that you post, to save time in answering questions",5
945,The original and still excellent: Many have started to provide this type of service but Craigs continues to reach farther and is easiest to manage for both buying and selling.  Highly recommend,5
946,Malicious deleting of ads: I‚Äôve literally had hundreds of legitimate ad deleted by vindictive craigslist people. And craigslist was notified at least 20 times. It still goes on today look at my account. If someone was to take care of that it would be five star rating all the way,4
947,"Craigslist-simple and effective!: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for some time now and have always been happy with the results!  A very simple way to effectively dispose of my ‚Äústuff‚Äù that I no longer have a use for, but someone else does.  Very happy!!",5
948,"Great: I know there can be sketchy people and some fake offers, but if you dig a little you can most of the time tell if they‚Äôre fake or not. I have been looking at cars and all the people I‚Äôve met and went to were very nice and not at all sketchy.",5
949,You know what ur getting!!!: I‚Äôve been shopping for mountain bikes and Craigslist gives you all the information about everything. If you are looking for a bike (or really anything used) I would have to recommend this appüòâ,5
950,"Love the app, easy to use: Very easy to use on your mobile, take pictures and upload. 
I really like the map search radius, gives u the ability to find items far from your location",5
951,"Used washer sold: Thanks CL ! My used washer could not have gone to a more deserving person. I also replied back to my two second and third interested parties and told them the item had been sold. I wanted to bring decency and integrity to CL. Thanks again, Frank",5
952,Much better functions and easier use than the website: Better option then the website on mobile devices,5
953,"Great app for acct management: Highly user friendly. The interface isn‚Äôt as easy as the desktop version but it‚Äôs a close second.

This app, though, excels in post management. It‚Äôs so much easier to manage your account via the app.",5
954,"Makes posting too easy: I don‚Äôt know why I held out on getting the app for so long. It makes posting seriously quick from a phone. I don‚Äôt need to use my computer anymore. 

Designed well with simplicity in mind. I mean, it‚Äôs craigslist. There‚Äôs a reason everyone uses it.",5
955,"Craigslist: Remember when Craigslist was free to use? Me too. My problem isn‚Äôt with the app. The app is intuitive and easy to use. It‚Äôs the fact that they want $5 per posting when you‚Äôre selling something. When most people are on Facebook, which is free to use, or OfferUp, which is also free to use, how does Craigslist justify charging people to make listings?",3
956,"Very well done: It was a long time coming, but they've done a good job with this app. It works the same as the website, it's easily navigated, and I use it quite a lot on my phone and tablet. No unnecessary ""improvements,"" just an app that does what it's supposed too and works properly.",5
957,"Shared townhouse posting successful again!: I‚Äôm grateful for Craig‚Äôs List. It‚Äôs very easy to enter information, pictures, edit and post. I especially like the share option.

Best of all it helps me find new tenants, quickly and easily!",5
958,"Review: Craig‚Äôs List is a great way to connect with others for everything from housing, searching for items and just about everything else.  I have used them for years and continue to be happy with results and the safety protocols they have in place.",4
959,"App is great, many buyers are not: So many people flake in meeting up to complete a purchase.  I also think a lot of shut ins use the app to just communicate with someone.  Lots of lowballers as well. But the app is easy to use and is a solid piece of software.",5
960,"best website app ever don't I'm leaving know why people use all the stupid ones that charge: craigslist is free safe and has always been dont know why people use apps that charge like ebay offerup facebook etc 

ebay is the worst",5
961,"Still with the Best: started with:‚Äùwho‚Äôs?‚Äù and now THE WORLD knows CRAIGSLIST ‚Ä¶unless u live on Pluto and remains in top 3 apps: FB, offer, and the original pioneer: CRAIGSLIST , still no annoying ads like the other 2 plus free section to me is Houston‚Äôs Donations (Free) You don‚Äôt even have to steal (1 of commandments!) Besides, it‚Äôs free ;)",5
962,Better then before: I stopped choosing craigslist for sometime. The new update and allowing us to see pictures and all kinds of things is so much better. Thank you for this update. although I really still wish there was a spot for us to re-adopt or adopt pets.,4
963,The absolute best way to sell local items‚Ä¶.: I‚Äôve been using craigslist now for close to 20 years in order to give away free items and find local opportunities.  I must say it is still the best thing going.,5
964,"Even Helped Reunite a Lost Dog: There are a lot of things that one can say about craigslist, but more often than not it serves a purpose. Easy to use and manage, it‚Äôs still by far my favorite listing site/app for local engagement.",5
965,"App is annoying: Craigslist itself is craigslist what can I say but the app is getting pretty annoying now if I want to post a motorcycle for sale at charges five dollars which is OK but come on guys!! It‚Äôs 2024, why not allow Apple Pay for that payment? Why do I have to fill in entire payment method, full home address and CC number for a quick $5 payment? Charge me $5.40 or whatever and modernize",2
966,Sold!: So easy to post and manage a listing. The exposure is great because it reaches a lot of people shopping. You can choose your area of location and search other cities to find what your looking for.,5
967,Finally a respectable app: The previous CL app was terrible. That was luckily Confirmed by how much better this one is. Night and day. This app works way more intuitively. It‚Äôs been a long time coming. Sheesh. Nice work to the developers that made this thing worth using. Boo-yah,5
968,"Thanks Craigslist: I didn‚Äôt know there was still a community on Craigslist. I sold my bike in about 12 hrs. Good for you Craigslist, you made it through all that negative press with all the whores and drug scandals and here you are still helping people connect!",5
969,"Craigslist, 2.0: It‚Äôs the same craigslist we always loved but easier to navigate on a mobile device. I wish they would bring back ‚Äúlost connections‚Äù :/. But oh well, there is always tinder for that.",5
970,Posting: Easy to access and manipulate once you understand the process. Also very user-friendly in terms of a mobile device which in this day and age is a must.,5
971,"CL is still the best way: Whether you just want something gone and offer it for free or you‚Äôre selling and item to recoup some of your initial cost, Craigslist has always been and still is THE BEST app to do it. Simple, fast and always reliable. 

Thanks CL!

972,Harassment -  No Response: I reported a add posting that some one maliciously made using my phone number and street address   asking for private favors and to send photos. I received multiple texts with inappropriate images. I flagged and reported it to Craigslist and received no reply back regarding this issue. I know have to take the person to court for harassment. You would thing a follow up would have been made but I haven‚Äôt heard back and it‚Äôs been 4 days now.,1
973,"Functional and to the point: For the most part works really well. Allows you to list browse and communicate through the app. The chat function is a little bit buggy, and sometimes my app closes or crashes due to it. But most of the time it‚Äôs OK.",4
974,"Easy to use: Pretty easy and quick to use. Biggest plus.
Some instability. For example, currently it won‚Äôt let me send message to the poster within Craigslist app. I‚Äôve to use my device‚Äôs email/txt features. Overall, useful app to connect with offer providers and responders.",4
975,Nation wide: The only improvement that I would like to see is being able to do a nationwide search. At one point a number of years ago was able to do just that.,5
976,"Sold my ladder: Worked great, for getting rid of my stuff I no longer need. Takes a few minutes to setup and I‚Äôve had pretty luck with the people that I‚Äôve encountered. I will definitely use it again.",5
977,Great place to sell and buy!: I haven‚Äôt been on Craigslist in years! Wow! So much has changed and it‚Äôs way better! I put up two separate ads and those items sold within a week! Thank you Craigslist team!,5
978,"Great resource for everybody: Always improving and always getting better. I started using craigslist when it first came out many years ago, it‚Äôs becoming easier to use and always improving.",5
979,"Has worked each time: This app is easy to use and reached the audience I need. I‚Äôve only given away, never sold but It has gotten a great response that helps me clear out those ‚Äúunwanted by me but great for someone else‚Äù items.",5
980,"Sold my car: My car sold in 17 hours after posting!
Thank you Craigslist.
I thought the process would be time consuming and I‚Äôm surprised it sold so quickly.
Good family car sold to a good family as well.",5
981,Functional and does the job: The app is good. The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is having to click on a pin on the map many times because there are multiple listings under each pin.,5
982,Awesome website except when your kicked off!: I like this website except cannot figure out why some listings get kicked off! It has never happened to a paid ad but does often in the free listing.,5
983,"Wonderful experience will start using Craigslist more!: Sold my Moms old car in a snap.
Most interested parties were respectful and honest.  Will use Craigslist for many more items in the future.
Thanks Craig for your listing service, well done.",5
984,"Freedom!: I love the Craigslist ‚ÄúFor Free‚Äù feature.
It‚Äôs easy to use and I‚Äôve used it multiple times finding new homes for furniture, home appliance &  business supplies I no longer needed, yet got the satisfaction of getting such things into the hands of truly needy nice folks.",5

987,"So easy to use!: I used to login to the mobile site and I would always need to have an email link sent to allow a login. The app is SOOO a much easier.  If you ever post on Craigslist, this app will make the process so much easier.",5
988,Great app: I really love Craigslist. Discovering the app has made it much easier to sell stuff and find things I‚Äôm looking for. I love the ability to create saved searches and get notified by either email or push notifications! Keep on rockin‚Äô!,5
989,"Hmm.: I have been using the app for a while but just started utilizing the app notification setting. 

I like how the app reminds me of new listings when it comes to finding a new place to live. 

Gonna try using this app more often for cool stuff.",5
990,"Best no hassle app!: Craigslist has always been the beat at leaving the user alone and allowing us to post, sell and buy needed or no longer needed items. Thank you for not changing the way we can use you.",5
991,"Still works: While certainly not the only or even leading second social sales channel, Craigslist still does work and likely is catering to an older audience (as well as scammers looking to take advantage of that older audience). 

80% effective for me still, albeit slower and full of bogus responses and scammers to sort through.",4
992,"Good Results: CL has a wide variety of users. That‚Äôs great. When the prices I set on items is better than reasonable, buyers take interest and the items sell. As a buyer, I always check CL among others. CL listing edit and photo features are tops. Recommended.",5
993,More options: I like this app but also I think it need a update on way people find housing for example of someone is looking low income housing the should be a category for that . Now for jobs search widen the category for that as well . This is a great app but just a little update catharsis all,4
994,"Cleaning out my closet...: Thank you Craig‚Äôs list. It‚Äôs been so nice to be able to pass things on that once were loved, but now just collect dust & take up space. And BONUS...  I get to make some cash for cleaning up & being willing to let go. I wouldn‚Äôt of cleared out my closet with out you Craig‚Äôs list. So happy & thankful!!",5

996,"Always quick and helpful selling: Have sold probably 50
Items over the years - better platform than others used.",5
997,"Frequent use: Al although marketplace has become more popular and sometimes has more products every once in a while, I find a diamond.

For the effort that it takes and the way the app is set up, this is one of the few apps on my phone.",4
998,"Needs to update flagging procedures.: I‚Äôve been in the process of looking for housing and posting want ads. Following the guidelines and after multiple tries, my posts keep getting flagged within hours, sometimes minutes of my posting. After research apparently I found out that someone can just flag you post for no reason at all and Craigslist just takes it down without any reason why. It‚Äôs super frustrating.",1
999,Good: Basically the app is very easy except deleting past searches is difficult. Sometimes they won‚Äôt go away without shutting the app down and starting over.,5
1000,"One of the rare honest sites: These guys are the best. It's always the least difficult way to sell something locally, and though the spammers do their best, craigslist keeps them at a minimum. Listing is easy, communications are great, and there's no fee. What's not to love?",5
1001,"Ease of use: Very impressed with how well the app is to navigate, you don‚Äôt have to go to the main page. You can just swipe to the left and go to the next listing and see everything upfront.",5
1002,"CL APP Makes Listings Easy: The app is a game changer for me, no more taking pictures on my phone and running to my computer to add pictures to a listing. I can do everything on my phone, so listings are no longer a multi-step process! Thanks CL!",5
1003,"Great app: No bloat, perfectly functional. One thing I would like to see is the ""postings"" button on the navigation bar instead of chat, or the ability to customize the navigation bar.",5
1004,The saved search and alerts is great!: I don‚Äôt use social media. This is how I search for random things. I have purchased my fair share from this app and have successfully sold a few too! Keep it up!,5
1005,Doing business with Craig‚Äôs list.: Have been doing business with Craig‚Äôs list now for 25 plus years and am happy with the ease of buying and selling. Please don‚Äôt change. Sold a very large planter pot today in about 24 hours. Craig‚Äôs list rocks!,5
1006,"Great way to pass it on: Craigslist works great, helps recycle things, hand goods on for continued use rather than throw them away, helps out those searching for a good deal on items that may no longer be manufactured that they need.",5
1007,The struggle is real!: Sometimes it can be hard to get a hold of people it takes a while to get what you‚Äôre looking for but it‚Äôs usually worth the wait and the people are always pretty genuine and nice and helpful on hereü´†,5
1008,"Thank you Craig.: Ya know you can count on Craigslist for many important things.

We continue to include Craigslist in a handful of our online resources to quickly sell, or find a cornucopia of amazing products or most likely just what we may need. Go Craig Go!",5

1011,Bullfrog Spa: I did my homework before posting the sale of the bullfrog spa. The price for the spa was a very good price and anyone who knew bullfrog spas knew the price was good. I sold the spa on the same day that I posted the spa and I had four other potential buyers waiting for the news.,5
1012,"Does everything you need it to: Good app, does everything the web site does plus adds a direct messaging option. Haven‚Äôt used the messaging yet but it a great idea for easier direct cons with customers.",5
1013,Serious Buyers: Of all the sites you can sell your personal items  Craig‚Äôs List  is where I have most  success and Very Few inquiries that are just to pass the time on wishful thinking  Thank‚Äôs Craigs List Administrators for keeping your site prosperous. Gary,5
1014,Harder to sell: I used to love putting up an ad here because I would get a response really quick but nowadays it‚Äôs really hard because you have so many people that‚Äôs doing fraud and then any little thing they want to report and then they flag your post I literally had to repost my item like 25 to 30 times people are really petty and making it hard to post things now,2
1015,Not perfect but at least it ain‚Äôt Facebook!: Mostly Craigslist is great.  I wish it were more heavily moderated so I wouldn‚Äôt keep seeing posts selling drugs & puppy mills.  But yeah it‚Äôs the OG digital classifieds and it isn‚Äôt handing your personal info to Zuch so 100% yay for Craigslist being what it is.,5
1016,"The best List: I‚Äôve tried John‚Äôs list, Carol‚Äôs list, Jimmy‚Äôs list, Saul‚Äôs list, Hank‚Äôs list, Jesse‚Äôs list, Gus‚Äôs List  and Mike‚Äôs list, geez Louise,  I‚Äôve even tried Skyler‚Äôs list! Tried so many bad lists with no luck, it was breaking my heart! I was feeling pretty blue until I found Craig‚Äôs list. It‚Äôs not a bad list. It is the best list.",5
1017,Sold my lawnmower: Easy and straight forward to list my item for sale. Had some spam emails and calls but guess that‚Äôs to be expected in this jacked up society nowadays. Lawnmower is now sold so I‚Äôm happy and have some garage space back thankfully.,5
1018,"Sold item but watch for scammers: Posted a bed frame on Craigslist. I did sell it, but out of the 5 inquiries, 3 were scammers wanting me to text them or email them at a personal email. Never do this, you are giving away personal info. Only email through Craigslist email!",4
1019,"A little tricky, but stick with it: Back in the day, craigslist was the go-to for finding local listings. There aren‚Äôt as many postings s there used to be, and navigation on the app is a bit trickier than it used to be just looking online, but there are still treasures to be found here.",4
1020,Quick sale: Posted 2 things for sale and sold one within 24 hours and have a inquiry for the other I have posted. Granted I‚Äôm downsizing and just needed them gone before I move but I got what I wanted for them.,5
1021,Concrete posting: This was the first time I used Craigslist to source a service and it worked out great. I got about 10 responses on a concrete retaining wall replacement ad in 5 days. It cost $5 but I was contacted by way more concrete guys than if I just looked at the ads.,5
1022,"Help wanted post: Immediately after posting my ad, I started receiving calls. Of course you have to expect the bad with the good but there werePlenty of qualified applicants to choose from. Our use craigslist again in a heartbeat.",5
1023,Searchable and location focused: The fact that craigslist is searchable and also is location base makes it much more usable and is way better thanFacebook marketplace. I‚Äôve been using Facebook too and it just doesn‚Äôt stack up.,5
1024,"East to use: The app is a great alternative to using a browser. The layout is intuitive, and it‚Äôs full-featured in terms of categories, filters, and content. Much better than using the browser on my phone.",5
1025,"Simple UI, great UX: This app does exactly what it should, no less, no more. It‚Äôs interface is simple and clean. It‚Äôs easy to search and browse. It‚Äôs easy to contact sellers. It‚Äôs easy to post. The team did a great job translating the desktop experience to mobile.",5
1026,"Impressed: I had an Xbox that I had to sell. I posted it last night, by this morning I had a message. Sold already no problem. Nice and easy to use and no people messaging about nonsense. Thanks for making this app! Very helpful.",5
1027,"Setup is  good but could be a little easier: It would be nice if the setup category selection was a little easier and if one could put in custom criteria as an example instead of using just a tool category, enter Mig Welders, Lincoln, welding gas Argon 75% / CO2 25%. Now i get a ton of trucks for sale included for my mig welder for sale lookup items‚Ä¶",4
1028,"So great!: I love buying and selling locally and this app makes it so easy to search, create favorites to purchase, and to post for easy selling too! 

There was a different app that was not nearly as easy to use - Thank you to whoever created this one!",5
1029,"Really like this craigslist app: I have used craigslist for year but always hated posting ads using my computer.  This app has made posting ads with my iphone quick and easy.  Thank you, Keep up the great work.",5
1030,Good experience: Mobile app works well and I was able to sell my car rather quickly. It was an older car and did not get too much interest from local advertising. Thanks Craigslist!,5
1031,"Sold 2005 Harley Davidson Dyna Glide: Amazing!! Posted the motorcycle less than 24 hours ago and it‚Äôs SOLD!! We tried CycleTrader first and got scammer after scammer after scammer ~ What??! 
CraigsList has its share of thieves but nothing like we experienced on CycleTrader.  Plus, hey, a week on that site w/no real offers, 12 hours on CraigsList & we are done.",5
1032,Best web reselling site!: I have sold so many items that we don‚Äôt use anymore. Craigslist is way better than Facebook marketplace and offer up in my opinion. Those are great to reselling site prioritize people who pay even if it‚Äôs just an owner is selling a small item.,5
1033,Still the best: Like the simplicity and live the filters unlike Facebook marketplace or Letgo/OfferUp which keep on showing u things u searched for even if u don‚Äôt want it now. I like cl because it shows u without considering your previous searches,5
1034,"Love love love: I already loved craigslist before, but I started using other apps like Mercari and offer up, because of the nice interface, but now that craigslist has a simple and easy to use app, I am using Craigslist even more than before. Love it.",5
1035,"Best app ever.: The CL app is the single most used app on my phone. I find myself on it for hours a day. Its way better than all those other apps like tik tok and instabook, or whatever these kids are using these days. I highly reccomend you downloading it. I wish I could give it more stars!",5
1036,Sold first day: Sold within 6 hours of post. Had several folks call with interest. The first one to look at the car in person bought it. It was worth the $5,5
1037,"Still the best classifieds ads around: I‚Äôve been using craigslist for a long time, and the new app is just as good as the old website. Easy to find what you‚Äôre looking for by search or mileage.",5
1038,Not like it used to be!: It‚Äôs definitely cleaned up and pretty safe. I think it‚Äôs just regular people trying to sell stuff and trying to buy stuff. Simple as that. I‚Äôm glad I have it another chance! I like the app too!,5
1039,Craigslist is no frills and Fantastic.: I love Craigslist because it‚Äôs so easy to search and use. Wish they could do something about the people that always try to scam every vehicle for sale. But they are usually easy to spot.,5

1041,"Works great!: I appreciate that Craigslist is just as easy as ever to use. It‚Äôs super easy - even the verification process is not a hassle. Just works great for me! Thanks, Craigslist! It means so much, with everything else out there being so frustrating!",5
1042,Outdated search engine: You guys started the buy sell for phone users. However your search engine is behind. You need to may specifics to find what u need. You guys need to upgrade your search engine for your site. Otherwise still works to buy and sell locally. Just needs an upgrade. Trust me this will help you guys a ton.,3
1043,Old Standard: Graigslist is the tried and true search for anything you have your mind set on buying or selling. eBay is a shadow of it‚Äôs former self! Incredible commission structure that benefits eBay and no one else! Offer Up is ok but none compare to Craigslist!,5
1044,"Craigslist prevails: Glad to see that this app works well, apart from about 10 scammers trying to get one over on me.  Takes me back to the days buying gopeds as a kid. Although, I still run up the stairs with my hands so I guess I‚Äôm still a kid. Stay golden ponyboys and girls",5
1045,Changes that would be helpful here.: I wish I could see on my Postings the number of Views.  It would help in how I described items I have listed.  I receive many inquiries if the Items are still available. I have had several people try and scam me on purchases.,4
1046,2015 Keystone Bullet: It was very difficult for the buyer to get in touch with me.   They claimed they tried numerous times without success but finally made contact.  I received many emails from the buyer without and content within the body of the email.  I had to email back a few times before actually making contact.,3
1047,"Sold Vehicle In 1 Day: Placed detailed ad with alphanumeric phone number and images. Interested serious buyers texted me with little to no questions. Beware of scammers and how they try to send you codes, links, etc. Block them immediately. Best wishes using site.",5
1048,Love love this app: This Craigslist app makes it so easy to search for and post items for sale.  It‚Äôs much easier today reply via the app because the texting option is easier to access.,5
1049,Fair Review: The app has come a long ways. Craigslist in general has come a long ways since the beginning. I am extremely pleased with the ease of the app. The updates on this current app make listing easier. I do not give 5 stars on anything because nothing is perfect.,4
1050,Easy to use: Best way to reach a lot of people fast to sell or buy something .  Sometime I wish they had more options when listing or searching but is you are specific in title it filters pretty good:),5
1051,"Needs updating: Always had success selling stuff.  I did not like that phone number is exposed if you want to get text messages, does not seem like it used to be that way, should be masked like the email.  Also, make private party filter more prominent, way too many dealer posts out there!  They apparently know how to dominate the top!",3
1052,"Easy to use: For what this app provides is simplicity and functionality. I wish other developers would realize this. Fast loads, easy to work and easy to navigate. Simplicity wins again",5
1053,Great for vehicle sales: Had my SUV sold within a few days for a fair price - much more $ for me than a trade in would have yielded and good deal for the buyer too. I highly suggest for sales of personal vehicles. Second time I‚Äôve sold a vehicle on CL and both good experiences. Thumbs up!,5
1054,SOLD: I‚Äôve been trying to sell this on FB app with no luck put it on CL I have sold it on The third day i used to sell a lot of stuff on craigslist I would definitely post here before anywhere else next time thanks craigslist,5
1055,"It works great: You just need to filter out people who are unreasonable. For instance, I post a lot of items for free and over the years I‚Äôve learned to make the terms on my time schedule because sometimes people don‚Äôt show.",5
1056,"Better than the website: Quick, easy, remembers your previous searches with filters, radius search includes other areas without having to switch locations. If you use Craigslist this app is a must have",5
1057,"Easy Posting and easy search for sale by owner items: I have bought and sold items easily.  Fortunately, I have not encountered any scammers.  All contacts have been pleasant and honest.  I am in the Daytona Beach vicinity, and the items for sale are usually in convenient locations.",5
1058,It‚Äôs a good app!: I like the CL app a lot. I like how you can easily see all your favorite listings. Making and managing your listings is much easier on the app. I also like how you can use the map search function. Everything seems to work well and I have no complaints. Well done CL!,5
1059,"Great App, but....: I really enjoy shopping on Craigslist. You can always find a great deal. My biggest issue is in the FREE STUFF oration. Folks FREE means NO MONEY INVOLVED! Pets are always there with a tearjerker write up wanting a good home, then at the end you‚Äôll see a 500 free for the transaction. WTH! Next, Porn is showing up on the site. One example had a naked woman with the caption ‚Äú Gutters Cleaned Cheap! CRIAGSLIST, please monitor what‚Äôs popping up on your site. Thank you. Stay safe....",3
1060,"Pretty functional app that connects you to your local marketplace: This app doesn‚Äôt flow as well as some made by big companies, but it‚Äôs pretty intuitive. 

Craigslist and fb marketplace are great ways to make some side money, but watch out for scammers on here. It‚Äôs largely unmoderated and the scammers do come out to play.",5
1061,"I love Craigslist: I have been using Craigslist for about 20 years for both buying, selling or giving away free stuff. It‚Äôs still the go to place for even with all the other newer options.",5
1062,Great site to accomplish anything you need done absolutely love it: If you wanna site that can do practically anything you need. This is the one it‚Äôs easy to set your account up. It‚Äôs easy to post. There‚Äôs nothing complicated about it. It‚Äôs great..,5
1063,Easy Process: Only took 3 days to sell for asking price. Very simple process getting the truck listed withen the correct category and location. I‚Äôll definitely use it again.,5
1064,Craigslist: We don‚Äôt have a resource problem. We have a distribution problem  - getting what we don‚Äôt need to someone else who can appropriately use it. Craigslist is an excellent tool in solving the distribution challenge!,5
1065,"Love the updates: Don‚Äôt know when they updated the app, it‚Äôs been a while since I used it, but the new updates are great, makes it so much easier to use through the phone.",5

1067,The perfect trading platform: The best and probably the oldest trading platform that‚Äôs been around! It doesn‚Äôt change which is a benefit cause you know what‚Äôre you are getting when you use their services!,5
1068,"Needs added functionality: Sometimes the spam is a little unmonitored but once you learn to navigate the scams, the app is better than the desktop version.",5
1069,"Nicely done: Kudos to the UX designer on this app. It works beautifully. My only recommendation is to auto save progress to postings when you create it. When I was switching between tabs on my iPhone, it cleared out some of the fields on my post.",5
1070,"Craigslist, but easier!: I can make a post faster on my phone than the website since photos are easy to add. It‚Äôs Craigslist, but more convenient. What more could you ask for.",5
1071,"Cleaned Up: I remember when Craigslist was always being spammed by salacious content and discrete perverts. Now it‚Äôs all grown up and the app is clean, save for the occasional phishing post offering a free trailer and all you have to do is send them your financial information.",5
1072,Best place to sell pre owned stuff: I have been using craigslist for year and for me it‚Äôs the best to sell used stuff locally. Having the app on my phone it makes easy to post many items in a few minutes. Love it!,5
1073,"Scammers ruin everything!: So I‚Äôm posting this bad review not to bash Craigslist but our society. The first 10 people to contact me through craigslist on my posts wanted to pay/rip me off with a bunk cashiers check, why do you think that is? Cashiers check is the biggest red flag told you by craigslist and others but still these people they want to waste our time trying to rip people off. Get a job you loser‚Äôs and quit stealing! I‚Äôm going back to the RECYCLER if I could!!!",1
1074,"It Just Works: I‚Äôve listed a handful of different items and have love the simplicity of the app.  It just works.  Easy navigation, quick response, simple edits, fast results.  The key to success is pricing items correctly. üéñÔ∏è",5
1075,Car for sale: This app was fabulous. I sold my car within an hour of posting it up. Please use it. It was only five dollars that‚Äôs great I can‚Äôt thank Craig list enough. Thank you for making my life so much easier.,5

1078,"Categories Need Improvement: CL is a very useful tool for buying / selling items. I do suggest updating the search categories. I would use this platform more often if PROFESSIONAL SERVICES was not limped in with non-professional services like massage. 

That said, thank you for a very good public access tool.",4
1079,Room for rent: Your ad was very useful. It informed the renter that it will not be available until the first of the month which is when he was looking to move thank you for being so efficient,5
1080,My Most Used App: I can‚Äôt say enough good things. It is simple and just works. The free stuff section always has golden nuggets hidden within and the antiques section always has at least one item to take note.,5
1081,"Here is the fix if app not working after updating the app and it does not work: If you are searching and it says no search results , Go to the homepage and type ‚Äúenable debug‚Äù in Search. It worked great to fix it.",5
1082,Craigslist Works!: I‚Äôd had a major problem when my transfer case in my Jeep blew apart on the fwy. I put an ‚ÄúIn NEED‚Äù ad on Craigslist under Auto Parts that night & within 6 hours I got a return text from someone who had a spare and at an AWESOME price. Lucky me!,5
1083,"Fast easy friendly: Posting items is easy and user friendly, reply options makes it faster to sell. And everyone is pretty friendly",5
1084,"All is fair in the selling business with Craig‚Äôs List: Craigslist has been around since I was a kid and now as an adult it means even more to me  craigslist las been of the few who cares for community by keeping us all united under it‚Äôs umbrella ‚òÇ of good business ties  ‚ù§Ô∏èüé©. 

       üé©",5
1085,Easy to use and well-designed: The mobile app is easy to use and well designed. You don‚Äôt need to get on a computer to use craigslist anymore. You can do it right from your phone.,5
1086,Craigslist: Apps works with no issues in my 5 usage days so far. I wish I could not get other areas housing info. I wish I could also search areas not listed & wonder - if I should even try to see if it‚Äôs possible - will try. Other than that‚Ä¶ all good,4
1087,Could be so much better: it's great but if someone gets their feelings hurt for not getting an item or having something held just for them they flag your post and boom it's gone then you have to post a couple more times but if you post too much craigslist automatically flags and removes your post without any explanation.,3
1088,"Sold!: Over the years I have sold many pieces of furniture on your website, thank you.  I do wish you had a better way of controlling the spam.  The search options also need some work.  Just trying to provide constructive feedback üòâ",4
1089,So good for selling: I like the app for posting items. So easy to upload pictures and keeping track of things. I still prefer using the online site for searching for items.,5
1090,"App Needs a messenger system, To easy to get scammed: Just got spammed on a couple different numbers tryin to scam me getting my personal info for cashiers check. Thankfully easy to spot, but it‚Äôs annoying I was getting piches immediately after putting up a listing. There‚Äôs no messenger system on the app or site and it‚Äôs super sketchy that the only way to communicate is through secure email OR through straight up texting.",2
1091,Sold item and gone within a half day: Good place to get rid of something in a hurry. Had no problems but only advice is to keep a couple emails from buyers Incase the other person falls through.,5
1092,"Good app with one giant flaw.: This app does what it advertises. But it drives me absolutely CRAZY that a left to right swipe takes me to the previous ad. Almost every very other app in the gd universe takes you BACK with that swipe. Please please please give us a left/right arrow for previous/next ad, and allow the swipe to take us back to the results list.",3
1093,"Rants for Ratings ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è: I have been using craigslist for many years and just downloaded and started using this new app. So far it‚Äôs working wonderfully well. It seems to be very easy to use.

1095,Quick response!: I usually receive one or more responses to an item I post within a day or two. I just sold a piece of garden decor for the full asking price.  A great way to sell quality items I no longer need.,5
1096,"Great free, community oriented app: I have been using Craigslist for a long time, buying and selling stuff (or giving away or getting ‚Äúfor free  stuff‚Äù) for years, and it never let me down. Also it is very useful for advertising services although I use it the most for buying and selling - urs great!",5
1097,"Review of Craigslist: I have used Craigslist several times.  Some things don‚Äôt sell, usually because it‚Äôs a common item and there are so many listed.  My last item, however, was a winner.  I posted it at 20:30 PM and it sold the following morning and I am thrilled!",5
1098,"The first place I would check: Craigslist has always been my first place I look when buying something used .I‚Äôve bought cars,sold cars here. Tools , furniture . Free stuff . No other place has Free Stuff . It‚Äôs great.",5

1100,"It‚Äôs giving what it needs to give: CL is my go to for housing and used goods. Never crashes or lags. Could crack down on the housing rental scams but that‚Äôs not a con, just come with the territory I guess. All in all, great app, great website, always on my phone.",5
1101,Does the job: App works fine in iOS.  Just wish cl saw the writing on the wall for mobile a long time ago before a majority of the cl users went with other options.,5
1102,"Craigslist is great, scammers are a part of online selling everywhere: I use Craigslist every day and there are only 2 improvements I wish they could make. 1)control scammers 2)not allow listings to expire. If they sent a monthly reminder to delete SOLD listings that would be great",4

On Craigslist, I got three replies within two hours, and three hours after posting, it‚Äôs gone ‚Äî and the new owners are very happy!",5
1104,"Cleaning House!: what more can you ask for, free online classified space, Ebay works great but it‚Äôs going to cost plenty, I‚Äôve been buying and selling on CL for 20 years and appreciate everything they provide, including great software, thanks / Brick NJ",5
1105,"If you‚Äôre serious about selling!: This app pretty much simplifies the chore of finding what you want or need in your area. Has been, by far, the easiest and user friendly app I‚Äôve used in a while!",5
1106,Craigslist is great but‚Ä¶: The app is good but I feel like CL could use some features to hide postings from certain sellers who are notorious over posters.  Sometimes I feel like I have to keep scrolling through the same guys ad over and over.   Otherwise CL is doing the lord‚Äôs work.,4
1107,"Excellent Sales Platform: I have used Craigslist for seeking needed items and for listing and selling items. For both purposes, Craigslist has been an excellent platform to use. It‚Äôs easy to use and I have achieved the intended results.",5

1109,Efficient! I like the Mobile app.: App works well through Gmail. Still haven‚Äôt found the way to use the Chat feature in the app though. There might be a way to do in-app messaging?,5

1111,Stick with what works :-): Everything that is needed and none of what is not. Great simple app for more efficiently utilizing craigslist from your phone.  Maintains the familiar experience you expect from craigslist and works reliably and consistently,5

1113,Worked as promised: Craigslist pretty straightforward so it serves as a vehicle to get your ad out to folks to see what you‚Äôre selling or giving away.  Within 15 minutes was getting responses abd sold within a day,5
1114,Very useful Free app in the market: The only app which doesn‚Äôt have tons of ads or like asking for payment and still does better jobs than most other platforms,5
1115,Response: When another person want to buy or ask questions about my product is difficult to replay the email I recieve is complicated and now show how to response the person right and direct,4
1116,"App wont take my pw that 'just' worked on the website: Your stupid app login asked for further verification after I tried my pw w my email. I entered the pw I literally just used on the website 'successfully.' Wont take it. Requires me to get an email link. Where am I supposed to enter the link received on an APP (vs a webpage)?? Why would I, how could I, use the app over the website?
Lousy app. Not sure why I am getting login  issue. Cant be bothered, will use website.",1

1122,"Who doesn‚Äôt love CL?!: This is my go to app to sell stuff, find housing, pets, and lot of other rando gear I can‚Äôt live without. From Power Riser Stilts to Gerbarian Shepsky‚Äôs‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve found most everything I‚Äôve thought up as well as selling my personal property. 
Thanks CraigsList App!",5
1123,Great: I‚Äôve been using craigslist from Louisiana to Florida for many years. Everything has always worked out exactly the way you see it and sometimes even better.,5
1124,Craigslist is a very user friendly app!: I sold some concert tickets within a couple of hours. Took about two minutes to list! Going to start using more often! üòÉ,5
1125,Good service but small concern: The app is very functional and easy to navigate compared to others. Only concern is when enter cell # I got text from State not even close to KY and concern of spam. Stayed w just Email in future. Thx for service.  Jim S.,5
1126,"Big green egg smoker/grill: We have never used Craig‚Äôs list before.
I was shocked that we had 2 responses in less than 10 minutes. It was sold and gone at our asking price in two hours.
We will be back - fabulous!!!",5
1127,Successful sale: Product is easy to list and make available for sale. No-brained to use before paying for other subscription based options.,5
1128,Suggestions: Cost of help wanted ads are too expensive. They loose their effectiveness after a day or two because they are pushed to the back. It would be nice to pay for an ad to come out on top every week or few days.,4
1129,"App works great and is much more efficient than browser: Well designed, easy to use and intuitive. I manage quite a few different listings, and this makes it easier.",5
1130,You have improved: Your app did have a problem with working with gmail but it looks like you fixed it. I have a iPad and it is working good with it.  I us Craig‚Äôs List a lot and glad they offer it free.  I do not have much money.  The app has helped me in many ways.    Thanks,4
1131,Better then selling on FB: I‚Äôve had more hits using craigslist over the years than anything else. Laid low from craigslist for a while until realizing where it was tried and true.,5
1132,Sold My Truck: Challenge with this site is the ability for folks to use multiple accounts - I was dealing with 3 different names and accounts but the same person.  Sold my truck regardless for what I was willing to let it go for.. but I prefer Facebook marketplace.,4
1133,"Super easy: You know, there are people who try to scam you. Its like that everywhere. But when u keep trying hard enough, a good person does usually come by when the product and price is right! Love it",5

1136,"Pretty good app-successful sales: I like the ease of seeing all items I'm selling in one place, and the private email function.   Listed stuff on Offer Up, Facebook Marketplace, and Craigslist.   Most items sold due to Craigslist buyers.   A bit clunky to upload photos.  App could use a refresh.",4
1137,"The update is great.: Lots more control, smoother functionality, and common sense layout and interface.  

I have used it for a few days now and am so glad that it feels good and seems to be one stop shop for my CL needs.",5
1138,First sale: I just sold my first item and the entire process was smooth. I will give this a great rating the only thing is I wish the app was sleeker like offer up or ebay. The looks won‚Äôt change me from using the app just always nice to dream a little.,5
1139,"Finally sold to real person after 4 weeks: Sold a bedroom set after 3 week of weeding out scammers, information hunters, and frauds. It‚Äôs difficult to weed out all the people trying to take advantage  -especially by new posters. I guess if u wait long enough and don‚Äôt answer anyone who won‚Äôt respond thru email, this can work.",4
1140,"Craigslist App: I love using this app! It‚Äôs way better than going on the site in my opinion. Everything is just much more user friendly and easy to navigate, I‚Äôd definitely recommend to anyone trying to make something happen tonight!",5
1141,Location zoning is better: Best part of this app us it‚Äôs still very simple but has very precise mapping compared to just picking cities. Idk why the other Craigslist clients are rated higher they are literally confusing. The beauty of Craigslist is it‚Äôs been practically the same since day one.,5
1142,"Works: Works well, you just have to return to the home page after a specific search if you want to change categories",5
1143,"Craigslist Team is Crushing it with this app: I‚Äôve been using Craigslist for something like 20 years. This app completely nails it. I‚Äôm rarely on a computer outside of work, so this app makes browsing local stuff for sale really easy.

I‚Äôm a fan!",5

1146,"Too many scammers.: They are vultures that try to build trust and a relationship. They try and convince you they are your friends and you have known them for 20 years with all kinds of creative options. As soon as seller payment mandates are established, they ghost you.",4
1147,"Craigslist ad worked great!: I had a pick up camper that I no longer needed and I listed it on craigslist and two days later it was gone!

Thank you craigslist for providing me an excellent spot to get rid of my truck camper canopy!",5
1148,"Ghoasted: I had someone that played with me all afternoon about coming‚Ä¶. He would say, I‚Äôll be there in 45 min, I am 14 min away etc.  I learned to only give out my address, if they give me their cell phone number. That worked. How can I report a person who does that?",4
1149,Constantly improving!: Way easier to navigate and user friendly than Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp. It‚Äôs never littered with advertising like those apps are. Just needs more people using the app!,5
1150,My car sold!: I posted my car on three different sites. I received the most inquiries from the Craig‚Äôs list post and the person who bought the car found it on Craig‚Äôs list.,5
1151,"Easier to post than the web: Craigslist was web-first, why am I installing an app? I like being able to pick images natively, and being always logged in. Creating a posting feels a bit cleaner than on the desktop.",4
1152,Short and sweet and it sells fast: I basically just post a picture and my phone number and if they want it they call I sell a lot of stuff on here I also buy stuff off here and resell it on here for more money.,5
1153,Useful app.: Lord knows Craigslist is probably not your general idea of a useful app.  But when ever I use it so sell an item it‚Äôs worked out well thankfully there are still good people in ABQ despite what the news may tell you.,5
1154,CL rules!: Best place to sell most things! I wish there was a way to post to surrounding areas in the same post to avoid having multiple listings of the same item. Other than that it‚Äôs awesome!,5
1155,"Get ‚Äòer done!: Whether we‚Äôre selling something, giving something away, having a garage sale or looking for something to buy Craigslist is my regular go-to.  There‚Äôs no other buy/sell/trade platform that compares!",5
1156,"Still a great bargain finder: After all these years, Craigslist is a handy app for finding great deals on everything from electronics to apartments. You just have to be careful of scams. If it seems too good to be true; it often is.",5
1157,"I wish for some updates: There are a lot of scammers. They need to start verifying accounts because there‚Äôs a lot of scammers. 
I wish there was an option to update all the posts at once instead of one by one. Other than that the app is great I‚Äôll update to 5 stars if craigs list makes some changes.",3
1158,"Works pretty good: I love Craigslist and the barebones web layout with searching possible 

The app tries to improve on an already successful implementation, and the end result is like ‚Äòtruth‚Äô: you detract from it the more you add. 

But it works fine for a cell phone when I‚Äôm away from the PC",4
1159,"I love Craigslist..: I do love Craigslist, and I have faithfully used it for years.
But! As the years have rolled by I have noticed that the number of scammers hoping to victimize all of us regular Joes on here has increased greatly.
 I know there‚Äôs no way to stop them completely. 
I just wish there was some way to prevent them from having it so easy.",3
1160,Amazing app for finding items that you need: I recently learned about this app. It is actually amazing ! I have almost furnished my house with many pieces we found here at incredible prices. We got lucky !,5
1161,"A good alternative for Facebook haters: If you have something that people want, they will buy it on craigslist. Easy to use app, I open it up every spring when we‚Äôre getting rid of stuff.",5
1162,"better than carvana or the dealers or the others: have a tentative sale (with a deposit) after just one afternoon of making a post and meeting the buyer.  
 
these days when the digital world mixes in with irl it can be a little scary and maybe make you paranoid, or fear for your own safety ‚Äî- but Craigslist has renewed my nostalgia for the classifieds and restored an old belief - its shown me that the person to person marketplace of yore still beats the new ways after all.

I feel like Michael Scott.

  ‚Äî satisfied customer",5
1163,So successful!: I have been able to clean out my house of unwanted furniture very successfully so far. I‚Äôm so glad these things are helping someone else and not clogging landfills. Plus the interface is easy and clear.,5
1164,"Getting better: With the last two postings I did I didn‚Äôt get one scam call, so craigslist is back on my list of how to sell stuff!! I would give you more stars (and I will when I have more experiences as these last few) but too many past experiences that I had to deal with people trying to scam me!",3
1165,No way to report post flooding: The app is good but now morons are flooding craigslist with the same post several times so when you check on your interest all you see is some idiots 30 posts for the same item. There is no way to report this in the app. I have tried to just report as prohibited but just get error message. This needs to be fixed.,2
1166,"The best: A great tool for selling and buying and trading. Be safe whenever interacting with complete strangers. Easy to use app as well, simple and well designed, if all apps were designed this respectfully the world would be a better place.",5
1167,"Umm, I sold something: Craigslist did what it was created to do. 
I sold a suitcase and Craigslist was so excited for itself, that they asked me to rate & give a review. 
Here you go Craigslist‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Good job being a website to sell things on and helping me sell something. 

Only 4 stars because this is obnoxious",4
1168,"Terrible app: The UI/UX for the app is a mess. It‚Äôs not merely dated and quaint like the perfectly acceptable web experience. It‚Äôs confusing, unreliable, and glitchy. 

My biggest gripe is with sign-in. Fields don‚Äôt register with iOS for autocomplete, so I can‚Äôt use 1Password to sign in without a back and forth app switching dance involving multiple Face ID runs. This is made worse by the app forgetting credentials/authentication frequently. 

It‚Äôs better to just use the website, even on mobile.",1
1169,"Pricing: Bummed about the charge for things now. I‚Äôm not sure what cost are or is Craig‚Äôs list just getting greedy, I use face book but really don‚Äôt like there plat form, but they don‚Äôt charge free is hard to beat. Saw a thing that the owner of Craig‚Äôs list is worth billions, kinda makes me wonder who‚Äôs really going to heaven including me. God Bless you guys, I have enjoyed Craig‚Äôs list.",3
1170,Good way to connect: It‚Äôs hard to find specific things through just your network of people and this site makes that so much easier,5
1171,Makes using Craigslist a breeze: I love the feature that lets you search a larger area. So much better than going city to city on craigslist. I think this program functions really well!,5
1172,"Success!: Great app, great site, I have always been successful selling things. Sometimes you just need the room or you have things that are just sitting around and craigslist is a great way to sell those items.",5
1173,"It was very successful: Thank you for letting me use this service 
I found a roommate in less than a week!!
I so appreciate the help with this and will definitely use it again and again",5
1174,"The good will prevail: Extremely satisfied. Easy to navigate, user friendly and very quick results. Unfortunately there are the scammers, scum of the planet that think money is highest almighty.  We honest folks participate in Craig‚Äôs list for the better of All",5
1175,"Easy selling: Love Craigslist! As one who is boycotting Facebook/Facebook Marketplace, this is the easiest way to sell things for me. The app is flawless and much easier to navigate than the website. Very glad they finally made an app!",5
1176,"Flagging: I like the app but do not appreciate the ease with which flagging occurs, with no explanation. I was flagged almost ten times and could not see why this occurred . It would happen almost immediately and I was very mindful of the rules of posting.",5
1177,Very good @ what they do: Craigslist has never failed me. Always came in clutch. Looking for a job several dollars above minimum wage? Bam. Looking to sell some stuff from your house? Boom. Craigslist over indeed any day when it comes to looking for jobs.,5
1178,"The way to go in Florida.: I‚Äôm helping my parents clear out their garage and craigslist has been the best channel for reaching the widest population to sell used garage stuff. That being said, there are a few specific places that craigslist could improve from a software development perspective.",4
1179,"Easy to use!: I live in a small town, and other internet sales options don‚Äôt have much on them. CL has an abundance of offerings, and not just items for sale. I‚Äôve never had a bad experience.",5
1180,Craigslist > Marketplace: Craigslist is still the easiest and most convenient way to buy and sell no matter what app you come across. I hope it never goes away and always remains available to use for free.,5
1181,"Easy to post and delete and GREAT results!: Been awhile since I‚Äôve posted an ad but was pleasantly surprised at how easy and quick it was. And I got GREAT results! My item would have sold first day if I HAD BEEN READY! 
I think the app is greatly improved since last posting. Thanks!",5
1182,"Victimizing data collection/data stealing and deceit.: There are a lot of scam adds and marketing metadata collection. It seems irritating to have wasted that however, short period. All adds should have phone contacts for quick connection and coordination.",4
1183,"First time post: Posted two items in one post and sold within days. I struggled a bit with how communication would work if I did not provide my cell number, but ot worked out fine. Received multiple inquiries and they didn‚Äôt go to my junk.",4

1185,"Studio Rental: Thanks again craigslist! Don‚Äôt know what we would do without you. Although we all have to be a little more cautious when using CL these days- overall the majority of CL users are reliable. Maybe one day, CL will develop a system to verify or rate users.",5

1188,Great app - fast & reliable: I‚Äôve used the CL app to buy a motorcycle and two scooters and countless pieces of furniture. It‚Äôs a no-brainer to have this on your phone if you ever want to buy something. I even use it when I‚Äôm at stores to get an idea of the price difference between ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúused‚Äù.,5
1189,"Best local selling app ever!: My parents or at that stage of needing to simplify their lives and did clutter.

1190,"Wonderful: I love how simple and useful the Craigslist app is.  I recently figured out to use the favorite button to keep track of items in interested in, or interested whether or not they sell quickly.  I love it.",5
1191,"Nice app: I barely can give any suggestions because i cant really think of any right off hand. I usually have all kinds of things to point out about apps and programs, but this app is pretty good. I cant lie.",5
1192,"They finally nailed it: After so many iterations and unofficial third party versions, we finally have an app that functions well! No more crashing! No more sketchy vibes. I also love the message feature!",5
1193,Tried and true platform: When you want to sell something f2f without losing over 20-25% of the money - Craigslist is the place to go. Disclaimer: it isn‚Äôt for ppl that are lacking common sense and/or street smarts. Be careful,5

1200,A lasting legacy of news and more: I love the platform that (occasionally) get a bad rap for being a dangerous site. More often than not I am successful. I use the site respectfully and get great results from its use. Keep up the great worküí•,5

1211,Craigslist in Nashville: User-friendly and mostly self-explanatory. I found it easy to post several items we are trying to get rid of because we are moving to Florida.,5
1212,CL has stepped up their game w/ this app: This used to be my Go To app for all searches but they seemed to ‚Äúlose their way‚Äù w/ usability the last couple yrs. but the latest refresh is really a good step up back to being a favorite for me.,5
1213,Sold My Fish Tank Pretty Fast!: Craigslist is still great for selling stuff. Only four stars because there are still a lot of scammers still not being weeded out or booted from the site. But if you are careful you can spot the fake ads and identify the scammers trying to get your private info.,4

1215,"4‚Äô bush hog: Craigs List does a good job with my listings, always successful. BUT, watch for scammers texts who generally have bad grammar wanting you to do a six digit confirmation number to ‚Äúprove you are real‚Äù. My experience are they are usually from outside your area codes.",5

The link directed me to a website, where I need to put in my SSN and credit card info, pay $1, and then can get the credit report. They looked like they were in a hurry, so I would suggest be really careful when using this app.",1

I give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating because there are a lot of scammers on the app so buyer beware!,4

I recommend 

I",5
1279,"Same crummy UX and outdated platform: Craigslist is well known for its inability to evolve, and it offers its users the same promise it always has: tomorrow‚Äôs Craigslist will be just as bad as yesterday‚Äôs. 

They finally managed to implement magic links, and sprinkled their particular brand of clunk to them. Pretty impressive considering that magic links were designed to make logins painless.

The mobile app seems to be unaware of its operating context and frequently logs you out. It wouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal if login for CL wasn‚Äôt straight out of 2002-i guess they worry you are using the app on a public ‚Ä¶phone?

Maybe one day CL will be thoughtfully designed‚Ä¶until then, you can rely on it being the same old clunky junk of yesteryear.",1

I have flagged a lot of these and craigslist allows the ads to continue, have never seen them take a single ad down despite clear violation of their ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù.

1390,"I love Craigslist: I may be showing my age, but I remember Craigslist being the place to go for deals on Saturday mornings. Facebook marketplace, offerup, let go, whatever trash out there pales in comparison with how great Craigslist was. Unfortunately people don‚Äôt use it as often anymore, I wish they would.

The app is great, everything a mobile app should be. You could argue it is a little late for it to have come out but that‚Äôs okay.

Let‚Äôs forget about Zuckerberg and still use CL.

1396,"What for scams: Immediately after posting received 3 offers from non local area codes wanting to buy the item by sending a cashiers cheque. And my inconvenience an extra payment of 10-20% will be made.

Selling items on the app has always been a success also.

Thank you for providing the forum to buy & sell.",5

1430,Sold quickly: Sold after being posted for two hours,5

1432,"Easy to use and star favorites: Easy app to use and search what I‚Äôm looking for and then save, star, what I like.  I just wish the contact email link would let default to my apple email app as I use outlook that is not linked to my apple account.",4

Is it easier than on a web browser? Yes
Can you save stuff you like? Yes

Thank you,",5
1446,"Scammers love this site!: I did sell my car on Craigslist, BUT the scammers (at least 7) were the first to respond.  PLEASE watch for unusual wording or misspellings from responders. 
DO NOT BUY OR PAY FOR A VIN HISTORY!
That was another scam. If someone wants that, tell them to buy one, and you‚Äôll reimburse them if they buy the vehicle.",4
1447,"Works great: The design is basic, no frills. But that never gets in the way of navigating a huge volume of ads. Searching is easy, filtering is intelligent, and I love how I can expand the search area by zooming out on the map.",5
1448,Sub-area filter does not work: The subarea filter works great on the web browser but appears to do nothing when I apply it in the app. I do searches and want to only see results in San Francisco but it appears to yield results for all of the Bay Area. I tried toggling this filter on/off which yields the same results either way.,3
1449,Easy to use: The Craigslist app resembles the original one from years ago but it is a lot more organized and less glitchy. Worked great for my latest sale.,5

1451,"Scammers: Craigslist is great for selling or buying but the scammers have gotten out of control. Craigslist you need to find a way to stop this. It‚Äôs really gotten out of hand. The ratio to scammers and actual real buyers is like 5:1. So people please be aware. Look for common signs of scammers like the copy paste of your posting title, asking you to email them, and bad grammar.",3
1452,"Better than nothing: Best thing is Craig‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt track everything you do on your phone, yet. Too many losers listing same item four, five, ten times a day. Should really get rid of owner and dealer options and replace with Pays sales tax and No tax. There might even be more scammers on this site than there are in Congress ‚Äî-maybe.",3
1453,"Easy to use!: I use the app on my phone, and it‚Äôs very easy to manage my listings or change them up a little if I want to. Intuitive, and allows me to do almost anything with my ads.",5
1454,Good but could be better.: One thing I would improve on CL is the ability to search for certain items Nationwide. CL has many great items on it. I hate having to do repeat searches all over the nation for an item,4

1481,Seek and Find or Sell: I‚Äôve had great success in finding unusual things otherwise difficult to locate. I‚Äôve also listed and sold unusual items such as old sailboat items.,5
1482,"It could be better!: I gave it four stars, because the one thing that is lacking, is the ability to exchange The search area with ease‚Ä¶. from area to area. If I am looking for a specialized item, I am willing to expand my range.",4
1483,Great App: It‚Äôs a great app. Especially I love the function that I can remove the posts that‚Äôs irrelevant to what I‚Äôm looking for to buy. I can‚Äôt do the same in eBay or Mercari so it‚Äôs quite useful. Some stuff is the best to be bought locally!,5
1484,Glad post succeeded: However I‚Äôm really disappointed in people and how many scammers there are on here. It‚Äôs really annoying and frustrating on how much of our time they waste. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm able to spot them immediately.,4

1497,Craigslist app is easy to use: All in all it is a very easy app to use I do however wish it had a few enhancement features such as more complex filtering options that could be saved and set up as hot buttons.,4
1498,Good but could be better: Would be nice if had notification in the app itself that I got a message. I missed a sale when busy moving. Too much emails to check and can‚Äôt check daily when busy.,4
1499,Reasonable App!: The only complaint I have is that Craigslist now charges a fee to make a post in some categories but I can somewhat understand because of all of the (businesses) taking advantage of Craigslist and posting 1000 post when it was all free.,4

people - the second bought it and paid cash!!",5

Recently listed a room in my apartment as I‚Äôve done many times in the past and whatever combo of automated spam detection, over zealous community members and paid flagging services, I‚Äôve lost a week trying to get a very simple, very innocuous and easily verifiable post to go live. Really really really disappointed that this formerly radical institution is now corrupted by pay to play and algorithms.",1

1574,"Can‚Äôt mark as sold: Would be better to be able to mark as sold; so, people interested can look it up and see as sold, deleting just makes it disappear which is frustrating",4
1575,"Reasonable value: The app is easy to use and listing an item is simple enough. The reason the rating is a 4 and not a 5 is due to the lack of a ‚Äúviews counter‚Äù. It would be very simple and extremely low cost to add to their capabilities. And, it would aid the seller and improve the overall experience",4
1576,Better than expected: Iam able to sell most of my bikes through this platform.  Although occasionally I do have to be careful with scammers.  But overall this app is pretty effective.,5
1577,"Finally an App...thx: I do believe some tweaking would be nice. In my case hunting for apartments. Having an option for small, medium, and large dogs would make searching easier than having to go to their page to find out small dogs only. I have a large dog. It‚Äôs annoying.",4

1581,Criagslist App is Fantastic: Refreshing in a time that scams are all you see on suckerturds fakebook! I used ebay exclusively and then craigslist exclusively until market place but now mktplc is filled with only scams! So glad to see craigslist has a wonderful app! I'm back to enjoying it,5

1593,"Good but could be better: Dirty tactics like flagging competition make this marketing platform nearly impossible to use. I love craigslist and always have but people are really able to explain it, and they have done a little to prevent that.",4
1594,What happened to free?: I guess I can see the point of charging five bucks to post something. That way you don‚Äôt get everybody and their mother posting things that aren‚Äôt real for sale lol my ad worked so that‚Äôs the best outcome ever in five bucks is reasonable,4

1596,"Real Good but one huge problem: To have the app is really good. You just open the app and you‚Äôre in Craigslist.
It has one really huge problem that wrecks it.

When you use the app and you want to reply to contact somebody, it gives you an e option to email, but no text or call option.
I
When you open your web browser and go to the same ad, you have a choice of texting or calling.

I Have missed out for months only to find they do have a phone or a text. I just didn‚Äôt have it using the app. Maybe I missed a setting somewhere or something and it‚Äôs my fault but I can‚Äôt find it.",2

1608,Best idea the internet creators have ever made for impowering people to be their own marketplace: My suggestion is to separate the individual sellers from the business sellers so the line between is clear and bright.,5
1609,Love this app: I was very happy when I discovered this app. It lets me do everything with my ads without having to be on my computer. I find it very user friendly too.,5

1624,Quick Craigslist Posting Option: I find it a lot easier to post with this app than the Craigslist mobile website :^),5
1625,The app is awesome. People are stupid: I put a post up for a room mate. Had a lot of hits. But one thing I found funny was the amount of military couples looking to rent my room. Dose the military not make enough money to have their own place?,5

1630,Unreliable people for the gigs jobs: Large amount of Unreliable people for the gigs labor üí™ü§£they say yes take the job and then they never show up for the job.  Your company (Craigslist) should have a way to leave reviews for the work received!!! That way people will at least make the effort to show at work to avoid bad reviews and be know as an irresponsible person and no one will wait their time with them.,1
1631,"Love it - but‚Ä¶: Great app ‚Ä¶ so glad to have it instead of the browser view, but still wish you could expand your search more broadly than 250 miles.",5
1632,Would be better without all the scammers!!: It‚Äôs really hard to use the app to find housing when almost anything you click on that looks affordable is a scam!!!! It seems like they‚Äôd have have figured some someway to keep to keep the scammers off the site and especially the app now!!‚Äô,3
1633,Still better than FB market place: Used both platforms to sell my car and I even boosted my post on FB. First person to test drive it from CL bought it that day.,5
1634,"Enlarged Images do not Load: Only the thumbnail images load in listings, clicking on each one does not load the large image. At least one can still open the listing in their browser to review. Otherwise a great version of CL for your mobile device.",3

1636,"Sold !: I‚Äôve had good luck. My phone pretty much explodes whenever I post stuff to sell. I do get scammers saying that they are interested, but they need to verify me first. They want me to go to a website and jump through hoops. IGNORE THEM, AND ALWAYS ASK FOR CASH, and you can‚Äôt go wrong. üëç",5
1637,"Love it!: Easy to use application. Well designed. Particularly like the ability to move your search area on the map, enlarging or making it smaller. Craigslist is awesome, and this app makes it even better, more accessible!",5

1644,CL has been useful but‚Ä¶..: I can‚Äôt even remember how long I‚Äôve been using CL but it has been very helpful in finding what I‚Äôm looking for with the only issue I‚Äôve found is most of the posts seem to be scammers just looking for data to steal but those are easy to spot and eliminate.,3
1645,"Craigslist is still relevant: As far as I‚Äôm concerned, Craigslist is the best kind of place for community stuff, and buying and selling things locally. No ads, no algorithms, a small piece of the more honest internet we used to have. It has some problems, but they are mainly due to exploitation of the site. 
People put up free stuff on here! Just to get rid of instead of wasting! It‚Äôs great! 

It‚Äôs simple, and it works. 

Be careful though, obviously. 
Use it to enrich your communities!

1654,App is dumb: First off. I make a post following all the rules. It gets flagged. Not only does the post get flagged. But it doesn‚Äôt even tell you why it‚Äôs flagged. It posted from different devices new accounts samething just keep getting flagged without telling you why. Craig‚Äôs list used to be the spot for selling things with ease.
