2,2024-09-02T16:46:14.070000+0000,Last Cleanout Bag Results! : r/ThredUp,"A few months ago I went ahead and did a cleanout after being disappointed by my last results. I reframed my thinking on it. It's not a huge return on worn clothing, never would have been for me, and I get the benefit of shipping it away. I have always used the credit anyway, seeing it as a ""many things out, a couple things in"" kind of rule. My first goal is less stuff and second if I can get a little out of it for me.
My designer stuff goes to a local store. If they pass on it for condition or style, I try another consignment store. After that, I consider giving it away in my community, to a local thrift, or to ThredUp. I chose return assurance in this bag because I had some nice things and also a couple things that I thought if they passed I'd just get it back and give it away.
It definitely got me reexamining why I wanted to keep wearing things even though I hadn't in a long time. Vince sweater my late mom bought and I inherited. Cute Miu Miu button down shirt I had owned and worn forever from a consignment shop. The sweater, nice as it is, just did not get enough wear in my closet. The shirt was getting small for me. It got easier to let go.
Anyway, I packed a box maybe just a few hairs over their max dimensions and by the time I culled some things from it I got it down to about 31 pounds. I wanted to maximize my shipment and ended up wheeling it into the post office on a hand cart.
When the Pont Sur and Juicy dresses were expiring I contemplated getting them back--but why? I had liked the Pont Sur dress but not enough to wear it more and the Juicy dress was cute but had gotten tight on my shoulders.
Note: the no earnings is from the return assurance, I got all of those back.
Would I do it again? Probably, yeah. I'm happy with what I got out of it. It was convenient and I have 31 pounds less of clothing in my wardrobe. I shop much less these days and seeing the things that were impulse buys go has made me more thoughtful about hitting that checkout button. Nearly all of the things I sent in had been worn and taken care of for quite some time.

26,2024-08-24T20:42:13.069000+0000,My Experience Selling With ThredUp : r/ThredUp,"Writing this to convey my experience and address the question: Is selling on ThredUp worth it?
While I don’t believe that ThredUp is a “scam,” or that it otherwise tries to “trick” sellers, I do believe that it's very difficult to get the kinds of returns on your used items that you would get if you sent them to The Real Real, took them to consignment, or listed them yourself on eBay, Depop, or Poshmark. A few likely reasons: the $14.99 listing fee, the crappy photography, the short amount of time items are on the site, and the endless “promos” that plunge prices, for which sellers, not the site, take the hit.
Here was my experience. It may not be yours.
First week of June I sent 15 items to ThredUp, all of them in excellent condition, no flaws. All popular mid-market brands, including M. Gemi, Vince, Marie Oliver, Frame Denim, Zara, and James Perse. My kit was processed and put up for sale four weeks after arrival. Two of my 15 items were rejected (I wasn’t told why) and were therefore “donated” to ThredUp because I neglected to click the “Return to Me” button when I signed up. 
Six items eventually sold, all together totaling just enough to cover the $14.99 Clean Out Kit fee, with $1.24 left over. I chose not to reclaim four of the remaining seven items. The other three I reclaimed for $5.99 each plus $10.99x2 for shipping (because of the staggered deadlines). In total, I PAID $39 to “sell” six items on ThredUp, and that doesn’t include the loss of the items that were rejected and the items I chose not to pay to reclaim.
I have been selling my closet cast offs for years, and I’d say 90 percent of the stuff I’ve listed on eBay, Posh, and TRR or taken into consignment has sold. And the stuff that didn’t sell I got back at no charge. It didn’t cost me nearly $6 per item and $10.99 in shipping to “reclaim” or lose them forever to God only knows where. 
 It was an . . . interesting . . . experiment. But not one I’d repeat.

Filter out brands (so I never see another piece of Shein or LulaRoe again)
Improve color selection feature (Predominantly gray and black items come up in my searches for any patterns even if I don't select them for colors...and for the love of God, why teal? Why? WHO over there loved teal so much? Six tertiary colors and you picked teal. SMDH)
Give measurements for sweaters and coats.
Stop saying fabric details unavailable when it's on another tag in the item 99% of the time.
Give a flat fee price for everything cheap fast fashion, and put it on sale one day a month--if it's Shein, LulaRoe, Walmart, or Target, just make it $5. And make it $3-4 one day a month. No returns on items $5 or less. Boom. All that stuff will move through your warehouses FAST and people will buy a lot more items at once. The bundles will be bigger. You could probably get away with listing these items with the size and no other description, because people know how the garments in these brands fit, and they know what kind of fabrics are used.

I've been shopping on thredup for myself for years with not many issues, but a little over a year ago I started a business which involves reselling. Shopping every order at thrift shops become overwhelming, so I started sourcing from thredup for most of my orders. For a while it was great, but over the past 6 months it's pretty much become more trouble than it's worth.
I am constantly receiving items in ""excellent condition"" with holes or stains. And it's gotten to about a 30% chance of my order having cancelled items, which then means I have to go shop for a similar item in person who the order ends up not saving me time. I have to hardcore inspect every item because I've been packing up orders only to find a huge hole at the last minute. It's just so frustrating how enshitification is striking them as well as every other company these days.

It sounds like Thredup is trying to have an option similar to Poshmark or Mercari, and it is waitlist only for now. I wonder if they're planning on setting up a separate section of the site, I imagine the pictures will be all over the place and it won't work with bundles.
The excerpt from Thredup:
Create your listing: Take photos of your item, add the brand, size, quality, price, and any special details. Your item stays listed until it sells, or you unlist it.
Ship Item to Customer: Once your item sells, use the pre-paid shipping label sent via email.
Earn Credit to Shop or Cash Out: There are no selling fees, so what you earn is yours to keep for all items listed yourself.

I'm pretty upset because I put some of my big ticket items in this bag and when I responded to the email they left me hanging. I never expect to make a ton with these kits, but I couldn't believe this response. Anyway – does anyone have any advice or a useful email for customer support? Has this happened to anyone else?

*they will reach out to the person and advise them to buy or release the item. The person is given 24 more hours to buy so a total of 72 hours minimum they can hoard it. Longer if nobody complains
*they will add it to my cart if it gets released in 24 hours and email me—unclear if they’ll put it in my cart earlier if it’s released before the deadline
*they do not offer the option to use a coupon with auto purchase and agent didn’t answer my question on a refund if auto purchase is used
*I pointed out the item I’ve been watching has 53 likes and the discount code has increased from 25% to 30% during the hoarding period, causing thredup and the seller to lose money.

64,2024-08-05T15:14:48.730000+0000,ThredUp should have an alternative for reclaiming items : r/ThredUp,"Right now the only option when an item in a cleanout bag expires is to pay $5.99+$10.99 shipping to get it sent back or forfeit it completely.
I wish they had a third option of a discounted buyout. That would benefit both ThredUp and the seller.
For example, I have a designer item that has expired. The item was stale in my Poshmark closet and the thought of spending nearly $20 to get it back to relist is not ideal.
If ThredUp offered me $10 for this item (retail $400+), I would take it in a heartbeat.
I just feel like tons of people have inventory that they don’t necessarily want back, but it feels icky to simply donate them for free to ThredUp.
Even if it was as simple as ‘reclaim for $5.99 or earn $5.99 by selling to us for immediate payout.’
Thoughts?

All they know is that when the mannequin measurement is mentioned, the mannequin used has a different size than the tag size.
So I put random listings that had the mannequin size into a table to try to estimate the mannequin sizes. Then, based on the fact that a listing's tag size ≠ mannequin size, I ordered them all by bust, then tried to assign possible sizing to similar mannequin measurements. I took the average of each postulated size, and ended up with the results below. It's only for tops so far. There were some weird ones, but...well, I tried :) It's just a fuzzy guideline so we have SOMETHING to go off on.
Working on the bottoms, but the table below will be updated when I'm done. I hope it helps some!
Size: Bust-Waist-Hips [Length] So if on the listing, the mannequin measurements are NOT stated in the Measurements section, then you can assume the mannequin will prroooobably match the tag size, and that it's measurements are:
XXS: 31-26-30 [22]
XS: 32-22-31 [24]
S: 33-23-32 [26]
M: 34-24-34 [28]
L: 36-25-36 [28]

First off, you should know you won't get rich selling your used clothes. If you want better money for your stuff, find a consignment event like Rhea Lana and consign your items there. (But even consignment events will pull clothing off racks if it's stained, or missing buttons or out of style more than 3 years or so.) Also it is possible online sites like Thredup do fudge a lot and don't pay out as much as they should for items. They have other sources of clothing besides people who sell them their used clothing.

I then realized immediately that out of the two black bags , I ordered the wrong one bc they didn't specify which bag was which size in the info I could see in the cart and I have low vision.
So I tried calling them. One number rang dead number. The other number gave me some computer repair voicemail so I hung up.
I emailed ThredUp and said please cancel the order so I can order the other bag. No response for three days until I received a notification from TU that the bag was shipped. After that I received a reply to my email saying so sorry its shipped, nothing we can do but you can return when it arrives. Ok, so I was trying to save us all the hassle of going through returns process but this is how they apparently do it.
So on to my question. Does ThredUp do this to everyone with shipping?
From the time they told me it had shipped, all I could get from them was this page that said it had shipped using a parcel delivery service Ive never heard of, called GLS, on a weirdly formatted page that I never could get to show me the whole thing. It kept saying they would be giving me tracking info but never changed from that.
Today I got a notification from USPS that my pkg is being delivered today. I am assuming its the TU pkg but I dont have any real idea bc TU has still never updated their tracking info.
Is this the way ThredUp typically operates when you buy from them? Do they use this GLS for everyone's pkgs and then turn into USPS? Do they fail to update tracking for everyone, or was my experience a fluke?
These stories of receiving moth eaten items is really scaring me. That combined with this whole shipping situation makes me think twice about ever purchasing from TU again, unless it was a fluke.
Thanks for your helpful replies.

But I have about 150 pounds of clothing to try to rehome that I just won’t be able to resale. I don’t want to overwhelm the thrift so I will probably try to break it down by size and give away. Anyhow, about 50 pounds (estimate) is resellable as in relatively current season, and good brand. Would I do it again? Probably not. It is a lot of excess for me to sort through upcycle and rehome. And some items sadly I feel just will never find a home, aside from a textile recycler. I hear the 15 item boxes are much better. Anyhow, these were my top highlights:
Vintage Betsey Johnson Dress (beautiful) Silk Theory Romper (current season - this blew my mind) Frame denim Bermuda shorts (current season) DVF pants and DVF silk dress 2 Lily Pulitzer tops Vineyard Vines dress (current season) Djerf Avenue flowy skirt (beautiful) Cinq a sept NWT beautiful red blouse Faherty linen dress Tory Burch Cardigan sweater Madewell blazer (new)

99,2024-07-24T19:31:47.448000+0000,My experience listing over 200 items on Thredup. Made little under $140 : r/ThredUp,"Just wanted to write about my experiences selling on ThredUp in case anyone is curious about sending items to this company. I recently sent in 200 items to ThredUp because I was clearing out a family member's estate. She was a big fashion person and collector and had a ton of NWT and mid tier to low-designer items. Most of the items sent were ""brand names"". Multiple Ugg shoes, Tory Burch flats, Coach flats, Tory Burch boots, Aritzia, etc etc. Many were rarely worn and in excellent condition.
Pros:
ThredUp was a life saver in my specific situation. I only had a week to sell everything that my family member owned because I had flown in and taken time off of work to help. I hosted a multi-day estate sale, but still had hundreds of pieces left (she was kind of a collector/hoarder). ThredUp was great because we were able to just put everything into moving boxes and just ship them off.
Cons:
I also sell on Depop casually and it's actually insane how much ThredUp takes from you. I think they offer customers discounts and then take it out of your payout. Sooo many pieces got payouts for 0.50-3 dollars, which meant that with the $15 handling fee, some of my boxes ended up making nothing. They also tried to charge me $6.00 to get each piece back, which made me realize that the sellers are the customers on ThredUp lol.
I understand the reasoning behind only allowing 30-45 days for an item to sell, but it's really not ideal for sellers. It seems like ThredUp will sell the items after they expire and take the money after. That gives them an incentive to make sure that the items expire. Since they control the algorithm, they can potentially boost expired items and give steeper discounts to customers, which pushes down the willingness to buy non-expired items that don't have such high discounts. Just a theory!
Overall, I would not sell on ThredUp again. I wish they would take like a percentage of sales instead of the $15/box handling fee. They also take a huge chunk of the listing price. Even without the flat fee I don't think I would have made a ton more because of how many pieces sold for under 5 dollars.
But, to ThredUp's credit, the selling experience was extremely convenient at a truly hectic period in my life. Selling clothes is a LOT of work, especially when you have boxes and boxes of them. I'd recommend selling to ThredUp if you're trying to get rid of stuff as quick as possible.

101,2024-07-24T16:41:03.674000+0000,Threadup is collecting PER ITEM fees up front before an item sells - is that legal? : r/ThredUp,"I would like people's opinion on this - I used the consignment pro program and I paid $35 for the kit fee. How it works is - I select which items are pro then it is $15 per item to make it ""pro"" They say that I receive 100 percent of the payout for a pro item.
So when some of the items started to sell I see that there are fees of $155 for the kit. The fees must be satisfied before I receive a payment. I sold a $75 pair of sneakers that I designated as ""pro. I was supposed to get 100 percent of the $75 But I got zero money. So I contacted them. What they said is the $15 fee for each item that you select as ""Pro"" is then charged to your sales that you make from the whole kit, pro or not. So they are collecting a $15 whether or not your item sells. Does this sound legal to you? I told them, You can't charge me $15 before an item has sold. There's nothing to charge against. There's no sale of the item and I should not be paying the fee out of the sales of my other items that I am not paying a $15 fee for. I do believe that I was part of a beta testing program for this type of clean out kit, I remember I received an invitation asking if I wanted to participate in the beta program. But still, it seems really not correct. . I am waiting to hear back from them.

Even if I just got an email notifying me a new item and then I go in and purchase that item, I’ve had them cancel my order and tell me they can’t locate the item. I find that hard to believe since the item was just recently added to their inventory. I think they just make errors and pricing and if they see that someone’s gotten something for a really good deal they just pretend they can’t find it and then they relist it later. I definitely saw one of the items that I purchased that they claimed they couldn’t find, relisted a couple weeks later for a higher price.

108,2024-07-22T07:57:22.442000+0000,goodbye thredup : r/ThredUp,"just placed my last order. I will not be buying from TU again.
first, the prices are way too high. ex. TU sells used, shitty, polyester shein products for $20+. in what world? completely worn out luxury brand items that need a funeral for few hundreds. it sucks to buy cheap brands, it sucks to buy high end brands.
second, return is shit. restocking fee for every item is unheard of, for smaller or larger brands. TU sells USED so the restocking is much easier. they already have the product data as well. plus, the return fee over $10? get out of here.
third, the unreliable price fluctuations. they always have a 'sale' going on but it is an excuse to change prices. just now, my cart increased $20 when promo code changed from HOT60 to HEAT.
fourth, negligence for authentication and quality control. I have already seen multiple, obvious fakes. I have received a truly horribly modified item, obviously not disclosed. a friend received a fake purse with gunk inside. sucks to buy known brands.
fifth, lack of info. pics of front and back with measurements for used items do not make sense. buyers need to know detailed info, especially because it's used. the picture quality are crap too. cannot even ask sellers Qs.
I can go on.
it's bad for buying low end fast fashion (price too steep), known brands (non existent authentication), and high end brands (fakes, unreasonable price for condition).
for any item, it is extremely risky, as details are not disclosed, and if unsatisfied, good luck paying return shipping and restocking fee!
many buyers might choose to forgo the return option due to the associated costs. then, TU is creating more environmental harm than contributing to sustainability. out of their warehouse, but now sitting in another person's closet (or somewhere in the back).
I have spent more than $300 on TU. my conclusion is that I am better off with buying from poshmark, local thrift stores, or new. I am left with only a few items that fit, bunch that do not or are breaking apart, and loss of cash from returning/restocking.
the idea was great but the execution needs improvement. some suggestions for TU, as a goodbye courtesy..
price fairly. seriously, get real. use AI to do market price check.
find a way to make shipping cheaper. you have enough shipping volume to negotiate.
get rid of restocking fee. at least reduce it to per order.
do not make prices so different across promo codes. fluctuation should be less than $5 IMO.
do not handle brands you cannot quality control or authenticate. selling counterfeits is illegal.
take pics of insides (where most od my problems arose). disclose item model number if available on tags.
use better pictures.
allow buyers and sellers to chat. it will not make them trade outside TU. give buyers a chance to question.
well then, it's a goodbye. will not be returning..

111,2024-07-20T21:58:47.566000+0000,I have a love/hate relationship with ThredUp - I am wondering if they will eventually kick me out. Do they do that? : r/ThredUp,"I love getting free shipping with the bundle thing. It saves so much money as opposed to buying single items from eBay or Poshmark, etc.
I like the way the search helps me narrow down what I am looking for, and that I find stuff for super cheap, and have re-vamped my wardrobe substantially since finding out about TU.
I very much dislike the disappointment factor when the box (finally) arrives. I am currently waiting on them to consolidate my order and get it to me, I expect to wait about a week. That's fine, that I wait, since I didn't pay for shipping, I don't expect them to overnight it to me. But when I get the box, I rip into it like a kid on Xmas morning, and... often almost every item is ""not as described""... either the measurements are completely off, the fabric is not at all what was stated (the tag proves it), which is a big deal for me, or the picture was taken in such a way that relevant features of the item were not accurately described, and it looks very different than the picture. Even the size could be misrepresented. Sometimes they put the pictures backwards, and the front was the back... but most often, the item is in much worse shape than stated, and I hold their feet to the fire on this.
I hate high-water pants. If they say the inseam is 30.5"" I consider that to be the minimum I can wear, but often they are off by an inch or more. Don't they have measuring tapes? They are often off on the rise, as well, and the waist is completely a crap shoot.
Within 10-15 minutes, as a general rule, I have a pile of what is unacceptably unlike the description, once it was EVERY ITEM. Sometimes they are ""final sale"". I get on the chat support and copy and paste the listings and tell them to put them on the return list, and they do it. Once in a while they just refund an item.
I'm nice about it, but I think if enough people were to do what I do, perhaps they would be a little more careful about measuring, grading, and fabric content, and PICTURES. Why do they put white shorts against a white background? You can't even see it. They could have a gray board for that, don't you think?
Anyhow, I'm venting, but I have had some incredible finds on there, too. Stuff that is very vintage, barely if ever worn, and just gorgeous material... and often very inexpensive. At this point, at least 60% of the clothes in my closet are from ThredUp, and I'm getting to the point where it is hard to justify getting more clothes, so I guess if they kick me off there, it's okay, since I don't really need any more clothes.
If I can clearly tell that the description is wrong (such as they call something 31"" long a ""top"" when it's clearly a ""dress"" - I just buy it as a dress, and don't complain about it) I don't consider that a problem, since I already knew it. I even cancel items before they ship if I find a deal breaker on it in the interim.
Sometimes I feel like I'm ThredUp's worst Karen. Can I speak to the manager, please? Sometimes I feel sorry for the chat person who has to deal with me and my nitpickiness.
If I had expensive clothes to sell, I would never trust them to do it, based on their ineptitude at describing and measuring things.
Who else holds them accountable for their failure to properly present the items as they actually are? I see people on here complain but they say they just accepted it, and I don't do that...and you don't want to be my waitress if they cook is not doing their job, either, by the way. LOL.

I was recently notified that the first bag I sent in April was lost. I gave it a pass because for some reason, the post office was having some issues in my area at the time. I just received a notification that my second bag is now being delayed.
I'd honestly rather have a yard sale or donate to Goodwill than knowing my clothes are somewhere in the deep abyss. Clothes that held memories that no longer fit or even ones that didn't but still could have given me a return on my investment.

I was keeping a look out for the email letting me know my stuff was posted. Didn't see anything. I finally logged into my account and saw a couple of the women's pieces were posted. When I reached out to CS they said they don't take men's clothes and donated it all. I'm so annoyed. I would have paid $10 to get it all back and consign it myself. Anything I can do or is it a total loss?

After I placed the items in my cart, the price jumped by several dollars - on all 3 items. It was instant. Example: The handbag had been listed at $15, after I placed in my cart it jumped to $20. This is called bait and switch and is considered a form of sales fraud. I am very disappointed with thredup.

These are dark wash and look to be mid-rise boot cut:
100% spandex
Palazzo, blue, dark wash, boot leg cut, high rise waist
These are dark wash and look to be low-rise straight leg:
98% cotton, 2% spandex
Kick flares, marled, tortoise, argyle print, grid, tweed fabric, chevron/herringbone pattern, chevron, blue, medium wash, dark wash, straight leg cut, low rise waist
These are dark wash and look to be high rise, perhaps skinny leg, and as the others, a size 6, but look at the sizing:
98% cotton, 2% spandex
Boyfriend, marled, grid, tweed fabric, blue, dark wash, medium wash, boot leg cut, mid rise waist
30.25"" Inseam, 8.75"" Rise, 42.5"" Waist

138,2024-07-10T10:57:15.048000+0000,First Experience Selling—What's Up With Details? : r/ThredUp,"Hi all,
I'm a longtime, experienced seller of my cast off clothing, shoes, and accessories on Postmark and eBay. But, wow, sooooo much work. So I decided to give ThredUp a try. Yes, the payouts are small in comparison, but it's pretty much zero work on my part.
I got an email this morning that my items have been processed and I have 24 hours to edit. They accepted all thirteen of my items, no no issues there, but, wow, their descriptions are lousy and their sizing, if it even exists, confusing. The listings of two of my blouses are completely wrong. One is a flow silk top and the bust is listed as 32"". There's no way, I'm a 36C cup and it wouldn't have fit me in the first place if it was. And they didn't even bother to list measurements on two items where it would really matter: a pencil skirt and a blazer.
Worse yet, I can't make changes. I went in to change a pair of beautiful platform sandals by a name brand because their description is ""Material Unknown,"" when they are clearly leather (both vegans and non will want to KNOW THAT!), but it won't accept my change.
Is this pretty much SOP for this site?
If so, I'm just going to give up on online resale platforms and stick with local consignment store and Goodwill.
Thanks for your input!

As soon as I clicked payment method the website froze. After that it crashed. Wasn’t able to go back to payment. Had no other choice but to refresh. “Sold out” So here is my question. Do you think sneaker-bots are being used to grab all the popular boxes? If so why doesn’t ThredUp do something about this?
First of all they don’t let us know specific time and date of restocks. You have to spend your day refreshing and waiting for their restocks. Goodwill Bluebox derma to really care about their customers. They restock each Friday @6:00 est. no mystery and no time wasted constantly refreshing. Goodwill blocks sneaker bots also. What’s your opinion?

141,2024-07-08T20:57:07.293000+0000,Is it common for ThredUp to cancel your order? : r/ThredUp,"I bought a pair of sandals yesterday after upwards of 5 hours searching for the right kind for an upcoming vacation where I'll be walking a lot. I was so excited to find a pair on ThredUp (in my size!), used the 45% code, and reveled in my blessed life.
This afternoon I got an email informing me that my order was canceled because the item couldn't be found in their warehouse. Devastated is a strong word maybe, but I'm certainly so disappointed?? I spoke to a customer service rep who assured me that I could use the discount on my next order (who knows), and they said it's possible that the shoes may appear on the site again when the stock updates in 1-3 days. Does anyone have any experience with this? Am I absolutely out of luck? So bummed!
UPDATE: Thanks for all of your suggestions and encouragement, I've been refreshing the search a few times a day and they were relisted today! For $10 cheaper!! Trying not to get my hopes up, but definitely crossing my fingers.
