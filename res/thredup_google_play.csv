0,"this app is trash. i would shop here more if that weren't the case but i get annoyed after 10 minutes of use and usually just go to depop or something. it's SO buggy, slow, and pages sometimes just don't load.",2
1,I sent them 46 items and made 0.6.,2
2,"Unable to see the full list of available items, it only lets me scroll through about 40 images and then stops. I tried uninstalling and re-installing, still a problem. I gave up and went to a local store to find what I needed instead.",1
3,"Service is good but the app is complete garbage. Issues sorting, purchasing, changing from tabs, finding items, loading, crashing.",1
4,The new update is so frustrating,1
5,What is with this $5 donations for what you send them??? Are they about to fail so can't even allow us to get merchandise for what we send? Their chat room ignored me when I asked if their Dun & Bradstreet credit rating had been downgraded.,5
6,"When trying to search for a brand you can only type in the first letter,say I want to look up Margaritaville you are only able to place in the m.",2
7,"Initially impressed at the selection and prices, that all went out the window when I got my order. One pair of pants had been labeled my size on the app, but when I got them, they weren't even close to my size! Despite this being their mistake, I still had to pay the restocking fee and the options to return are atrocious. I opted for the site credit figuring I could find something else, but now can't even get close to just spending the credit amount.",2
8,"Please make ""new with tags"" a searchable condition! I don't like used/pre-worn clothing at all. But I do like items that are NWT. It is not easy searching for these items.",3
9,"DO NOT send them anything. Their list of ""ineligible for payout"" brands is MASSIVE-- which they don't warn you about. Then, the stuff they do ""payout"" for they charge fees against, so you get NOTHING! To put salt in the wound, they show you how much theyre selling everything for. In our case they are selling everything we sent in for well over $200, but they ""gave us"" $6... which doesn't cover the fees... so we get nothing.",1
10,"Edit: they have updated the app. It works much better. I miss the ability to search for new with tag items. I have received items that were marked as excellent condition which were only good. Overall, I like it. It's a great concept, and I found some cool things, but the app only works %50 of the time. It's very laggy and sometimes it doesn't load.",4
11,Searches won't load and the app glitches a lot. Really frustrating,1
12,So why is this a sexist app? So adult males can't use this? Pretty offensive if you ask me...,1
13,"They get sizing wrong they put kids with women, I sent in 4-5 big boxes of clothes some nwt/never worn and ""higher end"" brands, almost nothing was picked, I was getting CENTS for them. App lags still Update coupons dont work it says coupon has changed but I'm still within the time frame I'm allowed to use it, if I send in clothes now I get to pick where $5 will go to charity. I used to love thredup, I used to work there. Now my opinion is be cautious. Have a yard sale instead of sending in stuff",2
14,Easy to use!,5
15,"Great concept l, works well on laptop. App is glitchy. On the app not all items load, there is no option to advance to subsequent pages. So you see less options. Jump on a desktop or laptop and use url the options are almost limitless. Fox the app.",3
16,"Absolute scam Do NOT send your clothes in. I sent athleta leggings and they didn't show up on my selling page, so I pm'd them asking why, they replied oh we have plenty of them. Then why wouldn't you send a list out with what you're not taking? And they don't send them back!The clothes they took I would get about $1-4 per clothing item, but guess what you have to pay them a fee, so 4 of my clothing items sold, but didn't meet the $18 fee, so guess who didn't get paid? Donate or eBay your clothes",1
17,Excellent app! Super buys!,5
18,"Newest update no longer sorts saved searches by ""newest first"" when choosing to sort by newest; it's just some different recommended items, not the newest ones. This, along with the fact that the last few updates only allow me to see the first couple pages of a saved search make finding things impossible and frustrating, even when just browsing.",2
19,Love what I've gotten so far.,5
20,I love thredup. I've been shopping with thredup for many years and it's how I get most of my clothes. But this app has its issues. These are the issues I have had over the course of using the app: unexpectedly crashes; shopping cart timers glitch; pay button takes multiple tries; points can't be redeemed from Rewards page; inventory within a custom search can't be accessed in its entirety (the page just ends after a couple dozen items or so). I enjoy the app otherwise.,3
21,"In my opinion, selling on thredup is def not worth it. I sent so much in and made $0. They sell your items and take about $15 from every bag of clothes they process, while they give you small change for each item sold. Literal cents.... So even if they sell your entire bag and make a nice sum of money for themselves you still don't get anything. I sent 4 large bags but I have nothing to show for it. I should have sold on Mercari/Poshmark. Meh to buy from-beware return shipping fees.",1
22,"There's a bug. Other than that, this is the best app for thrifting high-quality clothes.",5
23,"The app crashes every time you try to click search. It loads items by recommended instead of newest first and you can't change that. You can't just sort by actual measurements. It seems there is frequently some bug and when I've emailed before, the entire point was missed. A lot of items are final sale, which is fine, except when the description is incorrect and you're still stuck with it. So shopping is difficult and a gamble. Not really worth it anymore.",1
24,The app keeps crashing when I try to search for clothes.,1
25,"App crashes when trying to use the search function, given codes not working, less options available to filter and less product options than full site through browser on device or computer.",2
26,"Great shop, app needs work. I love the products and the idea behind threadup. I find it incredibly frustrating that I can't sort or search my saved items. It seems like they are doing a bit of work on the search feature, but being able to see white tank tops when I search for white tank tops, and not be shown 4000 belts instead, would also be cool.",3
27,"this app lacks style diversity so badly. the search filters and newly added picture search is great, but there's almost no options if you're looking for more alternative style clothing, or really anything that doesn't scream ""basic white girl"". hope this improves in the future :/",2
28,"Has it's moments but generally frustrating. There is a lot of variety and I actually think the search and filter features are good, however... 1. The alert to turn on notifications every time you open the app is obnoxious. 2. Quality is really hit and miss, and returns are a nightmare. I probably don't wear 50% of what I have bought. Remember these are clothes people don't want for a reason. 3. Selling feature feels like a total scam. I can get much better payouts on Mercari.",2
29,I like the old version better this one sucks. You can't see all the products for the categories anymore.,2
30,All the clothes are ugly imo,2
31,This update keeps saying opps something went wrong or only shows a few items at a time. Very frustrating! Undo button!,2
32,"After the recent update to allow users to search for brands or looks, the app traded off the ability to scroll through the inventory. I used to be able to scroll to my heart's content, but now I am capped at a certain number of items. I tried reinstalling the app but the same problem persists. This new feature defeats the purpose of thrift shopping to look for things you didn't know you wanted or needed until you see it. Please change it back to the way it was before.",2
33,"This used to be one of my favorite apps. I've made multiple orders over the last few years. I thought the push notifications would be great, but when you click on them, it takes you to a completely different unrelated brand and product. That leaves me searching for the one they told me about. IF I can find it. Also, the number of times I've ordered a clothing item AFTER checking the measurements which are or aren't included, and gotten a youth or child size is ridiculous.",2
34,"Horrible UI. ""New and improved"" app is just as atrocious as the version before it. Scrolling is laggy tap. Pressing the back button after looking at something puts you back at the top of the list. Crashes, lags, have to close/reopen frequently. By far one of the worst apps I've ever used. Polishing the *look* of the app doesn't improve the trash functionality of it. Sorting searches causes you to only see around 15 of 1000s of search results. Devs obviously have never used their own app.",1
35,"Pays in pennies. It doesn't even pay you anything good, unless you have the clothes that rich people can afford.",2
36,"Good: I've found some really good things on here and really like the search features/filters. Bad: Quality of items has decreased. The 'sales' part has gotten increasingly stingy over the years and now they charge you to even paritcipate. The returns buttons are misleading (very easy to accidentially get partial credit back rather than return the items). Customer service is hard to access, with broken links and often through a bunch articles.",3
37,I love the idea of thred up but the lack of ability to return items seamlessly or for free is a major detractor. The latest updates have seemed to dumb down the app. The search feature is absolute trash. If I search for a brand that I want to see I get a million other things except for what I searched for. If I put something in quotes it just expands the search to show even more unrelated nonsense. Why would you do that??? Please fix the search! 🙄,2
38,"This used to be a good app. Decently priced, good rewards program. Now things are not all that much cheaper for the quality .. the rewards program is a joke, the free shipping amount is almost double. And for the past WEEK I can't load more than about 20-30 items at a time no matter the category or search parameters. Now charge to send a clean out bag too? And the amount of mislabeled items has gotten bad. Wrong category, and sizing on an astronomical amount of items these days. I'm done.",1
39,"Since the app updated, the search bar is broke and you can literally not type anything.",1
40,"This app is glitching- every time I click on ""Track Order,"" the app closes.",3
41,"Everything I bought was in new condition, some even had tags! Got better deals than any other site I shop on, even Temu ! Really fast shipping because warehouses are in Texas and Georgia. Right now having issues getting the app to open though.",5
42,"almost one star, the fees have gotten insanely high to the point where you somehow make like 1% of the actual sale after fees and each bag fee oh man, after more items sold somehow it got worse and my payout went... down... I saw multiple shoes sell for $30 a piece and got $0.00 after fees :,) guess i should have given my friends my old clothes. i want my sandals back :(",1
43,Absolutely a complete waste of time and resources. You have to pay a $14.99 fee to clean out. If your cash out amount is only $9.35 then you will not receive a payment. Instead you'll receive a $10.00 credit which only covers the shipping. Thredup is therefore charging you more money to donate clothes so they actually exist. Why pay $14.99 and turn around and get something with a $10.00 credit but still have to pay for the merchandise itself? I'm calling this app a scam that I do not recommend.,1
44,"The clothes available to buy are current and in great condition. HOWEVER when you SELL your stuff they stick you with a 15.00 fee which basically eats up what your supposedly going to earn from selling your clothes-which btw they offer VERY VERY LITTLE for your clothes. So it's a joke. I'm sure that fee pays for the ""free"" (not free) shipping. I would NOT free recommend selling to ThredUp based on their businesses model.",1
45,It is very difficult to reach a live person for an order I had placed & not received any of these payments,1
46,"Typing in search is slow and messy. Interface is not organized intuitively. Sadly, I'm going back to the browser.",2
47,I don't receive any email to set up the account,1
48,"8/10/24: AI Update is Genius!! Add picture & SUCH a better discovery experience! Total Game Changer, I just dropped $400 LOL b/c am able to find what I didn't think I needed to find. Highly Recommend",5
49,"I sent gorgeous sweaters, designer shoes, designer everything and they sold 1 pair of shoes for 8 dollars. I rec'd NOTHING! WHAT A RIP OFF! AND NOBODY EVER GETS A CHANCE TO PURCHASE ""RESCUE BOXES"" since there is never a time or day they are sold. VERY DISSATISFIED AND EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED 😞. I CANNOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO SHOP HERE!",1
50,The app was decent before the last major update. Now the searches are screwed up and if I am looking for something particular it only shows the first few results and not all of the inventory. Not happy,2
51,"Awful update. All items disappear completely when filtering for a specific brand or sort by ""newest"".",2
52,"Need to fix saved search sort order. Please set default back to ""newest first"", not ""recommended"".",1
53,"in terms of clean outs, you get 20% or less of what they sell it for. I'm getting little to nothing for higher dollar items. they're selling 180$ dressed for 50$ and with discounts for cheaper a all I get 10$ or less (usually less). there's like a 14-30$ fee for selling your clean out and you could send in great stuff worth over 1k and still just break even with the fees. at that point it's worth nothing. buying is an OK experience. return policy is lenient. scrolling & filtering is terrible",1
54,Some wonderful finds and fun hunting them. Easy returns if not just what you want.,5
55,"I work in a male-dominated industry, the refinery industry. Though I work in the office, I have to adhere to a masculine dress code of jeans, steel toe boots, and long sleeve shirts. With the shirts I got from ThredUp, my work wardrobe is far more feminine without spending too much money! So glad this is available! And I can sell pieces from my old wardrobe!!! Winning!",5
56,ThredUp is a rip off!!! I sent them 15 items to sell and they only featured 5!! Then the amount of $$ I made was zero!! They take their cut and u end up with pennies. Not worth it people. There is another site where u can post whatever you like. Not happy at all with thred up at all. I deleted the app!,4
57,Every time I click add to cart nothing goes into the cart. It just does not work. I'm disappointed,1
58,"I regret updating the app two months ago. Every update functionality worsens. Right now, all Searches are capped to only a few results. It makes searching for Brands or even discounts difficult since you can't see what else is in inventory aside from the initial 30-40 search results.",2
59,"Returns policy is ridiculous! After this purchase, I will NOT be buying from you again.",1
60,It wouldn't even let me sign in to start it,1
61,"Don't waste your time selling clothes on here as you likely won't make anything with their fees and the small percentage they give you. Buying through thredup is hit or miss as it seems clothing is not inspected well and it can be described as excellent condition and often arrives with very obvious flaws. Store credit expires quickly, so don't accept that as a solution to any problem. Frustrating and disappointing all around!",1
62,I love this App in general but there seems to be a recent issue when else arching where it does not let you scroll through very long and just stops showing anything after 20 or so items. It does this more times than not so I can't search anything.,3
63,"Love the concept, and some of my favorite pieces have come from this site. I've also had a positive experience with the closet cleanout process. Highly recommend! I'm updating my review. The saved search is working for me now.",5
64,"Loyal customer for years. Never again. Gave me fake prices until after I paid. Then said they would give me discounts retroactively or I could cancel. Emailed me after I chose retroactive discounts, and said I wasn't eligible for them. Then why show me those prices you scammers!? Now I can't cancel. AVOID THIS SCAM SHAM BS!!",1
65,"I love Thredup, but it can be frustrating. The ""back"" button is a problem. I feel like it's a gamble every time. It only lets you do it so many times before the app just closes, and I never know where it's going to take me when it does go ""back."" I'm grateful they increased the cart time. It seemed odd to me to take things out of a paying customer's cart so quickly. Customer service is TOP NOTCH, but site navigation can be a nightmare.",3
66,The clean out option is like robbery. Don't give them your clothes,1
67,"Can't login with existing account info. Only offers option to create a new account or sign in with Google, etc. Unusable, if you already have an account.",1
68,"Right now, when I go to my saved searches, it automatically moves that particular search up or down to fit the screen. However, if I have a lot of brands on one of my searches and it moves it so the bottom bar hides ""see all"" and I cannot select it, rendering that search useless. It used to scroll as I moved it and wouldn't shift it automatically. Please fix!",2
69,I'm absolutely certain you've had costs to upgrade your system and app. But wow they was a little while when you beat goodwill in prices and now you're no better. Plus the shipping comes by carrier horse across the county. Using Ontrac has to be the dummest decision. You can't get a live person for help with Thredup. I've not saved anything shopping with you anymore and I may as well just use outlets and Amazon.,2
70,"I've updated my rating to 5 stars. It took a while, but the issue was resolved. I would still be careful sending anything higher end for consignment, but overall I think it is an very good place to buy and sell clothes.",5
71,Rare finds for the low priced people,5
72,Couldn't even make an account due to servers issues,1
73,"DO NOT USE THIS APP!! Don't use this app. They steal from you and then sell your items for 500% over the price. I sold over 15 pieces and got $0. Not only do you have to pay for the bag, but they have additional fees. This was not the case before. Just use Poshmark or other selling apps. ThredUp is just another scam. And then, if you want your things, you didn't sell, you have to pay yet again to get them back. They still sell them, though. This is not fair.",1
74,"I've been using this app for years and it used to be wonderful, but now they charge a really high rate for any bag sent in and they also make returns next to impossible. No longer going to use this app",1
75,"Super glitchy, never seems to work as it should. Really really bad actually.",1
76,They accept waaaayy to much junk. I hate scrolling through countless unbearable clothes that won't sell just to find one item that is half decent.,1
77,"I love thredup, but the app is so glitchy that it makes it hard to use, and it's extremely frustrating",3
78,App does not work on Android. When I go to my saved searches it brings up a bunch of random things that aren't part of my search. Works fine on a non Mac computer but not phones.,2
79,"Very disappointed,you are better off listing on eBay or Vinted. This app is scandalous with the fees. You will not make a profit for you rstuff even if it it's new with tags.very disappointed. Please read the reviews before jumping into this app.",1
80,So much to choose from and items were always in great condition. I've ordered in the past and I loved everything I bought. Thank you for having so much to choose from. Ty🫠,5
81,"I like the app. Over the years there have been improvements to quality of life. But I CANNOT stress how much I am IRKED by when I say my sizes are 16, 18, and 20, and I'm shown constant size 12s and 14s. Please fix this",3
82,"The app works as expected. The search feature needs improved to narrow down the number of items you have to view to find what you want. There are literally thousands of items.... but example finding a tshirt with a dragonfly is like a needle in a haystack. The only other issue I've had is that the measurements are of little use. Some are ridiculous small for a size large or vice versa. I have to pass on a lot of final sale items, as measurements don't seem realistic. Good Luck",2
83,Overall app works somewhat well and is pleasant search function is a little weird (⭐⭐⭐⭐) unfortunately it has a very intentional nag feature that constantly begs for push notifications. I do not allow any apps on my phone to send push notifications. This takes the app from being a very mid app to an extremely annoying app that's constantly just trying to change phone settings I do not want to change. No means no threadup. Now ad links don't work. App experience just gets worse.,1
84,"App has no filters or search options for men's clothing. And yes, you do carry men's clothing. It's just unsearchable on your app.",1
85,"Worst experience, EVER! I sent them very nice, lightly used clothes. American Eagle, Loft, Kancan, Abercrombie... and after the ridiculously large percentage that they keep, plus the $15 fee, I now owe them money?!?! WORST COMPANY EVER!",1
86,I'd give a 0 if I could being charged for a product that was canceled. I'll never recommend thred up again,1
87,Finally placed a couple of orders. Created saved searches. They keep suggesting that I let them send notifications. Great. Notify me. So they notify me. Here is a perfect bodysuit that you were looking for. So I go for it and it is immediately gone as well as my whole flipping search. I can't find my search. I can't find the bodysuit. And I can't do anything on the site suddenly because it just searches and searches and won't stop. The site keeps stopping. I hate this flipping site.,1
88,I always find what I'm looking for!,5
89,"Prices are extremely high for the clothing condition. Purses are not in ""like new"" or even ""good"" condition for the price. If you go to Goodwill on a regular basis you can pick up designer bags under $25.00 dollars. I purchased a Gucci medium sized bag at a second hand shop for $65.00 and it was in mint condition in my eyes. The store had it marked in ""good"" condition because it had an ink mark from a pen inside. In other words, this site's prices are not in line with used items offered online.",2
90,Big rip off 6.57 for 16 items sold out of 5 full bags of cloths,1
91,"They managed to make a mediocre app awful after this newest 'update'. There are less pictures of items; measurements are written now, not pictured; the usability is sloppy - scrolling wildly, overlapping boxes of text, visually cluttered; something is now 'unavailable' vs 'sold' - why, who knows. Categories now have huge pictures instead of a more streamline list... But my saved searches are finally back after 6+ months gone, so yay, I guess ?",1
92,"App is glitchy. Saved searches disappear or the screen won't scroll down far enough to be able to see results, etc. The service & products are poor too. A majority of what I've purchased hasn't been represented fairly. Ex: a swim suit that had no more elasticy left, a purse with scuffs and trim missing from the leather (not shown in the photos), a shirt with pom pom trim that had a few poms missing. Stuff that should be trashed/recycled. No money back either, just credit. Shady.",2
93,"It's still very buggy. *So far* it isn't crashing every time you leave the screen anymore but it won't let you check out many of your saved searches before it bugs out. So basically, if you want to look further down your saved searches list after coughing on a search or item not towards the top, you have to exit and restart the app. This issue might not be as bad as it crashing all the time like it used to but it's been there the whole time and is still really annoying.",2
94,"EDIT: 7/10/24 Back in 2023, I left a 2 star review about the multiple glitches, loading issues, and inefficient UI. I'm happy to to say that I recently re-downloaded the app and was met with so many great improvements! Every issue I had last year seems to have been fixed, and I'm super excited to use the app again!",5
95,Thredup live chat has been amazing helping me out to resolve a problem I had. Awesome 👌 job!,5
96,Worst app. They sell my clothes and give you peanuts saying n reasons.,1
97,It's broken. Very broken. Unless my phone is that outdated. But by the reviews I don't think I'm the only one. It's not even worth trying to explain them all.,1
98,"Please do another update on the app and add the junior option back. The only way I can search in juniors is on the desktop site. There is no option on the app anymore. Also, I'm not a fan of the new way of searching. It's not as easy and doesn't save your searches like it used to.",2
99,I LOVE this app and have had several orders with no issues. The last update left me with glitches and unusable search bar. I literally cannot use the app at all anymore 👎 Hope the developers can get things straightened out for all of us.,2
100,"Selling on the service is one thing (used to get such better payouts), but the app is so buggy, and only getting worse. I can't see my saved list half the time anymore, saved searches are gone, the shortcut buttons don't work. Skip the app and shop online.",2
101,"LOVE thredUP, HATE the app. No matter what my connection is, it never wants to load my saved searches. Just keeps giving me a blank screen. My other apps work fine so I know this app is the issue. I'll just stick to the website.",2
102,"I've been using Thredup for years now and I mostly like it. However I'm starting to become annoyed at their badly designed search. I don't know if it's intentional or just bad design. I have my sizes set to XL/XXL and 16/18, and they show me 14s. I pretty much never fit in 14s. I don't want to see them. I get excited about a style... And then nope, too small. With big searches (e.g. ""dress"") it means I'm unnecessarily scrolling through dozens, if not hundreds of items that won't fit.",4
103,"Placed my order June 30th, takes forever for them to ship anything. My order was supposed to be here today July 5th and didn't show up now tracking says the 8th. If you need clothes quick without going to a store, id recommend ordering from somewhere else. This is the only app I've used that takes this long to receive anything. Even wish delivers to me quicker. Shipping should be free regardless of how much you spend with how long it takes to get anything.",1
104,"Often won't filter or load, despite updates and new phone.",2
105,"Selling on this platform is basically a scam. Absolutely ridiculous. First they charge you to send your clothes in. Then with all the listing, selling and shipping fees, you only get 8% of anything of yours they sell. So i could make more selling each item for $1 on the side of the road. It doesnt end there; if your items don't sell within 30 days you can reclaim them, but it costs $6 (minimum) per item to reclaim. I get the whole point is they do all the listing work ""for you"" but not worth it.",1
106,"this is such a cool idea, but why don't you do mens clothes as well? myself and many of the other guys i know trift/resell our clothes often, possibly even more then the women and kids i know, and many of the girls i know enjoy mens style clothing more. it seems like a strange thing to exclude",2
107,"App works fine, but DO NOT SELL ITEMS WITH THRED UP. Sent in a huge bag of nice clothes, and even though 14 items sold, I made $0. Waste of my time. Shopping is hit or miss. I've found a few nice items but also have received items that I wouldn't even consider selling (I did get a refund for some of those items).",2
108,There's no men's clothes or shoes.,2
109,Literally excludes men this blatantly sexist,1
110,The process time is way too long 😒 I hope they can fix that. If they need more people send over an application,2
111,"This used to be a great option for buying clothes. Sadly, the app has so many glitches, and the customer service is non existant. The only way to contact the customer service is through some ai ""Kustomer"" chat and which is worthless. I've been buying off the app for years and have spent a fortune for myself and children not to mention all of the friends I've referred. The app now operates more like some scam app than a real business anymore. Sadly I am done.",1
112,"I'm missing my $89 order, supposed to have been delivered June 3rd!!!!",5
113,ThreUp is easy to use and has a lot of variety at an affordable price. The return process is also really simple. I haven't had any problems with them thus far.,5
114,"They are constantly finding ways to make this a worse option than just buying new clothes from a store. It's more expensive, you can only return items for partial credit in the store, items you save become not eligible for sales??? Really guys....",2
115,love clothes and prices,4
116,"I have ordered 4 times, never received a package. I thought I must be doing something. I contacted support and tried again and again. They cannot be counted on to deliver packages and time is lost that could have been spent getting actual items from a reliable company.",1
117,Multiple orders with poor quality. Support is a joke. They wait Multiple days to respond and then tell you to get a refund. Guess what. Refunds not available. If I wanted used items literally held together with safety pins and items with holes all over (dresses)- I'll continue to order here..... get your service right and treat paying customers better please.,1

122,I can't find jewelry loty,4

124,"App is terrible. Can't use saved searches, random items appear in my cart. Item notifications lead to nothing, just back to the homepage. They said this was going to be updated but it's the exact same app. Use a browser.",1
125,"Thred up is a great option for finding top brands at cheaper prices. HOWEVER, there is a 3.99 restocking fee on top of $10.99 (or more) return shipping. If you don't love what you get you're still paying for it. Selling items to them is less than ideal. I sent in 11 items, won't make more than $2 a piece and have to pay fees for the clothes I sent in. I realize they have to pay workers and for warehouses, etc but wish it was a great deal all around, not just when initially purchasing.",2
126,"Not loving the new design. You can no longer see any numbers, such as the number of items displayed, which I find very important, or number of favorites (not as important, but why remove it?). Another case of don't fix what isn't broken.",3
127,"Absolutely love thredup, but the app needs a lot of work. The app almost always has bugs. They've added a lot of filters, and are working on the app, but every time I get a push notification about something that matches my search, it never works.",3
128,"Great idea, ok execution Each update to this app seems to make it worse. Current version really messed up searching and speed. Search terms or filters don't seem to be recognized half of the time. Additionally, it seems if you apply more than one filter, the results never display. I'll continue to use the app because sales and selection are the best around, it just comes with the cost of frequent frustration.",3
129,"First, let me say that I LOVE thredUp.... on my desktop. (Although, to be honest, some of the search categories could be better.) But the app, or at least the version on my new phone sucks. When I get a notification on a saved search and click on it, it only opens the app instead of taking me to the results of my saved search. It never used to do this. I have since turned off all notifications. PLEASE FIX THIS",1
130,Easy Peaszy,5
131,"Not worth the download. I've seen products with the tag still on it listed at a higher price than the price tag. They charge a restocking fee which is crazy considering no other store will do this for a completely new product being returned and all their products are used so you dont really know the quality until you get it in person. They have been doing a price increase on clothes then marking them ""on sale"" but it's the same price if not more. Don't download.",1
132,Awesomeness,5
133,"I love this app, but I think the new update took away the total item count in a search. It's too daunting to start scrolling without knowing how many shirts I'll be looking at! Also, I can't find the premium search tool.",4
134,Ever since the last update this app sucks. It rarely let's me log in and if I want to log out I have to uninstall then reinstall the app. It's garbage. Edit: they are even worse now. I had the prices on most of the stuff in my cart raised. It went from $180 to $216. That's a big difference. They are shady. And my favorite items dissappear for no reason and I lose them in the app.,1
135,Updated my review (06/18/24) Positives - so many cute clothes and deals! - customer service is great. Had a top come with a not great zipper that kept randomly breaking and they refunded it. - the app used to have issues but has greatly improved. Negatives - I don't know or trust their cloth standards... I have sent in new clothes I never worn and been told they couldn't sell it because of 'wear' showing?!,3
136,Honestly this app does not work properly most of the time. Get it together thredup seriously.,1
137,"Love the deals, been a fan gor years, but the app is soooo slow & glitchy!",3
138,The App was working great prior to the most recent update. Now there is no longer a juniors section in the app. You can only see the juniors clothing in your web browser. Please put the juniors clothing section back in the app,3
139,"THIS APP IS SKILLED AT RIPPING US OFF!!! I'm just disgusted after sending in BAG after BAG of IN great condition clothing - watching it sell (quickly and almost everything sold!) thru the app - then receiving $0 in payments due to all the $$ being eaten ALIVE every single bleeping time by the company's ""fees"" and ""shipping"" costs!!! It's ridiculous, ludicrous, rude-icrous, and Im downright sickened that any viable company, especially persons in the industry of re-sale, would operate in this way!",1
140,"ThredUp has really gone down hill. I've used this app for thrifted clothing for years... Now each return has a $3.99 restocking fee AND $10 return label fee. It cost me $26 to return four items that we're heinously the wrong size in spite of the measurings on the site. You'd have to get a really good deal on a lot of other clothing to make those fees worth it. I got some adorable clothes thay really fit and were super high quality, but yeah, read the fine print for fees and penalties!!",3
141,Absolutely love thred up been buying for years !,5
142,If I could get it zero stars I would. Thisnis a complete rip off and the app is no good. Stay away.,1
143,So far so good,3
144,Like getting items from thred up wish there was other ways to do payments plan was getting a 10:00 dollar box dont have it anymore only the bundle,5
145,After the most recent update the app is full of glitches. If I want to filter my all sizes nothing shows up and the page is white. So frustrating because before the update the app worked perfectly.,1
146,"The new app experience is a terrible downgrade. Search is now laggy when typing, borderline unusable. It sometimes doesn't register letters I'm typing. They got rid of favorite search links in the search menu. And I can't find a link to Rent the Runway stuff anywhere now. Avoid until these things are fixed (especially the search).",1
147,Fun and easy,5
148,"I love Thredup, I've purchased things in the past, but this particular time, I was truly disappointed, the shoes that I bought were disgusting on the bottom, also the heels were wobbly, yes I understand there secondhand, but if there in poor condition or quality don't sell them.",2
149,Don't use these people they are fake and will take your items just to make money for them you GET NOTHING ...,1
150,"Edit: my bag was finally processed two years later. All items sold but I received nothing. They deemed my old Navy clothing as ""fast fashion"" and ineligible for payout. I don't believe I saw anything stating this two years ago when I sent it. I enjoy the app and have bought a handful of items off of it. My issue is that I sent in a clean out in June and it says it has been processed but I have yet to see any money or any items even listed. When looking for any help, you just get the runaround.",1
151,"I have been using Thredup for years and have lots of redeemable points to use. Unfortunately, with one of the latest updates, I cannot redeem any points anymore. Disappointed. Additionally, there's a scent that every Thredup box comes with, all the clothes smell of it when I get them. It doesn't smell bad, but I am super sensitive to scents and it makes me have allergy attacks. It takes multiple washes to get it out of the clothing. Just might want to consider not using scents on the clothing.",3
152,"This is the BEST way to buy second hand. I'm addicted to shopping on this app and I don't even feel bad because the clothes are so cheap! I don't know if I'm lucky or what, but every single thing I've bought so far has been in great condition (you can filter results to make sure of this) and has fit perfectly. Definitely download and check it out. Edit: The prices are great, but the customer service is awful. I've never had to contact customer support before and I hope I never do again.",2
153,"Love this shop and have been shopping here for years, but every iteration of the app has been glitchy. The Beta that showed up this morning is no different. The new filters are nice. The soft controls disappearing then reappearing every time you scroll is super distracting and really slows the app down. This is so bad, that it just ruins the experience.",3
154,"I loved this app, shopped from it all the time, however they just ""updated"" it, and now it is much more difficult to maneuver! Ugh!",1
155,"I recently bought a pair of American Engel Jean for only 14.00 dollars and not only did the package arrived earlier then expected,the Jean actually fit great and I can't wait to buy another pair. The measurements on sizes were on PONT. I recommend you try",5
156,I love finding great bargins that I had been looking for. I just love thrifting. I love all the discounts.,5
157,So glad I found ThredUP. Awesome shopping experience and Superfantastic Customer Support Team Members. Bee especially has went above and beyond to Help solve any issues I bring to her. Great Designer Brands and Awesome Prices Including Big Sale Discounts Often. Trendy styles- Easy to navigate App. I Love-Love ThredUP!! Thank You All! 😊💗 I Just Wish Returns Were Consistently Handled Quicker. It Keeps Your Monies Tied Up A Bit Waiting On Refunds. I Wish Issues Could Get Resolved Quicker-Greta,5
158,"All the items I've purchased have been in excellent condition, the pricing is very reasonable. It's incredibly convenient to be able to donate clothes back to them in the bag they send in your order!! I've referred people I don't really know to check you guys out",5
159,"Sizes are inconsistent, but have gotten a little better. There's now a glitch with the app where I can't see the item or information about it.",1
160,This is a straight rip off. !!! I've sent then 3 bags I know of with good descent clothes. They only accepted 3 items out of 30 and My payout is only 1.95 but my Costa are suatantially more then what was said in the beginning. Deleting Asap,1
161,"I am a true thrifter. I love that Thredup gives me a larger variety of thrift items from the comfort of my home. So far, all my items has came as described. I have placed 3 orders and 1 return. I am one happy thrifter.",5
162,"Terrible return policy. You make it extremely hard to return anything. I ordered 40 dresses and want to keep more than half of them. I ordered all the same size. Most fits just right but the rest are way too tight. When I went to return page, it says ""no item eligible for return."" Can can this be when only a handful of them are on final sale????? I didn't want to trtun the final ones. I want to return the normal price items.",1
163,"Easy to use app So far, the clothes have been great. Highly recommend.",5
164,Best place to buy brand name clothes at a low price,5
165,Love Thedup,5
166,"Easy to use app. Very satisfied with my order. Arrived timely. Thank you, threadup.",5
167,"I do most of my shopping here, so good!",5
168,Great designer clothes for a fraction of the cost if you were to buy it in a store. Paid $4 for a dress that normally would cost $190. Looked brand new. I literally bought 23 items for under $80. This is now my go to when it comes to buy clothes for myself,5
169,I love this app and the ability to shop mobile. There are so many great items. I can't wait to buy more.,5
170,affordable price,4
171,I love thredup! The option to only see your size is nice and the measurements for each item is helpful. I can scroll for hours!,5
172,"They are inconsistent, I sent a 20 lb box of stuff in better shape then before and they only picked 10 things. I am disappointed",1
173,"All of my items have sold, but I don't get any funds because they are taking it for bag fees, if I knew this I would have never sent the anything.",1
174,I love it,5
175,Overall good experience. Got many deals.,5
176,Would be great if they told you whether garments have pockets!,4
177,Horrible app.. Clothes look nasty from pics and when you type something you looking for they don't have it. I deleted account good grief,1
178,Don't use it's a rip off and fraud! Better to donate clothes to the needy.,1
179,Great products at great prices.,5
180,"The updated version does not show me items sold by same seller. Something I use on multiple purchases I'm on the fence about. It stalls out when I put in searches as well. Not as ""streamlined"" as they promoted",1
181,"This is the best shopping experience for great rates on clothing you want. You can put in a description of anything you are looking for and filter sizes, color, price, everything! I don't think I will ever pay high price retail again. Check out ThredUp!",5
182,Absolutely perfect shopping for exactly my size. Amazing,5
183,"Value, price, easy returns, efficient customer service.",5
184,Such a convenient way to shop and buy beautiful clothes!,5
185,"I loved the website version of ThredUp, but the app feels a little janky at times. It doesn't save my sizes, so I have to re-input them into the filter every time I search something new. Also, when I give it a price range, it always goes a little over, which the website doesn't do. Another thing is when I tap on their sections, like ""spring dresses"" or ""$10 and under clearance"" it just brings me to the last thing I searched instead of the preset options they're trying to offer.",3
186,I just joined ThredUp and I'm loving it. Easy to navigate and so much to look thru. I ordered a Clean Out kit. And yesterday I ordered some really cute tops! Loving it so far. To be continued. ☺️,5
187,Amazing Love you guys 🤩,5
188,Easy to use.,5
189,"This app has great filters search for specific items, brands, colors, and iteem condition. Descriptions are accurate 75% of the time (items listed as excellent condition showing up with holes.)The store has generous return policies. Be cautious with discount codes, the often make items final sale non refundable. Overall I would recommend the app.",3
190,Perfect,5
191,Such a great app! Also you can find so really amazing deals on some nice clothes.,5
192,I love to go thrift shopping when I travel. This is basically thrift shopping from many different places at the same time. I have found so many good deals!,5
193,Very hard to cash out to pay pal. Can not find my clean outs had to go to customer service to make transaction,1
194,No men's clothing.,1
195,"I,m Loving it ! 😍",5
196,Love how it states clean out your closet and sell items. Most of stuff sent got sent back. If you wanted name brand stuff try putting that in your title. You are a resell retail company. So what's with wanting just name brand. NOT EVERYONE CAN SHOP AT NAME BRAND STORES!,2
197,"Excellent,on time with delivery. Love my bathing suit.",5
198,I wish they would post when the item has pockets.,4
199,I love the selection. It doesn't only show your size. Return policy is nice.,5
200,"It's OK, I would rather go with local consignment shops. I am certain I would get more $.",3
201,"Love Thred up! The app has nice filters to narrow your searches. My only issue is a t check out, the page glitches and will not let you scroll down through all your items and just jumps back to the top of the page.",4
202,I have been a customer for years! I have been through it with ThreadUp and I even wanted to forget about it in the early years but selling and shopping have never been better!,4
203,Loads of designer goods at a thrifty cost!,5
204,Love it1!!°,5
205,"Thanks thredUP for sending my order to the wrong address. I'm out almost $70, and you will certainly not get my business ever again!",1
206,"Buying clothes through this is decent, but can still be pricey. The hint is to look for items out of season. But the biggest negative is that they create this illusive marketing ploy to get people to send clothes to them for some kind of ""reward"". But with all their processing fees, you make maybe a few cents here and there. Which is not worth it. It's better to support a local non-profit community company this way.",2
207,"I absolutely LOVE this app!!!. ThredUp is AMAZING!!!! If you are a style fashionista you MUST get on here, shop until you drop from the privacy of your own home & live your best life!!! ThredUp works with AfterPay so you can create & build the most perfect stylish wardrobe and pay an affordable down payment and the rest in 4 installments. I'm going to do some DoorDashing deliveries for an hour or two so I can come back home and shop some more!!! Great job Thredup!!! Keep up the EXCELLENT work!!!",5
208,"Convenient, great selection! I like being able to filter my searches by size, color, fabric, patterns, and even accents. I've scored some fantastic items for great prices. You can get designer items for a fraction of the original cost. They almost always have a discount code, too. And it's environmentally friendly to shop secondhand. I recommend! 5/27/24 recently have had some issues with a notification showing me an item that I would like to purchase but I can't find it anywhere on the app",5
209,Love that there is no need to keep thumbing through hundreds of pages or hours of looking to find your size or anything specific you want that you can do here so quickly!! Gained some weight and having no money to get decent clothes at this time I managed to get a few changes of clothes that practically costs nothing with 1st time buyers %'s and other ways too.,5
210,Love Thred up...,5
211,"Initially, I was hesitant to put in an order, but I saw several items that were too cute to pass up. When I received my first order earlier this month, I was extremely impressed with how quick my order arrived, how nicely wrapped my garments were, and most of all, how each of the nine items I ordered were in fantastic condition (like I was the original buyer)!! I am now waiting for my second order! I'm hooked! Love the quality of the garments, the service provided, and the prices!!",5
212,"Great service, smart idea and very affordable, stylish clothes! Love it!!",5
213,"I was going to shop for gently used clothes for myself, but there is no listing for men's sizes.",1
214,"I had a recent order reserved. I DID NOT PLACE THE ORDER. U placed it without my permission Will now have to go to my bank and cancell. I placed 2 orders in which u cancelled.. FOR NO REASON. My credit card was charged and the orders cleared..i tried to contact u on several occasions, yet u failed to respond. I finally had to cancell that credit card and get a new one. After trying to contact u 5 times and asking that reinstate my order,since it was already paid for, u issued me a credit.",1
215,Easy to use,5
216,Love this app so much,5
217,"This review is NOT for the app but for an individual... I tried for an hour to process a cash out, talked to 2 different CSR's, still had no luck all they did was give me a link which didn't work...You know what they say 3rd times the charm and it was...This time I got Hanna⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, she alone gets this review, she gave me numerous options and then let me know she could process what I wanted done...If course I went with that option...lol..It was done in 15 seconds too... Thank You Hanna!!! Tanya",5
218,"LOVE Thredup!! 90% of my wardrobe comes from here. Buy, sell, and enjoy!",5
219,Shopping works well but the cart keeps refreshing making it hard to scroll through the cart.,4
220,Takes forever to load.,1
221,It is always a pleasure buying from this app. 2nd hand clothes 💙.. Hope you guys get Men clothes too.,5
222,"Purposely hiding things like the Outlet and discount items. It's impossible to locate things and overall ThredUp has become one of those companies I can't justify supporting anymore because of price. Thrifting is an accessibility need in most of this country, you're treating it like a privilege. Do better.",1
223,Horrible. This app is super slow. Not to mention customer service ends your chats before you are done. I was in the middle of typing a response and they ended up because they are short staffed. Don't bother buying anything from them since they use extremely small delivery companies that you can't even contact to update with additional delivery info like entry codes or if the apt # is wrong,1
224,"I'm blown away by the quality, cleanliness & condition of the items I've ordered thru thredUP. Everytime a box arrives, it's an event! Don't spend time watching/bidding on other sites; thredUP does not disappoint. 🥰",5
225,Absolutely love ThreadUP!!,5
226,"Good variety, the sight is really easy to use.",5
227,"Bad search and sorting features, but good stuff when you find it.",4
228,"I have had nothing but great experiences with thredUP. I made several purchases, and I'm totally happy with the entire experience.",5
229,Best second hand clothing app,5
230,Very easy to navigate through,5
231,Great variety and prices.,5
232,App is pretty trash. Doesn't save my sizes and I have to constantly manually enter them each search. Only installed it to see what the deals would be but it's so frustrating to use I don't think even care. Website is leagues better.,2
233,This app is just as easy to use as their website. It really is the best online thrift store there is.,5
234,"Awesome App and store!! I have gotten soooo many amazing pieces of clothing, shoes and handbags. I loveeee this store!! They are always having sales too which is great!! You have to try it.... you will get hooked!",5
235,Many times I have been disappointed because the sizes and measurements have been wrong. I will not be paying for shipping returns and restocking fees. I now have several jeans that will be used as capris. I will no longer be shopping at thredUp 😠,1
236,Love how easy it is to order from the app!,5
237,Good quality of clothes. I didn't know what to expect since it's my first time ordering. I love that I can shop from home and that this supports recycling of clothes. I recommend this site for people who want to do their part for the environment.,5
238,Exceptionally buggy. Needs to be restarted frequently. Also it is really annoying that it asks me to allow notifications EVERY TIME I open it. I shouldn't need to say no repeatedly.,2
239,"Great deals if you're buying, not so great if selling",5
240,Easy to maneuver,5
241,Customer service is there and worth the wait. Could smarten up the return proccess to allow returns with multiple lables to be streamlined. For example a tool that recognises a return was already prepared and when a new return is established an option button to combine the items to an existing return order and lable.,4
242,Love using the app to shop,5
243,Love this app,5
244,LOVE thredUP! I find great prices on defined that I want to wear. It's super exciting to get that box on the doorstep!,5
245,"glitchy with a side of scam. I sent in a clean out kit with a brand new with tags VS Swimsuit and it didn't get included in my items once the kit was processed. I contacted customer service and was told it was rejected and without assurance on my kit I am not able to receive the items back because they have been ""donated""-likely into someone's purse. BUYER BEWARE this is pure robbery and I will not be returning as a customer. This scenario happened to my mom with a really expensive purse too. 👎",1
246,Would give zero stars if I could. They sold my clothes and I made about $15 off it. Little did I know that there was a $15 fee so what did I make? Zero dollars! This is a scam. RUN,1
247,"I'd highly reccomend buying from thredup. They pretty much always run sales and you can get good deals that way. Without the sales, things can be kinda pricy, but still not as much as you'd pay for new (in most cases). The items I've recieved have all been high quality. Selling is a different story. Unless you're selling a designer item, it is unlikely that you'll make any profits from what you sell; even if you sell several things.",4
248,"Search function is not the greatest, notifications open the app instead of going to the item it's notifying about. Although really like the site, the app could be improved. Many items are mislabeled. There is a freebird ""scarf""- it's a dust cover that should just be with the shoes. Practically all the jeans are labeled boyfriend- they are not. Leggings are skinny cut/ tapered& labeled kick flare- huge difference. Heart print& it's just normal jeans. Mannequin measurements instead of the item.",2
249,"New shopping go to Soamy great finds and some stuff stills the tags. Why pay full price, when tou can find so much name brand stuff for a fraction of the cost.",5
250,this app keeps asking me to turn on notifications every single time I open it. well I don't want to. have you considered maybe some people don't turn on notifications by choice so you can't spam them?,1
251,Loved my first order. I am very pleased with my order.,5
252,"Recently, the emails I received are linking to the website, but not to the specific tab for which the email is addressed. Also, I occasionally will have trouble finalizing an order (an Oops message will pop up and might have to attempt the transaction a few times).",4
253,Love Thred up Having the app is even better. Im also able to find my favorite designer brand for much less.,5
254,Awesome,5
255,"Thred up clothing were dirty with body odor, stains including deodorantnstaibs. I will not be purchasing from thred up in the future.",1
256,"Sometimes the photos of items after selecting them won't show up, or the search results are really short (compared to online), and despite having an account - my size options aren't automatically input for any search that I do. For now, ill stick to using the website.",2
257,App isn't loading items,1
258,"Photos are not generally great, the app is generally easy to understand & use, and the description of items listed is often inaccurate. Sellers generally are getting pennies on the dollar.",3
259,Easy to use.,5
260,super fast delivery... worried product may not always match due to being unable to see the detail.,5
261,"I like shopping in an eco friendly way and thrift shopping from my phone, but DO NOT SELL anything with them. The fees are now so high you're just giving your stuff away FYI. The payouts are already paltry so to sell enough to pay the fee is ridiculous. I also wish there was a way to report items described incorrectly. Most descriptions are pretty poor. Wish the reward tiers were better.",3
262,Love second hand shopping! ThredUp makes it even easier!,5
263,Good luck with customer support.....,1
264,Thrifting and thriving! I love this app and want the search feature to be better.,4
265,I sent my first clean out kit on April 4th and they have not even opened my kit much less list a single item. I've requested my kit back multiple times with NO RESPONSE!! At this point my spring and summer items will be out of season by the time they get to it. I also paid for the return my items option but to NO AVAIL! I was leary to send a kit to begin with and should have stuck with my gut instinct! Purchasing from ThreadUp is always good but sending a kit to sell is RIDICULOUS SELLERS 🚫,1
266,Some things have been great. The sizes are not always accurate which can be frustrating. Be sure to read the measurements when available! Returns are great and professional. I feel they have improved a great deal over the past 2 years. Always packaged very nicely and arrive promptly.,4
267,"I don't really wanna give a rating because I couldn't use the app. I'm not a woman a girl or a child, I don't understand why there isn't a Men's section. I suppose men aren't style-savvy or interested in buying second hand for the good of the environment. Was really looking forward to making this a well-used app too...",3
268,Excellent experience for a pregnancy 👏,5
269,"I'm so glad I discovered this app. I've been using it for many years now. However as of yesterday 5/9/2024 the Conditions section on the app removed the""New"" button. Why? I like the option and as it is a consignment shop. Yes I like to buy new and I like to shop just choosing from that option.If you're new to the app you might not care but I do. It wasn't broken so there was no need to fix anything.Bad decision 😪 You put""New with tags"" back it's under ""Ways to shop"" instead of under ""Condition""",5
270,Great app and store! I found some great buys there,5
271,Love the app hate the shipping fee,5
272,"Fun to thrift shop ThredUP. Search feature is fantastic to narrow down items by size, type, style, brand, color, price and more. Great app",5
273,Just like going to the thrift store but in the comfort from ur home.,5
274,User-friendly! Easy to contact customer support via live chat and the app sends ou notifications on your favorite brands or your Favorites.,5
275,Terrific!,5
276,"Easy to use, reliable",5
277,"I've made 3 seperate purchases; I'm very happy with the CLOTHING I purchased but not HANDBAGS. I threw away both purses once discovering they were final sale; they shouldn't have been resold (falling apart, excessively worn straps on one and just very misleading descriptions/pictures) Just use caution so you're not left with disappointment as I was.",3
278,It sometimes glitches but overall it is a great app.,4
279,"After having this app for awhile, I've noticed it's very buggy. Doesnt refresh, if you place an autobuy, better check on an actual website. Its tossed mine twice. So many things need addressing here, including the company itself! Poor info on items, almost everything I've gotten was incorrect measurements or condition not as described. No phone number to speak to anyone. I hate that businesses are going this way. Cheap, cutting jobs, these people are not the environmental gems they claim.",1
280,No mens selection,1
281,ThreadUp is SUPER convenient for online thrifting! I love this app & the quality of clothing I get. The filters make it really easy to find EXACTLY what you're looking for too. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because their Cleanout Kit system isn't great... don't really want to pay a few to send you guys clothes that you probably won't resell! Other than that ⭐️👍,4
282,Takes a while to learn how to navigate. Item descriptions are too vague.,4
283,Always have fun finding thredup buys. Bundling over several days conserves packaging and shipping costs.,5
284,Excellent,5
285,Love it!,5
286,Love shopping here and it's a great place to send my clothes I no longer need to get a credit towards more clothes.,5
287,"The app is glitchy, but the selection and prices are good. I like all the filters so I can narrow down exactly what I want. I do wish they'd fix all the glitches, though. The app is really slow to load, and every time I use it something else goes wrong. I always think to myself, ""All apps have glitches; I'm sure they'll fix it soon."" But this app really never gets fixed all the way. It's worth it for me sometimes if I need clothes, though.",3
288,"Stop with the notification pop-ups. I t's bothersome enough that I open other apps instead of yours. Also, 1 out of 7 items I ordered were inaccurate measurements.I was looking for mid-rise jeans, what I received were mostly high rise. They all were final sale and I didn't pay much but that's not the point. Please post accurate measurements and details. Almost every jean I click on describes heart pattern. The low-rise jeans look high-rise in pics. My trust level is depleted.",1
289,I did not expect to find name brand clothing in like new condition and new with tags attached for less than $10 a piece. I am very impressed,5
290,I love thredUP !! I've been shopping on it for years and you can't find designer clothes at their price anywhere. They are great with refunds and very fast at getting it all together and shipped out to you. 😁🤘,5
291,Great app,5
292,"Love all the affordable brands. Also, how efficient the app is when sending you the merchandise.",5
293,I always find great items on Threadup.,5
294,I'm addicted to this app and feel better about the world when purchasing off here rather than Amazon or another fast fashion places. They are also helpful with refunds. You can either return items for a small fee or get credit. I usually enjoy the credit for items that just don't work and donate to a domestic shelter. Only drawback is the items are not always that cost saving but with enough promos I've managed to get a lot of bang for my buck. Cheers!,5
295,"I'm happy with my purchases on this app. The order was accurate, fast shipping and looks exactly as shown in the picture on their website!",5
296,A lot of selection at Great prices,5
297,Terrible. Two of the last three orders were wrong. Pant measurements are off 3 inches or more for the inseam as well as the waist. Hard to actually get it contact with a human. This place is not what it used to be.,1
298,"Send the wrong size clothes, no way to return.",1
299,"You put in the size clothes you need, and they send you baby clothes. Plus, there's no way to return anything.",1
300,Exceptional shopping experiences and easy closet purge.,5
301,pretty much always have had. good luck with this,4
302,The app is excellent! My only issue with it is that it not-infrequently asks me to turn on notifications; I don't want notifications because I don't shop for fun - only when I'm looking for something specific for my wardrobe.,5
303,This company is a scam! They will give you cents in the dollar for clothes. Do not sell to them!,1
304,Loved it!!,5
305,"My picks have been like new, I live knowing I am helping the environment. Everything I order is wonderful and fits my body. You must shop and remember what looks good on you. There is soooo much to choose from. Better then a store, doing something good, and finding beautiful things. I buy for my granddaughter and daughter, also. Love it!",5
306,"Was good had over 100,00 dollars orders a sell bag about 15,00 and now I only have 7.00 left I was keeping the money till I was ready to cash out after I ordered another bag. So where did the 80.00 go??",3
307,Great place to buy gently used items and a reasonable price. The site is easy to navigate and I have always been happy with my purchases. Worth the download if you like to thrift shop and receive good quality items and a great price.,5
308,The prices are amazing and so are the quality of clothes! Sometimes shipping can take a little longer than expected but worth the wait! The discounts on sale days are amazing. My last order was 70% off and free shipping. I highly recommend this app!,5
309,Amazing,5
310,Concept is a great idea. They charge too much for 2nd hand items. You can't combine any discounts with any coupons or any of the credit that you have earned for inviting people. Also the credit that you earn when you invite people expire so you have to use it ASAP. I'm not sure if I'll keep it much longer.,2
311,"App is slightly better on IOS, but super glitchy on both. Website is more consistently operable.",2
312,"I do not recommend this app or the shop for that matter. Unless you have a full credit card, this ""company"" won't accept any debit cards, no matter what. I tried to pay from my debit card, called Chime, which receives my weekly direct deposit, but I was unable to pay, even after I loaded my cart with clothes that I was looking forward to getting. The site said NOTHING about how it refuses to accept debit and prepaid cards. No luck with my husband's debit card either. Shop at Amazon or poshmark..",1
313,"I love this site. I have lost weight and this is a great place to find new clothes, especially jeans",5
314,"I've bought clothes from ThredUp a handful of times over the past few years, and I have been consistently happy with the quality of the items that are sent. Not everything always fits perfectly, of course, and I've had good experience with their return policies & procedures as well. I'm happy to buy secondhand & still get compliments on my unique items.",5
315,"BEWARE. Thredup now ships with GLS, who have a 1 star rating on Trust pilot. My package was marked as delivered but was stolen by the delivery driver. Lots of other reviews on GLS state similar experiences.",1
316,"App works good. Not like a consignment store at all. They take more money from your sales than any company I've sold clothes though, but if you're going to just donate those clothes, then it's a better option. Make a (little) money, while helping the environment. Love that. I will definitely buy from them again, prices and quality are great. Shipping take 11 business days, so be patient.",3
317,Enjoy shopping for GREAT NAME BRANDS for the BEST PRICES! 😁👍,5
318,Love this store :),5
319,No just don't even.. just go to buffalo exchange or somewhere else. This app rips you off from store credit and cash if you're cleaning out your closet just don't try it.,1
320,This app is janky af.,3
321,Excellent service 👏 👍,5
322,"So far I got a free, totally free, from my T-Mobile Tuesdays, $25 credit with ThreadUp, Cardigan, so soft and nice and beautiful...got it so super fast. Then I just ordered 3 short sleeve Tops, gorgeous, so soft, perfect and one even still has tags on it. I love it so much. I also got a Free Clean Out Kit, going to sending in lots of things I've held onto, but don't fit, so I'm here for this Online Thifting....Amazing !!!! The prices and fast shipping, Amazing!!!! You gotta try it NOW!!!",5
323,"love this app, but after having not using it much over the last few months, I was bummed to see that I think the options have gotten slimmer. hopefully they're just gearing up for a summer drop!",5
324,"You guys sold my clothes, and I did not get 1 cent from it. I think that is ridiculous!!!",1
325,"Welp. They removed the way to sign in with your email. I guess the only way to sign in now is to link your Facebook, Amazon, or Google account. I'll be deleting my account and this app.",1
326,"The fee for clean out box is a little much. Nice perks tho,",3
327,I've found such great quality items for amazing prices 👌,5
328,Love this website .,5
329,Love ❤️ everything I get from thred up for many years now.,5
330,"Pretty great app. It does what it's supposed to do. It has a couple glitches every now and then, but SO many deals and good prices! Worth it.",5
331,"I do like the selection of clothes and prices. Do not expect to get any help from customer service. You do pay for shipping, and expect shipping to get to you in 3-4 weeks.",2
332,"I love to thrift, and now I can do it from the comfort of my phone! They have great brands and deals, and many new with tags. Check it out!",5
333,"Love this app! I've always been pleased with the items I have purchased. I almost exclusively buy clothing second hand, and this offers a huge selection.",4
334,My order wouldn't go through. I hit submit order and it just kept saying loading. I lost my credit cause it expired since the order wouldn't go through. No one is helping me get my credit back.,1
335,App is incredibly useless. Keeps redirecting you. Hard to find items. I received 6 items that were not as described. They were fi al sale so can't return. Condition if items sometimes don't match after you receive. Have not tried returning items but it does not seem worth it by the time you pay fees. Not sure I will continue using. I sent 3 bags of clothes and only one has listed. Turnaround time is too long. I will just give my stuff to needy people instead of getting the hassle to send and try,1
336,"Great, I recommend using the app",4
337,Love ThredUp. Not simply bc of the great prices on recycled clothing which include items with tags still on them and designer goods. But also bc it feels great to recycle and help our planet.,5
338,"I ❤️ ThredUp!! only reason I didn't give five ⭐'s is I think they keep to big of a ""service fee"" per bag! I continue to send all our clothing, shoes and bags because it's easy and the fastest way of getting rid of unused stuff and earn some extra gas money.",4
339,It does not work well on Android. Very choppy,2
340,"I sent a huge bag of items and they chose a good deal of them, are charging others >$10 for them, and gave ME <$1 in consignment value. It's disrespectful! They should be ashamed! Update: I tried this app again in 2024 and still the same problem, but worse. I sent off a bag breaking amount of items, they charged me a $25 processing fee taken away from my earnings. I ended up earning $28.. so like $3 left. This is a SCAM.",1
341,"So, I ordered a purse and a dress, neither of which were the measurements listed for the items. They are both in great condition and my order arrived quickly. However, I won't be ordering from them again.",1
342,Best App everrrrr!,5
343,Awesome thrift shop... The selection is out of this world!,5
344,"The clothes are so cute and thrifted! The date and/or time that it says the package(s) will be delivered is almost always off, and the clothes get to you earlier than expected. I only had to wait about a week for both of my packages after ordering them and I love it!!! This online store has so many good options and you can even donate your old clothes that you don't want anymore. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants more adorable clothes that fit!!",5
345,Great perusing functionality,5
346,A great company! Wonderful customer service and great looking clothing!,5
347,"Updating my review: the app is unfortunately unstable on Android - I love being able to shop second hand from my couch, but thred up doesn't always accept my card (oops! An error) or there are issues with loading or filtering search results. It also scrolls to the bottom of my cart and won't let me see other items. Clicking on an order and then backing out takes me to a blank page.",2
348,"I have been waiting for my package for a while, I keep checking to see if something changed or if it says anything about it but it won't let me track my package anymore and when I ask costumer support it keeps telling me to sign in when I am signed in.",1
349,"Yeah its nice they take pictures and sell the product for you, but the amount you get per sale is ridiculously low. They will sell lululemon for 25 and you get 2 dollars. Uhm okay. Also I have to pay a little under $20 to get an item back because it didnt sell in their ridiculously short window? Wont be using this service again.",2
350,I do all my shopping on this site. The prices are unbeatable. I wish the clothes were a little more organized by category. I wish they had men's clothes too.,5
351,"Very poor customer service, because it is only ""lip service,"" while nothing gets done/managed.",3
352,Love ThredUp! The app can be a bit buggy but I just close and reopen and it's fine,5
353,Excellent,5
354,"ThredUP is my favorite place to shop for clothes online! Love their search filter capabilities. I do wish they were a little more consistent and accurate in how they tag/describe items. Also miss the feature that used to exist where if an item you had liked has sold, it would show you similar items. Also wish that they would fix whatever algorithm is generating items under a specific category on their home page; I don't like seeing random items when I click on ""spring dresses from $12"".",5
355,Best used clothes market ever! I'm able to shop for brands at often 75% off regular price.,5
356,Loads of items priced well. Hope the filters on the app works better to show only the types chosen,4
357,Fabulous clothes. Fabulous prices. Love everything about thredup,5
358,No stuff for men.,1
359,"Took some sorting out the program at first, but sort of an adventure in the way you shop. Like all cheapies, designer, specific lines or items. Beware, additive. But mostly looking to relieve my closets and redirect for the things I do buy. Cool system to offload good pieces. 😉",5
360,🤟🏻👍🏻😀,5
361,They have gone downhill recently. It is getting harder to get an actual person to help you. And they seem to have gotten either or more disorganized. They 'haven't found' three items for my last two orders. so honestly it is a gamble if you are actually going to get the items you expect. They just refund you and leave it at that. I am really disappointed in how things are going with them.,1
362,Great shop!,5
363,"No more thrift store jungles for me. With thredUP, I now have organization. I scroll and pick out the items I like. When I'm ready to purchase, it's all just a click away. What's not to love about this App? Hmmm 🤔 nothing!",5
364,"This app is a glitchy joke, and only decent during major sales. There's no reason that 3 USED cardigans costs $45, and that's WITH A SALE, and not even from an expensive brand. We're talking brands you can buy at a mall for the same amount as the sale price. No profit if you decide to sell your used items through ThredUp. You might be able to get $10, but then the fees are $14+ etc. So, you never actually get the money. You only profit if you sell things that are high end, or pay them.",1
365,Love the variety and diversity of clothing per fraction of the cost. Read descriptions carefully as there is a restocking fee for all each returned item. But overall my new favorite place to shop and I feel good about not contributing to fashion waste.,5
366,"Seems like to me it doesn't matter what's in my bag, I end up making nothing with a $18.00 fee paid out to you guys on each bag.",2
367,"My family had t Mobile Tuesday credit. Tu shipped the first order and then cancelled my daughter's orders saying that the works only be one coupon per house address. The three girls in my house could not get their tmo benefit and to make it worse,tu waited until last day of tmo benefit before cancelling all the orders so my girls lost all their tmo benefits",1
368,I always enjoyed shopping ThredUP,5
369,Awesome,5
370,Excellent customer service. Friendly and helpful. Great prices and codes to use! Love ❤️ love,5
371,The filters are great for helping me narrow down my search for what I'm looking to buy.,5
372,"I was told to never indulge in ThredUP. I was told I would become quickly addicted. But here's the thing, if you are dedicated to reusing/recycling this is the only site to use. Pack your unwanted garments send them off and restock with new thrifted threads. The best muah!",5
373,Great for finding vintage clothing!!!!,5
374,Easy and credited,5
375,Received a Coach Wallet that was very damaged and was not worth what I paid. Disappointed.,2
376,"Items not listed or returned. I was using ThredUp for buying and selling. When selling, I preferred to use the 'return' my unlisted items option for the extra fee. In my last clean out, 6 items were not listed or returned. When I tried to reach out via the Customer Support chat, the app kept looping me back to the Q & A section. After years of using ThredUp, this customer is gone.",1
377,Love to thrift. Doing my part in saving the environment.,5
378,Almost hard to see everything at once. Maybe separated a little bit even more?,4
379,"Stupid, no mens section like what? Zero stars if I could",1
380,Very glitchy and unable to redeem my rewards,1
381,"I absolutely love thredUP! They have a massive selection. They're always having huge sales on top of already low prices (always high quality) items. The app is easy to use, Quality pics, all items incl. measurements, The rewards are great, Customer service is top notch, Fast shipping, Returns on most items, Safe payments. I could go on but I'm running out of space. Definitely check them out, you won't be disappointed.",5
382,Customer support is a joke,1
383,"Sexist AF, why are men's clothing items banned?????",1
384,Great clothes and a great price. I just returned something and the process was super simple!,5
385,Absolutely nothing for men. We need clothes too people.,1
386,"Great deals but the app has been super glitchy. Most commonly, I'll add a search filter and it won't change the results or I'll click on my saved searches and get a blank screen with the word ""null."" UPDATE 4/21/24: The issues that I was having when I wrote this review have been resolved. However, I cannot change the two star rating because the pop-ups prompting me to turn on notifications for the app have become so frequent and annoying that most of the time I choose to shop elsewhere.",2
387,"Love being able to find brands that are disappeaing from stores, and in the size I need and a great price. Reducing waste at the same time is a great bonus.",5
388,Great quality clothing handbags sneakers!,5
389,"I tried to ""add my email and start shopping"" like they suggested but it would not let me do it. Talking about the server is down or whatever. Bout to uninstall it. Thanks anyway",1
390,Love it especially the filters.,4
391,"Gosh, this app has been out for years and it's basically identical to when it was released. There should be more pictures and better descriptions. Sometimes you buy things and realize it's a weird texture or wonder if something has pockets and can only find out by buying it. The search is truly awful. Even their own featured categories like ""off shoulder tops"" pull completely unrelated items like pants and handbags. If they just invested in the tagging of clothing more, they could make so much.",3
392,Wonderful love the clothes,5
393,Great clothes. Great buying experience!,5
394,Absolute rip off,1
395,Great app,5
396,Great dealz,5
397,First used this app around 2012 when they were fairly new. After sending them several clothing items they notified me shortly after to let me know which items they accepted. I loved that they offered a choice between cash or app credit. In the end I used app credit to buy a Coach wristlet and a scarf from Express which were in great quality. They were fast shippers and delivered prompt service. One of my favorite clothing apps since!,5
398,"I very much enjoy my shopping experiences on thredup- except for 1 very aggravating issue: The constant jumping around when I'm in my cart, aàaaaaaaaaack😖 I knocked off 2 stars for that because it literally gives me a headache 😩 PLEASE fix this! Other than that, I really enjoy shopping in here, it's the ultimate thrift store experience. I couldn't be happier with the large and lovely clothing choices here. Oh, and 1 more thing: Add a men's section! My hubby would like to shop here too! Jolee.",3
399,Love ThredUp,5
400,I love the app I will definitely be telling my friends about it,5
401,Placed order on Tuesday 4/16.. Order still processing Friday 4/19. Terrible..,1
402,I shop nowhere else but here.i absolutely love it!??😃,5
403,"Great shopping for gently used clothes. Good variety, brand names, quality jeans, tops.",5
404,Love this app.ntm accepts afterpay,5
405,I'm in love. I got 2 dresses and a cute jean skirt all for $0 just used my free $25 . Wow I can't wait,5
406,Great Brands and even better prices.,5
407,Ammmaaaszzing,5
408,Always find great hidden treasures!,5
409,"Most of my clothes are from thredup now, and I do love it, but as they've grown the reliability of measurements has decreased. I've purchased multiple items that had the length/size incorrectly listed. Or items will be incorrectly categorized (e.g. maternity items mixed in with standard sizing). I wish they would include pictures of the tag or sizing information inside the clothing so consumers could make more informed choices.",3
410,"Love this app but it can be frustrating at times. There are times when you go to look at an item and you never get to see the pictures. When you go to your cart there are times when you can't scroll to the top to see the items. If you fill your Cart on a day they're the discount, sometimes the discount changes right before you pay making it almost 20% difference!!! One of my orders was missing a purse and they could not locate it. Other than that it's a fantastic app.",3
411,"app very easy to navigate, everything arrives, fits like I think it should. the prices are very reasonable. the only thing I hate is not having at least 24 hours for stuff to stay in my cart cause I work 12 hour shifts and eat shower and then sleep but within 2 hours if I haven't made my mind up its pulled from my cart and then most of the items are sold and gone. other than that love shopping with thred up. earn points to use on stuff too send my stuff in that don't fit me anymore also.",5
412,"Scam scam!!!!!!!!! Be careful Tmobile scammed us again. No free shipping as they promised, and of course, the code doesn't work. So you have to pay. They have nothing good or for men, just boys and women. And I can't delete my account they scammed us. Plz don't download and report them",1
413,thredUP has a large selection of beautiful items.,5
414,Best place to shop,5
415,There's a lot of bugs with the app. It won't even let me create an account.,1
416,Filters do not work.,2
417,I love this service. I wish that there were more ways of sorting and narrowing options.,4
418,Should have mens clothing too,1
419,Okay good products,5
420,Layout and design of app is nice.,5
421,Easy-to-use,4
422,Love it!,5
423,I love the variety of items and the low prices! It's nice to be able to buy used instead of paying full price for new. Which helps the planet! The rewards are great too! Next I want to try selling!,5
424,Suks.,1
425,Bargain central!! I've placed 3 orders so far and I'm not disappointed. I haven't sent things in to consign yet so I can't speak of that aspect of the company but I'm thrilled so far with what I've bought from them.,5
426,Great app and great place to buy clothes!,5
427,"Won't show favorites, constant glitches.",1
428,"4/14/24 Still unreliable. Man, I really want to like this app because the purpose seems so great. But like... Saved Searches will not load. And I've tried clicking through from push notifications and email alerts for saved searches that don't resolve anywhere but the app home screen. Updated the app, reinstalled the app. At a certain point, I just assume you don't want loyal customer's money, considering I've sent this feedback multiple times.",2
429,I love thrifting and ThredUp makes it even better!,5
430,Great online thrift store and great customer service. Highly recommend,5
431,Best online thrifting experience,5
432,Wonderful quality and customer service! I am obsessed with this app.,5
433,Easy to use. No glitches.,5
434,Love it!!!?,5
435,I love that you guys put together outfits! Love it!,5
436,"I buy all my clothes, shoes and purses with thred up. Can't say enough about how much they've save me while supporting my environmental goals.",5
437,Love the options,5
438,This is a scam beware.... they steal from people and line their pockets at your expense. Hundreds of lawsuits filed and fraud reports completed. Do not send them your clothing... I wish I had read the reviews instead of shopping here or trying to sell my things here. I will no longer be supporting this organization.,1
439,"Not a very user-friendly interface on the app. Difficult to filter items. And I've noticed on the desktop version that things are listed incorrectly - like a solid white shirt being described as color-block. Prices are ridiculous now, too. The ""retail prices"" of items are way inflated to make ThredUp prices look like a deal. Torrid jeans, for example, retail for 70-80 but ThredUp lists the retail price as 102! Company used to be great, but I'm going to thrift local from now on.",2
440,"They don't check their emails, the customer support isn't helpful & I sent back my returns & I'm still waiting & they said it is a clean out kit. I'm about to call The Better Business Bureau about this matter because I'm fed up with it all, & I can't get any help!!",1
441,My go to place for thrifting!,5
442,Lots to choose from,5
443,Easy to use,5
444,They lie about the measurements. They are incredibly dishonest about their return policy.,1
445,Recycle!! This is a great app to find repeat treasures!,5
446,I love the quality of the clothes and you just can't beat the price.,5
447,"The app is okay, but the shopping is great.",5
448,Ease of app use and quality of items.,5
449,Easy to use..great app and store.,5
450,"The app, in general, is good. What I find absolutely annoying is that it constantly asks me to receive notifications, and if I don't, ""I will miss deals."" I'm okay with that. I purposely have turned notifications off, and I don't need constant reminders. Please do better, ThredUp.",2
451,Wonderful site for a trans man,5
452,"Figured I'd give it another try. It's been a few years. Purchased a bundle - love the option to buy and hold, allowing me to browse over a week so that shipping is only paid once if I decide to purchase more. I did have some issues with descriptions of products - some sunglasses were described as cloth material and some tops and jackets didn't give a chest measurement.",4
453,"I've had a ThredUp account for many years. After 2020, & going with a home based job, I didn't have the need for as much office attire & in turn, I hadn't visited the ThredUp app for quite a while. After a recent visit to the app, I particularly liked the ""Shop The Look"" feature. I also liked the improved navigation on my phone. It's a great app & it WILL save you money on clothing, handbags, accessories, & shoes. Most of my work clothes are from ThredUp! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!",4
454,Unhappy. You charge to much for selling my items and then pay out very little. I may as well have donated them to charity.,3
455,This is the worse place to sell your clothes on items they are selling for 45.00 dollar I am getting paid 11.77. Like wow. I will never send them my clothes again. By far the worse place to sell my clothes at every. Like they should say just donate us your clothes bc we won't pay u even a third of what we get for your clothes. And what they don't list they don't even send back for free. On top of having to wait two months just to get a response about my clean out.. so don't use this sight. Ebay.,1
456,I'm addicted to ordering pants on tHREDUP.. I love this app😘🤘..,5
457,"I like the variety of clothes, I also like the prices and I would recommend this app to anyone!!",5
458,"One of (if not the) best online shopping apps I've come across! I always have a hard time shopping in person, and even worse online (shein, temu, etc.). But this app provides great online thrift store-style shopping. The clothes are mostly name brand but have fantastic deals from cheap to more high-end prices. They have many sales and reward benefits to help lower the prices. Usually, I feel hesitant with the end price, but with this, app I always feel satisfied and content. 100% recommend!!",5
459,I the app is easy to use and the idea of online thrifting is the best!!,5
460,"I love shopping on Thread Up, but now it won't let me sign in. I have always used Facebook to sign in,and it wouldn't let me use that. So I tried to sign up using a different email, and the show you're not a robot kept giving me new pictures and says something about an error.",1
461,Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
462,Love these guys. Only issue is not being able to use more than one code at checking. Also shipping cost at $11 is INSANE.,4
463,"I used the app to sell 8 items from Aritzia and 10tree. The items sold for between $14 and $25, which is a STEAL as these were in at least great condition, a few never worn more than to try on and bought for $70-180 each. What a coincidence that the payout % for each item varies and totals up to $14.73 (the amount I would get IF it weren't for the $15 shipping charge I purchased when I sent the items in). What a rip off... You'll only make money this way if you have literally luxury items.",1
464,Awesome thanks,5
465,When I first encountered this app I was very excited because I thought the idea was great. I sent in approximately 12 I had no choice but to accept the items that still had tags attached and were in excellent condition. I was floored! The amount I was paid?...$7.75 for ALL my items! It was not enough to even pay for shipping! Later when I saw my items being sold I couldn't believe it... Something they gave me ¢75 for was sold for $15! I am still angry and DO NOT RECOMMEND To ANYONE!!!,1
466,Always helping the community to save the planet. I appreciate Thredup...,5
467,I love buying clothes from here. I love how they pack them and it's cheap. Giving my clothes helps me know someone else is gonna love them like I use to.,5
468,I love this app! The quality of the clothes is very good as well as the shoes. The reward perks are really good too.,5
469,Difficult!!,1
470,"App won't load pictures and clothing information, please fix this",3
471,The bees knees!!!!,5
472,My favorite shopping app!!,5
473,"They take more than 90% PLUS a 18$ fee per bag, so my earnings on a large bag that included NWT Lululemon Nike and Athleta was 12$. AND if the item doesn't sell in less than 30 days, they keep EVERYTHING and charge 6$ PER ITEM to get anything back. Absolute theft.",1
474,"Great app,with great finds at reasonable prices I love it",5
475,Selling on this app is a pure scam. The percentage you get from a sale is not enough to even make the wait for your items to be sold worth it. I am insulted and will never sell ever again. I'll take this a lesson learned.,1
476,You can find some really affordable pieces in good condition.,5
477,This is the best thing around! Im a single mom with two teenagers and this allows me to put my kids in quality stuff that expresses who they are without going in the hole!! This gives me the abilty to keep all of us feeling good in our skin and feel good about doing something positive for the place we call home!! Give it a try... Seriously they have great answers to all the concerns i had in the idea!,5
478,I love ThredUp. It is so easy and fun to shop on this site. I have found The Best things here and I no longer shop elsewhere.,5
479,I sent clothes in to be sold all of the clothes were name brand I only seen a few of them listed on the site..out of 2 bag's of clothing I received 3.89 better to give them away for free! They steal your money there a rip off for sure!,1
480,my heart ♥️ thred up allows me to change my style whenever I need to and not spend a fortune doing it. they have awesome sales and shipping deals. seriously way better than regular thrift stores!,5

482,Love thred up! I'm addicted.....,5
483,Awesome,5
484,Would not let me update after i deleted an app to,1
485,I've never been disappointed!,5
486,"So far the app is easy to use , I love there preloved merch .I hope it remains this simple when I decide to purchase something.",3
487,Love the expanded opportunity to shop multiple brands. I do wish that I could see the design of dark pieces. Only a dark design photo. I have no idea on how to improve the process....different lighting?,4
488,"Love this app! Delivery only took a week and I got 300$ worth of Lululemon for 120$ . Lots of y2k finds, Nike shirts that retail for like 40$ are 25. At this point don't order off fast fashion, this app is way more eco friendly",5
489,Love it. Great clothes and great prices. They have my favorite brand that I couldn't afford before. All clothes I've ordered have been in great shape and fit great..,5
490,"I love the company and the product, but the app is so slow: loading, circle of doom, having to close and restart multiple times. I have a great phone and I update the app, but it never works well and I end up leaving the app out of frustration.",2
491,Easy to use app for ThredUP,5
492,I love it,5
493,"Doesn't have a men's section, only for women and boys and girls",1
494,"Good discriptions, quick delivery",4
495,This app is so worth it. You can thrift from the comfort of your own home and have good prices :),5
496,Mission Accomplished. Love the message.,5
497,"I sent name brand cloths that where worn ONCE and received notice that they excepted 3 pieces out of at least 40! You have to be kidding me! But I see them listing cloths from Walmart and Sheen for retail and I send in name brand worn once in perfect condition and they only take 3!?! And on top of that I have to pay a fee! Ridiculous not to mention the past few times I ordered from them the cloths I received either had holes, buttons missing and stains on them and sizing was incorrect! Dishonest",1
498,Nice stuff. Nice prices.,5
499,A great place to find good second hand clothing. Take a look and find new pieces for your closet.,5
500,Hard to edit card to shop!,1
501,"I wanted to like this since it's one of few places I can find 5.11 tactical pants used but it's a nope. Size descriptions are inconsistent and confusing, it's pricey for something that's used just because it's a name brand and the shipping, handling and taxes put me at almost where I would be if I bought it new. Not to mention the return policy is shady and there's an excessively high fee to return to shelf. No thanks, I will buy new if I can't find what I need at the local shops. 🤷‍♀️",2
502,"I am nnt happy with the condition of a dress that I received that it was described as in ""excellent"" condition as a final sell item. That is not true. It has pulls all over the fabric.",1
503,One of my favorite thrift shops! It comes right to my home. Every box is packed with care and the clothes never disappoint!,5
504,"Love ThredUp app , I love the prices, payment options, and the bundle options.",5
505,Awful..... wouldn't let me add items to cart to purchase and when I reported the issue it just kept me going in circles,1
506,"When viewing cart, it keeps scrolling by itself. A lot! Annoying. Also, things were ""added to my cart"" that I didn't choose.",4
507,I Love to shop and get good deals. However somethings on ThreadUp items are over priced considering it's used Not Brand New ! And then having to wait for the shipment. Also I've received items that were juniors size and not woman's. So it causes an issue with with inaccurate size postings.,2
508,Love thread up!,5
509,The biggest thieves I have ever encountered. I would not recommend them to anyone. They got all my clothes donated to them because they were charging me 96 times more then I would have made selling them. So if your items don't sell you pay a great price if you want them back. Also be prepared to earn .03 to .04 cents if your lucky. They are thieves.,1
510,👍🏻,5
511,Doesnt carry mens/unisex clothes,1
512,Do not send clothes here. They rip you off.,1
513,Amazing!,5
514,I've purchased from thredup numerous times and the app is easy and works great!,5
515,The return button is inactive making it impossible to make a return using the app. Won't be shopping here again u til that is fixed. Reported it to the company over a week ago. Still not working. Sketchy,1
516,You pay an outrageous fee to get a clean out bag. They sell your stuff online for a very short period of time for little money and make no money. #deleteapp#closeaccount,2
517,"Love being able to buy used clothes from a reputable company. Haven't had any issues with buying and receiving items. The app could be more user friendly when it comes to searching for items - things are often mislabeled or miscategorized. Also you can only see items from the front and back - sides are important too!! **update** They seem to have added ways to search for items, which is a plus. Also, noticed more side pics. So yay!",5
518,Excellent incentives,5
519,love it,5
520,Best consignment store EVER,5
521,this app and company used to be a lot better a few years back. now they make it impossible to get fair prices for things and straight up steal items you send in for consignment saying that they weren't up to par then later you see them listed on their site. customer service is near inexistent,3
522,My favorite place to shop,5
523,"I love thrifting! The prices always seem reasonable on this site, and the quality has been good every time. Three complaints: 1. Each bag you send in has a $15 fee taken from the total your clothes sell for, plus the percentage they take from each piece that sells. That seems like it could be a bit lower?? 2. The clothes you send only have 30 days to sell, I just wish it were longer. 3. More detailed pictures of the clothing fabric and details. 4-5 pictures instead of 2 would be great!",4
524,They are honest about the items they are selling and in the descriptions,5
525,Don't send a clean out kit if you expect it to get processed timely. I am going on two months now.,1
526,Still Extremely Satisfied! Still use it often. Still satisfied!,5
527,Amazing selection of high end items at unbeatable prices. Easy returns and speedy shpricey. I left the realreal and this is now the easiest way to shop!,5
528,"I've had quite a few poor quality items recently that I couldn't tell from the picture, things listed as wrong size, and more and more things with just a generic size label and no measurements. If we're expected to pay retail for thrifted items like this, I would expect better quality control and effort. I've had things arrive with retail price tags attached that were more expensive on thredup. (Also, like everyone else has said, the app is awful just use the web browser.)",2
529,"I sent my clothes to thrwadUP to be sold. More than halk was sold and I only got a ""store credit"". I have no choice to request my balance to be transferred to my bank. Never again I'm sending my clothes ti threadUP. I'd rather to donate to Goodwill and write it off",1
530,❤️ ❤️ ❤️ you can find some great deals!,5
531,Great Deals on gently used clothing.,5
532,Cart refreshes every few seconds and it jumps around making it difficult to use,4
533,Don't bother using Thred Up to sell-you won't make enough to even cover the processing fee. The app is painfully slow as well.,1
534,"Once I learned to navigate the site, what to watch out for & how to pair down the overwhelming selection of everything, this is an AWESOME place to shop!! After losing over 100 lbs, I've had to replace my entire wardrobe right down to the undies, and figure I've saved about a gazillion $$ by shopping thrift & consignment. These folks are super prompt with returns, their customer service is top drawer, and most of their descriptions are spot-on.",4
535,Photos often don't load.,2
536,"Great app with so many selections to choose from. Highly satisfied with all my purchases made, they come nicely boxed and are in excellent condition just as described. Highly recommend this seller.",5
537,It was good Thank you,5
538,ThredUp's customer service is above and beyond great!!! Their shipping company was very patient with me while I change my address to the correct one. Thank you for everything ❤️ Kat,5
539,"Love it, everything I get is in great condition and prices are pretty fair",5
540,App is functional but often has issues loading. Service is great.,4
541,"ThredUp is a great way to shop. If you aren't satisfied with your items, you can simply box them up and send back. I have always been satisfied.",5
542,It's a enjoyment to be able to go to a website and not have to struggle . It's easy to find what you want. So it's see love pay. It's on it's way. That's Simple 😉 Thanks,5
543,"I'm loving the deals and it was so easy to fill up a clean out bag and have FedEx pick it up! This app is perfect for students and busy moms or any stylish girl, really.",5
544,"Affordable clothes, easy to use app",5
545,No way this is a thrifting app.,1
546,"Addicting purchasing app! Lots of selection, most items I bought have been very good or new quality. Limited descriptions and pictures of items, and a couple items I ordered were not the size described. Definitely need better information. I like the return policy, except for anything that has ""final sale"", meaning there are no returns or credit, even if described incorrectly. Shipping costs are average, with a free shipping option when spend more. Delivery is reasonably quick. Bundling good",4
547,I love this app it has great prices and items shipping is fast and comes well wrapped with only clean clothing!!!!!,5
548,Love this app.,5
549,I have bought many things from this site and everything is exactly as described if not better and i am always happy with my purchase!! I love thredUP!,5
550,"I love threadup and finding great deals on name brand, and new items. The app functions well. The only thing that frustrates me is when the back button exits me out of the app. I accidentally exit out of the app 2 to 3 times each shopping session and have to restart my search from the beginning. Eventually, I give up out of frustration. Please make it where the back button takes you back in your search and not closing the app.",4
551,ThredUP is awesome!,5
552,My favorite hobby,5
553,Easy to navigate! Very organized! Love selling and shopping here!,5
554,Has in app advertising... How greedy do you have to be to add popup ads for junk companies disguised as alerts in an app where we are already paying you?,1
555,"The app barely works. It's not just laggy, there's a lot of just broken things about it. When you try to put filters such as ""Tops"" it'll return with no options no matter what, the filter is really fritzy in other ways too. If you look at a previous order and then go back in the app, it breaks. If you unfavorite an item it'll sometimes add it to your cart. It's so glitchy, no reason to use this over the website.",1
556,So quick and easy!!!,5
557,App dosent work correctly gliches,1
558,"Talk about a million dollar search engine!! It's easy to get overwhelmed on competitor apps, with thredUP you can search for specifics with no hassle.",5
559,Beautiful clothes,5
560,I still love this company but my problem is I wish they had where you could put your chest size in. My sizes can go from medium to XL but I haven't tried any other size because it would take even longer to go threw it all. Is it possible you could put that filter in? Please,3
561,"Ugh, so slow. The app is painfully slow to load and seems unconnected to to the emails that I get - with personalized recommendations and notifications of new listings. When I click on the 'shop now' button in the email, it simply takes me to the main home page in the app << specifically when I'm on my phone. The other issue that I've been having for some time now (and previously reported to their support) is that my 'saved searches' will not load in the app - I just the forever circling arrow",2
562,"Pretty much a scam, buying is okay, but prices are still pretty high and sadly half of what I've bought each time is not the size I thought or quality I thought but it's mot worth it to send back. The items I've sent in to be sold were kept and deemed not worthy of selling (even though I made sure to send items I've actually seen sold there) and the couple of items I sold made decent money and I made less than a dollar each.... which was then also kept because there was a 15.00 fee charged.",1
563,i wanna order more but that's the thing the shipping is expensive,1
564,Most definitely not authentic and not real for the taking people be aware and be warned this is all fraud and not real what is the world coming to next?,1
565,"Just received my first order and I'm thrilled. It was like Christmas. Everything fit, the condition of every garment was even better than their description. I ordered 7 pairs of shoes and sandals and they look like someone might have worn them once and stayed on carpet. Thank you! I am placing my 2nd order immediately.",5
566,"The app is not as good as it used to be. Ex.: Select an item after filtering and then go back to the list - it takes you back to the beginning. I love ThredUp, but the app needs work",4
567,Never had any issues,5
568,I have found some great deals and I just sent a large bag of nice clothes and I hope it works out well 😊,5
569,"This app is honestly amazing, I've been using it for a while, and I've had no problems with the app whatsoever. Everything runs smoothly, and I would absolutely recommend it!",4
570,Very poor when it comes to a payout from sales,1
571,No menswear,1
572,The app doesn't interact very well with Android phones. It is slow to load photos and navigate from one area to the next.,2
573,"I love shopping on this site. It's so easy and convenient and the photos are great, you can zoom in on the details to help make your decision. I'm very happy 😊.",5
574,I like the shopping,4
575,This company needs to change their returns policy since taking half of my payment for themselves and then telling me I can only have store credit for the rest is nothing more than a thieving scam.,1
576,Excellent,5
577,thredUP - my most-used app,5
578,Love my clothes,5
579,This is my second time shopping here. I love it!,5
580,"Fun, easy efficient shopping experince on a wide selection of iyems and brands I love.",5
581,Love this app. I've gotten many great deals!,5
582,Boycott human greed!! Id rather give my stuff away locally than make greedy ppl richer. They take up to 99% of the sale price. So on an item they sells for $10 earns you a dime. They only pay out 10¢ and keep $9.90 That's ridiculous online consignment should be 70/30 or maybe 80/20. The rates were better in the Beginning but they've slowly changed them without us knowing and are robbing us blind.,1
583,Love buying from ThredUp,5
584,Unbelievable selection and carefully curated. I was pleased with every item I received.,5
585,"In the future, this rating may go down to a two. Thredup has great things for sale, but they hose you on the clean out services. I will not be making the same mistake twice. I'm very sad that thredup has changed so dramatically",3
586,I love thred up...super easy for old farts like me!,5
587,Love recycling clothing! Everything I purchased fit great!,5
588,i love this website and everything I've bought has been perfect! I can save money while getting my favorite brands!,5
589,What is going on with the app?? First we haven't been able to veiw saved searches for months! Finally did an update. I just searched for sures and got 3000 listing's for bathsuits sweaters and pants! Please fix the app,1
590,It's been fun...,5
591,I love my purchases but customer service doesn't exist when you need help and don't let me forget when you refer someone the link doesn't work ..so I'm not telling nobody else because so far 2 people told me the referral link doesn't work so no more referrals because I'm not getting what was promised.,3
592,"If a user wants more screen space, let them x out all the stupid little boxes! Soooo frustrating and infuriating!",1
593,Excellent quality. Honest appraisal of every piece of merchandise. Good sales weekly. Free shipping at certain amounts. Very satisfied,5
594,Mostly all expensive handbags not my thing,2
595,"My only issue is that when something in my cart times out, it's impossible to find it again. It would be nice if it showed up as a ""recently viewed"" item(s), etc . I fell asleep with a bunch of items in my car and when I woke up the next day they were nowhere to be found 👎",4
596,I'm enjoying this app great clothing for all types of occasions,5
597,Love thredup it is easy to use. I love my purchases,5
598,Excellent 👌,5
599,I love the fashion and quality of clothing. It's easy and quick to order. I recommend it to all my friends.,5
600,"Ordered 3 different pairs of jeans 3 different times. Each one was supposed to be trousers, wide leg boot cut . Sadly all 3 were skinny leg",2
601,"Thred up makes it easy to recycle and have a fabulous wardrobe. I have never had a problem with them, even when returning things that didn't fit. It's all easy and fabulous!",5
602,Forces you to sign up. How do I know if I want to even use the app if I can't even look before I sign up to get spammed?.,1
603,"You cheat your customers. I will never recommend anybody to this company.I hope you close up forever.I don't understand how I sent all those new items to you to sell.But you sent me 7.43 Shame on you. THREAD UP is the worst company that I've ever done business with. NEVER AGAIN YOU GREEDY DOGS. CHEAT,LIE,STEAL WHY??,",1
604,At midnight Pacific Time US the app goes on the fritz and you cannot continue shopping. Also at random times the app just won't refresh. It doesn't need to be updated but it often doesn't load after an uncomfortable 30 seconds to a minute,2
605,I have loved everything I have gotten from Thread Up. I also love the prices!!,5
606,"Complete scam. They double charge you for service, under value your items but take a huge cut. I wish I had just donated them instead so at least this greedy company wouldn't have taken a cut.",1
607,"Organized, easy to use, great selection. I just tried everything on and it smelled so good, it was clean, and fit me like a glove. I haven't felt this pretty in a long time. I wish they carried men's clothes for Thomas. I'm Kortney btw ... It's a joint account lol",5
608,Love being able to thrift online! And usually the item looks even better once I receive it!,5
609,Too easy to buy things I don't need.,5
610,Since the update months ago I still can't see all of my saved searches. I have to go to the website. It'd be really nice if this was fixed.,1
611,such a long shipping time I'd forget the order. Fina order received not as listed. was supposed to be a scarf 🧣 but it's just some rug item,3
612,Love it.,5
613,"Can't look at anything without registering. Lots of sites do this but if I can't look first . Nah, not that important",1
614,This app freezes constantly. Not the relaxing online shopping I hope for.,1
615,"Selling now is awful! They take like %90 commission AND now charge $15 processing fee on top of that. Their measurements are all messed up. Example: they will list pants as 27"" but description will say 33"". Ok, but which is it?! I also got sent pants with 4 HOLES in them, and a pair of childs pants listed as adults. Get them, and they fit my 10 year old instead of me.",2
616,FINALLY a place to thrift from in the comfort of my home (without buyers remorse and it's kinda nice knowing we're all trying to do our part to help)! Highly recommended! *Just make SURE to READ measurements guys!!*😜,5
617,Very reliable and well organized app. The THREDUP loyalty program is generous. I have connected lots of friends and sisters to ThredUp. I have built multiple seasonal wardrobes structured around first-class top brands that I could never have afforded at full retail prices. Every item I purchased from ThredUp over the last 6 years has been in excellent condition and perfectly cleaned. Clothing from ThredUp is in far better condition in terms of cleanliness than Thrift Shops like SAVERS.,5
618,"The shopping experience could be so much better with more elaborate info abt the clothes: rise, fit type, description of the fabric/close up photo of fabric, as well as more accurate measurements. The measurements are too inaccurate. Shopping isn't easy. You have stuff, it's hard to know if it's what we want to buy.",3
619,I have enjoyed the clothes I have bought. Going to do a closet clean out soon.,5
620,"Most of the clothing you receive will be horribly damaged even though the description says ""excellent"" and you can't rely on the photos, black clothing especially is shot so you can't see anything",1
621,"Ruth OBrien -2/22/24 bought a bunch of dresses for great price all shipped together, came like a present to myself. Everything as expected, clean & ready to wear. Made me feel special and helping the planet recycle. Love thredUP!",5
622,"SCAM!!! DO NOT USE!!! Oneof the worst clothing websites. They cancelled my order that I spent hours looking through and spent well over $500 on. They just said 'sorry' and that I would have to go and find them all again after they were relisted. On a separate occasion I asked for a bag to be cancelled, they responded and they STILL sent it out and told me to pay to ship it back. I also send in a bag of clothing to sell and they didn't list everything keeping my bags and jewelry.",1
623,Love shopping on thredup! The sales are always unbeatable and what you see is what you get.,5
624,The carrier they use is totally unreliable and rarely has tracking info. They lost a very expensive package I ordered. The app is glitchy and slow. Returns are not even worth the cost or effort. Selling with them isn't worth it unless you have a ton of pricey items. I will not be using this company ever again.,1
625,"I've used thredup for a while. I'm becoming more disappointed in it. First, whoever measures the items are way off on a lot of their measurements. It's like they never had true training on how to measure clothing. I tailor clothes, and it's laughable at what some items I get and their measurements are on threadup vs what they truly are when I receive them. Second, the fees are getting ridiculous. Third, rewards are not accessible right away. Fourth, damage is found on ""like-new"" items.",2
626,Thank you guys !! Good Job my orders have been getting here alot faster..,5
627,What a ripoff. I sent a huge bag of very nice work clothes and they only lister 8 items. They listed them all to total less than $1.00 after their processing fee. Where are the other items I sent?,1
628,I love shopping on here. Everything is easy to navigate and prices are amazing!!,5
629,"Super great to be able to find specifics by designers, color, size, and material. Everything from hats, scarves shoes belts maternity clothes to children's clothes. And I love that you guys run sales on items and I have a massive favorite list.",5
630,"Fantastic way to clean out ypur closet... And, then, shop",5
631,"App is horrible. It's nearly impossible to edit your cart because it keeps scrolling you back to the bottom every few seconds. Search is frustrating and filters limited. You can get some great stuff, but 9/10 times I get so frustrated that I give up and shop poshmark or a thrift store instead.",2
632,Better than expected! Love!,5
633,"I love shopping with Thredup on my computer browser, but my experience with the app just keeps getting worse! Initially I couldn't ever get my saved searches to load. Now it almost never loads the app at all.",2
634,My favorite place to shop for clothes and brands I enjoy,5
635,"I got $0.21 for an $80 shirt. It was brand new and still had tags. Not worth the effort, sell your clothes elsewhere.",1
636,They take terrible pictures that don't actually show the garment and mislabel both measurements and colours. Would not recommend. Go to a local thrift store instead.,1
637,I am pleased with the items I brought. I mostly buy items new with tags,5
638,They charge you and charge you and charge you again. Never will I send anything to them again. $2.99 for the bag. Then when it sells they give you maybe 20%off the sale. Then they charge you $14.99 for I don't know what. Then if it doesn't sell they want to charge you to send it back. Then on top of that they charge you for sending your money with another fee. It's a scam! Don't do it. I doubt I will get 10% off the sale when it's done. And it takes months to get your money.,1
639,"Update: (02/22/24) downgrading from 3 to 2. Idk what happened to the rewards system, the free shipping if you choose to slow ship a bundle, or the quality of the clothes but it's all gone way down hill and it's REALLY sad. The search engine is rough. There's glitches like crazy since my last review. You can be in the middle of trying to do something and boop, right back to home you go and can't go back to what you were doing.",2
640,Love this site!,5
641,Amazing functionality love this app,5
642,Great app. Easy to use.,5
643,"I've been using thredup to sell clothes and buy for a longgggg time. It was better in the past, but also the resale game as changed overall over the years. I have found great items on the app for specific brands I was looking for and I like you can get notifications for new items for certain brands. Most recently I purchased a dress that turned out to be a jumpsuit, I notified customer service they refunded me in full. Easy. Their clean out service I wouldn't recommend anymore.",4
644,"User friendly app, easy to navigate to find great brands at affordable prices!",5
645,Easy navigation to get what I want,5
646,Love this app with all my petite heart!!!! Thank you,5
647,"Please bring back the ability to search clothes by material in the search bar, or add more materials to the filters. I've been using the search bar to find specific fabrics containing modal and tencel, but I'm no longer able to do that. I only took the time to write this review because that specific issue bothered me so much, but I genuinely love the service Thred Up provides. I'm just picky, and I know other people are too--especially when buying clothes online without trying them on first.",3
648,They need to double check before uploading photos of clothing. I also gave them a whole bag which included 2 dresses with tags still attached and were not posted for sale.,1
649,"Sum1z AI is actually working it's noticable when I'm generally searching & normally I'm not happy with u all on here I have to say that's pretty cool. It's enuf to notice cuz my taste is begged randomly popping in here or there feels like a personal shopper almost, that good. Really happy about that. Still have app crashing alot sometimes searching it'll just reset itself to the start home then u gotta repeat the search again & that's about 3 steps 2 many cuz ya click the field then gotta click",2
650,"Updated: 5 stars down to 4 stars now. I used to think ThredUp was amazing!! & they were back in 2019, 2020. I used to find so many quality 2nd hand items I still enjoy but it seems ladies have abandoned sending in nicer quality things because 2022,2023 policy changes take advantage of & treat donators so poorly, while ThredUp pays out next to nothing then overcharges. I also still run into a lot of search field bugs too. It's sad I don't find as much anymore but I still send my nice items in.",4
651,"Excellent clothing and prices 👌I have hit the jackpot since January with several great pairs of jeans, two dresses, and a lovely warm wrap. Keep your eyes open!",5
652,Better than Goodwill,5
653,"I really like how inclusive this app is with sizes. Being a plus sized person it is hard to find clothes, and especially jeans that fit me, but it was so easy to find cute and affordable jeans in my size on this app.",5
654,Great variety,4
655,"App has been extremely glitchy. Pages never load. Edit: Now, ThredUp is charging $14+ to even send your clothes to be sold?! I miss the old company and the way they did business. I find myself using ThredUp less and less for purchases, and now, with these hidden fees just to sell, I'm not using them anymore. How are you taking a $14+ fee right off the top. Most people don't make much more than that selling to begin with!",1
656,The app is so easy to use. I can use the filters to find the perfect clothes and the photos and descriptions are great.,5
657,"Was buying from this app on a regular basis, but now the filter option does not work. My app is updated, but every time I pick a filter it just sends me to the home screen. :( **** Update**** started to use the app again and it seems to be working better now. Which made me happy because I truly think this is one of my favorite online thrift/second hand apps. I only gave four stars because I wish there was a filter option for going through your favorited items.",4
658,Not letting me sign in??!!!,2
659,Pricing is way too high for used clothing. I saw a 60% off code for some shoes I wanted. I checked the brand site and their new price was the same as the ThredUP used shoes.,2
660,Why can't they figure out the cart page?! If you have more like 3 items in the cart the stupid changing banner at the top bounces you down to the very bottom of the cart over and over again making it almost impossible to scroll through the cart and look at all your selections.,4
661,Absolutely love this app and highly recommend it for great quality 2nd hand clothing.,5
662,"I tried selling my clothes, they gave me next to nothing for them, and when I went to get my pay out, they charged me double what I earned in fees. So I didn't get anything... Not happy...",1
663,Love it,5
664,shipping time is abhorrent,1
665,"i loved thredup during covid. I purchased many great pieces and sold most of what I elected to sell. payout and credits seemed reasonable. but especially as a VIP,all recent changes are unacceptable to me. i agree with all concerns stated in other reviews. i made ZERO on one of my recent sales boxes because of fee excesses. payouts have decreased. i made 30 cents on an item recently. unacceptable. plus they do not pay out as much as credit they give. I'm done.",1
666,"PLEASE READ NOW!!!! LET ME JUST SAY THAT ANYONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN THIS WEBSITE OR APP I SHOULD SAY, I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW IT IS A FULL ON 100% SCAM. THEY GIVE YOU LITERALLY 14 DAYS TO SELL YOUR ITEMS AFTER THAT YOU CAN EITHER DONATE THEM OR HAVE THEM SENT BACK TO YOU FOR LIKE A $5 COST PER ITEM OR DONATE LIKE SOME OF YOUR ITEMS AREN'T EVEN SELLING FOR ANYTHING OVER A DOLLAR. THEY DO NOT GIVE YOU THE PERCENTAGES THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU, AND THERE'S LIKE A 22.00 PROCESSING FEE.",1
667,When I download it I went to boys clothes but it went to woman's,1
668,"I love ThredUp a little too much. It's a problem. You can set your sizes and the search will only look for those sizes, and set favorites. Even if something sells, you can still look back and see a brand you favorited, then search by that brand. The setup of their site makes shopping... Too easy. !! And then you can earn points for discounts or free shipping.",5
669,Not worth it they keep your stuff resale it u never make anything over what it cost to send them your items of course they don't show u how much they sold items after 30 days they charge to reclaim item if u don't pay to get item back they turn around and put it back up for sale it would be cheaper to buy it on sale than to pay reclaim fee might as well donate it all to them that what I will be doing anyway,1
670,The app is constantly changing. Rarely for the better.,3
671,"Not worth it! Prices are too high for thrift items. Received a wool coat absolutely covered in animal hair and smelling dirty, dry cleaning was required, item was listed in excellent condition. Also had damage on the buttons that wasn't noted. Not worth the cost, wait and hassle to return. Sent in a huge bag to sell, lots of higher end items, some brand new. Received nothing in return after 3 months, made pennies per item and that all went to their selling fees! I didn't even get $1 in credit!",2
672,Nice features,5
673,Thred up is the best!,5
674,"*The* most annoying constant requests for access to notifications. No way to dismiss permanently it, either. Just use the mobile browser version- or better yet, go to an in-person thrift store",1
675,Im sure they are making money.They never sent me any from the full bag i sent or even acknowledged recieving it.,1
676,Don't bother going yard selling when the sale can come to you. Great clothes for a terrific price.,4
677,This company stole from me. I sent two high end purses and they never posted them for sell and when asked they said they were not in good enough shape to post. They were both almost new and I couldn't get them back.,1
678,"Very visually appealing, easy to navigate! No bugs or other issues.",5
679,"amazing app!! great clothes excellent outlet prices, shipping is fast and free!!!",5
680,Horrible!! Package lost. Never notified. Poor customer service. Never found package. No refund,1
681,App is bugggy,2
682,Easy to use!,5
683,"To clean 🪥 full. Really , goodie.",5
684,"so easy to use and *incredible* deals on some seriously great treasures! no fees at all- actually, quite the opposite- bundle shipping is an amazing offer! if you love thrift shopping, you've got to check out thredup, and the app makes that even easier!",5
685,"Thifting at its finest! The website will allow you to search specifics like ""Gold Lace Tank,"" and it will pull up everything in that category. You can find exactly what you are looking for and the prices are great! I have put together 5 outfits for less than $100. This is my new go-to for spending less and looking like I spent hundreds!",5
686,I overall like the look and usability of the app. It has performance issues a lot. It will lock up and I can't scroll.,4
687,THE FEES FOR CLEAN OUT KITS & RECLAIMING ITEMS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! WOULD HAVE GIVEN -5 STARS IF I COULD HAVE. HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER! THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR SELLING ITEMS WITH NO FEES & WAY BETTER REIMBURSEMENTS. 👎👎👎👎👎 FED UP WITH THRED UP!,1
688,"Love this app! Saves my sizes, fave brands and alerts me when my brand and sizes are available! Great prices! Quality products! Buy all my clothing/accessories thru the app.",5
689,Love the app.,4
690,Rip off.,1
691,"So many cute, sexy, cloths! I only shop with thredup. I love this app",5
692,I didn't buy anything. The app is mostly for women not men.,3
693,"The app overall is decent to use. Minimal glitches. However, there has been a significant increase in pricing. If you do want to sell or donate clothing, it takes months to process and you get no payout. Their expected revenue for 2023 is 319.5 million-321.5 million. For a thrift shop, this is awfully greedy.",1
694,Pretty good.,4
695,Fantastic customer care. Shipped quickly and as good or better than described. Frequent discounts keep the stock fresh and rolling over with new choices. Will be trying cleaning my closet with ThredUP next!,5
696,Easy to Shop,5
697,"Keeps crashing/freezing for me, but seems like a cool app",3
698,"To sale : think of it as just a donation, because the potential earnings all go to fees so if you cone out with $1 or $2 you did good. I had designer an good brand items with tags, I made only $4.28 .. That's out of 4 bags at maximum weight. On the other hand if you buying ... great sales an promotions nice things I just recommend washing before wearing. .. so if you want to make any type of profit better off saying on a different platform. This is a donation site.",3
699,BEST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE I LUVA YOU THREDUP! NOW I AM SELLING I HAVENT RECEIVED PAYMENT FOR MERCHANDISE SOLD SINCE APRIL 2023 DISAPPOINTED THREDUP! I received my Payout and very disappointed. There is some confusion about returned merchandise and charged fees. It is still difficult to communicate regarding complaints. I received the resolution to my complaints in a fair manner. Thank you Thredup. I will continue to shop!,5
700,The app used to work better than it does now. It freezes up a lot. It's very frustrating!,3
701,Horrible company to its sellers,1
702,The app in apple had more options and selections to sort through. You are also able to click onto the brands and open their own page within your sizes which IS NoT an option on Android and I just want them to both be the same. Fix the issues make the apps uniform between systems.,1
703,"I sent in about 20-25 items but they only posted 7 to sell. No explanation about why or what happened to the ""unsellable"" items. 2 items i have sent in, a dress and a blazer, were in excellent condition, never worn and they only posted the dress. I really want to know what happened to the items not sold, especially the Blazer. I know that they say they will donate/recycle unsellable items but I also wonder if those who open the packages get first free dibs on the items.",1
704,Great garments as featured. Great prices,5
705,I guess Thred Up thinks we are pretty stupid consumers. That's all I have to say about that.,2
706,The app is addictive! So easy to shop anywhere and anytime 💖!,5
707,Not good not even what I oredered,1
708,Love the site but the android app gets stuck sometimes in odd nonfunctional ways,3
709,Higher prices than a typical store and now they are charging nearly $20 for shipping and processing. As soon as my last bag is finished i will be deleting this app. Im better off donating to goodwill or someother charity.,1
710,Threadup used to be my favorite place to buy clothes but now with each update it gets harder to actually use the app. Im unable to order clean out kits & my favorite items keep dissappearing. Also the cost of sending in clothes just isn't worth the payout (not that the payout was that great before) overall it's become a waste of time & money to use & I'll find a different way to sell my clothes.,1
711,I came back and I still don't want notifications and service is good and this is recycling ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻 I did not sign up for notifications I will be uninstalling,5
712,Great...easy,5
713,Love thred up and love how EASY it is to use/shop with the app.,4
714,Easy to navigate.,5
715,"Beautiful clothes so far, and happy to be re-using.",5
716,"It is difficult to apply your payout and/or points to purchase. Additionally, there are numerous fees associated with selling items. Not a great deal.",3
717,Good,4
718,"Ok for buyers, but straight up AWFUL for sellers! I sent in new designer items with tags and got $0. Other items I didn't earn enough to make the effort of cleaning, packing, and shipping worthwhile. Better off using ebay or another resale app, or just donating and taking the tax writeoff. Oh, and if the buyer uses a discount code to purchase an item, it comes out of YOUR earnings, NOT Thredups. YOU take the loss even if though THEY are the ones constantly running sales and pushing coupons.",1
719,App conveniently crashes when trying to chat with customer support,1
720,You guys rip people off. Your payout is horrible plus you charge $5 per item to reclaim your own clothes. Then the fee is crazy. I sent like 5 bags of clothes and will get nothing for them. Never again. You will go out of business treating people this way,1
721,"I am an addict! 3 years later on, and this is basically the only place that I buy clothes. If I can't find it here, then I obviously don't need it!",5
722,Negative. Give your stuff away. Never again,1
723,"I keep being let down by the sizing. A Large does not always fit like a Large. Depending on where the item is from, it sometimes fits like a Small. I appreciate that they have sizing info for most of the blouses, but I wear alot of blazers and I can't use most of them that I've ordered from ThredUp because, although they are marked as Large, they are very very small. I guess I just need to not order any more blazers from here.",2
724,Easy to understand and use.,5
725,Doesn't work,1
726,I like the app but can use some work as far as what you save and refreshing the app because it glitches and doesn't show all my saved favorites!,4
727,I love ThredUp. I haven't had new clothes in years.,5
728,"Update 02/2024 (4.5 yrs later): Basically the only place I buy clothes! Still occasionally run into the same filter issue. Jumpsuits are sorted under dresses, which is weird. It is rare for email links to direct to what they say they're directing to; they typically just go to the homepage. Love ThredUp! (08/2019) A fun way to buy used clothes. Occasionally filters do not update properly if there are too many being used. Overall it is easy to find what I want and I love their business model!",4
729,"The app is very easy, and the items I've purchased are exactly as described. It's shopping at a resale without leaving the house. I've had so many compliments on my purchases. I do wish I could input my body shape and make suggestions on what might look best. I know there are apps that can help, but to have it wear your buying, the suggestions would be helpful.",5
730,"For an individual who absolutely loves thrifting, resale, and merchandising, I enjoy this application beyond measure. I get a thrill out of the ingenious way others use their concepts to make billions of dollars off of what some would consider throw-aways in the garment industry. This app is easy, fun, and inventive to utilize.",5
731,Love this app,5
732,In the past I would given 5 stars but recently I never got my order and when I contacted them about it they told me to give it a few more days so I did but when I tried to contact them again I couldn't almost like it blocked me if things change I will change my rating,1
733,"The app is very fast, as fast as you can read descriptions and sizes for clothes and move on to the next it easily keeps up.",5
734,"The prices are more than they used to be. There are very few items now that are $10 or less and that was not the case over a year ago. I get more popularity should usually include higher prices, but at this rate, what is the point of buying from a thrift store when most items are close to the original price? Not to mention how hard it is to find anything stylish. I usually enjoy the thrift hunt, but at these prices, not worth it.",5
735,"Trying to scroll in my cart, and it refreshes about every five seconds, pulling me to the bottom again. Almost unusable right now if you, like me, add to cart and then whittle down your choices there.",3
736,I love it,5
737,This is legalized theft if you sell your clothes. You will get less than 3% of how much they are selling it for and after fees will get nothing,1
738,Generally great experience but could do with better filtering options. Also app freezes/crashes quite often.,4
739,"Works okay but I always have to refresh the app, especially if I'm switching between shopping from the home page to my favorites to the general search. I also find that the filters on the app pull slightly different than on the web.",4
740,"Clothes are great, never disappointed!",5
741,Great place to find good brand names in great condition. Saves the planet and my bank account! I love shopping here.,4
742,Waste of time. $0 in payout.,1
743,Easy to find great deals,5
744,"Sizing is definitely an issue from time to time. Yes, you can return most items, but a $3.99 restocking fee per item?! I have been ordering for years and really disappointed to see how this site has gone down hill.",1
745,"So im looking SPECIFICALLY for yarn. Was recommended to this app. Okay. Awesome. Online thrift store? Who wouldn't like that? Yeah, me. If I wanted just clothes I would have loved this app. But no. Name or description needs to change because my idea of a thrift store and the creators is clearly 2 different things.",1
746,Doesn't always return to the item just looked at when returning to shopping. Otherwise an okay ap.,4
747,"Not even a ""mens"" option. Just woman, boy and girl. Men shop too. Sexist.",1
748,You sent him stuff and they charge you crazy for the cleanup bag so you never get the money for items and when your item sale they sell them for pennies!! YOU WON'T GET ANY MONEY OR CREDIT TO SHOP IT'S A RIP OFF!!! THTEDUP PROFITS OF YOUR STUFF!! YOU WONT EVEN GET ENOUGH TO SHOP!! 😡,1
749,So easy to use!,4
750,Easy to use,5
751,Online thrift shopping at it's best! And I can browse the different categories to see what's available only in my size!,5
752,"App is extremely glitchy! Everything is fine until I go to my cart then the whole page just starts glitching really bad! And how stupid is the expiration time, that right there can make anyone lose interest in your company!!",1
753,"I love the items I've found, and the prices are amazing!",5
754,Extremely easy to navigate & find favorites,5
755,"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. Returns are a nightmare. Their numbers don't add up on their own receipt/refund and at times are completely arbitrary. I am missing $30 on a return. It is hard to track because they refund one item at a time instead of a lump sum like a normal business. I can't wait to get this sorted out so I can NEVER USE THEM AGAIN.",1
756,I started with 5 stars. I've purchased many things with this app and company. Then I sent in a clean out kit and got totally taken advantage of. Such a scam. They lost a customer.,1
757,Awesome app. No errors or issues ever.,5
758,"Don't sell here. You will end up paying them versus making extra cash. This is because of the low payouts, the fee to process clothes along with the fee to have clothes returned if they don't sell. I should have just donated to Goodwill at this rate.",1
759,Great site. Been a customer for several years. Awesome finds and great prices. Ive been a thrift shopper since the 1980s and this place delivers. Highly recommend,5
760,Great deals. The site works exponentially better on the phone than the desktop version.,4
761,Doesn't work. Buggy,1
762,"As a buyer I'd give 4 stars. The condition of items is frequently listed as incorrect, but all in all usually worth it in the end. HOWEVER....As a seller I'd give 0 stars. I sent in a bag full of great condition, name brand (mostly) baby clothes. They're charging a fee of $14.99 and I doubt I'll see a penny of the sales. My sell items only have a few days left where I can get a payout and are now less than $1.50 combined. I wondered how they could sell so many items so cheaply. Now I know.",1
763,"Seems like a good idea, but my first time ordering some shoes they arrived and were way too big. They were listed as size 6, with no further specification, so I assumed it was US size 6 since they only ship in North America. But turns out they were UK size 6, so US size 8. I can't return them, they just offered me a discount on my next order. So I can order more stuff that doesn't fit! Yay!",1
764,Don't waste your time!,1
765,Not worth it ... I would have been better off selling my stuff online on my own.,2
766,Doesn't hold items in cart if you choose to buy the next day. My family and I will shop elsewhere .,1
767,My absolute favorite app. I love it and have loved everything I have ordered it comes in a timely manner and is wrapped very well when you receive it everything I have gotten has came in one piece only one time have I had a problem getting my products thad because I ordered so many things at one time and didn't get a few things I had ordered they were sent out supposedly but to whom I don't know but i learned not to order to much at one time,5
768,"The app consistently tries to get me to add notifications. It's annoying. I work IT, so my phone settings on my personal device are set to a bare minimum. Ask me once, total, not every single time I go onto the app. Also, don't ask me every 30min I am on the app, I am clearly already here. For someone who spends 50+hrs a week working and needing to check for updates on tasks, my free time is me time. Not sift thru 20+ alerts when all I want to check is texts from friends/fam. Flow/layout is ok.",2
769,Why is there no Mens clothing?,1
770,Always amazing ❤️,5
771,Great deals,5
772,Always great,5
773,love this app,5
774,The ThredUp app is very easy to use on my android phone. I love being able to save various searches and to sort within a search to be able to find the items l want.,5
775,Love having outfits right at my finger tips.,5
776,Great for kids! Great for the world. Am so glad this exists.,5
777,HORRIBLE. The CLEAN OUT IS A SCAM.,1
778,I'm not sure about this. There's not enough filters. Very basic.,4
779,"I'm so happy to have found thredUP. I decided to test it out with just a two item purchase. I loved the garments I received. They were in great condition and the prices were very fair. I have now ordered more pieces, and I am so excited to receive them. I love the weekly deals. Great selections with new items all the time. I am waiting for my first bag so I may pass on items that no longer serve me. I feel great about the carbon footprint of the process. Amazing and easy.",5
780,It's honestly phenomenal,5
781,Great purchases so far!,5
782,great place to get your favorite brands at discount cost..,5
783,I love thred up,4
784,Love ThreadUp but the app. Is a bit glitchy.,4
785,"I continue to find great, quality deals and why I have enjoyed frequenting the site. I have been happy with the inventory selection, accurate descriptions and details as well as the pricing. I find more items on this app that is to my preference in many ways. Thank you! Still love ThredUp!!! They continue to offer quality, unique items, app is user friendly and easy to navigate, filter searches etc. and delivers great pricing, rewards and selection continues to be amazing!! My #1 favorite!!",5
786,"I don't buy clothes, I only sell them, but I find it ridiculous that there such a short amount of time they can be on the site without being brought and then they don't let you have any commission. I didn't make enough to cover my bag and then I lost my chance to sell another piece of clothing that was in really good shape and designer. Their updating to app so often I never get to check if anything been sold or if my bag even arrived.",2
787,"I like this app. But it would be better if I could search for chest size in inches. Too often I'm searching by XL and the chest is 30 - 35 inches!? I don't like that the return/ restocking free is $3.99, it's too much!",3
788,I love thrifting but moved to a large population with boundry issues so thred up has been my solice and I love it <3,5
789,A difference im making.,5
790,The app is good but I have had too many orders where the clothes look one way online and once received the clothes are not the correct size according to the description or they are not in condition as stated. I think I will stop ordering from them.,4
791,Very easy to follow. Very sorted and easy to navigate.,5
792,Freezing up on me a lot lately. Search functionality has gotten pretty inaccurate compared to before.,3
793,"The pictures are so tiny, without any way to enlarge them, that it's impossible to see any type of detail, especially on dark colored items. Also making it impossible to tell the appearance of clothes is that they look like they've been wadded up at the bottom of someone's closet for a year. At least try to fold the clothes when storing. Considering uninstalling because I can't see what I'm looking for.",1
794,"Sold 21 things, waited over 2 months and still never once received any payout. I feel like it's a scam to make money off your stuff, I'd rather donate for free.",1
795,"I love this web site! Wonderful clothing, shoes and accessories for great prices!",5
796,Great selections and love the convenience of the filters.,5
797,Not worth the time,1
798,Awesome,5
799,"Shipping costs are ridiculous, and more than the actual products. I bought my first order (2 sweaters) both in ""excellent"" condition, but one arrived damaged with a giant hole in the front. I got a 50% credit, tried to buy a sports bra, and the entire $18 credit was used for shipping the single bra. Won't be using this app again.",1
800,"No instant credit, no credit for sales, not interested in buying my own items back lol. App does not do what it says and can not contact them. Just annoying auto popups when you try to contact.listed 3 bags, had sales. Stated no waiting for sales to cash out however 3 bags were processed and multiple items in each bag listed, however got no cashout amount, even after multiple items sold!! Complete scam",1
801,I love scrolling through all the pretties! It's so much fun planning outfits and knowing I'm getting a great deal and also supporting slow fashion!,5
802,Love finding beautiful clothes at an affordable price.,5
803,Great products in great condition. Never been disappointed with a purchase:),5
804,This app no longer works my phone and you stopped talking Amazon pay. So sad,1

806,"Love to purchase from ThredUP...great bargains, great prices and its good to Mother Earth",5
807,Great to deal with,5
808,"experienced many a good deal on thred up. its nice to get upscale clothing ,shoes etc. that you can't find in your area. Different than what everyone wears! However look out for size details, they don't specify juinors from women. A large can mean a wide variety of size!",4
809,Doesn't fit phone screen,2
810,I absolutely love this app.,5
811,"Awesome selection , so fun thank you",5
812,As a buyer great previously gave 5 stars as a seller they get a zero items of value was not listed so just lost only give you $1 or $2 if they sell it for 20 on top of a kit fee so by the time b they done you get nothing. Most of my kit got nothing. Got money for 1 item for 50 got $35 after the it fee but would not let me cash out out they put it as credit to buy more stuff 😑 such a scam if you sending in items,2
813,I hate this website it doesn't like to pay you for your items,1
814,Cool app!!,5
815,"I can't go from email to saved searches! It's capricious, it works sometimes and sometimes not, what a pain. Shipping costs are outrageous",1
816,"I received a Zara jacket described as excellent condition with a big hole in the sleeve. When I try to return, it doesn't recognize my return.??? I'm done with ThredUp. Even the coupons they send you don't work.",2
817,"Update 15 Jan 24... when I click on a clothing item in the saved search emails, it takes me to the Google Play page for the app, not the actual app or the article of clothing.",4
818,This is a great place to find little treasures.,5
819,Great selection & frequent sales.,5
820,"Buyer beware! Refunds are almost impossible even when they are 100% at fault and send you filthy, heavily used, worn and faded items covered in animal and human hair that have been listed as being in ""excellent condition"". You have to pay a ""restocking"" fee as well as return shipping and you have a very narrow window of time to ship items back, then they'll make you wait 3 weeks for a partial refund. Total scam. They intentionally make refunds difficult with zero customer service or support.",1
821,Used to be 5* but now 1*. I don't know what changed but the browse function is useless. Saved sizes don't default. Whatever changed please please please put it back the way it was. It's unusable now!!,1
822,"Too many steps/too cumbersome to use and to buy what used to be so simple: select item, put in cart, order. Now when I select item, am taken to another page which doesn't reflect the item at all. Don't know what prompted this change, but it is NOT user friendly nor efficient. I have been a 'prolific' shopper over the past three years or so, but probably will no longer shop at thredUP with this app.",1
823,Explains quality truthfully,5
824,"Horrible app ,they give you certain days to sell your clothes if the times expire they will keep it and you will have no profit at all , also for every piece of clothing you're are earning only like a 1 dollar or 2 , it's ridiculous What a scam 😒 😑 🙄 😐",1
825,I have no issue with thredup but this app is so glitchy and has so many bugs that it's pretty much impossible to use.,2
826,Love thredup!!,5
827,"The payout is pathetic. Every item I sent sold, my payout was less than a dollar for every item. Some brand new never worn. And my payout was less than their fees they charge. I will never buy or sell on here again. I would have much rather given this to the needy than to have made this company money with no fair share back",1
828,"Thread up is bar far my favorite online consignment store with so much variety. However, I am only going to give the app 4 stars bc there seems to be a bug that when you click on an item of clothing to see the picture and description it loads but only displays a blank screen. I have amazing internet as well as unlimited data with four bars every time this has happened. Restarting the app seems to fix it but it doesn't make for a very smooth shoping experience.",4
829,"Love the clothes, lots of glitches with the website",3
830,"The app stinks!! I used to be able to get my nightly email with that days selections in the sizes I picked in my profile, now when I click on the item it takes me into the stupid app and not at all what I wanted to see. But now I can't get it to do anything because when I click on the item it takes me to the stupid app.",1
831,"What a scam! One item was listed as the wrong size in the description. The other item was listed under women's jeans, but it was actually boy's sized. I went on the app, but they will only refund me about 70% of the total cost (and that's with the $3.99/item restocking fee waived), AND I have to pay for the return shipping. I'm very unhappy to have wasted money on 2 items that I'll never be able to wear because they were described/listed incorrectly BY THE SITE. I wish I could give zero stars.",1
832,"I used to exclusively shop ThredUp. I loved them and recommended them to everyone. And then there were restocking fees. Then the restocking fees went from 1.99 to 3.99. The shipping got more expensive. The reward system was changed, not for the better. Tons of final sale items. The pay out for selling is trash, if they pay at all (won't pay for lower end brands). Now you have to pay a fee to sell......I bought stock in ThredUp when they went public because I loved the company. No more. I'm done.",1
833,Easy to navigate. Good app,5
834,"New app is glitchy, slow, and the same annoying pop-up window prompts every time I open it. Lots of technical issues. I love this concept and company, but please fix your app.",3
835,Love the packing . Prices ok at outlet. Still a little pricey for things second hand. I still like to shop here..,4
836,I've ordered at least 20 times and had a couple of returns and never had a problem.,5
837,"Easy to search, with seamless and fast results.",4
838,"since your recent update, you can't click on an item on a saved search email and be taken to the item in the app. it only takes you to this page, to download the app. I am about to turn off all of the emails for saved searches, as they are now useless until this is fixed.",1
839,"Poor judgment on what they think is in excellent condition. When I receive the item it is in poor condition. (Example: several sweaters that have pilling on them and colors that are faded.) That is not what I call ""excellent"" condition!",1
840,Slow opening & I can't believe the shipping prices; as well as the pay out..i've sold 12 items & haven't made a dime..go figure that one out ..smh,4
841,App is currently glitchy AF. Filters and sort feature don't work well if at all. Won't be shopping with this updated app anytime soon.,1
842,I send my clean out bag in and I also requested 2 more. Never received the other bags and NEVER received infor ation cincerning the 1st bag! Co taxting customer service is impossible. I feel robbed and ripped off!,1
843,Love it!!!!,5
844,The website will not show what I put in my search or what was saved in my size,1
845,I have just ordered for the 3rd time. I have been very impressed with almost everything I have received. The clothing is just like the description says. Can't wait to get this order. Thank you ThredUp. We'll it's 2024 and I am patiently waiting on another order. Still wearing a lot of the clothes I ordered in 2019 Great name brand clothing for thrift store prices. Thanks again THREADUP,5
846,I don't want app I just want my email,1
847,I ❤️ It,5
848,Love it fast delivery excellent clothes great deals,5
849,Excellent prices wonderful choices,5
850,How are so many of us falling for this SCAM?! Payout for items you sell is ridiculous! One of my sweaters sold for $12.78 and my payout was $0.68 🤣 And I won't even get my .68 cents because it goes towards the $14.99 service fee they deduct from your earnings!,1
851,I had to Uninstall the app. It was so glitchy and crashed a lot. It took forever to load and always had trouble checking out. Is there going to be a fix any time soon?,1
852,Every single item I ordered had incorrect measurements on the app. It's hard to order clothes that fit so I looked at all the measurements before placing an order and they were all wayyyyyyyyy off.,1
853,Love this app. And it's easy to use!!,5
854,Great clothes for the prices,5
855,Love this place! Super cheap with first time discount!!!!,5
856,"The app is great. You can find so many options of size, color, patterns, and price.",5
857,"I've purchased a lot of clothing from them over the years and I love the idea of this company, but their measurements have become unbelievably unreliable so I no longer trust that the items I order will actually fit as expected. It would save me the hassle of having to return full orders of ill-fitting clothing if they just measured correctly.",3
858,"This is a good app for finding clothes that you otherwise would have never seen. You can find clothes in other states (US) and get shipped in a timely manner. There are also filters for color, size, brand, and item (i.e., shirts, pants, dresses, etc.). The only drawback is that they try to do clothing measurements, but sometimes the waist or chest is off. Ex: I'll be looking at the same item, including brand and size from two closets, but one has a 23-inch waist, and the other is 27",5
859,I updated the app today amd most of the actions just don't work. If I search something the screen goes white. If I click anything but browse it does nothing. Something is wrong with the update.,1
860,🙂👍,5
861,The app is not working. Most of the time it won't open. When it does open it fails to load anything. Please fix.,1
862,I absolutely LOVE this! I have used it for 10 plus years when it was Twice. I recommend this to everyone everyone. It is very hard to find exactly what you're looking for though it could be improved more on that. A lot of people give up shopping cuz it's difficult. Only complaint I have. I give 5 stars on everything else.,5
863,They have changed into nothing but a scam. They sent me a piece of clothing that was clearly manipulated in the photos on the app to look fine. It wasn't. The neck line was so stretched out it went down to my belly button!!!! I tried to send it back and my options were to pay $11 to ship it back and their $3.99 restocking fee (which is a scam in itself) or take a $5 loss and keep the item for credit which expires in a week. Im done shopping with them. Apparently all thrifting has become is scams,1
864,"The app is very easy to navigate and the filter settings really enhance the likelihood that I find the types of pieces I'm looking for. Great app, high quality shopping experience!",5
865,App doesn't work,1
866,Website is a joke.,1
867,I found some name branch stuff for cheaper price. In general I like to shop at the. Thrift store,3
868,"I like the service, but the app is glitchy. Since the update a few days ago I can't get it to open at all, even after Uninstalling and reinstalling.",4
869,Received 3 orders that had the wrong size. Having trouble returning them as they were final sale. Very difficult and time consuming to navigate.,2
870,"I'm a huge fan of Thredup, and the App works well too.",5
871,"It's easy, the clothes are nice, and some are reasonably priced.",5
872,"I had 3 kits I sent in. Half the clothes didn't get accepted. I didn't choose to have them sent back because I thought for sure they would be accepted considering they were clean, smelt good, many of them still tags, and clothes were in great condition. I knew there was a processing fee, but when I read all the information, it didn't say that those fees would be taken out of my payout. So the few things they accepted and sold, I made zero and they get everything. Take to a local consignment shop",1
873,"The worst experience! I mailed 25 items, waited almost a YEAR to have them listed, half sold in like 3 months and my pay out is 2$ that I can't even cash out! I could have donated everything in 5 up the road if I knew that I'm waiting 1 years for 2$! The worst waist of time, effort!",1
874,LOVE THREDUP,5
875,"I love the idea of this store, but the app is extremely frustrating. As a consequence, I buy things less often than I would like. While scrolling through search results, if I wait too long and my phone auto-locks, the search is cleared, and I have to start again from scratch. Often, even opening the app takes time. I have to close it several times before I can get in successfully. I love all of the filters offered to help narrow down searches, if I'm able to use them before the app resets.",3
876,Enjoy shopping on here!,5
877,I love thrifting! It's a great convience to be able to do it from my own home!!!!,5
878,Great!,5
879,Easy to navigate and narrow down by small details.,5
880,"01/05/24 Got closed out of chat while waiting...checking on a refund for an order placed on 12/18, supposedly shipped 12/21, had not arrived by 12/31 & had no tracking number, was promised refund but still yet to see on credit statement (but other refunds have come thru) When asked by chat support if I want follow-up email instead of waiting in chat- no, because I need to talk to someone directly. I had been waiting nearly almost an hour or so when chat closed and would not reopen.",2
881,"Nothing has happened yet with anything that I have mailed you. What is up with that? What takes so long for you to get around to doing anything with my clothes? Well, you only used a few of my clothes out of 5 big full bags, and I made less than $15. Sending in your stuff is not the way to go, I just lost a lot of good things....I would have been just as well off donating them locally and not costed myself all the charges for shipping. Now I owe money for nothing in return.",1
882,"""Our goal is to provide customers with a seamless visit when shopping on our app and we're so sorry for this experience."" Clearly, you guys aren't too ""sorry for the experience"" bc your customers are complaining about the same issues over & over again, yet you haven't done a thing to fix it! I can't even order a pair of jeans from y'all bc the size descriptions are so jacked up and all over the place! Just fix your janky app already!! Sheesh!",1
883,New version of app has lots of issues. This is the second time my status has been reset and all my points lost. All my order history is missing. I just placed an order and can't track it. It's really frustrating.,1
884,"Selling and buying though ThredUp is terrible. Many items with tags, in brand new condition NEVER made it to my sell account. We're talking designer brands! Ralph Lauren just gone! Items that were put on platform and sold had VERY low payouts... .15 cents?? Items I bought listed as in ""excellent condition"" had stains, holes, buttons missing. I try to inspect pictures as carefully as possible, rely on the description, and condition rating but I'm done! Beware!",1
885,They sell your stuff and only pay you penny's. Never can log into my account but customer service is not reachable. Took a 100 dollar brand new leather purse and kept it never paying me. Sell elsewhere if you are smart!,1
886,"Usually decent products, I use to order all the time but it's gotten to pricey for the product's. The shipping cost is ridiculous! I won't be ordering because of the cost of the shipping & it's unfortunate",5
887,"ThredUp wiped my point balance to zero & downgraded my status for no reason other than a new year. It also is no longer the bargain spot it used to be--the same used items on ThredUp can be found for new, & at lower cost, via Amazon, major retailers, or vendor direct. Shipping is costly, long, unreliable. There's a fee for returns. And customer service is THE WORST!",1
888,For caring about the planet y'all sure do send out a LOT of dyed paper. I'm talking hundreds of pieces of paper within a few weeks that all could have easily been an email,1
889,"You want me to give you my ""preloved"" items, yet there can be no signs of wear or they won't be accepted...so you really only want like new items you can get dirt cheap and resell at a premium, or at a huge markdown for a fast turnover...you sound more Luke the salvation army or goodwill than a real thrift store.",1
890,Very low payouts! Costly to reclaim items!,1
891,Threadup is a great place to browse and shop for thrifted items and the saved filters feature makes it so you are only looking at those types of items. There are some issues with the cart where you can't scroll well after putting in a discount code and the fact that the information about the clothing only has a front and back picture makes it harder to gage the style/quality.,4
892,"My last two clean out kits, which contained clothes with tags still on them they didn't sell and the items that sold out of two clean out kits I got .19 cents, so I will not shop or sell with threadup again",1
893,Always have great deals on luxury brands! I just bought a Disney x Coach saddle bag I have been wanting for a long time! Haven't received it yet but I'm sure it will be beautiful!,5
894,"Every now and again i have to use the site instead of the app to make a coupon work, but overall it's a pretty user friendly app",4
895,Y'all are OUTRAGIOUS! YOUR PRICES NEED TO COME DOWN!! MOST OF THESE CLITHES ARE USED! AND YOUR CHARGING THE SAME PRICE AS NEW IN THE STORE?! IM PRETTY SURE YALL ARE DONATED THESE CLOTHES ALSO!! UNTIL THESE PRICES COME DOWN I WILL NOT USE THIS APP,1
896,"Won't purchase that often from them bc I don't like their return policy/fees. Don't like I only had a week to use $10 credit, it expired before I could use it. Don't like I can't see what carrier my package gets shipped with. Don't like they don't show up close pics of any wear and tear an item may have.",1
897,"I don't like how new price items sail so cheap, also I never received the other kits also I don't want them",1
898,"Easy site, clear pictures, simple checkout.",5
899,"Downloaded the app, tried 10 times just to open it, error screen and automatic close.",4
900,I have shopped Thredup for 8 years.,5
901,I love Thred Up for the same reasons anyone loves these apps. I enjoy Thred Up for the fact they send you bags...etc... to send your different items to help you sell your clothes...etc...it's pretty cool. It helps clean out the closets and maybe enjoy some money to go along with it. 🙂🙃,5
902,Don't waste your time. This company used to be great but now their fees are higher than any potential sales.,1
903,Super glitchy. Just downloaded it and it constantly freezes on the opening screen.,1
904,"Scammers, they steal your clothes and you never get paid",1
905,Clothing exactly as shown. Sort by petite + size. Easiest app I use. 5 years now.,5
906,I love this app i use it all the time.,5
907,It's a little clunky at times and resets instead of going back. It also will show a favorite item sold when it's not.,4
908,"They keep offering free shipping, but it either never shows up, or they take my earned points and charge me shipping anyway. Downloaded but now uninstalling because I can't effing shop without creating an account here or on the website. Seriously, I'm trying to give you money; just let me shop! I. DON'T. WANT. ANOTHER. ACCOUNT. WHOSE INFO. I. HAVE. TO. REMEMBER.",1
909,Frustrating to be unable to return to a specific item if it wasn't favorited. The page numbers will not allow you to hone in on a specific page.,4
910,"Amazing store that allows me to get my clothes for a cheaper price is always having a sale to make stuff even cheaper, totally recommended",5
911,Very very slow at processing. They charge so much for everything you make no money. your giving your clothes away for free. this place is a scam!!!!,1
912,1 1/2 month out and I'm hooked. Very pleased.,5
913,"The website works great, the app works well enough. It has a few bugs and glitches, but nothing enough to prevent you from shopping on your phone.",3
914,Nice for donating but you get no payout after fees and sales are factored in,1
915,Amazing!!!! So easy to use and great prices!!!,5
916,Love this app,5
917,The item was here quickly actually I was surprised I wasn't expecting it so soon. Plus how you wrap everything so nice and the item was just as it was said to be oh and at a great low price .I believe I found my favorite shopping place ..Thank you,5
918,"Not good if you intent to sell here, less than your good quality items get choose and you earn nothing from it basically just donate them to goodwill it will help more people than on here.",1
919,"Love this app! All the info you need, easy to use and great pieces. It's fun to use!",5
920,I have shopped and found so many wonderful items on ThredUp.,5
921,Great deals! Love being able to update my wardrobe and find new styles.,5
922,I lik,4
923,Very difficult to maneuver and I just ordered two things today but it does not show they were ordered anywhere. I have been waiting over a month for a package that is stuck with no reason in Seattle it's been nearly a month also I was shopping yesterday and just looking at things in my cart and it put it already sold and put it on my card. I am so angry with this site. The last three items I bought listed in perfect condition one had broken zipper one was completely torn down whole sleeve and🤬,1
924,Very difficult to navigate the app and to find where to view other people's liked items like is often shown in sponsored videos on social media,2
925,"Poor to no customer service, deceptive descriptions, poorly evaluated products for sale, and poorly packaged for shipping!",1
926,great thrifing experience,5
927,great app,5
928,Great site for fashionistas!,5
929,"Ritzy....and doesn't always like to load Update: I love this app...it wasn't the app, it was my phone....I've ordered from it multiple times and plan on continuing too do so.. i love this app❤️ HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",5
930,I enjoy the easy way to shop and my deliveries are pretty fast. I haven't returned anything.,5
931,Never used it,4
932,If you think you will get anywhere nere what you're items are actually worth think again because after all the fees and markdowns and the amount they received you will be lucky to make $1. Your better off donating your items to a organization then getting ripped off 😔,1
933,"Filters don't have enough options, details are often missing, you earn rewards then can't use them all, they expire, now there are big fees to return clothes when you can't even try them on. Became not worth it.",1
934,Always good,4
935,Very user-friendly app.,5
936,My favorite place to shop!,5
937,Do not like the process I sent a lot of very good items and didn't even make $10,1
938,"Edit: the app is quite glitchy; seems like a new bug/problem all the time. 😣 Still shop on it, but it's frustrating. 🙃 I've gotten some incredible deals/finds that I'm overall happy with. 😁 The photos are high-rez, so when you zoom in you can really see details, which is valuable when tags have been removed. My requests would be: side-view photos, not just front/back; more details about clothing features, like pockets/ thumb holes/ etc; more standardized measurements, or measurement photos.",3
939,Love everything,5
940,I would have gave you 5 stars but my saved section hardly ever loads but the rest of the app loads just fine....it's a lil frustrating,4
941,"It's been o.k, just have had trouble cashing out and reclaiming",3
942,"At first my experience with ThredUp was good. But my second cleanout kit that I sent to them was a disappointment. I sent two like new coats, a sweater that I had bought from Thredup n outgrew,n a dress that was worn once n a dress coat I wore maybe 3 times. It all, but the sweater was in very like new condition. The leather coat and sweater sold right away, never saw the dress coat n dress again. Never listed, they were sent to recycling. They were like new!! Ripped off. Closed account.",1
943,Great way to get rid of clothing you no longer wear & you get a little bit back for doing it.,5
944,So much to choose from. Good quality items it doesn't feel like you are shopping thrift.,5
945,Love this app!!!,5
946,I ordered a pr of pants a month ago and still have not received them. I have gotten zero response from customer service! Pls cancel this order and credit me.,2
947,Great,5
948,I love my new clothes and accessories! It's such a great price and every item is just like new!!,5
949,Great online thrift store!!!,5
950,"I love the concept and order from here often, but the app is poor. It crashes all the time and is not user-friendly. The website works better and gives good suggestions for similar styles. The customer service is the worst I have ever had to deal with from a store; pretty much non-existent and when they do answer it's generic and unhelpful. They obviously don't feel that each customer is important.",2
951,"It's easy to customize the search to find the brands and products you want, including clothing condition (new with tags? gently used? or, used?).",5
952,love it! Great Selection. Great prices!Highly recommended,5
953,"Terribly designed app. Extremely frustrating and wouldn't show me any men's clothing either. Great idea in theory, but you have a lot more luck at your local thrift store.",1
954,I love this app,5
955,The app is okay but buggy some days. My buying experience on Thredup has been mostly good. The selling experience is not good. You won't make any money. They charge you $14.99 and then you also have to pay to get items back if they don't sell quickly. You can lower the price on items after they price them but you literally are looking at a dollar or two after they take their percentage so you may not even cover the $14.99 fee. I'll only buy on Thredup now.,3
956,"Not worth the trouble. Recently got the wrong item, and when I tried to return it, they were still going to charge me a fee for THEIR mistake. They already get the majority of the profits for my clothes that they sold, and I would have been okay with that, after all, they do all of the work. But after selling my clothing, they then took a fee, in addition to the money they already made, out of my supposed profits. I used to like ThredUp and think it was worth it. Not so much anymore.",1
957,"Most of what I bought ,I've loved .I'm taking a Leukemia drug and I've lost a lot of weight so the site has been very helpful. The only criticism I have is that when I sent them a box of name brand clothes to sell I never heard from them. It's been a year or more.",4
958,Irritating app to use. Constant pop ups about receiving notifications. Just as annoying as the company itself. Save yourself and go to an actual consignment shop.,1
959,"Good luck getting any payout. And sales prices change after the sale, the company may buy your stuff at a low cost before its listed but good luck seeing that money. Use mercari!! Much better program!!",1
960,"Women, girls, and boys. I don't recall any details about threadup not including men's clothing but it's evident that the app is not intended for (cis) men to use for themselves or others. Be warned. That said, this app is probably great if you're shopping for anything that isn't male fashion! Otherwise, waste of time!",4
961,I've bought several higher end purses and been VERY HAPPY with my purchases!,5
962,Overall a great app. I wish you could filter by measurements.,4
963,Quality clothes. Easy to use. Reliable.,5
964,Not worth the effort to send off the bag. After the fees and their commission I ended up with $1.78.,1
965,So far enjoying the app. The actual company I will let you know when I get the items I purchased. However it takes over 10 weeks to get your items you sent to them processed. I got tired of waiting and decided to purchase something anyway. We shall see... love it!!! can't stop shopping!!,5
966,"I like the descriptions for each product, especially the measurements, so that I don't order something too small for ne. Thank you.",5
967,Love this website!! Been using since 2020 and it has NEVER disappointed!,5
968,I've been shopping with thread up for quite a while now and I just love it,5
969,"Awful company and website, don't send in any clothes to them for sell! Trying to cash your money out is also a nightmare!",1
970,Everything I have ordered has lived up to their standards,5
971,Easy to use. Wish they posted more photos of items,4
972,"I have spent hundreds on this app but I just can't anymore. The price to get to free shipping is way too high now, and even with sales the prices for items are often out of touch with reality. I just put a discounted dress in my cart, went to check out, & the cost with shipping was more than if I were to just buy it new. The sizing has gotten a lot more hit or miss as well. It's become a gamble whether something will actually be the size it was labeled as.",1
973,"The thread up app helped me with gifts for the family. I saved so much money with qr codes. I'm here for this app , shopping is better with thread up.",5
974,Always able to get one of kind funds,5
975,Horrible,1
976,Love the huge selection and great savings. Cleaning out my closet was painless too.,5
977,"I used to like this app. Then they got greedy charging too much money nevermind they took 3 months to process my kit. After waiting all that time, I opened the app to see nothing!! NOT ONE SINGLE CENT. ( my kit included brands fabletics, WHBM, guess, Free People & Levi's-all new!) I will no longer recommend or use Thread up. It's not worth it. And I get 50 points for what? Can't do anything with their points, anyway.",1
978,"Found this App on FB & have been using it for 6 months or so & for the most part this app is freaking awesome. Packages actually come pretty quickly & u can find name brand stuff for a decent price. My only complaint is that u can't send ne thing back, doesn't matter if it's there mistake or not",4
979,Easy to shop,5
980,"Update to my original review. Someone finally reached out to me by email, and my order was re-sent, by FedEx this time. Still only 4 stars because the customer support on the app is seriously lacking. The chat bot takes you in circles & there's no phone number for support. Fix that and definitely a 5 star app.",4
981,Fun!,5
982,If the concept and deals weren't so good it would have a lower rating for sometimes not loading and the search features leaving something to be desired but if you have an hour or two you can really cut down on waste and honestly shopping time if you include drive time.,5
983,Love ThredUp,5
984,"Eh! It's gone downhill! 😕 Started out great. Was find some good stuff. Loved that I was able to search under specific categories for that thing I was looking for. Now the Handbags categories is filled with pants, jackets, shirts, etc. What happened! I liked that I was able to just look at all the handbag options. Now it's a mess!!! Hate it! It's the same mixed mess unders the Shoes & Accessories categories. Fix it!!!!",3
985,"I love the convenience of shopping second hand from anywhere! I've been a Thredhead for a few years now, and it's a great way to update the closet while not hurting the planet! 😊👍",5
986,"Love this app!!! Prices are pretty awesome.. especially during sale events. Quality is good and descriptions of products are sooo helpful in making choices. Totally recommend this online shopping superstore. Will Men's products be added? Would be great, if so. Thanks.",5
987,easy to use,5
988,"The idea is solid...but the app itself is a constant buggy mess. Some days, nothing loads. I haven't been able to see my favorite searches in months. I have it on 2 phone, both have the same endless problems. It's amazing I'm able to buy anything at all. So frustrating!!!",2
989,Forces you to allow notifications or none of their pages load in the app. Gfsf.,1
990,"Please Fix your app! I use to buy several times a month but in the last few months the app is so glitchy (doesn't load, hearts don't save or show, search says nothing available one search and then 1000+the next search). Since you are an app / online company you need to make sure this is working or your sales will suffer.",2
991,"I like the idea. However, this app is super glitchy and often times the measurements are not correct so I have to return things.",3
992,"the app has so many popups all the time in the interface, and also doesn't load half the time",2
993,The app fails most of the time. It freezes and the saved searches don't open.,3
994,reallllly slow on Android,1
995,Great clothes and deals!!,5
996,Love the selection,5
997,I love this place,4
998,"Good quality clothing,large selection, great service, good prices, and good for the planet! What's not to like?",5
999,My experience is very negative. I don't recommend this platform.,1
1000,I have sent in a huge box of clothes and a bag and haven't received a dime for any of them. I won't be doing it again,1
1001,"DO NOT USE TO SELL YOUR CLOTHES!!!! Selling to this company is a joke. I would have gotten more out of the clothes I sent just taking them to goodwill. they made about 600+ off the clothes I sent them and I got $6. On top of the already low rates they pay, they charged a $15 processing fee per package sent. I sent 5 boxes (all relatively small because they limit the weight you can send per label) so they pretty much just wiped out any money that should have come to me.",1
1002,Absolutely love thred up! Extremely quick delivery and items are always as described and clean.,5
1003,"I have ordered before and it was satisfactory. I have been trying every day for the last week, at different times and it has been more and more frustrating with no purchase made. I doubt I will go through the hassle again for a few scarves and a LOVE tshirts. Michele Kommer",3
1004,"Great place to find clothing from Chanel to Gap to everything in between. Initially the app worked perfectly but in recent months, it kept hanging up and i had to restart several times. It still didn't work properly so I deleted it. Too bad but I can still shop online.",4
1005,"I had sent in a brand new dress with tags on them worth approximately $180. This dress wasn't one of the items that got picked because it said something about them getting too many similar items. I'm very upset since it was a brand new dress that I was hoping I could earn some money for. I will never use this app once my items listed sell, and I would rate this app a 0 stars if I could.",1
1006,This website steals your clothes. I asked that all my items be returned when I set up my account. Non were returned and the one that is listed has a charge to return it to me. I sent some expensive shoes and I don't know where they went. I don't see them in the items they listed as expired. I would rather give my things to Paws For Cause. You can make $70 off a pocket book and you only receive $10.,1
1007,"Hands down the BEST place to find an entire wardrobe on the pennies. Their sales are real, the clothes come WAY nicer than you'd expect. Most of mine surprisingly STILL HAD TAGS! I am I'm 100% love with ThreadUp. I have gotten real leather jackets for so little it would blow your mind. I have bought at least 8 to 10 pairs of jeans...they ALL fit because of their measurements on the items. I DONT HAVE TO WORRY STUFF WONT FIT. They have all brand names and they are at ridiculously low prices. A+",5
1008,Love thred up!,5
1009,"Wanted to sell some high-end purses. After reading the reviews about their shady business processes, I've decided to pass on selling my items here and also purchasing items knowing customers have been scammed by threadUp.",1
1010,The clothes are good but the shipping is ridiculous so your not getting a discount. One way or the other your paying full price!,3
1011,"Love this store, except for shipping fees, make sure you know an item will fit otherwise it cost more to return or keep it and get maybe half what you paid for it (store credit) if your lucky. Otherwise I love browsing things you won't find locally or vintage items, and a variety you won't get anywhere else.",5
1012,"The app is ok, it seems to bug out and freeze often, especially when you move to another app and go back to reopen the app, it takes a long time to refresh. I also wish they had an option to see similar items to the one you're currently viewing. I've seen this when an item is unavailable, but it would be nice to see when you're looking for a similar item.",4
1013,"Might as well donate to Goodwill vs. going through the trouble with a clean out bag. Months of processing time, after fees, $0 payout from two full bags of clothing, many of which were new with tags.",3
1014,"I bought three different items from thred up, all different materials and textures and OH MY WORD are they are stunning!!! Everything came in a box and everything was ironed and folded nicely! I got everything on a sale which was another exciting aspect. I've also sent them some clothing of my own but I have yet to really seem much turnover on that. My profit margin seems to be pretty small there. Overall I'm mostly satisfied and I definitely will be buying from them again soon!",4
1015,"Sent in a clean out kit, and once it was finally processed I see there's a $15 service fee, which means I won't make a single cent on anything I sent in. Very misleading. Don't waste your time.",2
1016,Love the ease this app provides for thrifting the perfect item!,5
1017,"Great prices, clothing is in good shape and app is easy to use!",5
1018,"It is very easy to use this app. Makes shopping fun, and I can do it anywhere.",5
1019,Still enjoying this app. 3 years later. Still the best second hand shop.,5
1020,"Soooo....I've found some killer finds on this site. Granted with any online consignment shop, you hit and occasionally you miss. It's inevitable that every now and then you order something you don't love. In those cases, return it baby!!. Easy, peezy, lemon squeezy! I've been a customer for years...They have designer like $2000.00 purses, an ""outlet"" section. And like every brand in between. I've discovered so many different labels I wouldn't have otherwise.",5
1021,I have two pair of Miss Me jeans two other pair of jeans and a coat that they want to pay me .39 I will not send my stuff back here,1
1022,I used to love using this app but the the in app notifications make it impossible to view your cart. Everytime you scroll and a pop-up comes up it automatically scrolls back to the bottom of the list. Even if you x out the notification it comes up 2 seconds later. The return function isn't working on the app or the website so I'm spending days and weeks trying to get a refund or credit for my returns. I've gotten stuck with items I was going to return because I missed the return deadline. Fix it,2
1023,Always a good experience and no issues with returns!,5
1024,"Easy to use, but as with all stores, a lack of women's 12w shoes",4
1025,"I can't love Thread Up more! I love how easy it is to find what I want, the variety of choices, and the convenience of having the clothes delivered to my home where I can try them on in comfort and privacy. In addition, if for some reason I don't love it, I've found returning the items is pretty easy. Most of the clothes' descriptions include a measurement diagram, which allows me to be sure that the item will fit, and usually it does.",5
1026,"I sent them over $1,000 worth of nearly new designer clothing to sell, and they sent me $131. Found out they scam a lot of people this way. Criminal business, do not recommend.",1
1027,My app is not working as it used to... It used to show me all items from one particular label by clicking on the designer name while sifting.,3
1028,I ♥️ it!!,5
1029,The app wont open on my phone,2
1030,App navigation is not great. If you hit the wrong back button you lose your whole search. Also their customer support feature is not helpful and I can't even see my credits from my returns on my account profile.,2
1031,Not worth it.......,1
1032,"The clean out bag is a joke. I've made ZERO money off if my items, and was charged a fee of $17.98 per item sold. $71.92 for thred up, $0 for me. $5.99 to reclaim my items. Only $10.99 to pay to have purchases shipped to me.",1
1033,"Great place to buy secondhand clothes. The clothes are all in good condition and cute. It's easy to find stuff in your size, too.",5
1034,LOVE THRED UP! The most amazing DESIGNER jeans in BRAND NEW CONDITION- sometimes even NEW WITH TAGS at a FRACTION of retail! VERY VERY EXCITING!,5
1035,I love this app its legit made shopping fun again for me after the long lasting seasonal depression of temu blues and feeling lost and hopeless from endless scrolling of temus cheap soulless products. Thred up has offered me a whole new set of eyes and a new and more exciting market to shop on. Why buy a random stupid 7$ 'trendy' shirt off temu just cuz it's 7$ when now with thred up I can buy an actual name brand shirt for the same price. Then the incentives/rewards threadup gives are 💯 too!,5
1036,Learn to love the look . It's like seeing your friend in a coat you really like. Now instead of borrowing it you can own the look and keep the the friend for a twinning look. Lol😏,5
1037,"Buyer beware, selling fake bags they know and do not care they are counterfeit products. I sent pictures hoping they would realize the mistake, but they stand by their lies. Anyone who has had a designer bag knows a counterfeit when they see it. I can not believe more people do not speak up. This company is a fraud. I want to shop secondhand, but I also want what I am paying for.",1
1038,love it! would recommend it to my friend and family.,5
1039,"Can be finicky and difficult to navigate at times, but overall very helpful. Love ThredUp!",4
1040,The app loads a little slow when it starts up but runs smoothly from there... Unless I go to other applications while I have the cart open. It'll crash sometimes (not consistently) if I leave it on the cart page and leave the app for a while,5
1041,Every once in a great while it suddenly freezes and closes,3
1042,"I was excited about thrifting online and thredup sounded perfect for me. I ordered the kit and sent in the most quality clothing I had, some still had tags attached. I was thrilled when I got notification that it was up. Only to find out that 17 items out of my entire bag was chosen. A little bothered, but it was going to net me approximately 50$, so I was still okay. I never got any credit for any of the items. now I am just fed up and would NOT recommend this app to anyone.",1
1043,Great shopping experience,5
1044,Great thrift!! good stuff!! sales have amazing prices you can return most stuff that doesn't work!! Also have had great experience selling super easy!!,5
1045,"The only good thing (I thought) about this app is that they provide waist, inseam, and rise measurements so I can tell if it's going to fit me. For pants purchases, I would say 80% of the time these measurements are incorrect. There are only 2 photos per item, front and back, and you can't really tell anything about material from that. Some white pants are retouched so that you can't even see a photo of the pants, it just blends with the background. Save search features and filtering are iffy",2
1046,I love this site because I can find different!,5
1047,Love this app,5
1048,Great buys on good clothes. Fast shipping.,5
1049,"I CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS about ThredUp! I can't help but notice a lot of neg. reviews in dealing with minor glitches/ app errors. Me, personally, considering the amazing deals, great 4 our planet,rewards,wide selection, and looking FAB, to name a few, is well worth a little extra thumb work to reap these benefits. Simply exit the app and reload it. It works for me every time.Hope this helps! As they say,""One man's trash is another man's treasure!"" Happy thrifting, everyone!",5
1050,Glitchy at cart but good overall,4
1051,It upsets me when I have something in my cart and I go back to get it when I'm ready to pay for it and it's been removed then I have to start all over again it's like I do all the hard work and somebody else gets it and that makes me feel some kind.,3
1052,Great clothes at great prices,5
1053,Love this app love saving $money,5
1054,"Descriptions of items are accurate prices affordable, nice shopping experiences",5
1055,"Great finds, but not a good place to consign due to tiny payout % of your sale.",4
1056,"Horrible app. You give them clothes ( nice clothes) for them to help you sale and they RIP you of your money. Out of 2 huge bags I would get a total of $4 I believe, when they are charging $10+ per item. One bag I had a total of $14+ of earnings but my fees were $15! Ridiculous. Taking advantage of people who are trying to make a little money on the side. Should be ashamed",1
1057,Love it. Fast and affordable,5
1058,"Terrible consignment in every way they are cheating ppl. They still sell the ""unacceptable"" brands even though they don't pay out any percent to the owner. They just decide to keep all money made. Often they pay out as little as ¢25 on a sale of $10. They are greedy and making tons of money off of sellers.",1
1059,"Love buying excellent quality items in great condition for a faction of retail! Such a big selection! After extensive shopping, I even ended up by a dress for my daughter's wedding through thredUP!",5
1060,pretty good app/store. sometimes they won't have the item. then you'll get refunded. not sure if it's full amount or they charge for restock fee. even though they haven't sent the item.. but other then that I love thredup.,4
1061,I appreciate the large sizes that I need.,5
1062,If I could give it a zero star I would. Are you still love this site it used to give amazing resale clothes but I ordered a shirt it was removed from my order they did not explain why they claim they refunded me they never did so they essentially stole from me there is no way of contacting anyone to get any resolution for for it. Be wary if you order anything that you may be paying for something you won't get which essentially is stealing.,1
1063,"I wish the ThredUp App had a feature that tells you that despite an item's ""Excellent"" rating, the item has Stains, Holes, is Faded or Pilled... THAT would be REALLY USEFUL since they charge so much to return items now! And Especially if it's a Final Sale! Come on, ladies! Don't be selling your stained, holey, pilled, faded clothing. Please! Help a girl out!",1
1064,Great prices for the latest styles in great condition. App is easy to use. I love thredUp!!!,5
1065,"I love Thred up, but the ap could use some minor adjustments. 1. When you select an item to view, it automatically scrolls to the bottom of the page, so you have to scroll up view the item. 2. A lot of items get overlooked due to name brands being the top way an item is classified. For example let's say your looking for a size 28 full seat riding breeches, and don't care about the name brand. How do you find them? Put breeches in the search bar prepare for nothing close to pull up.",4
1066,Great deals!!,5
1067,Very difficult to save filters,2
1068,I had nothing but horrible experiences with you guys,1
1069,Love this app! Most of my wardrobe is from thredup.,5
1070,"A few of my items that I sent to them never got displayed to be sold nor did I receive any request to have them returned. They vanished. Did I get ripped off? I think so. Also, $28.00 store credit for 7 high quality items that were sold, is pretty pathetic. I would have rather donated them.",1
1071,A great app! It makes browsing for clothing decently easy and has pretty great control seeing as how many hundreds of thousands of clothing there are to trip it up.,5
1072,Great prices on new and used clothing,5
1073,"I've now fully understood that this app has been deceiving me. It has no good intentions, it just wants to make money. I shopped on here for a while, and after looking at through a different email I saw that they were serving different discounts. My, ""star,"" account that I use was significantly more expensive then the new one. Full warning, go through this app with several different emails. They will try to squeeze money from you.",2
1074,"It has ok items and the prices arent terrible (atleast for black friday) other than that it sucks, you can't even order from 2 different accounts if they are shipping to the same address, making it impossible to buy xmas gifts. When my mom tried to order gifts for my family after I ordered a pair of converse it got cancelled and we couldnt get any of the items back to try buying them again, I don't even think she got a refund yet and it's been over 12 hours she spent over 100$. ruined our day.",1
1075,Points earned should not expire,2
1076,Not only do I enjoy thread up because of the great deals but I also enjoy the excitement that comes from the competitive side of shopping on thread up. When you discover a really cool item or great deal you can't wait around. There's only one of that item & when it's gone it's gone. My only complaint is that after your shopping cart expires and items are removed it can be time consuming trying to find them again. It would be cool if although no longer reserved they were still listed in the cart.,4
1077,awesome finds and better prices! recommend to several,5
1078,Love it. No problems with the app or merchandise.,5
1079,It's great. Only thing make it better is stackable coupons and free shipping,5
1080,"Thredups item descriptions are consistently deceptive. I ordered jeans described as straight leg and they were skinny, and my sweater that was in ""good condition"" has a hole on the front and was covered in blonde hair (I have black, so not mine). A pair of cords came with white crust on it that was just disgusting. I also noticed I was presented 2 black Friday discount codes depending if I was logged in. One had free shipping, but the other did not. What kind of segmenting nonsense is this??",1
1081,Slow sometimes.,3
1082,Only thing I have not been receiving motivation as before,5
1083,"If you try to sell anything on this app, you will not make a profit and they will not return your items. You'd be better off taking your items to the thrift store. I had no idea this would happen and listed several nice pieces. IF the items sold, I'd make $3 per item on average. If the items don't sell - ThredUp keeps the items. Definitely just deleting the app after this experience as a seller.",1
1084,"Great sales and clothes! They're not listed correct however. If you look for cashmere it'll show non-cashmere items. If you look for wool, it'll bring up a tooooon of polyester clothing. Any other app would forbid this and remove those listings.",3
1085,"Everything I have bought is either missing buttons, has holes or not even remotely close to the correct size. Stay away.",1
1086,"Please offer better deals, prices, and bigger discounts with free delivery for new customers. Higher quality items, clothing, and new type of accessories, too. Looking forward to using your shopping app. Thank you again.",5
1087,"The app itself is okay for what it is, but it can be slow to load and the clothes, especially dark clothes, can be difficult to see in detail. But, they do offer some great deals.... that wins in my book!",4
1088,Stop asking me to turn on app notifications every 5 seconds. That is my reason for this negative review.,1
1089,Great! Easy to find great deals!,5
1090,"Most of the clothes sent described in ""great condition"" were so worn out, collar and sleeves so stretched out , I couldn't wear it anywhere but bed...these tops were over $20 The spp doesn't allow returns without a hefty restocking fee. Also, it doesn't allow for review of items or sellers! Don't waste your money!",1
1091,"Great clothes and functional app. I do wish I didnt have to choose between using my points and whatever sale is going on. If Ive earned free shipping, I should be able to use it regardless of seasonal sales without losing the 15% off or whatever.",4
1092,"Love it, slow at times, but overall good!",4
1093,The ONLY section they don't sell to is MEN. I should open a store that sells to men and children only.,1
1094,"App is just like the website, but can be slow and quirky.",4
1095,"Easy to use, excellent selection that is always changing, fun!",5
1096,Love this app! It's great to know it's so simple to help the planet and save money!,5
1097,I'm not very happy with my purchases or my clean out bag. I'm very disappointed,1
1098,"Buying pre-owned Clothes in good condition at Low Prices is great. With the app you can sit in your chair and shop. It is user friendly. Bundling saves money, is eco friendly. The only thing so far I have not liked about ThredUP is the way designer purses are shipped! I bought a Brighton and a Kate Spade bag, total purchase for both almost 200$. They were shipped crunched in a box, bent. I can't get them to stand up because the fold from the packing will not come undone. 🙁",5
1099,It took a long time to process the clean out bag.,3
1100,"Honestly, I wish ThredUp actually served up deals. A skirt with minor wear should not be going for $20, it should be going for $5. The restocking fee continues to increase making it not worth every actually buying something from them unless you know 1000% that it will fit you and you will like it. The app is also mid at best.",2
1101,"The app will mess up occasionally to where I am unable to scroll or search if i didnt exit entirely the last time i used it, so I have to close the whole app down and restart which is annoying. Other then that I used thred up pretty much daily and for all my clothing purchases.",3
1102,"Awful service. Don't use it. They make money on you and give you pennies back. Even if you sent them items in excellent condition, they will take not enough to cover your expenses and then blame you that items didn't match there policy and cannot be sale on there platform. Better donate your closes for free.",1
1103,Love it and very easy to shop and find great things!,5
1104,Lost everything I had need help please am made!,5
1105,It's a little addicting to find such great deals on cool stuff!,5
1106,couldn't figure out how to list items for sale. only option I found wanted me to pay 15 bucks to send in a bag of my clothes. needs to be much more user friendly. seems like a scam.,1
1107,good prices,5
1108,Easy to use. I love it!,5
1109,"The changes to the platform and customer service has lowered any value of selling your items. The fees, pricing and logistics are horrible",1
1110,"If I have a long cart full of stuff, the cart screen bounces back to the bottom. Is that a bug? If so, get some bug spray! Fix the glitch. Gracias.",3
1111,"I used to love shopping at threadup, but recently, I've stopped. One of the easiest ways for me to shop was to add items to my favorites and then add them to my cart from there. It was easy to see the items I liked and eliminate the ones that got sold with a simple touch. Now, the items on my list don't have the black heart, and when an item is sold out, I have to tap on the item, then tap the heart to remove it and go back. So basically, it's an extra step that makes it annoying. Fix itplease.",3
1112,Don't sell they are a rip off,1
1113,"Honestly, it feels good to help the planet while shopping for clothing and premium handbags",5
1114,I have enjoyed buying and selling on Thredup,5
1115,"I love shopping on the thredup app! There is so much to choose from! I have so many cute dresses. Anytime I need to return, customer service is excellent! I love Thredup and I tell all my friends about it!",5
1116,VERY GOOD APP WITH DISCOUNTS AT TIMES. I ALWAYS ENJOY MY SEARCH AND PURCHASE.,5
1117,"I have purchased many purses from you. Would buy more. However, the new system sucks. I buy only the top designers. I will not scroll through all of the junk to find something to buy. Please put it back to the way it was.",2
1118,They suck I'll never order from them again. You can never get hold of anyone in the customer service department to help you with your order.,1
1119,Flashing notifications on the bottom of the screen reminding you about current promotions that reappear seconds after you press the X. Constant pop-ups telling you to turn on push notifications. The favorite feature barely functions. The only benefit of this version of the app is that you can actually set price parameters instead of having pre-set ranges you have to choose from.,1
1120,Love my orders!,5
1121,just dont,1
1122,I absolutely love this app it is hands down my most favorite app. If there was anything I could add about is that I would most definitely sell mens clothes as well🥰,5
1123,"Everything I purchase is unique, and in excellent condition. I love it! The prices are excellent! I'm never disappointed!",5
1124,Scammy and dishonest app. Will never use again. Don't bother.,1
1125,"Not being able to add items to the cart tends to lessen the UI shopping experience. I am logged in to my account. My account info is updated. My app is updated. When pressing the ""add to cart"" button, I receive: Error message pop-up: ""Cart not found for user"" That's as much info as I can give you. Please fix this bug. If more folks than me are having this issue, it seems to be a huge bummer for both customers and ThredUp. Hoping to post an update very soon.",1
1126,Excellent bargains. Easy to find beautiful items.,5
1127,Always great stuff!!!,5
1128,Terrible app! Glitches and things like the print label function for a cleanout bag doesn't work. Currently trying to chat with someone and that doesn't work either. Thredup needs an app person and some customer service focus!,2
1129,No mens option. Nearly impossible to find clothes for men,2
1130,Love that you can keep your size filtered for searches!,5
1131,So far this Is good! 👏🏽 Hope this app gets the attention it needs.,5
1132,Amazing.. I would recommend highly,5
1133,You took my stuff made a giant profit then want to charge me if i want anything back and now you're charging me to cash pot lousy $15 dollars.. you're a corporate scam and making us think you're making a difference to the plant .. scammmmmmmm,1
1134,I'm addicted!! LOVE THIS APP!,5
1135,"I love ThredUP, you can get amazing finds for a fraction of the cost it's also a great way to clean out your closet. Their customer service team is awesome so don't be afraid to try this great resale store!",5
1136,Love the recurring sales,5
1137,"App gets worse and worse - saved items don't default to selected hearts, so in your saves, you have to like them again, then unlike them, then refresh to get rid of them. When you click on individual items, it jumps to highlighting the bottom, making you then have to scroll all the way back up to the top. And as far as content - half of the items have never had a bust size or a waist size, but now even the categories that used to dont. Sizing is not uniform. You need accurate measurements.",2
1138,This is a huge rip off I don't encourage anyone to try it.,1
1139,I changed my address and now i cant checkout .,1
1140,"Love the concept and would buy more if it was easier to find stuff, but filtering doesn't work very well, and some important filters are missing altogether. Example: I'm looking for cozy dresses to wear in winter, but there is no sleeve length filter. I don't have time to scroll through tens of thousands of sleeveless/short sleeve dresses that don't meet my needs at all, so why bother?",2
1141,"App is too glitchy, too slow, and the saved searches feature does not work.",3
1142,"app works great - there's just such a huge inventory, even with their search & filter options, it's easy to get lost in all the options",4
1143,"Great app so far. For some reason everytime you go to look at an item, the popup telling you to turn on push notifications pops up. After 10 times I give up and close the app. Maybe it's better to go online than deal with that annoyance on the app. Only started recently. I hope they fix it!",4
1144,Love this app which brings a full store to my fingertips. The clothes are clearly marked and there is variety you wouldnt find anywhere else.,5
1145,Always happy with the service. Great products and pictures are on point.,5
1146,Never got help with my purchase 😕,1
1147,App glitches are annoying but great deals!,4
1148,The app sometimes bugs out when it comes to filters (such as sleeve length only sometimes showing up if you're looking at tops) but they've got great deals.,4
1149,I am very disappointed with the mail in kit process. Took nearly three months to process my items and now I'm getting pennies in the dollar if anything. I DO NOT recommend this at all.,1
1150,Wow this is a great app so with phenomenal potential 👏 😍,5
1151,"The LOW PERCENTAGE paid out after taking a large ""free shipping "" fee leaves nothing, many items not listed even new current with tags...VERY DISSATISFIED with the business practices....and no communication with humans...",1
1152,Waiting ages for them to begin processing the items I sent in. They received it a month ago.,2
1153,"I'm providing new feedback. Customer service is AWESOME. I highly recommend this app/site. They really went above and beyond to help me resolve my issue. Not to mention prompt response, understanding. They truly care. Rarely have I encountered this level of service online. Love this!",5
1154,Love thredUP,5
1155,Not worth it,1
1156,Good,5
1157,"I've loved this app. As an avid thrifter, it makes it fun and convenient to dig for treasures at any time of the day. I do wish it was easier to search for items by description. Perhaps tags could be added for each item, ""feathered"", ""ombre"", ""peter pan collar"". That would make it easier to find what I'm really looking for...which is a feathered-ombre-collared top, obviously.",4
1158,It is very hard to locate the clean out kit with an update. I'm not a fan.,3
1159,Great products and wonderful prices.,5
1160,"My favorite way to shop second-hand and to shop online in general. App works great, user friendly, no bugs or glitches, secure payment and pleasant looking overall.",5
1161,Very good,5
1162,It freezes so much. Won't even open,2
1163,"Fine for buying, terrible for selling anything of value. Items are incorrectly categorized and priced so low that after the fees you may actually owe more money if not everything sells. As for purchasing, prices can be okay if you take advantage of sales but beware there are a lot of inaccurate descriptions and sizes.",1
1164,Terrible ! I had sent a full bag of clothes that still had tags and a lot of them were name brand clothes. Out of all the clothes I had sent only 5 items were posted and 4 were expired... so the one shirt that got sold I didn't get any money from it because of there fee! I basically got robbed and I should've just sold them myself n make some of the money back.,1
1165,"Easy, great clothes, honest rating system! Your order comes just as it was described.",5
1166,Sent in circles when you need assistance,2
1167,I've loved the stuff I bought on ThredUp so far. I also really appreciate that I'm able to shop more sustainably by buying second hand clothes.,5
1168,"Glitchy but works. Don't fall for the free clean out your closet bag. I sent very nice items to try it, and after 4 months I have never received any money. Many items they list, they don't actually have but will hold your money for 2-3 weeks before paying you back.",2
1169,"This app never updates in a timely matter. It lags majorly. Today it's not even working and keep getting a error message that "" Opps! Something happened. We are working on this"". I hope they are working on their bugs. 11/6 update: one more star down! This app sucks! When click on an item to view details, the item disappears. All updates made, phone restarted- still, no item to view. This has been happening A LOT! Love this store, but this app is THE WORST!!",2
1170,Easy to use easy to shop. Often thredup overcharges but they have good sales,5
1171,"My wife says: Pls add a black/night mode to settings & magnifying glass to look closer in hi def. Can't tell what some patterns are. Please consider including info on fabric type/weight, ex.: knit, jersey, loom, light, medium, heavy. Filters need adjusted & refined or staff needs to train for leggings, ponchos, coats v. jackets, as lots of irrelevant items come up. Pls add garment: tunic. It would be awesome if you could sell men's clothing, too! 🙏 Overall I adore this store! 👍 Thanks",4
1172,This is about the only way to find cute clothes these days since the drummers in the stores are so off lately. Thank you for giving us a way to thread up!,5
1173,"The main thing I would change about the app is that it is too easy to put things I don't want in my cart. I can remove them, but why should I have to. I would like to be able to resty finger on the screen while I'm scrolling sometimes.",4
1174,DO NOT SEND YOUR CLOTHES TO THREDUP. I Sent 12 bags of very nice and new with tags clothes and shoes. I have a $8.45 credit from all of that. Do your research,1
1175,"This app constantly crashes or crashes my phone. Searching on the app is frustrating sometimes, also.",3
1176,This app is fun and addictive! Great deals and good to keep materials up cycled and in use instead of filling landfills. They have become very good at solving issues in a fast and satisfying way.,5
1177,Love this app!!,5
1178,love love love it!!!,5
1179,always a positive experience!,5
1180,Excellent.,5
1181,"Took them months to process clothes I sent, just to make absolutely nothing off them. I sent good quality clothes that spent more time in the box waiting for them to process them, than they ever did up for sale. And if they had sold, I would've made like ¢.10. Total waste of your time and clothing.",1
1182,I went to place my order and saw that all of my points had just expired. I don't think I'll use this app anymore. What a scam.,1
1183,No men's?,1
1184,I love ThredUp but the app is glitchy. I end up ordering from the browser.,2
1185,Solid overall - easy to use and more consistently good deals than other places like ebay or poshmark. Wish there were more filters but thats small in comparison to how great it is! Edited - the past few months it's crashed constantly to the point where my phone prompts me to put the app in deep sleep. Not sure what's wrong but hope the developers can fix it as it's getting annoying!,3
1186,"I love everything about this!! The ease that I can send things in, and the vast choices I have when I am buying is unmatched anywhere.",5
1187,"Bought a hoodie that was listed as ""excellent condition"" and when it arrived it had food and sweat stains down the front and on the sleeves. Wouldn't even allow a refund in store credit. This was listed as a 20$ item, at any in person thrift store it'd be 5$ tops.",1
1188,Love this store!! I'm a thrifty shopper and love a deal this is always so much cheaper and it filters your size only!!! So you can look for specific items like a yellow shirt and have hundreds to choose from!!!! Love it,5
1189,Fun and easy to navigate site 😃,5
1190,Twice now I've gotten damage items. Twice I have complained and twice I've gotten no response,1
1191,"Easy to use, fun to shop used! Love it!",5
1192,"Love checking what's ""new"" each day!!!",5
1193,The app is awful. I prefer my original ThredUp non app site and will dump the thredup app.,1
1194,Awesome finds!,5
1195,Awesome!!!!,5
1196,"Fun, easy to use.",5
1197,Awesome app! I love being able to thrift without leaving the house!,5
1198,I love this app. It's simple to navigate,5
1199,"Shocked at how easy it was to find, buy and receive quickly a large order of cool finds. Everything was packaged nicely and clean. And customer service was excellent for two items that didn't work out. Very grateful as a person and parent of chronic illness for the ability to thrift from my home.",5
1200,Great deals,4
1201,I always find what I'm looking for and if I don't there's always something else to make shopping fun!,5
1202,I have found some wonderful $$$ pieces that I never dreamed I would be able to own.,5
1203,A million times better than the website; makes everything much easier!,5
1204,"The service and the app used to be good (my previous review had 5 stars), now, the app glitches and crashes almost every time I open it, costumer services takes days to respond (or hours in case of chat), and prices increased quite a bit. I'm sad that such a good company/app is now as terrible as the others",2
1205,Very easy to navigate and make purchases. Maybe too easy...LOL!!,5
1206,The app glitches and closes out while using several times,2
1207,"It took almost a year to process the small box of clothes that I sent in to sell. 14 months later, the clothes never even got posted to my account or sold.",1
1208,"I used to love this app. It has gone downhill in efficiency and just being user friendly. Very glitchy. Also,the raise in price to send in your clean out/consignment clothing is ridiculous. It is worthless to send a bag and be charged $14-$17 when that is more than your bag will likely earn!",2
1209,As a shopper I'm a big fan of thredup versus she in or other fast fashion brands.,5
1210,Finding great deals.,5
1211,"The app is just part of their problem. selling pros: less stuff, find the stuff a new home selling neg: you're likely to lose money, you'll pay $14.99 for them to take your stuff, get less than 10% of their cost, pay another $10.99 to get your return stuff, but wait pay another $5.99+ an item & additonal $10.99 shipping fee to get the items they don't sell back after posted <2 months. Are they really trying to sell it for you or profit off you?",1
1212,Took a break from this app for a while and just redownloaded. Now ever two minutes they ask me to turn on notifications i absolutely do not want and i cant figure out how to turn these alerts off. Also the search features are still very limited and page load glitches persisting.,2
1213,"Love this store , just received my 10 th order !!!! And loved everything!!!!!",5
1214,"I love thredup. some bugs occasionally, like not applying saved sizes, but overall works as intended and easy to shop and find what I want.",5
1215,Are you kidding? You're AMAZING!!!,5
1216,Like it most definitely. (Bill and Ted's exallent adventures)movie quotes.,5
1217,Fast delivery. Great product,5
1218,It isn't geared to benefit the sellers. Just the buyers.,1
1219,"The app is very glitchy. There are times when I try to view items in my cart or even try and view a label and it gives me issues. I love the wide variety of clothes, purses, and shoes. I love the designer section too. I do love looking and buying clothes on this app, so I do hope they fix their app issues.",3
1220,I love just flipping through and saving my favorites. Great shopping experience. I've picked up a few treasures.,5
1221,"best thrifting store, has the perfect Y2K outfits😍😍😍",5
1222,"The infinite scroll is one of the most important parts of what makes this app so great! Although too expensive for me, I do like the pics in the new designer section with people wearing the items! I wish the saves worked better (they frequently don't clear from my save page, even when I uncheck the heart icons). I also wish I could sort my faves list. 3rd wish: flexibility of using points - I have never used mine because they have so many limitations. Lots of fun sales do keep me interested!",4
1223,Love the selections & sale prices,5
1224,"The last several months that I've shopped, the app has been so glitchy, it's nearly impossible to use. Especially the favorites section and the cart. They won't scroll properly, so you can't see everything, or edit the cart, because it takes you back to the bottom every few seconds. So frustrating!! I used to love ThredUp, but the app has been so bad, I've just been giving up and shopping local resale clothing shops instead.",1
1225,Excellent,5
1226,Love using threadup!,5
1227,Cool,5
1228,"Crashes during checkouts, disappearing credits, they use a (fake?) shipping company (GLS) which has lost multiple bundles, (took several weeks to get a few hundred bucks refunded). It's taken about 6 months to list 1/2 the stuff I sent in for a cleanout before summer. Waiting for an order rn: if they lost this one, I'm updating this as 1 star. It's hard to get in touch with customer service, they'll send u in circles. Would love to filter OUT brands like Shein, ""unbranded"", etc.",2
1229,Love being able to thrift and be specific about sizes,5
1230,"Snail mail can not even describe how long it takes to ship, not even receive but ship off. Receiving is another story. 2 stars only because I enjoyed what I ordered but if you need it ASAP not worth it. Even with expedite takes 7days or longer.",2
1231,👍,5
1232,"I love ThredUp.... mostly. What annoys me: shopping cart flickers non-stop and continuously takes me back to the bottom of the cart, making it almost impossible to browse your cart. I earned $5 and $10 rewards very quickly but they don't allow you to use more than one discount option at a time which makes dollars rewards useless. Why would I choose to save $5 or $10 over saving much, much more with promo codes for sales and free shipping? Best: only paying shipping once(mostly not at all!)",5
1233,I don't get y online thrift shopping online app is only for women and children's close why is there no men's clothes option I'm not even eighteen yet I don't see why there's no men's option,1
1234,Love it!,5
1235,Borders on arrassment to allow notifications. Doesn't load saved searches 95% of the time. Useless.,2
1236,"The app freezes sometimes when you are checking out and using coupon codes at the same time, but otherwise it's amazing. I like the search function and even though the last update has added some weird stuff it's an overall great experience. I love using the service.",4
1237,"Always on point shipping, no hassle returns, excellent merchandise descriptions and pictures",5
1238,"I had an issue with the product I ordered, and they were very fair in their decision! The second time I ordered, it has taken over a month to get my orders. They still have not been shipped. If you want anything in a timely manner don't order from thredUP!",5
1239,Very convenient,5
1240,The best way to shop,5
1241,Lots of glitches and will freeze and shut down,3
1242,I LOVED shopping this app but hopefully the update I just did helps with the glitches,3
1243,"I love the idea of thredup, generally like thredup but the app is awful, it's constantly freezing, I have not been able to even get it open for a month. I've since started using the web browser, but I wish they'd fix it.",3
1244,I love the options that thredUP offers. The app makes it so easy to access all the options and keeps me updated on additional ways to save!,4
1245,I love the variety of options available! Customer service is great.,5
1246,I'll never deal with this company again. Oh sure they take all your items but most never get put up for sale even with their sales tags still on them which means someone has them. I feel robbed of things I could have sold myself but I thought this way would help all the way around. I was so wrong. Never again!!,1
1247,"I love this app, I've ordered a few things and really loved it. The purses is I'd have to say my favorite. They have about any kind of purse that you would want. But it's a great place to shop for just about what ever you want they have it. I would give them a 10.",5
1248,"Love the variety and ability to save/watch items. Prices are great, and I have never been disappointed in the quality of any of the many items I've purchased.",5
1249,Awesome online thrift shop for someone who like nice things and retail is insane. Found some many nice clothes for cheap. I love thrift shopping and recommend everyone to do it. It recycles what would pile up in the land fills and helps save the planet plus people in any tax bracket can look fabulous.,5
1250,Love getting great deals while being mindful of helping the environment!,5
1251,"Love the selection, how easy it is to filter for what you are looking for via fabric, color, size, etc. Sometimes the app bugs on me though, as in it won't show stuff in my cart that is there or when I click on something, I can't see the item, but overall I love this app",4
1252,"Definitely the best way to thrift.. almost everything I've gotten was perfect, like brand new. And if not or I didn't like c the way it fit there's an easy return. Definitely recommend thredup if you like to thrifty or save money😉",5
1253,"great service, fast shipping",5
1254,"in general pretty good! could use work, has never once given me a push notification despite efforts to turn them on, and kind of glitches out sometimes when something interrupts my scrolling. ThredUp itself uses some awful ML/AI thing to sort and label the clothes that half the time doesn't know what a stripe is. but it's fun to look at clothes and find weird things I never would have found in actual stores, which means they succeeded in actually recreating the thrift store experience online.",4
1255,Processing time for your closet cleanouts is way too long. Photos and descriptions are subpar.,2
1256,Easy to shop and have wonderful discounts on all items,5
1257,I find it expensive when you can go to your local thrift store and find unique stuff alot cheaper!,2
1258,Thread up. Love the app. Love the store. You can thrift without even leaving your house.,5
1259,"I'm very disappointed! The main item I wanted was not ""available"", so of course they refunded my money. However, my disappointment didn't end there. One of the shirts I bought, I found as I was wearing it, had a hole that looked like a cigarette burn in one of the sleeves. This shirt was described as in excellent condition.",2
1260,Thrifting at its best! Many items already include measurements & accept returns.,5
1261,It doesn't let you filter by product. It just shoes absolutely everything available. I use the app on iOS without any issues but it doesn't work like it should on Android.,1
1262,Keeps freezing & when in cart it won't scroll easily,3
1263,could not get anyone on chat for a week,1
1264,"Search feature works fairly well, but app will sometimes freeze or show a blank screen when toggling between saved searches. Especially if you switch to another app and then return to the thredup open app. I like that the show sellers other items at bottom of the item page, but wish they brought back the ""similar items"". So helpful if your item is in another person's cart or sold.",4
1265,"I haven't had any experience yet, just notified that my consignment was received.",5
1266,Never disappointed with thredUP finds!,5
1267,I love this app! The filtering options make it SO easy to find exactly what you're looking for.,5
1268,"while you're still shopping they take stuff out of your cart, I went to checkout they had taken everything out RUDE they didn't use to do that,",2
1269,All of the sudden my app isn't working. I tried reinstalling it but then it wouldn't let me login. I tried resetting my password and it still isn't working. It keeps saying it can't verify the server. My login works in the internet browser but the app has completely crashed on me. It was working just fine yesterday.,1
1270,"It's more of a 2.5 for me, due to the fact there's no men's section for the site. I downloaded the app because I hate buying new and need scrubs for work but I couldn't find anything in my size or for me.",3
1271,"Hello. Your website has an issue with creating account. It says that ""We've encountered an error. Please try again."" And i couldn't register to buy some clothing.",3
1272,"Glitchy, very very glitchy. You have to click thru the search bar three times to actually type something, and if you go back to edit what you typed, it auto deletes and you have to start from scratch. Payment will suddenly not work, and you have to restart the app. Searches will suddenly not work, and you have to restart the app. Right now there's stuff in my cart, but my cart is showing empty and I can't check out. Honestly their app is terrible. The worst shopping app I've ever used.",1
1273,"Absolutely love thredup. My only complaint is that the app freezes sometimes. I won't be able to check out, look at my orders, or check out an item, and now it's telling me any item I try to put into my cart isn't listed? This sucks",4
1274,"After downloading the app I discovered the categories only include women, girls, and boys. I guess men don't wear clothing?",1
1275,"2023 edit: the app has been glitching for months and does not seem to be getting fixed. In fact, it seems to be getting worse. I have been a thredup customer for years (see my original review below) but I'm considering giving up on it given that the app is so unusable these days. (Original review) The best! The app is very well designed to make secondhand shopping easy! (Maybe too easy!!) Returns are easy in case something you order isn't perfect! Could not recommend this app more highly!",3
1276,Love it!! Great deals on really nice stuff! I'm totally addicted 😁,5
1277,"So far am OBSESSED with this app! I love that you can get BRAND NAME QUALITY, THREADS, w/ out spending all your THREADS (money)!! ALSO they always seem to have some promotional code to help even more so. I currently have the need for an maternity clothing. So, LOW COST interim attire, has been condusive to my growing baby budget... inflation has presented a terrible disadvantage.",5
1278,my experience is a horrible one. sent in my clothes. new at that. and pieces were sold never received anything. for that I could have kept my own clothes,1
1279,"The app is pretty good, not without glitches, but I have an older phone so I'm not sure if it's like that for everyone. Love the selection, discounts and plenty of offers. Have built my dream wardrobe sonce September now, for real.",4
1280,"I'm not for anyone taking advantage of sellers. I'm done with this site, and you should be too! Oh, there send a reply all programmed and DO NOTHING to fix it!!",3
1281,Great I love the idea of sending in what we don't need any getting credit for that!,5
1282,I adore thredUP. It's my favorite place to shop in the world and the app is awesome.,5
1283,Great!,5
1284,"I will probably retink the using the clean out bag program. Bags processed out of order. The amount you make is truly minimal, and it takes forever. They have had bags for 2 months +. Don't expect much. I guess better than nothing. I think taking the time with, let's say, . well worth the time put in to sell your items. You definitely have more control. I received less than $10 for Abercrombie pants with tags",3
1285,Great choices and wonderful people who want to help,5
1286,It is fun to look around on ThredUp. So the experience makes me a Smiley Face person.,5
1287,"This company lied cheated and stole from me I requested my item back after it was priced at 80% off retail (brand new item) after being told it would be returned, they sold it behind my back. I lost hundreds of dollars vs selling it with other marketplaces",1
1288,Just found this site. Haven't received my order yet but the site has been easy to use with a lot of discounts. I will continue to use this site.,5
1289,Excellent for me and the planet. Only drawback to the app is...I have to keep resetting my sizes regarding my searches. The app tells me it a permanent choice based upon my login but that has not been the case. A bit annoying 😕,4
1290,High Background Battery Useage & Frequent Crashes according to my Galaxy a maintenance report every day even when I ain't using the app & I cannot understand what in earth ur app needs to b doing when not in has honestly that's baffling so I simply uninstalled cuz I've mentioned this cupl times to CS last year each promised to let sum1 know to fix nothing's changed after several updates only thing that has was u removed useful features app suggestions for an item u click on used to list below,1
1291,"Love the store, but the app is glitchy. It constantly times out and crashes.",3
1292,I love all the items from there.,5
1293,So far so good.,5
1294,Always great bargains you won't be disappointed sometimes the sizing is off but the measurements are listed for most items. It's good to know most items are in good or excellent condition. The only thing I add is the turn around time for the processing of the donation and the clean out bags are extremely slow and now they are charging 17.99 to process your bag for example I had 11 items that sold and was paid 12 dollars for high end clothing. My suggestion is to find a better consignment seller.,4
1295,❤️,5
1296,My main complaint is that you can't view your cart properly when you add a coupon code. Otherwise it is good and easy to navigate.,4
1297,Great clothing selection and app is easy to use.,5
1298,"Since what I believe was an app update around a month ago, this app has become a bit of a nightmare to use - glitching and freezing up. I'm forced to uninstall/reinstall it in an attempt to use it. I love ThredUP but this is annoying. I've even lost out on items I planned to buy due to the app glitching. Disappointing ☹️",3
1299,"The BEST THRIFTING! If you recycle, you can send clothes in and order new finds out! Highly recommend for browsing and shopping. You can set your filters very specifically if you don't want to sift through. Enjoy!",5
1300,I always have good results with Thredup,5
1301,You can find some good unique things and decent prices!!!! Love this site!!!,5
1302,"Pretty good app. Looks like they fixed the problem I was having where the search kept resetting. Still, some searches are easier online. On the plus side, if the app glitches, it's easy enough to switch over to the web version and all your stuff is still there.",4
1303,The app on my Android doesn't open up individual items!,1
1304,"App functionality: The app filtering doesn't work well (when it does work that is). The app will close for no reason. It takes a while to load up as well. The site itself: honestly I'm over it. My points expire before I can use them half the time, the deals aren't really worth (a few dollars off a worn shein dress just isn't worth it to me), and the fees on returns are just ridiculous. Im sure luxury brands have good deals, but it's not what I'm after.",1
1305,Excellent,5
1306,love it. easy shopping. Easy selling. I love always finding my favorite brands and some that don't exist in stores anymore! Lots of unique items as well,5
1307,"I enjoy shopping trend up I browse their app quite often, this is my Four order. I look forward to delivering date. I would recommend this app. For a pleasant online shopping experience",4
1308,It is a lot better than it use to be,5
1309,Prices are the best and clothes are in very good condition!,5
1310,Easy to use. Affordable. Eco-friendly!,5
1311,Addictive and Fun,5
1312,"Wow! I haven't gotten my order yet, but I can't believe the savings! And it's fun!",5
1313,"The ThredUp app is easy to use. The quality of items I've purchased has been true to their stated condition. I have also sent items to them to sell and that has been a very positive experience, too. I recommend them!",5
1314,Search engine on this app is priceless 👌,5
1315,I enjoy grabbing a few like-new fashion items for a song from thredUP! Fun to scroll through searches using filters and discount codes.,5
1316,"Always on time , great quality clothes ,always in great condition.",5
1317,"Horrible consignment experience, took over 70% off a new item that retails for 1000 even with written request to not discount over 50%. They approve or deny items at their discretion and will simply keep your items they reject and sell them without your involvement. They are not able to compete with other consignment companies and you should take your items there instead.",1
1318,I'm absolutely hooked!!,5
1319,Items do not load as they should most of the time,2
1320,Love it!! ❤️,5
1321,I love this site I buy clothes for myself and my kids all the time. Really nice finds my only complaint would be the awards for being a loyal customer.,5
1322,Easy and affordable!,5
1323,"I'm happy with the app, but prices have gone up significantly in the past six months or so. These are no longer thrift prices, they're more like just regular sale prices. I'm not going to pay $20 for a used piece of clothing that retailed at $30, you must be out of your mind. I used to love shopping ThredUp, now I might as well just go to the mall. You ruined a good thing, guys.",2
1324,Thredup is s FRAUDULENT BUSINESS. They post clothing on there site that DOESN'T EXIST 👎👎👎. Thredup post pictures like a 4 yr old took it..no skills. Thredup customer service does not work on the weekends nor RESPONDS TO EMAILS ON THE WEEKENDS. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE 👎👎👎👎👎 The web site STUCKS still,1
1325,The app is almost unusable. It automatically loads random sizing and when I clear those filters shows no results. Meanwhile I have saved ones that still say available so there should be results. It's gotten worse over time.,1
1326,I love thredup I have been a customer for a while now... I always find something..,5
1327,The search feature is unpredictable. The app is bloated and slow. Preset sizing doesn't work. The listing information and sizing is not reliable.,2
1328,Makes cashing out and getting a new label for multiple closet clean outs difficult. App isn't user friendly for sales.,1
1329,"Excellent experience w/THREDUP as far as BUYING goes! Now, I am ready to try the SELLING aspect of it! My daughter uses this app ALL THE TIME! (Have NO IDEA why it took me so long to listen to her!)",5
1330,"Dropped from 5 stars to 3, again, because the app just stops loading. Several pages just never load including the Orders, Returns, Saved Searches and only a handful of search results that should yield 10K+ items. App is updated so idk why this can't be improved, still.",3
1331,"Works so much faster than the website which is a plus, but when I'm trying to look for shoes it returns 0 results no matter how many or how few filters are included.",1
1332,They are rip off! THEY KEEP 90% OF THE PROCEEDS !,1
1333,Inconsistent,3
1334,Love this App!!,5
1335,"Don't get me wrong I love what I buy from ThreadUP, EVERYTHING IS 👍. I just do wish that shipping was lower,. I could buy more things, if shipping costs would go down a little. thanks for listening",3
1336,Its a great site! Everything comes quickly packaged in a lovely presentation! Returns are very simple as well!,5
1337,Lots of fun and many wonderful clothes.,4
1338,Great app with lightly used clothing,5
1339,Fun and exciting shopping. Just wish they included sizing on outdoors clothing.,5
1340,So far so good,4
1341,Great products great prices,5
1342,"If I could it 0 stars I would. Sure they offerer great prices because they rip off the people who send items in. They take 75 percent off the top IF your item sells and not returned. They offer discounts to ""buyers"" that they take from your earnings too! Then there's a $15 fee subtracted from your ""earnings"" per bag! It can end up costing you! After that, you have to pay $6 to get an item back if you want it. A complete rip off for sellers...a gold mine for them!",1
1343,"This app kicks you out whenever you hit the back button, and you have to re-search all over again.",2
1344,"Shopping cart flickers like crazy. Continously sends me back to the bottom of the items. Also, without being able to use sale codes, if/ when using points earned or bday code, they're not worth ever using. I can save $10 or free shipping, as long as I pay full price for all of my items?",3
1345,It's super that measurements of items are listed...all sizes aren't the same,5
1346,Awesome styles!!,5
1347,The search sucks. Takes a month+ to process cleanouts. Not worth the hype.,2
1348,"The app is slow and glitchy. Supposedly the clothes are without stains, but multiple things I ordered were badly stained. I ordered a size 2 in jeans and received a size 12. I also made the mistake of ordering a ""clean out kit"" where you send them your clothes and they sell them on consignment. I sent clothes in early summer and they were listed in October. The only things they listed were some jeans. I sent some good quality dresses and also some things I bought from their site. Ridiculous.",1
1349,This place ripped me off I used to love shopping here until I ordered 3 clean out kits n they took out 3 items out of a 30lb bag with almost brand new Nike shoes sandals old navy rue 21 express ect I owed 14.99 for each bag they sold 2 of my items already totaling 17.95 my earning was .98cents and I did not receive because of the fee of 14.99 they listed a David's bridal dress for 38.00 bucks my profit was 9.98 which was taken for 14.99 fee so I made a total of 0 bucks for over 100.00 worth,1
1350,I'm very disgusted at thredup. I just sent a bag of nice name brand clothing. This company takes a ridiculous percentage and charges fees that does make it worth the chore to send clothes in. Just give your clothes to people in need. Not a company who is just wants to make the most money off of other people's backs.,1
1351,I love to shop and I'm addicted.,5
1352,It takes over 2 weeks before items ship. Processing takes forever with this company.,4
1353,"Rarely works, even when fully updated. Still waiting on a clean out kit I ordered almost a month ago, and can't even get customer support chat to open. Clicking it does nothing. I have good phone service, also. So frustrating.",3
1354,Greedy comany that takes advantage of thie sellers,1
1355,"Used to love shopping here but there are issues. The app is glitchy and randomly sends me to the top of the page. Size filtering doesn't work appropriately either, it's happened twice now that I buy something from the 'womens' page filtered by my sizes and the items are definitely child sized when they arrive. Shipping also has gotten very slow. Even if I don't select the bundle option my items take a week to ship anyway. Very frustrating.",2
1356,"100% Guilt free shopping! Great sales, great selection, great shipping! Love this site!",5
1357,Don't waste your time or money! I bought several items that #1 looked way better in the pictures #2 smelled like a musty storage shed and #3 were way overpriced for the actual quality. Wish I could give 0 stars.,1
1358,"I find many treasures with tags on or, very likely, the tags removed, then washed, BUT probably tried on/wore once to hang out in the closet untouched.",5
1359,Excellent!,5
1360,I really like this app! I wish that I could search for specific items in the search bar. That’s why I am giving a 4 star rating.,4
1361,💕,5
1362,I love thred up!,5
1363,"Costly, inconsistent sizing, scammy",1
1364,My sizes often fluctuate. This is a much more efficient and cost-effective way for me to shop,5
1365,It's ok for buying but they give you nothing for the clothes you send in.,2
1366,Loads poorly,1
1367,I can't say enough about how great this company is. I love how the site tracks your sizes and remembers. I love live love the clothing. I love ordering and receiving the beautiful box with all the items lovingly tissue papered and carefully arranged. I truly hope this company never changes their processes.,5
1368,"Womens jeans are not properly sized. They do not specify short, regular, or long. Even the measurements they give on the site don't help with this issue because they are inaccurate. Expedited shipping, although almost 3x more expensive, is not any faster. Their solution to this is to either offer you free shipping or 35% off your next order. That's only a $8.99 value compared to the $25.99 original expedited charge. OR you can recover that cost by spending an ADDITIONAL $75.",1
1369,"I'd like to see a section for men, men sizes, men clothes and the like",2
1370,"Nothing compares to Thredup shopping name brand items, shoes, and Clothes at it's best!",5
1371,"Should be against the law how this business operates. In fact, isn't it? If you've bought from Thredup and can't reach customer service or are being charged a restocking fee for items that were not accurately described, contact California's Attorney General. Don't just leave a negative review here where there's no real recourse for selling junk, then charging fees for refunds, or taking your items without explicitly informing you that you won't be reimbursed.",1
1372,Amazing values,5
1373,So easy to shop! I really appreciate being able to shop by condition of clothing & having the measurements listed.,5
1374,Shipping is WAYYYY TOO EXPENSIVE!!,2
1375,"Process is easy as a seller but they charge 14.99 processing for each bag. In my situations, the payout was so low for my 3 items sold (Sean John jeans, Tommy H sweater,impeccable pig dress), I didn't receive anything. Also sent in 15-20 items that were the supposed accepted brands and only 4 total items were selected.",1
1376,Can only view items in gallery images. If you try to view a single item it never loads.,1
1377,I freaking love this place!!!,5
1378,I think they take all of your money. I won't ever use them again.,1
1379,"Great until they started charging by the kit. I'm very disappointed. I thought this site was for thrifting, not a money machine.",2
1380,THE BEST online thrift store ever!,5
1381,Great clothes!,5
1382,"Quality control nonexistent. I only purchase excellent, like new or new items. Today i received a jacket with snaps on the pockets with no corresponding receptacl to snap to. They just flailed loosely. This isn't the first time. Many of the items ordered have been items i would have had trouble deciding if they were good enough to donate. I actually have not purchased from thredup for some time because of this. The concept is good. Obviously, many of those grading the items just don't care.",2
1383,Much better than website on phone,5
1384,"Love everything I've ordered, even if it didn't fit me, my friends are happy with my choices",5
1385,No decent response since u cant call and complain for refund issues..,1
1386,"I don't like buying used clothing but daughter talked me into it. Out of 18 items, just 1 was worth keeping. I received unwashed, dirty clothes. Pants with period stain on crotch, shirts worn to nearly see-through, one pair of jeans were men's. The condition of almost every item was far worse than photos depicted. Per refund policy, I'm expected to pay shipping + restocking fee (so they can sell again) but I refuse to give this company any more money. I feel like I was scammed.",1
1387,"I have enjoyed shopping online. For shopping I give 5 stars. For selling, I wouldn't give any stars at this point. The clean out bag I returned was received on August 10th and is still sitting there as of September 26th. The clothes won't be in season by the time they start posting items online.",2
1388,"At first, I thought that this would be a nice thrift shop to explore. However, after two ar three orders, I'm not so sure. First, your shipping fee is outrageous. Secondly, when returning items, you all take so long to put it back on one's Afterpay account. Third, there is no live person to speak with when you encounter problems such as returns. I also feel that you all need to show more pics than what you show and be more detailed about the item itself. (Ex: tears in the fabric, shrinkage",1
1389,Sent my clothes in months ago. Summer clothes. Haven't even gone through them in processing. Now it's fall. I am deleting this fake pretend to sell your stuff store!,1
1390,Clothes were dirty,1
1391,Chat is worthless. Can't find my clean out kit label. Takes forever to load. Page is very circular. Can't answer my questions,1
1392,Beats Poshmark!,5
1393,"I love thredUP but the app has a ton of bugs. My saved searches won't show up, my sizes won't save, when I search the outlet nothing shows up, and when I filter a search it doesn't work. I had some clothes in my cart that added up to $120 and the total showing was over $500! I hope they can fix this - because I do love their clothes!!",2
1394,"This app used to be good, but ever since the last update, it's nothing but bugs. And as of today, the entire app crashes when I click on a brand.",1
1395,Love it!,5
1396,"I love this app! Super deals on great clothes. However, right after I used my card here, someone used my number to order something though Shopify.",5
1397,There's no option for mens clothes.,1
1398,"Less usable after recent updates. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling to make sure it's not a issue with my phone, but it's the app itself. Items in my favorites no longer have the heart selected, so I have to press the heart button twice to remove sold items from my favorites and it takes twice as long to sort things out. And on top of that, the heart button itself is now smaller and more difficult to press. I love this app so please make it more user friendly again.",2
1399,"Don't bother sending them clothes. They say 6-8 weeks to process, try 4 to 5 months! No notification, I had to contact them to get an update status. Other apps work within days.",1
1400,Love Love Love threadUp!!! The Only Way To Shop!!! threadUp has us looking great and makes the planet a happier place!!! Update 9-5-23... Please Undo The Revent Updare To The Thread Up Website!!! It's Impossible To Shop Or Order From Thread Up Now! Im Very Sad I Couldn't Order During The Labor Sale or Play Bingo. I Couldn't get the app to work. 👎 update-The website is rediculous now. The update you did site you should undo! threadUp used to have great prices and low shipping. Not anymore👎👎,1
1401,Kind of a scam and not worth sending your items to to sell,1
1402,I've always had a great shopping experience with thredup! Love all the prices and deals!,5
1403,Love all the items and the mix of high end brands and more retail ones. Wish there were better pictures (especially of hats) and more sorting options.,4
1404,"The app doesn't work as well as it once did. Now, when I click on an item to see an enlarged image, I only see the mannequin as a large image and the clothing is thumbnail size. Please fix.",3
1405,It's almost too easy to shop lol. I can almost always find exactly what I'm looking for at a great price.,5
1406,"We reaaaaaally need a way for us to exclude specific brands from our search. There is SO MUCH Lululemon and Ann Taylor Loft to scroll through and I cannot stand those brands, but thredup is saturated with them. This alone is why I rarely ever shop on thredup anymore, it is so ineffective and time consuming. Using the selecting brands we want filter is not a solution bc that takes just as much time if not more.",1
1407,"Great stuff, great prices. I am very pleased with all my purchases! Lots of choices, and so far, I have found more than I would have in any store! It is a challenge to limit my purchases, but because of the great prices, I still get more than I would elsewhere.",5
1408,"ThredUp has went downhill, I'll be uninstalling the app after this review. The filter doesn't work to find your size and style of clothes and they pretty much ""steal"" your clothes when you try to sell them back with a high processing fee.",2
1409,App keeps crashing while trying to checkout,1
1410,"I have saved so much money!!! Ladies, this is the way to shop!",5
1411,Love this site and their product for the money,5
1412,"Great finds, shop for the week and bundle, set your sizes, reuse :)",5
1413,Love them!!! And it's easy without any hassle to return items!,5
1414,A great way to indulge champagne tastes on a beer budget! ThredUP has the brands I love for so much less. I check every day to see what treasures have come available.,5
1415,"Once you get it to go through, its 🙂",5
1416,"It is very easy to use this app to filter down what size,color, style, brand, price range,, etc. You are looking for andd save settings if you wish.And many ways to browse, put items on a hold list, quick pay, and very safe, easy check out. And best shop EVER",5
1417,It seems the app is not working right. It won't let me search specific items,5
1418,"I've been using this app for a long time, but this last update has been a mess. I can only see about half the items I've saved as favorites. If I long on from my laptop, I can see all the items. When I want to enlarge an item to look at details, then I go back out, it starts me all the way back to the beginning.",3
1419,"Tons of great deals on clothes, shoes, & accessories. Frequent sales. You can receive notifications for sales events, when items you are looking for are back in stock, when your cart is expiring & more.",5
1420,I'm not satisfied with the service I said clothes 3 months ago I still cannot see where sold anything. There is no customer service,1
1421,"On my first order, most of the sizes listed were incorrect but the fees to return them, makes it not worth returning. They also smell, kind of like Pepto. The navigation on the site only works half the time, which makes it inconvenient. They have some really cute options and good brand names, but definitely buy at your own risk.",3
1422,No men's clothing,1
1423,"Their quality control and so many way to create searches by brand, color, condition is the best. I have saved hundreds on designer garments. For example, a designer dress, new with tags that someone bought for $800, is now mine for $70. Also, a great way to try a different style without breaking your budget.",5
1424,So many choices and such great prices... a shopping heaven with easy returns (if necessary),5
1425,Not sure how to use it.,3
1426,Filtering isn’t specific enough. It would be beneficial to be able to filter things you DON'T want. Items are often mislabeled. You can't combine sales & points so you have to choose one or the other. The restocking fee is ridiculously high! Basic items like t-shirts & tank tops cost way more than they should for used clothes. The only good thing is the huge selection right at your fingertips. But be ready to either pay a lot for only a few items or pay a lot to get the best deal possible.,1
1427,"Something is seriously wrong with this app. I have uninstalled, cleared cache, reinstalled, several times. Still won't load Saved Searches. When trying to search via your search engine, some pages stay in buffering mode. Extremely aggravating! Please fix it!! Thanks!",1
1428,"When it, finally, comes time for thread up to payout it's a fierce fight. To hit the cash out you're sent back to the shopping site",1
1429,Awesome,5
1430,"I ordered 5 sweaters only 2 are in decent condition the other 3 are not wearable dirty and smells horrible full of pet hair, my allergies are going crazy, even though they were described as in good and excellent condition",2
1431,It doesn't even have a tab for men's clothes. Real nice 👍,1
1432,Great finds,5
1433,"Shipping is high. Also, I got a reward for free shipping but it covered 10 not 10.99, so that was a lie. I've tried to sell bags through here but they literally took 3 months to process it. I sent a bag of brand new summer clothes. So after it sitting in their warehouse through the summer, then they came back & said my bag was basically worthless so gave me $0 for probably $300 in brand new clothes still in wrapping or with tags. Total scam, if ya ask me. I could've made more yardselling them.",1
1434,"I love shopping on thred up. so easy and fun. Amazing bargains. Great customer service. Helping the planet. Looking chic and stylish. Awesome sales and rewards. I no longer sell on thredup because they charge 14.99 and you get 50 cents per item. Not worth it but I love the buying experience. The app is good except for when you have a list of reults of a search and when you look at 1 item and go back to your search results, it goes back to the top. I prefer using the website on desktop.",5
1435,"Keeps filtering with incorrect sizing.. every time I open a new search or select a sale, it puts in Petite, standard. neither are saved as my sizes. I'm TALL. Not a midget. Also, when I try to put in the correct filters,it will say no results, and if I just clear the filters, it will show no results. Doesn't make any sense. I just do not trust a site that has bugs like this. It's weird and shows there's obvious issues. I ordered twice a year ago, but now, something is clearly wrong.",3
1436,Worst ever.,1
1437,It's easy to find what you're looking for shipping is quick which I really really like the clothes are always in good condition folded really nice thredup is one of the coolest places,5
1438,"I love shopping on here.. I get all my name brand clothes for half the price, and it ships extremely fast, and they are high quality.. thank you",5
1439,Shipping is ridiculous why charge that much for shipping I would buy clothes but not for that much to ship,1
1440,"Pinch me, I'm dreaming!! I remember scrolling across the biggest online consignment shop about 2 years ago. It feels good shopping consignment and it has kept me, my mom, and my daughter oh so happy choosing our own unique styles. On top of that, knowing we will get quality brand items for realistic prices from Thredup😁",5
1441,"I bought a purse with measurements indicating it was 17"" long on the base. The purse came today and it's 9 1/2 inches. They don't accurately describe or measure their items and then deny ability to return. Now I'm stuck with a purse I can't use and I'm out the money I could have spent someplace honest with good customer service. Never using thred up again.",1
1442,Always have trouble making a return . Been trying for 3 days on this return . Customer service closes when they ask you to try doing something to see if it's working .,1
1443,I buy and sell! Very happy so far!,5
1444,"Thredup has expanded my closet to awesome levels, for less money than getting everything new, and helps save the planet. My favorite thing about this service is how easy it is to return things.",5
1445,The search your sizes feature on the App doesn't work properly,1
1446,Glitchy!,3
1447,"If I could fewer stars, I would. Thredup is a rip off. You get so little money back. They have one of my bags and haven't even opened it. They've had it for MONTHS. I will never use thredup again. You're getting so little money back, it's a waste of time. Might as well just post them on nextdoor or trash nothing or buy nothing and give them away for free. Give them to someone who really needs them, and they don't go to a landfill.",1
1448,No men's section.,1
1449,"I love using this service on desktop. That being said, the mobile app is unusable. You cannot set any filters. There is no point wasting your time looking through a bunch of irrelevant items.",1
1450,I wish I had discovered this earlier! What a perfect way to dress the way you want to And afford to do so!,5
1451,I'm addicted!! This is the easiest app to get addicted to!! I find myself browsing and adding stuff to my favorites several times a day!!,5
1452,"I love ThreadUp. It really is a great app, and they have great customer service!",5
1453,"App is terrible. Nothing works as it should. When I attempt to unfavorite sold items, they're not starred but still apart on my favorites. I have to restar then unstar. When browsing, it forces a refresh vs allowing me to refresh as I want to. You can't categorize your favorites, e.g. I might like to only look at the tips I've saved, or maybe have a special category for an outfit I'm building. Also, clicking on random search items just brings you to a blank screen without details or larger pic.",1
1454,Great inventory and prices.,5
1455,"Good consignment store, as long as everything goes smoothly! No customer service, none! So if your package gets lost and you've paid for the item, the only recourse is yo call your bank. Update. I have 2 orders that havent shipped. It's been 2 weeks, and again, no customer service. Will be canceling the irder through my bank.",2
1456,"Frequent thredup shopper here-- I found the thredup app to be very disappointing on my Android phone. My favorites that I saved on my computer are not all found in my app. None of the filters work, for example if I did a search and wanted to filter by color or size it doesn't apply to the search results. I'll only browse on the app if I don't have my computer with me. These issues have been going on for a while and I'm disappointed they're not being addressed.",2
1457,Love it!!,5
1458,App is a little glitchy on certain places but the service is awesome!,5
1459,Love this app! Easy to use and filter with my wants and needs.,5
1460,Unbelievable...paying Sellers pennies for quality clothing. :(,1
1461,"When it comes to buying, great, but sending clothes to sell is not good. they steal ur items and lie about hoe many items u sent. I sent about 15 items and they only put down 2. They may say its because they cant accept them for not being clean or because theyre ripped but i wouldnt send trash clothes. its a waste just shipping that out! I would just use them as rags or repurpose. So one star for the lies. Just sell them on ur own plus they dont give u enough for what u send.",1
1462,It works a little better than the website on a phone but you can't scroll when you are in the cart. It just keeps jumping to the bottom when you scroll up and it doesn't bring you to the right spot when you try to go back.,3
1463,I don't need all theses,1
1464,app crashes frequently and search filters won't apply after selecting them--frustrating shopping experience,1
1465,"I like the ease of the app, and the items are good quality. I'll say that it takes awhile for everything to come, and I'm not a fan of restocking fees.",4
1466,"****Udate to previous review*** I sent in a clean out kit for thredup to resell and almost each item was BRAND NEW WITH TAGS, yet they only approved 4 out of 20 items and said they were ""recycling"" the others for poor condition. BRAND NEW LUXURY CLOTHING ITEMS that were included in their acceptable items list. I DO NOT RECCOMEND SENDING IN YOUR ITEMS TO THREDUP!!!!! Was not honorable at all!! *********Perfect for getting school clothes at reasonable prices! It's like your actually in the store!",1
1467,"Love this App! Everything I have ordered is true to size,color,and overall good product.",5
1468,"The app just plain sucks at this point. It takes a long time to load, and when trying to refine searches, it just completely ignores your selections. It also jumps all the way back to the top of your search results every time you go back to them. It's infuriating. Also, they're now charging like $15 just to send in items? Hell, $15 is probably like 20+ items' worth of credit, because they give you pennies. Gtfo of here. Not a bad place to shop, but a rip off to sell/consign to.",2
1469,"Getting your pay out is very difficult. I have been trying for a couple of days and I keep getting a ""something went wrong"" message 😡",2
1470,I love thredup,5
1471,"Go ANYWHERE ELSE - there are tons of better apps/orgs that you can sell your clothes on. I sent 2 packed bags of clothes I would have been better off donating. After months (sent March&April, saw an 'update' in Sept). I reached out to customer service and it turns out I don't get anything, my sales went to cover processing fees. So you're better off donating or throwing your clothes in the trash over the annoyance of waiting to find out you get $0 OR paying almost $20 to submit for the same $0",1
1472,"Whenever you look at an item and you go back to the main search, it puts you back at the beginning vs where you left off. Frustrating.",1
1473,"I wouldn't recommend using the app right now. I need to keep selecting my sizes because somehow you are showing me all of them despite this never happening before. Also, if I select a brand and a category like dresses it shows me everything from that to handbags. Kind of unimpressed to be honest.",2
1474,5 stars for the service 1 star for the app. Filters in app search are now useless - can't even shop by size anymore. Deleted the app and will just use the website from now on because the app is now unusable! 😡,1
1475,"Used to be great, but now it is beyond glitchy. Filters barely work and often need to be inputted multiple times if they work at all, annoying pop-ups just come back seconds after being cleared, and unsaving items is a chore.",1
1476,"Disappointed, payouts are small %. Then they get you for clean out fee. And they don't post all the name brand items you send in the were in great condition and accepted on their list.",1
1477,"This helps the environment, the pocket book, and I look fabulous! What's not to Love?",5
1478,Use it weekly. No problem. I love shopping here.,5
1479,"I opened the app and it offered a FLASH promo. After shopping, it wouldn't let me use the promo. Also, my items were taken out of my cart too soon and I promise I will NOT be going back to try to find what Thred Up took out of my cart. If you don't want me to purchase it, I won't. Less for me to pay for. You should give us a tad bit more time to - get this- SHOP!!!!!!!!!",1
1480,It was a pretty cool app until it started crashing and filters stopped working,5
1481,I have been ordering from this app for almost a year now and have gotten some amazing clothes for unbelievable prices. The selection is the largest I've ever seen. Be careful when ordering jeans. They never have the fit correct so you have to pay attention to the shape in the pics. Don't download the app. I don't need to compete with any other people to get my steals!,5
1482,You can't search for your size right now. So you just have to scroll until you see a piece of clothing in your size. It wasn't always like this. Please fix the filter so I can start shopping again.,1
1483,"I used to love ThredUP app!!! The shopping experience is the same amazing one that you would get on your desktop! However, now the app is constantly changing my search to include everything BUT my sizes in any specific search. Also, the company has now started charging for sending in clothes and the prices are higher than they have ever been.. very disappointing as I have been doing this for years with them and now have to consign elsewhere.",2
1484,Really cool app! I completely redid my wardrobe for a great price!,5
1485,"Very glitchy app. Filters do not save or if you press back button the filters disappear and search starts over from beginning. Search categories leave much to be desired. Can't search for items like overalls or themed things like holidays i.e. ""Christmas sweater"". Items are frequently listed under wrong search categories. Like you'll see a purse pop up if you search for tops. App does not remember where you left off in your search so if you stop then you have to start all over to see inventory",1
1486,Great 👍 so excited to receive my clothing items,5
1487,Too addicting. I always think I'm going to 'window shop' and end up with a cart full of a dozen items. And it's so amazing when they come! They're broken in and fit so well! Glad to not contribute to fast fashion.,5
1488,I ❤️ ThredUp!!!! It's so easy to find High Quality items in the sizes I want for Fantastic Prices!!! I only wish I had known about ThredUp a long time ago!!!,5
1489,No customer service! You can not contact them at all!!,1
1490,Filters are not working. My sizes don't work. This update is broken.,1
1491,For the most part the app is fine but it resets and page when you go back from looking at an item. Scrolling down to find the spot you left off can be very annoying.,4
1492,Filters don't work.,1
1493,please fix the like function! it's impossible to find clothing I've liked in the past because pressing the like button doesn't add the item to my favorites list anymore and so I'm unable to find it and buy it later.,2
1494,"This app was amazing, and some recent updates made it so frustrating and unusable.",2
1495,"I have had a great experience using ThredUp. My only complaint if that sometimes the app gets buggy when I try to enter my sizes in the search, but it usually works fine, and I've found it to be a great way to thrift online.",4
1496,the save feature is not working anymore :(,3
1497,"Freezes and glitches a lot, doesn't apply saved sizes to searches when filtering, can't save both women and children sizes...annoying how it keeps closing and freezing",3
1498,"Used to love this app, but last update in August broke ALL search filters for Android users which rederers the app virtually unusable for Android users 😕. I'm told that their engineering team has fixed the issue but it won't go into effect until the next update is released. Any timeline on when that next update will occur (are we looking at a few weeks, a month, a year???).",2
1499,Never pays out sells clothes for penny's,1
1500,Good prices but should update online cancelation can't cancel an order and no phone number to call,4
1501,I love all the choices and the prices are great. I've already referred 2friends. I've also sent in part of my clothes that are too big for me. I've been loosing weight.,5
1502,Awesome,5
1503,"Updated 09/2023: A great way to live more sustainably, and I can now afford the name brands I love to window shop and drool over. HOWEVER, the app is poorly made. It seems every time there is a new update, little bugs that were previously fixed make there way through again. E g., (1) when you hit the back button it reloads the entire page so you have to scroll down to find where you were; (2) the filters do not apply after you set them. It's a frustrating app, but a great concept.",3
1504,"App is constantly crashing. Borderline unusable. Update: still very hard to use. Saved searches show the oldest things first, and when you open up a saved search from the top, you have to relaunch the app in order to see more than five of your saved searches.",1
1505,Never use.,1
1506,"Thredup! Your last update should have fixed the issue of filtering products. For the last week or so, the user is no longer able to search for styles, colors, material, etc., and My Sizes aren't showing. Another major issue is that if a person leaves the app for any reason (maybe to text or answer a call), the search automatically starts at the beginning of the long, unfilterable list. Users, do yourself a favor and just use the website.",1
1507,"Search feature not great. Try to filter and the filters dont stay. Click on something and when I go back to the search results it goes back to the top, not where I left off. If I favorite something in the search (not the product page) it doesn't actually save to my favorites. Good deals on the app just a pain to use.",2
1508,Size filters don't work anymore. Won't default to my sizes and manual changes useless.,1
1509,I'm tired of having to scroll back to where I was after I view an item.,1
1510,"App no longer shows clothing in your sizes, even when saved and set to only show those sizes. Very annoying and makes it 10 times harder to find what you're looking for.",1
1511,"Show us the INSIDE of all bags and purses!! Especially since they've all been made Final Sale and can't be returned. I drop a star every year, I think. The more they try to grab money, the less the site appeals to me",2
1512,Eco-friendly and inexpensive,5
1513,Refreshes when you go back after looking at an item making shopping tedious and exhausting. Often had to reset the search EVERY TIME I'd view an item Finally gave up and uninstalled.,1
1514,Great website and easy shopping,5
1515,"I love the idea of thrifting the clothes I wear rather than buy new ones and waisting money, contributing to earth's accumulating waste, and even slave labor. There are few things about the app it's self... it randomly kicks me out, sometimes it says my package delivered when it hadn't, and other things. But for the most part, it's nice that it's all second hand, I can save money, and it's online, so no rummaging through stores to find what I need.",4
1516,Really enjoying how much I'm saving on my purchases. Also happy it's helping the environment and making sure things get used instead of thrown away.,5
1517,"Ever since the most recent update, this app has really gone downhill. I'm a VIT but I have never been given the appropriate level perks through the app, the app crashes constantly, and in my favorites section the only way to unsave a sold item is by re-hearting then unhearting the item. It's a huge pain.",2
1518,"Never pay full price! What?! Price and quality are awesome, but I like knowing it's in my size and the color and style I want without having to drive into the product. What you see is what you get.",5
1519,My filters never stay,3
1520,Buggy. Not synced with website account. Doesn't apply filters.,2
1521,"The app is not great in terms of the user experience. If you select an item to see the details about it you lose your place in your search. I've also had to close and reopen the app to make purchases sometimes. ThredUp is a great concept, it's given me access to brands I would not have thought I could afford. I've increased my professional wardrobe quickly and affordably. Know your prices though, some of the lower end brands are priced to their in store equivalent at times.",3
1522,The last 3 purchases I've made have been incorrect items when I received them.,1
1523,"The functionality of this app just continues to get worse with each use. Right now even after I put in my size and refresh, nothing gets set. Any filters I use get automatically erased. Additionally, when I am scrolling and tap on an item to view, upon going back to the main page it resets all the way back to the top so you can't continue to browse from where you left off. It's so frustrating that I don't even want to shop.",1
1524,"This is a great way to recycle ♻️ your clothes and stuff; for a good cause and you can also find the most unique items. Also, user-friendly 😀",5
1525,"Excellent concept, but frustrating to navigate. The ""my size"" filters would not apply to my searches no matter how many times I tried. Every time I ran a search specifying things like Medium, Large, Tall, etc., unwanted sizes like Small, Petite, Size 2, would appear. I would remove the ""Petite"" label from the top of the search results, and then the entire page would refresh without filters entirely.",2
1526,This is one of the best places I have found nice crisp clothes when they arrived your house exactly as they look when you're choosing the picture,5
1527,"I used to love this app. But apparently I can't search for anything in my size anymore. Every time I search, I go I to the filters to tell it to search within my sizes, but it doesn't save my filter. I don't need to know about all the shoes I can't wear, or the shirts that won't fit me. Hopefully this issue gets resolved soon.",1
1528,"I love Thredup. I also never rate apps so that should say a lot. Although the app can be better, the concept, availability/ variety of items, and customer service are exceptional. Very easy to use and find great items. The thing with any thrift store is the same online, it takes time to find the gems. Patience will serve you well on your ventures here.",5
1529,Not sure what happed with recent updates but the app is not functioning for me. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. It does not keep my sizes and I can't unlike things that are no longer available. The app is unusable.,1
1530,Great possibilities. Love this application,5
1531,"They curate everything which ensures quality and accuracy in description. TX They are harsh in evaluating what you send them so that is the flip side. Overall I think the centralized evaluation is valuable, unless you always buy NWT. Even then, though, they will call out something with tags that seems to have been worn nevertheless.",5
1532,"The app became completely useless after a few months. Every time I try to filter something, it goes back to my search without the filter sticking. It also uses my sizes when searching for clothes for my daughter. I thought I had her sizes saved as well but can't find anything like that now. I've tried Uninstalling and reinstalling. No customer support for the app.",1
1533,"My favorite thrift store, hands down. Online or on land.",5
1534,"i would give 0 stars if possible. they took $102 dollars out of my account after trying to make a purchase, but the purchase didnt even go through, they still have my money, and its not showing up that i ordered anything.",1
1535,Thrifting Fun!,5
1536,"Always loved the app but experiencing the same problems as everyone else - favorites don't want to load correctly and my sizes won't even save anymore - even when I turn them back on, they just reset all over again. Bummer!",2
1537,I recommend this app to all of my girl friends and am always buying things on thred up bc it's always so much cheaper then any store,5
1538,Just wish the goods stayed in your cart longer. But I love the APP,4
1539,Quality clothing at affordable prices with quick delivery. Packed like a fancy dept store.,5
1540,"Many small glitches that make searching and sometimes even checking out impossible. Some saved searches don't load, no matter how many times the app is restarted. Clicking on an item resets your search, likes don't show up sometimes, search parameters often aren't functional, and using discount codes sometimes freezes the checkout screen. I would say the app works well about 65% of the time.",3
1541,"It could just be my phone, but search filters don't apply when I set them (category, color etc.) Had to switch to the website to do a decent search.",3
1542,"It took weeks, almost 2 months to process my first bag, which was filled with designer shoes, boots, purses, bags and wallets, and 2nd bag, not as long, but only accepted 30-40% of my good quality clothing items. Don't expect the promised 70% payout, as they low ball the listing prices and supposedly offer promotional discounts immediately on your items (which render you pennies on the dollar). I won't be using Thredup again",2
1543,I uninstalled and went back to the website. Won't filter and Won't return to where I was after I look at an item. I have to scroll allllll the way back down to where I left off.,2
1544,"I have earned enough points to have $10 cash credit but I can't use it if I am using another promotional code. The only thing I can think of that I could do is select the bundle option and do one item seperately but then I would have to pay full price for that item which defeats the purpose of earning it in the first place. Also sometimes the app glitches, when I am reviewing my cart and I try to scroll up, it will take me back to the bottom. I still love the clothes and sales though.",3
1545,App keeps crashing,1
1546,There are so many great choices and so many deals to be had at ThredUp!,5
1547,I'm finding some really great deals.,5
1548,Edited August 2023 - Search is still hit or miss. Just tried to shop their sale and can't refine very far. I don't have time to search 533 items. Not worth my time if search isn't working right. May 2020- Overall good experience. Filters in search do not always work as intended. Sometimes the back button kicks you out of the app instead of back a page...,4
1549,"My review is solely for the app. It's become unusable. Cannot filter by size: I click done, the filter shows for a brief second and then resets. When trying to search for items in the kids section, the results reset back to women. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck on both my phone and my tablet.",1
1550,The app recently stopped working properly and crashes constantly. It also shifts you back to the start of the search if you click on an item. Super frustrating,3
1551,"I have had this app for a while, and I have bought many things and enjoyed using it until recently. I have unistalled and reinstalled more than once to try to fix issues. The app does not save sizes and when you search, the filters do not work for any filter. When I am shopping this app, I'm usually looking for a specific piece so not being able to filter defeats the purpose of the search. I don't sit at a computer all day and if the app isn't useful, it's not worth having.",1
1552,"Fun to shop all of the amazing selection of items! Great prices, and saving our environment!",5
1553,Glitches when you try to change sizes on the search function,4
1554,"This site used to be amazing.... until COVID. Now that everyone knows about it, it pretty much just sucks in every way. They don't list items long enough AT ALL! And the amount of time that I had to wait just for them to sorry my clothes was an absolute joke",2
1555,Lots of great clothes but if you wanna pay close to retail price this is the app for you!,2
1556,"Best clothing app! Super cheap and arrives quickly. If you love to thrift, you'll be obsessed",5
1557,"The app was glitchy before the update and now even more so after I updated it this week. I double checked my account settings and they still have my correct sizes, however sizes that I didn't indicate are pulling up. I constantly lose my spot in the search if I click to read the description of an item or if I open another app during my thredup scrolling. It's so frustrating that the app developers can't seem to get it right. I also wish that thredup would be even more descriptive with filteting",1
1558,"The filter button does not work. When I return to the search it always goes back to the first page. Recently, it doesn't automatically apply my sizes and I have to select them with every search.",3
1559,Amazing,5
1560,Good app but constant search filter glitches are very frustrating,3
1561,"Works the first time i used it, wont start up now",2
1562,"it's really glitchy. doesn't save my sizes, and takes forever to load. half the time it freezes and I have to x out of it....",3
1563,"I mean cool concept, but there's no mens clothing, there's women's, boy's, and girl's but no mens which is pretty disappointing",1
1564,"Changed from 4 to 1 with 8/28/2023 update. Searches are now useless. Filter options now load and then disappear, showing all items regardless of condition, material, etc. Favorited items are not showing in favorites page but when found again, still reflect having been favorited with a colored in heart. Cart scrolls to the top during review and causes mis-clicks so wrong items are removed from cart and then do not show in the recently removed bar - which is difficult to use due to the autoscroll.",1
1565,Positive experience!,5
1566,It glitches fairly often,4
1567,"fun. i hate shopping in stores, but here i can order exactly what i already know fits. The app takes a long time to load.",5
1568,I like this site very much. I can now afford quality clothing -beautiful items that were out of my budget until I found ThredUP.,5
1569,Doesn't offer goods for Men.,1
1570,"In theory i really like this, the clothes are nice however the sizing is a little uncertain. The huge issue i have is the order process and the customer service. I guess i had my last adress saved on the app before i moved and didnt realize i sent my order to my last apartment. After days of emailing, writing on insta, calling the help number that isn't actually a help number, I give up. Probably could have helped if they actually answered. It's weeks too late now. Waste of my money.",1
1571,App was wonderful. Glitches make it frustrating to use sometimes.,3
1572,"Lots of fees, bag processing time is really long. There is not a lot of potential to make a profit as a seller. You pay the shipping cost of the clearout bag. The items they dont choose to list, they charge you, if you want them back. You're Better off selling the items yourself on Ebay, Poshmark, Mercari or even Vinted at least you will make a profit.",1
1573,"Purchasing is great. Products are always as described. WISH we could sort by sleeve length. App is extremely glitchy on Samsung Galaxy 9s. Most days it doesn't load at all, despite restarting app and phone.",4
1574,Great,5
1575,"The thredup app has gotten worse and worse. I can NEVER apply coupon codes, it just sits there and endlessly spins in circles but never applies the code and recently it keeps applying filters that aren't my size, when even I re-apply my sizes and double check that my settings are correct it keeps applying the petite tag and size small and that's not correct at all. Thredup's fees have gotten out of control and their app keeps getting worse. It makes me want to stop buying from them honestly.",2
1576,"Constantly crashes before and after update. If you exit the app for and reason it completely reloads and you have to reset your entire search from scratch. I real pain in the butt. Update: well they app doesn't crash, it does not save your size preferences which makes it near impossible to shop for your sizes. I would shop on this app on a very regular basis if they can figure out the bugs in their app. As it is, I'm moving on.",1
1577,"Ever since the latest update, it has not applied my sizes automatically when viewing different clothing categories. It also takes so long to load anything. The app is not very convenient with these issues.",3
1578,"Absolutely obsessed with Thredup, but man this app is rough. I get notifications for new items and see something cute, so I click. One of two things will happen: you open the app and see NONE o/the new items, or you open and it doesn't show you anything from that search at all. Lately when I search something with a particular material, the filters won't save so the general search is refreshed. If you click an item and back out, it completely sends you back to the top of the search page.",1
1579,"Easy to navigate, well designed.",5
1580,"This is not worth it. They are charging a 15 dollar fee. Luckily, I received the ""free"" bag that they sell for $12.99. I am to receive 91c for an item they sold for $10.99. They sold another for $19.99, and I'm to receive $3. I was excited to try this. Now I wish I had not.",1
1581,You can always count on a variety of different pieces to update your capsule wardrobe.,5
1582,Awesome,5
1583,Great finds! Love the vast selections of brands!,5
1584,"I usually love this app, but it's been really glitches lately - I'll save stuff, but it doesn't actually save. When it's showing my daily suggestions, I'll go through them, but it will reset again, and it keeps suggesting the same things I've said no to all week, etc. Also, it suddenly stopped applying my sizes for no reason. Frustrating, because I just recommended this to a friend, and it's frustrating when it's not as user friendly as I described.",3
1585,Easy to find what I want when brand shopping,5
1586,It's exciting finding clothes,5
1587,"Great place for second hand bags. I ordered several Coach bags and they are perfect, like new. I recommend if you are like me a Coach freak and want to find items that are not available in store anymore.",5
1588,"8/2023: Still a great app and shopping experience. The only complaint is the return fees, but since you're trying to save the planet, it's understandable. 8/2022: Still the best online shopping 4 years later. But the app has really started getting bogged down and the app sometimes features older sales versus the website. I wish restock fees were only charged once per return not by the number of items returned. 11/2018: The BEST online shopping with THE easiest returns!!!",5
1589,I love all the stuff I bought,5
1590,Great place to buy hood quality second hand items.,4
1591,"I've been using thred up for years now and love it. I just don't like the glitches it has randomly and there was a few issues with the app pulling up only my sizes and not sizes to big for me. But overall, it has been awesome and I've been telling everyone I know about it.",4
1592,"I'm really happy with the things I bought. I appreciate the measurements and description of condition. I like knowing I am recycling and I love the prices! They arrive nicely packed, too. It's fun to open my Thredup box and see all my treasures, the beautiful clothing and designer handbags at a significant discount. My new favorite place to shop. I do wish there were more description, though, like showing whether the purse has zipper closure, has sections, saying whether pants are bootcut, etc.",5
1593,No men options,1
1594,"I am so glad I found ThredUp because everything thing I have purchased has been in excellent shape.The prices are reasonable.I normally buy low end items,but good quality items such as dresses,tops,and handbags.For me,secondhand shopping is perfect because everything is budget friendly.",5
1595,"Love the app, not so much the prices. A bit salty for used clothes. I find good brands, and all the clothes are nice, but sometimes I rethink purchasing because of the prices. There are discounts you can rack up from the purchases but like I said, you have to purchase to get points to add up to the discounts. It would be nice if you could use 2 discounts at once.",4
1596,Trusted sight. Continual update on status of order. Merchandise in condition as reported.,5
1597,Never opens,1
1598,Trending clothes at a fraction of costs. Buy all clothes at this site from Madewell.,5
1599,"I get kicked out of the app frequently, several times per session. My payout disappeared. You send a lot of clothes, sell most, get $0. Not worth your time, unless you're purchasing, but expect to get kicked out of the app.",2
1600,Everything is amazing!!,5
1601,Never disappointed,5
1602,This place is a rip off,1
1603,I love everything I have gotten for myself and especially for my kids! Wirh them growing so fast needing new sizes every year I don't like paying full price. These items almost always look brand new. My girls didn't even know they were second hand until I told them!,5
1604,Love it. The clothes I have recieved are in great shape!,5
1605,"I love this app!! Not only do I send them clothes, I also buy from them. It's a win win. The money you get from them you can cash out or shop with them. I have done both and I have had an excellent experience doing both! Truly a great app!!",5
1606,Cute stuff,5
1607,Not for men,1
1608,"I sent in clothes, a while ago. I didn't make much. Which was fine. I wanted to send in more clothes and I have to pay to send them. I understand postal costs. Does this mean. I will make more money. No. I would actually lost more. I can't remove the money I made. I didn't make it to their minimum. I don't remember reading this. When I first sent clothes in.",1
1609,Love it.,5
1610,Sometimes app is a little slow but overall I love it!,5
1611,It's wonderful to be able to buy gently used clothing at a discount especially when you're losing weight and don't want to pay full price for something you only be able to wear for a month or two!,5
1612,Great,5
1613,Thread up Dom I order her fast and instead of returning a pair of jeans that is a little too small they gave me the money back for the jeans That were too small and told me to keep them and gave me the money back so I could buy another pair which I think is just an amazing policy to have. Very impressive.🤓👍,5
1614,"Jumpy and fickle. Mainly during SALES. Recently, I must open in browser to input the sale code. Also difficult, deleting some items from the cart.",3
1615,Best app for clothes,5
1616,Good deals in good conditions,5
1617,"You can easily navigate through it but that's the only good thing about it. I'll try to keep this short. But in my experience they've have taken so much money only to commit highway robbery. I loved having this app until I tried to do a clean-out kit. The biggest mistake of my life. Thousands of dollars worth of stuff didn't make the cut/get posted, 90% of what I sent back I had bought from here, and only to get 11 things post for sale at cheap costs and only get pennies to the hundreds. Awful",1
1618,So this is 8-18... another problem with NO WAY TO CONTACT!! package says delivered. I was home all day in and out walking my dogs and NO PACKAGE HOT MY DOORSTEP!! SO I'm out 50 $ the previous review and now I'm out 35!! I've spent over a thousand $ at this site so As long as you don't have a problem its great. But if you do need to flow up with a return thats not showing up then no one to talk to. Customer service emails you a blanket instruction on the topic of your issue but NO REAL RESPONSE!,1
1619,"Underwhelming! The app is functional, but boring.Their system is outdated as far as consignment. Hands down their current business model is of paying people pennies for clothes you provide them. The only people making money here are the shareholders,investors, and venture capitalists. Although I suspect a move soon where people will list their clothes themselves on other platforms or apps and keep more of their hard earned money. Basically they steal your clothes and keep the profits.",3
1620,I love shopping thredup. There's more choice than at thrift stores in my area.,4
1621,"App is fine but company is so slow. Sent items 5/10, they were received 5/21 - summer items. It's now 8/18, and the processing date is in September. They won't sell. Waste of my time. I should have brought them to a thrift shop. Live and learn. They'll end up in a landfill, which is what I was hoping to avoid. So, good to buy but don't bother trying to sell on this.",4
1622,The directions were confusing.,2
1623,I found the most comfortable jeans at a thrift store. When I looked them up online to get more they were $278... ummmm that wasn't happening so I decided to look on here and I got 4 pair for under $40. It said the condition was light wear but I couldn't find it...fantastic!!,5
1624,Hard to open app!!!,1
1625,"I think I enjoy it. The filtering system seems to work for me. I really wish there was a way to easier browse the items you've already saved. I find myself saving a lot, but then I have to scroll through everything, all shoes I've saved and all dressed and tops, and it'd be nice if I could sort by price or type, or put them into folders or organize what I've saved.",4
1626,"Great shopping experience overall. Some items are a little frustrating: returns are not working in the app - you have to go to the full site to process a return. Also, I've noticed this on both the app and the site when you filter your search, the same results will be duplicated on multiple pages.",4
1627,Works well on a consistent basis. Easy to use.,5
1628,Love Thred up. It saves me money!,5
1629,"I used to send in a ton of clothes. It was convenient because it was free to get a bag and fill it up, send it in and hope for the best. I wasn't too worried about the extremely laughable pay out but now they want to charge $3 for the shipping bag plus a $15 fee to sell.... Umm I would end up owing them money after it's all said and done. It's no longer worth my time. (Added I always wash and fold the clothes before sending) ...ohhh and it won't let me cash out my earned money into my bank/PayPa",1
1630,Always great prices & styles. Addictive!,5
1631,"It would be great if I didn't keep getting kicked off the app when I'm trying to browse. Can't even browse long enough and then suddenly get kicked off the app, it's really frustrating.",2
1632,No men's section 😢,1
1633,I couldn't be happier with my experience using thredUP! Amazing prices on tons of great items!,5
1634,The buy 10 or more 30% off coupon code isn't working. I also made sure my app was up to date.,2

1639,Bad very bad service.,1
1640,Very good news about this one!!,5
1641,"Awful Experience Selling, did a clean out. Take forever to pay. Never pay you because they have a non-transparent system of arbitrarily deciding which clothes to list (probably employees get first dibs) then selling what is listed and you get pennies. literally less than a dollar. Then you are whacked a $14.99 fee on clothes you provided them. Then claim i got paid and there is no proof they paid me. No live chat feature. the only winners here are ThredUp so back to Mercari or Poshmark for me.",1
1642,Well i useto love it until they added fees so now when i sell clothes i can hit above the fee price of no matter either $15 without their handy bag or $17 with bag. My sales are hitting $14 for my clothes i am not happy about these fees and this time bag was nothing but high dollar items. Someone please explain how they are #1 for selling clothes to make money when i keep making no money.,2
1643,Unusable with the new update. Constantly freezes and shuts down.,2
1644,Love it!,5
1645,"The app isn't the issue...it's the business. I strongly encourage anyone considering selling w thredUp, RECONSIDER!..especially if you are looking for a payout. They are selective with the items they list. If you don't pay for the rush processing, expect to wait 10+ weeks. Any item that sells will first go towards shipping costs. Anything thereafter will go towards your payout, but within the required window. If not, your items are ""recycled."" Buyers also beware. They work for PROFIT.",2
1646,I have been ordering off of thred up for years now. All of the clothing I have received has been in mint condition . All of the items of clothing are perfectly pressed and look entirely brand new and are packaged very neatly . They have so many discounts for all brand named clothing. I have a 14 year old grand daughter that starts high school this year living with me and I have saved a ton of money with buying her brand named jeans at such a low price .,5
1647,"1. If I'm shopping through a large grouping of items and respond to a text, I'm automatically brought back to the beginning of the grouping to start over. This is extremely frustrating! Most times, I will go out of the app and come back another time. 2. Filtering withing the app is so limited. 3. Recently, the app has had a lot of glitches!!! Shutting down in the middle of shopping is one major issue! Not allowing me to see everything that is in my cart is another. Extremely frustrating!!",3
1648,App has been a headache! Can't use it because it's shutting down 9 times out of 10. Ive finally accepted it's not going to properly work & deleted the app completely & shopped on Mercari & Poshmark 🤷,1
1649,This is an Awesome App. I use it everyday! Works great! I love this concept it's fantastic!!!,5
1650,So far pretty good. It's just time consuming to surf through all the pieces and sizes. It's fun when I have time.,4
1651,Wonderful variety of products,5
1652,I used to love this app and recently is not working properly at all. I just updated because it was going slow. Still proceeds to go slow and it keeps crashing. Fix your app thredup!!,2
1653,Filters for searches don't work,1
1654,Great app with all of the options you need.,5
1655,It's absolutely awesome for shopping high-end on a budget.,5
1656,Fantastic!,5
1657,"Overall functional and an easy way to shop thredUP, but sometimes it's glitchy and weird. Some examples: *I have one saved search that just won't load, but when I redo the search, there are results and the app reflects that it's a saved search. *Sometimes the app just doesn't want to show me my account page or cart. I have to shut down the app and reopen. Also if the app reloads while you're looking through search results, it'll just bring you to the top of the results. Which is annoying.",3
1658,"The amount we get is so little anymore. And then you take a big chunk off the top at the beginning. I am about to start giving more of my items to charity. If you can afford high dollar clothes you make out, but takes forever to build my account when my pay out is .69 -1-2 dollars.",3
1659,"This app is okay at best. I have a couple problems with it, like the search filters just not working. The biggest problem I have with this app is that it doesn't have a men's section? I'm a nonbinary person who likes to look more masculine at times but there's no men's section, there's only women's, girls, and boys. It's like they made the app specifically for mom's but advertised it as something for everyone? I'm all for a thrift store app that's all women's clothing just market it better.",2
1660,"My first order was designer shoes, love my order love the speed and the professional delivery",5
1661,My first experience was better than expected. I like the way you operate much better than some of the others. The thing I don't like is the description and pictures if purses. Both things need to be more descriptive.,4
1662,"Overall the app works great, but sometimes the filters aren't functional",4
1663,Love the clothes and prices!,5
1664,"I really want to use this app. It seems to have good bones, but I've tried it on several different devices and it nearly always times out as in I am unable to actually view any clothing. A few devices ago using the app messed up my saved searches online. I'll keep coming back to try this out until it works!",2
1665,Total rip off 3 months to process my bag and then I get 20% of the sale,1
1666,Love it,5
1667,Easy to navigate,5
1668,Open app and it won't boot up. I have 5 bars of 5g internet. Had to Uninstall and re install to try to get it to work. Ended up going on the internet page through google.,2
1669,"Complete Trash. Seriously. Their coupon codes never work, app constantly freezes, that stupid bingo game they promote endlessly never saves your actions, everything takes days to load. I have a new really nice samsung, but it didnt work on my last 2 phones either. Thred Up is a great idea but poorly executed, and that includes the app.",1
1670,I love this app and the prices are so affordable that its scary! Love it and would rate 10/10 If I could. They also have so many ways to earn credit that you can receive free items.,5
1671,Terrible app. Slow loading and crashes if I try to like something or load more options.,1
1672,Awesome,5
1673,Like this app- I like buying used if possible and this app has a great selection and great deals,5
1674,Just really disappointed that they resell Shein. Talk about poor quality control.,2
1675,"Uodate 910/23. You CANNOT get into the outlet at all. It doesn't load up. The sales that Thread Up has are awesome. My only complaint is not having the ability to look up junior and womens sizes together. Some brands I wear a 12 but others an 11. Then when you look at the size measurements under an item it's usually off and says a waitline measures at 34"" but your trying to find 31"". So you chance getting the correct size if you make the purchase.",3
1676,Absolutely wonderful.,5
1677,"On my previous order where 2 items were torn, stained and had pet hair. I emailed you and NO response. Tonight I wanted to continue shopping and your site would not allow me...not the first time.",2
1678,So far it has been a great experience. I have gotten some nice clothes that I wouldn't have been able to afford at stores and I have returned some items and havent had any issues. I am loving thredup!,5
1679,Great service,5
1680,The app keeps crashing and not saving my favorites. When I try to search clothing items the search bar doesn't change. Also they up the price on donation bags. So now it's not really worth it or different from Amazon.,1
1681,Can't access my account via app. It just spins and spins like it's loading and never does. It's updated. I've logged out and back in. I've uninstalled ans reinstalled.,1
1682,Excellent App all the way around!!,5
1683,I've found some great pieces here and like how easy it is to use the app .,5
1684,"I enjoy being able to look for items and use the filter to find what I am looking for. I would love it if the app would include a filter for the length of skirts and dresses similar to the filter used on jeans and pants. The grouping of long, knee-length hi-low calf-length and short is inadequate. There are often wrong lengths included in the filtering and makes it difficult to shop for skirts and dresses. Overall, I like the Threadup app, but there could be improvements.",3
1685,They steal clothing. DONT USE THEM!!,1
1686,Love the deals,5
1687,"Really glitchy. It doesn't load certain searches, I can't view some of my account details, I'm not able to track shipments or see details for my clean out items. Why????",2
1688,"Haven't tried it yet, but was looking for bingo?",4
1689,Great prices and very nice products,5
1690,"AMAZING!!!! I kid you not....I completely revamped my entire wardrobe and literally spent less than $40....ON A WHOLE NEW CLOSET!!!!!! Fantastic company, AMAZING rewards, and incredibly well designed user friendly app! Way to be ThreadUp!!?🥰🥰🥰",5
1691,"Useless app.. 1) There seems to be NO MENS CLOTHING... Which is laughable because there is a HUGE market for men's clothing that most thrift apps put to good use.. i.e. Air Jordan clothes from 1984-current is HUGE.. Just look at GOAT app or GRAILED and see how big that market is... 2) The search function is GARBAGE.. You can type in a brand and a ton of other brands come up mixed in the search results.. The price filter doesn't work. In a world of high tech, this app uses only the bare minimum",1
1692,Easy to use browsing with filtering and sorting on many types of garment descriptions.,5
1693,a bit of a learning curve placing orders,4
1694,"Love shopping thredup! Thrifting is my jam but it's so nice to be able to do it on my phone and have a selection of literally thousands of items. The quality is great, and they pretty much always have special deals going to make it even more affordable.",5
1695,Easy to use! Great clothes!,5
1696,Never posted a whole bag full of summer clothes I sent to you,1
1697,I love ThredUp! 95% of my purchases have been spot on and the other 5% was due to trying a new label :).,5
1698,Easy to use and love the selection.,5
1699,It is difficult to navigate. It is difficult to add $ owed to me toward my purchase.,2
1700,"In the past I received the wrong size of shoe twice. Since I don't drive, returning item was and is difficult. Wasn't able to return rain boot. The UK Size was being used as the USA size. But I enjoy shopping with you and 🩱👖👔👗🧣🧤👙🧦👚🥻👕🩳👗🕶👜👝👛📿🩴👡👟👢👠🥿👒🧢💍😄😃🙃🙂😉",4
1701,Fun good quality Good people,5
1702,I've really enjoyed shopping with ThreadUp. A very easy way to thrift without leaving home!,5
1703,I love this app. Great stuff. Great prices.,4
1704,Always find great deals on clothes with tags or like new! I appreciate the filters. It's relatively easy to navigate.,5
1705,I ordered two jackets and both were beautiful! I also ordered tops and have been getting compliments from friends and coworkers!,5
1706,The app works well for ordering clean out kits or making purchases. The app fails during the cash out process so you can't get your payment after your items have sold. It's the only function that doesn't work.,2
1707,"You can't get your money for sold items. They make it so hard to get a Cash Out as they call it. Every way I try to just cash out leafs me to another page where they want me to use my money on buying items instead. No customer care! This has been going on for a year,! I still can not get my money and it's only $25.69!",1
1708,"Hey thredUP...your app needs some work. The filter function does not work. I set a price range, and it includes prices outside of it. I select certain styles I want to see, it includes styles I specifically did not choose. You cannot select to filter by BIGDEALS. It greys out the option. My cart wouldn't update. I added 11 items. It will only show the 4 I added first. I didn't seem to have a problem with any of this on your website.",1
1709,This app really doesn't answer any questions that you have. The only option that I got was an email. Not sure if I'll be buying or selling my stuff through this company.,4
1710,Terrible customer service. Been waiting over a month for an update on an order with little to no response from customer support. Will probably end up contacting my bank to dispute the charge. Would definitely not recommend.,1
1711,My experience with thredup was completely horrible a nightmare I felt like I was lied to this company is Twisted they took all of my merchandise and sold it for their own profit and give me chunk change clothing I pray that they will be out of business before the year is out I consider them to be Thieves that is my review so I take my losses for they have stolen from me you don't deserve no stars as far as I'm concerned you are zero + 0,1
1712,"I have encountered issues with products not properly labeled and in wrong departments. I had ordered clothing for my son and ended up with items that were not the correct size as labeled on item description (more than half of all my items in that order were not what I expected). I am also disappointed with their Clean Out option. It takes WAY too long, they accept very little (even though items sent in are in good condition), payout is not great, and the cost is high!",3
1713,"I love the interface. The way you navigate and see the clothing has a learning element, but once you do, smooth sailing! Top brands, customizable, better than Zulily, temu, Wayfair, SheIn, all of the rest!! I love threadUP!!!",4
1714,This company has went downhill & extremely greedy. They now want $15 for a shipping label even though they list 50% or less of your clothing and they keep 30-50% of the selling prices. They still list the unwanted items for strait profit. I used to love this company but I can't justify their increased prices and crazy profit. So many other apps/companies to use that are far more efficient and have better customer service & shipping times.,1
1715,"I really love shopping here. Great selection, and im a lover of thrifting,but the seller be warn they will keep your clothes, They always say they never recieved a whole bag full never got that many always. Also,I found they will charge you 15.00 convenience fee and take all the profits from the sales also. So you will definitely lose out.",4
1716,"Love this place! I have not been disappointed yet, I have ordered twice. Don't expect your items as quick as Amazon, but usually arrives within 10 days, if you don't choose the option to shop all week and add to your order. Overall, it is worth it.",5
1717,Sent alot of stuff in and many items not listed and I know they were in perfect shape. What a scam now I have to pay to get my stuff back. Forget this,1
1718,I've used this app for years but suddenly I keep getting booted out every time it loads in. Literally can do nothing with it. I will gladly change my rating once this bug is resolved.,5
1719,Everything I try to ise the app it logs me out .,5
1720,"Can't use the app, it crashes every time.",1
1721,I LOVE THRED UP!!!!!,5
1722,"Don't trust them, after one order they kept my card on file an they been tryin to get money off my card but I always was alerted your company connected with freeshipping an that where 3x they been tryin to get money off my card not only that I received my order an idk how u have Lil baby overall that say size 9 when it lok more like 6-7 month old size",1
1723,Used the app with no problem..until now..after the update it will let me log on at all.....keeps throwing it off line and not bring up the main screen for the app to run it...,1
1724,The app keeps closing. It's kinda hard to buy or look at anything when it keeps doing this. I even Just did an update amd it still will not stay opened..... PLEASE FIX ASAP,1
1725,"ThredUp is making a killing off of those who shop used. So why is the app atrocious? Why a restocking fee on top of paying for return shipment when items aren't as described-that should be on ThredUp (like every other resale platform) not the misled customer. Why is payout for sellers offensively low when prices are ok at best? How do they get away with taking clean-out bags and not crediting seller for all listed items, without explanation? By taking advantage of those who shop used. Shameful.",1
1726,I love the app BUT every single time I use it the bottom glitches and flickers. Need bug update.,4
1727,"This app is so glitchy, love the company though. I even forgot I had an account for awhile because I deleted the app. Now I only use the site.",2
1728,"I've installed and tried to get this app to work multiple times, to no avail.",1
1729,"Love the choices, love the prices!",5
1730,I love all of the amazing clothes and low prices! Shipping is a bit high though.,5
1731,"I love shopping ThredUp. Not only do they provide sizing, they also post measurements of the clothes. The filter for clothing condition (new, near new, etc) lets me balance condition v cost.",5
1732,No mens clothing options not right at all guys need clothes too 😫,1
1733,"Shipping takes a very long time compared to other companies and once you factor in shipping costs you are not saving much compared to other thrift store prices, if you want one or 2 clearance items shipping costs more than the items if I did not have free shipping I probably would not have ordered. I think the idea of this is great but some improvements could be made",3
1734,"It's fine, but I if these were in a thriftstore, they would be way more affordable. It's more of a consignment store ig.",3
1735,This concept is good but you guess rip people off you get more than half the money you sell our items for and on top of that you also take a 14.99 service fee that's ridiculous I recommend poshmark don't waste your time with this place they pretty much jack you,1
1736,Love,5
1737,"ThredUp is an outstanding company. The app is a bit slow, but informative. Photos are good, but items page doesn't do the clothing justice!! Everything in my order came neatly folded, extremely clean, and in a timely manner. I highly recommend!!! Everything was worth at least 3x what they charged for it, despite being second hand. In all my years of thrifting, I've never been so delighted by a single company. I love what they're trying to do by stewarding our planet toward a cleaner future.",5
1738,I've found a lot of great clothes at a great price,5
1739,Love,5
1740,"No men's clothing, only women, girls and boys. Why no men's clothing. As if I don't wan to buy clothing.",1
1741,Easy to use.,4
1742,Beware:Very addictive! Love shopping here. App works better than website.,4
1743,Shop at your own risk. Return policy is awful: they offer credit that expires to try and keep from you returning an item or make you jump through hoops to make a return. I used to recommend thredup as a great option but they're awful with measurements and you are lucky if you get half your money back on a return. *Which sucks because the return policy page doesn't load.* App also works as poorly as mobile. Constantly restarting and impossible to return to start without starting over.,1
1744,All good transactions! From the beginning to the end! The app is very easy to use. 😃,5
1745,So easy!!,5
1746,My order is cought in a perpetual loop. Terrible customer support.,1
1747,"The app needs an overhaul. It won't update my sizes, it shows me clothing that is too small despite the filters on. I love Thredup's concept so much but I takes me hours to find what I want to look at. Please fix the app, your filter system, etc!",3
1748,It cheap and name brand that usually couldn't afford and like similar to consignment shop,5
1749,Hard to get into thread up,5
1750,Good prices and great products,5
1751,"I have 2 big complaints that have made using this app a frustrating experience: 1) if I need to put my phone to sleep while browsing the app, I will find myself abruptly back at the top of the search results when I come back; & 2) the in-app search engine does not allow for results to be excluded from searches as a means of filtering a category or search. You can refine a search by brand, color, style, etc. but you cannot ask the search engine to specifically exclude items matching any tag.",2
1752,I love thredup it's really great wonderful savings helping the environment too,5
1753,"I will not be doing any business with ThredUp again. I was a loyal customer for years, but the company has gone down the toilet. It is ridiculous that you have to pay $15 to send in a bag of clothes now. They accept very few items, but the ones they do, they charge outrageous prices. $40-$50 for a used blouse is bananas. And because nobody is going to buy anything at those prices, I ended up losing money from sending in a bag. I'm better off just donating items.",1
1754,Love being able to thrift shop online!,5
1755,"I love ThredUp but I wish there was a better way to search for specifically what you want. I like to find vintage items but there is no way to search for ""vintage"", only to search by brand name or item like ""skirt"". It makes finding things difficult and time consuming.",4
1756,It takes a long time but ig you are patient and read the measurements then you will love this app. Been using it off and on for 5 years. I have,5
1757,Very good buying experiences,5
1758,"I love this app and it think what it's doing is amazing, the only issue I have with it is that clothing items are frequently mislabeled as different sizes or different products altogether there isn't and real way to report this or bring it to anyone's attention and I know I have already once ordered something that was not what is was shown to be",4
1759,The items are easy to size and organized in a way I can actually find what I'm looking for!,5
1760,Great clothing at great prices!,5
1761,Love it Little expensive,5
1762,Love it.,5
1763,Wrong item sent and we keep getting bounced around website . Can't get to customer service!!,1
1764,Like buying at great prices,5
1765,"Love the incredible finds I've made. It would be more enjoyable if they provided more details about garments such as whether or not items have pockets. Also, sometimes the color of garments do no look like they do in the pictures when you receive them. Uodate: There should be a 360° view of ALL items. Some have lettering and you can't see it at all. I contacted customer service, and they can't even request new images of the items.",4
1766,"Overpriced. I found a shirt that was really cute selling for 15.99. The shipping for just that t shirt was 10.99. if you look up that shirt new from the brand it was 25.99 with a shipping of 8. So, you could buy the shirt brand new for 5 dollars more. Now maybe that won't matter to you, but to me that seems very overpriced for a business that claims to be a thrift store.",1
1767,Frustrating Speaking with the real-life person can be a bit of a challenge. Just want to check on my order not chat with a bot.,3
1768,This app has been great and the concept itself is outstanding.,5
1769,Best prices and beautiful clothes.,5
1770,"Do not use this app. Descriptions are limited, no indications if items have pockets or what kind of materials they really are. Nothing I have received fits and you can't get your money back. Also I sent a huge box of clothes of all new high quality items and haven't received acknowledgement of any kind.",1
1771,I love this on-line store! I get more compliments on the things that I buy from ThredUp! It's so fun to mix and match things until I get a perfect outfit made just for me!,5
1772,"I was disappointed in the tiny amounts of residual payouts. I shouldnt get less than 50% on any item handed over. I trusted that the payout would be fair but it's not. If you just don't care whether you make money and your recycling textiles, then great. If your using ThreadUp in hopes of making good money, then you will be disappointed in the return. Sending items in was once free is now costing $3, but you may only make .49 cents on a NWT boutique child's summer dress that cost $28 new.",2
1773,"I sent a bag of clothes to ThredUp many months ago and have heard NOTHING back from them! Over a year later, and I never got any word about what happened with my items. I will NEVER use thredUP again and I will tell anyone I know NOT to use them!",1
1774,Slow load times. App has to restart/reload any time you switch off. Really frustrating to use because of the performance.,3
1775,Don't patronize this company.,1
1776,"App is terrible. Crashes all the time, features will freeze and lock, and there are some very obvious usability problems. I love the company and the mission but it's a very frustrating relationship.",1
1777,"The app just isn't as useful as the website. I can't track returns from the app. As for the company itself, they make things right when things go wrong. However, things should'nt go so wrong so often. The last 2 purchases I've made have arrived with damage not listed or shown. One was a NWT pair of pants with a hole where a belt loop should have been. The other was a ""like new"" dress with a shredded seam on the front. These have been delt with, but I wish they didn't need to be.",3
1778,Always have a good experience in this app whenever I shop through here.,5
1779,This business is a rip off,1
1780,Good experience ... Never a glitch and great deals,5
1781,"Awesome service and super bargains! A real treasure hunt!!! And I feel great about the reuse, reduce and recycle aspect - this is living my lifelong values! TWO years later, I still love it!",5
1782,"The app needs a lot of work. There are some links that don't work, and it can be very slow. I use the website rather than the app, but if they ever fix it, I would use it again.",3
1783,Using the app was okay. Some of the deals on the home page take you to 0 items... The bust measurements always throw me off if the item is in the size I normally wear.,3
1784,Great place to get great deals!,5
1785,Its Unbelievable that you can have quality for an awesome price!,5
1786,Don't send anything! Rip off!!!,5
1787,"Love the store. Loathe the app. It's all kinds of glitchy, particularly when you actually want to buy something. The online version works great as a resale store. The application however, is all but unusable.",3
1788,"I like the chothes and the special prices, I can find everything there.",5
1789,I love the low prices.,5
1790,Easy to use and good quality gently used clothing. I like to buy my clothes for work from this thrift store.,5
1791,"Clean out kit, pay out way off. Not worth the work.",1
1792,"Set in 2 boxes of close, it toke mouths to get it listed. Only got $1.80. Its a scam dont send your things to them. Sell it your self your make more money.",1
1793,Good finds,5
1794,I love this app. I can make payments on my orders and for the first time I own high end purses,5
1795,It's wonderful,5
1796,Love ThredUp always a bargain to be found somewhere...,5
1797,Descriptions of items & photos could be better.,3
1798,"I love the concept. The app just really needs work. Everyone's concerns are on point, especially cust. svc...there really isn't any. I disagree with the restocking fee policy since the descriptions and photos are limited. Not sure if the return time changed. I was stuck with $300 of clothes that didn't fit on last haul and no cust. svc.. It took 12 days to receive order and I only had 15 days to return from date of purchase. The app was not helpful in resolving issue at all.",4
1799,Great options and love it tells you if clothing has defects,5
1800,"Measurements were way off, sent me a pair of jeans that were different than what I ordered & about 3 sizes too big. The other 2 pair were off in size as well. I ordered from thredUp because they sent me a coupon & free shipping. BIG MISTAKE! I would return but they charge a restocking fee. I'll stick with Poshmark & Ebay. Never a problem with them & the shipping is twice as fast. ThredUp is very slow to mail packages. If I could give 0 stars I would.",1
1801,Horrible. I sent 4 boxes full of high end clothes. I literally received nothing. They set low percent payouts & take that with the per box fee. So they just stole my items & made money on all of it. Don't ever use them. Just donate to a thrift store instead. It also took 7 months before I heard anything at all after sending the boxes.,1
1802,"The app itself freezes up once in a while and is slow to load. The sizes listed/items listed are sometimes wrong in many ways. They charge for cleanout bags and for restocking and for selling your items, so, you make a pittance from your items. Processing times are excruciatingly long both in and outbound. Have a garage sale and keep your money.",3
1803,Excellent,5
1804,"Shopping, shipping and returns are a serious hassle. Everything is automated and done through the app. Nothing updates as it should and there are no humans for customer support. You have to pay to return items, the return window is only 14 days but you can't start a return on the app because it doesn't update to show that you received the items. Can't return what you didn't receive. Major hassle for a busy mom like me. I'll stick with the hassle of going to the store.",1
1805,I love getting clothes from thredUP. They're always in great shape and affordable. The app is just a bit glitchy sometimes.,4
1806,WHOA!! This app as well as the Company is a total Ripoff!! Place your clothing items elsewhere . Anytime you don't receive half of the value of your items then I suggest listing elsewhere. 2/3 cost for the Company is not the way to go. Spend your time in better genre's.,1
1807,"Love most of it but sometimes there's a glitch where the current discounts don't show up in my favorites. Also, I wish I could add to cart from the preview like you can on the website.",4
1808,Love the app and thrift store. Miss the goody boxes,4
1809,Can glitch every now and again.,4
1810,Love the app! I like the suggested outfits feature which only seems to be online. Would like to see this in the app with more options.,5
1811,"Easy to shop, great prices, wonderful variety of clothing.",5
1812,"For the most part I like it. I have trouble with searching specific items & when I scroll through the items it refreshes back to the top of the page if I exit the app for 2 seconds. I also received an item that had a Goodwill tag on it for $7 & bought it on here for $21.99 which got me thinking it's probably best to just to stick to physical thrift stores, people buying quality items for cheap & selling them for more, which I'm not hating on by any means good for them but sucks for me😅",4
1813,Love it!,5
1814,"I've used thredup for years and I really love it, but the app is really frustrating to use. If I minimize the window and then go back to thredup it takes me all the way back to the top of the page. If exit and try to reopen it won't open.",4
1815,It's easy to filter and quickly scroll to find appealing items,5
1816,"Love this app, it's made thrifting so much easier and more enjoyable. I wish there were easier ways to search for the exact item I'm looking for however, like style & aesthetic tags or something. :)",4
1817,"I like the idea of recycle, reuse, reduce. This is helping not only me and others but the planet too! Thanks Thredup!",5
1818,Love this app,5
1819,"They don't mind taking your stuff, but it will take at least 6 months before they list your items on consignment. By then, the clothes you sent will be out of season. Delay, delay, delay....that's what they do.",2
1820,Very good place to catch a good deal. Either for yourself or to resell. Tons of new with tags. Frequently offer discount codes and sales. A little bit slow customer service but all issues always have been resolved in my behalf.,5
1821,Sent in multiple boxes even 2 Dior bags and still dont have a shopping credit!! Dont let them rip you off too!!!!!,1
1822,The app works great and very smooth! Mercari Developers need to level up lol,5
1823,I now only buy new to me clothes second-hand. I love Thread Up. The selection is awesome. I find great quality clothes at a fraction of the price. I really believe in buying second-hand clothes for helping the environmental.,5
1824,"I absolutely love ThredUp conceptually: great variety, great prices, low environmental impact, and selling your stuff back is fabulous! The con is that you can't really narrow the search that much. It gives you some options, but you can't search specifics really at all making it necessary to scroll a ton of items to find what you want. Sometimes I want to browse a large swath, but sometimes it would be really helpful to be able to take a more targeted approach.",4
1825,App won't open or do anything,1
1826,I have bought some high-quality work clothes for great prices,5
1827,"No ads, easy to navigate, never kicks me out of account",5
1828,"It's okay for shopping, but not for selling. I will be getting nothing for the items I've sent them. I understand they are a thrift store, but they say you can sell items too. I would only get 15% of the total selling price, and they charge a $15 service fee. I sent them my items months ago and I won't be making any money back. What a rip off. Sure thrift your items, but they are making a ton of money off your unused items. The prices aren't that great either. App is being deleted.",2
1829,Great.,5
1830,"Overall works well. Refunds easy to process. Not all items have sizing listed and in the app, if your screen goes off, where you are in the search resets. This is the most annoying thing.",3
1831,The clothes are always delivered so wonderfully ironed & clean. I love this app!,5
1832,Love it!!!!,5
1833,Mens isn't even an option to search for.,1
1834,No ads - easy to navigate app. A little too easy because I am on it daily! I love ThredUP!!,5
1835,Great,5
1836,I guess the live spider in the box was a free gift?,2
1837,"Can't find a way to reach actual customer support. The returns page on the app just displays ""failed to retrieve return history"" and the FAQ is no help, it just keeps flipping from the app to the browser where it won't let me log in. And there's no way to reach a human for help. So be warned - if you order something and it doesn't fit you're going to be stuck with it.",1
1838,Not good for men. It seems like this app caters only to women users which to me is kind of disgusting. They don't even have a men's shoe section.,1
1839,I love thred Up and the huge variety they have. The only thing I think would make it better if you could search by the actual clothing items chest/waist measurement. That would save a lot of time searching in my sizes for clothes that will fit me well.,5
1840,Fantastic in every way!!,5
1841,"Changing my initial review because these people rip off the people that provide the clothes to sell.... they gave me a whopping $20.54 for a kit that had high end wallets, purses and jeans... not to mention all the name brand next to new tops that were sold by them also...I mean come on, $20?!.! That's not even worth the trouble to send the box to them... and I sent the kit to them over a YEAR AGO!!!!! Edit: it's now June 2023 and the 25 pc kit that was sent 04/ 2021 paid out 59.10, ridiculous!",1
1842,"I love this app, but sometimes I wish there was additional information in product descriptions. For example, is there padding in things like sports bras or dresses? Overall a very accessible and enjoyable app to use!",4
1843,Sent in items (designer shoes) and items were never listed in my account for sale. Do not use.,1
1844,"Great experience, fast shipping, good quality clothes!",5
1845,"Exceptional. The inventory is enormous. The app is easy to navigate, and the customer service is great. Clothes arrive nicely folded and beautifully packaged in tissue paper. I love the thoughtful details put into the entire shopping experience. It's become my favorite way to shop, and my daughter loves it, too!",5
1846,"Great clothing at Great prices. Update: After years of not shopping, my recent purchase was fantastic! Quality items, perfect fit, descriptions match products perfectly and the prices are always great. Can't wait to do it again!♡☆",5
1847,Why couldn't I see more?,3
1848,Why all the fees. You use to be a good place to sell items. Not anymore because of the fees.,1
1849,Trouble loading app,1
1850,I don't find anything that I like,2
1851,I love repurposed clothing. Thx,4
1852,"I can't say enough good things about thredUP. Everything that I have ordered over the last couple of years has been in excellent condition- most still with the original tags on them. I can truly say I have never been disappointed with an order. And knowing that I am helping the planet in the process, makes it all even better. Great selection of name brand clothing at low prices. Thank you thredUP!!",5
1853,LOVE THREADUP!!! Good quality items for half the price!!,5
1854,A reasonable way to buy new or gently used clothing.,5
1855,"Difficulty completing a purchase, getting an error message. It's turned me away quite a few times.",4
1856,Easy to use!,5
1857,"Often when I search, the filters don't work and I only get a fraction of what I see that's on my web browser. I spend a lot of waiting time on this app so wish it were more accurate. Thanks!",4
1858,The app is intuitive to use. I've found lots.of great used clothing for me and my kids.,5
1859,Great,5
1860,Doesn't work well,2
1861,Very good experience.,5
1862,Worst experience ever. Covid was blamed for extreme processing time. More than 8 items were sold at 30 plus dollars or more and I only pocket less than 9 bucks could have taken everything to platos closet and made at least 60. Charged a $14.99 fee and took up to 50%-80% of money made.,1
1863,"Love the earth friendly concept and massive selection. Everything I have received has been in great condition. The filters are great, but they could use some work. For example, if you try to filter tall pants, Prana isn't a brand option. I also wish washing instructions were part of the item description, as I don't generally buy handwash items. Hopefully, they expand to include men's clothing someday.",5
1864,Love all the great deals,5
1865,"I LOVE ""THRED UP""!!!!",5
1866,Go local! There is no value here.,1
1867,Easier than a store.,4
1868,"Fast shipping, LOVE the clothes. A BEST BEST.",5
1869,"Everything I have purchased here has been as advertised and in great condition. Highly recommend. Also it makes sense to me to reuse and recycle. Ready to wear and throw away really impacts our planet , so this is brilliant. A thift shop at your fingertips! Update...I continue to be amazed at the wide selection available and the quicker shipping turnaround. I'm always here for the discounts that are earned by getting points and the really big sales events. I am constantly getting compliments!",5
1870,"The hand bag was smaller than advertised and is useless to me. It was also more worn than advertised. This will be my last purchase because now I am stuck with an item I can't use, and it is non-returnable. Waste of money.",2
1871,"I love the fabulous selection of clothing. Designer fashion at an affordable price in excellent condition and great value! Love, Love, Love THREDUP.",5
1872,I'm unable to cash out and am not getting a response to my emails,3
1873,My go to site now for shopping,5
1874,"Fun! I have found some cute bargains, love it.",5
1875,"I paid for my top. I didn't receive it, and now it is for sale again.",1
1876,"I've spent ALOT of money on this site nothing ever fits,or it's trash or too small it's never right then you can't return them because it'll cost more money! I'll never use this again",1
1877,Charges almost $15 to send in a clean-out bag now.,3
1878,Fast shipping,5
1879,"Overall good experience. Most shoes are unlabeled when it comes to materials, and you gotta want to buy a lot of you're gonna buy through thredup to make it worth it. The cancelling order process is also super complicated. I've found some of my favorite pieces from here and I love the ethics, so I think you should go ahead and download!",4
1880,"Absolutely love Thredup. Received my first order and everything came in excellent condition, clean and the packaging was like opening up a gift. The only issue I have is with the app. when I put in a ""promo code"", it takes about 30 minutes for it to lock in, and by the time it locks in, all my stuff in my cart times out and I have to re-add all my items. Not really a big deal, just annoying. I would definitely recommend Thredup to anyone and the prices are excellent. Thank you! 😊",5
1881,"Easy to use, with lots and lots of great clothing options. I may never shop for new clothes (besides obvious) because of how easy threadup makes thrifting. Would absolutely recommend.",5
1882,"Quick shipping, accurate clothing descriptions!",5
1883,They make it close to impossible to cash out your money.,1
1884,Customer service is horrible. No one responds to information in the chat boxes and there is no Customer Service number. Awful!,1
1885,"App great if spending money. Lousy getting human help for refunds or altering orders. And I find better deals at local thrift stores. Paying shipping for already overpriced used clothing, or losing restock fee & additional shipping fee on returns is insane for a frugal consumer. Scrolling thru 100s of items (even after filters) can be addictive & frustrating in search of quality pieces. App continues to lure me back with ""surprise"" rewards that are impossible to apply at checkout.",1
1886,Unable to access app even though app was installed.,1
1887,I love love love this app. No complaints. Customer service is on top of there game in case you have a problem. The quality of the merchandise is exactly like stated. And the sales are phenomenal!,5
1888,"Sorry, we are having problems loading the app currently. Please try again later. I get this message on all of my devices...",1
1889,I'd give zero stars if possible. The app will only open to the menu but nothing else. Can't chat online or speak to a live person. Don't know what happened to your app. I've been a customer for many years and put the app on my tablet.,1
1890,App glitches sometimes and needs to be rebooted; when this happens at the time of placing the order this can be nerve wracking. Otherwise works well and is easy to browse.,4
1891,I can find the brands I love at reduced prices.,5
1892,"1/22/23 UPDATE: SELLERS BEWARE!! I sent in two bag full of clothes. They processed one bag of over 30 items and only 7 are listed. They set a price (you can change it) but you'll only receive pennies in the dollar Initial Rating: I've submitted my items, they received them back in August 22. They have not processed my items to sell. It's now November, Im starting to feel like I should have just donated what I sent in because there's no progress in selling my items. Big slow fail at this point...",1
1893,"I wouldn't order unless you're comfortable with getting items that are not as described or damaged. This has happened to me more than successful purchases. Also, now they have added a 14.99$ sellers fee, shipping is 10.99!, and if you choose to send in items, certain brands you can't cash out on! I buy old navy and target and the prices are pretty much the same as in store. Disappointed.",1
1894,Most amazing website I don't shop anywhere else so easy love it,5
1895,The app was fine. The product was awful. Dropped my purchase off at Salvation Army. Avoid this site.,3
1896,I love what I see I get I'm a larger size woman and a grandmother love shopping the sight,5
1897,Having problems with your app and I can't contact customer support...If I could rate this app a zero I would,1
1898,It's not letting me sign up at all,1
1899,The app needs the same features as the website. It crashes sometimes too.,3
1900,"It's addicting , they have really great deals on good quality clothes. No complaints",5
1901,"Horrible. Sent in items that they kept, and sold. Didn't receive a dime.",1
1902,I love this site! Thank you and keep up the great work!,4
1903,Great besides the shipping cost.,4
1904,Works as should,5
1905,"love Thred Up, l just ordered my 3rd bundle.",5
1906,I LOVE ThreadUp! It's super easy and the items are always as advertised. One option I use all the time is tapping on a brand name to find everything they have for that brand. There is always a sale going on and they usually have a new sale every week. It is my favorite place to shop!,5
1907,"Pretty good user experience, love the service",4
1908,Love it!,5
1909,Very user friendly,5
1910,Used another to buy but when I tried to sell my items they sent then right back without even posting anything,2
1911,"Overall the I like the app and concept but it would be really nice if I could also filter by ways to wash the clothes. Often I'll come across something I really like, but then it's dry clean only. I try to filter by material to avoid most of it but then I'll still see it, and I just want washing my clothes to be easy. Also, for some reason logging out just doesn't load for me and I had to reinstall the app to change accounts.",4
1912,"Searching for items has become virtually impossible. It used to be occasionally I'd find something miscategorized and I could blame it on the occasional human error, but now it's as if the search function simply does not work. Using filters is even more useless, if you're lucky you'll get the same item type but I've absolutely found shoes when I was searching shirts. I don't know what's happened, but I hope it's fixed soon. I used to use this app all the time but now I avoid it.",1
1913,"I love shopping here, and the app makes it super easy.",5
1914,Update... I am unable to log in on new phone after using the app on old phone. When they fix the glitch I will update. Here recently when I click on a product it goes to the next page but has a loading icon over it rendering me unable to add any items to my cart. I literally waited two minutes for the loading to finish but it never ceased. Please help!!!,1
1915,"The app is so, so very buggy and refreshes your browse constantly",2
1916,Just got my first order! OMG! The pictures don't do justice to what I received!,5
1917,Having am awesome experience 😎 😌 🤗,5
1918,"I will say I have found some good deals on this app. For me, it's honestly so glitchy sometimes. It can't be my phone because I've had 3 different phones with this app and 2 different carries and same problem. Like last night, I was gonna buy some stuff on their Flash sale, but for hours, the app would not load. Everything else on my phone was working fine. This was not the first time it's happened. I ended up missing the sale because of the app malfunctioning.",2
1919,"Great selection and prices but I hate that you can't combine rewards with promotions. I have something like 1400 points but if I try to use my $10 reward or free shipping, it cancels the sale price so costs way more. So the rewards are basically a joke.",3
1920,I love Thred up great prices on good quality name brand items,5
1921,CAUTION!! I WAS RIPPED OFF $150. If you happen to move and try to place an order they do not ask you for a shipping address. When you try to correct this before shipment you can't. Customer service said they would refund it but after months since contact they haven't. There is no option to change shipping address even before the order was prepared. BOO!!! ZERO STARS!,1
1922,Didn't even let me sign in as a new member. Have no clue how to create an account. It just freezes,1
1923,Best customer service support team,5
1924,I have bought some very nice items with really good prices.,5
1925,The clothes are fabulous and look new!,5
1926,Don't buy from this company there a rip off! They must photo shop there clothes because I've only gotten old worn out jeans a coat that fell apart pants marked tall but was short delivery too forever tracking never got updated. Go shop posh!,1
1927,Love this app.,5
1928,If you need to return for any reason they charge $3.99 per item and then charge you for return shipping too!! I paid $105 and would have gotten $30 refunded if I returned all. Shop the name brand websites and you can get better deals too.,1
1929,"I downloaded the app, and it asked how I wanted to sign in. I gave it my information, it took FOREVER to open, and it never did open with my Facebook or Gmail account. I would NOT recommend this app. 0 stars!",1
1930,You cannot get these kinda deals anywhere else! I'm sitting at my desk right now in a $5 dress that EVERYONE I see asks me about! I love this company!,5
1931,Extremely excellent shopping experience!! 👍,5
1932,Very pleased. Two little problems in over a year and with 3 thousand spent. Customer service does do their job I rarely buy any where else. Highly recommend thredUp....,5
1933,"Used to be great until they started scamming all of their sellers. They have recently started charging extra to mail in a clean out kit. Also, they only list about half of the items you send in. If you don't pay to have them returned they still sell them anyway and keep 100% of the profits. I've recently mailed in brand new (with tags) high demand items that were rejected and not listed as part of my kit, but I saw them selling on their site anyway. So disappointed 😞",1
1934,This is just a fun easy way to thrift!,4
1935,Easy to use and return items!,5
1936,The app sucks. So does your customer service!,1
1937,"Horrible for android, full of bugs.",1
1938,I love thred up! I get my favorite brands in great condition and for a fraction of the cost. Honestly it's a bit addicting shopping on thred up because their prices are so good and they have a huge variety of clothing that is always changing!,5
1939,Love you guys,5
1940,"I was excited when I found ThredUp but it has been a huge disappointment. Your prices are too high. I can find the same items new locally for approximately the same price. Your restocking fee is punative. Garment descriptions are often inaccurate, and garments are often stretched out and in poor condition. I sent you a bundle of clothes in April and I have yet to hear back about it. All in all... not a happy customer. :(",1
1941,"I really want this to work for me but I just don't have the heart anymore. I ordered a kit and I never received it. So, I thought I would try printing my own label and just have to ask when is the fun going to be there.",5
1942,I literally couldn't get past the sign in screen. It kept giving me error messages.,1
1943,"App needs to be closed and reloaded frequently to see entire favorites list, cart, account info.",3
1944,"Absolutely horrendous time setting up an account. App also takes too long to load. You'll have an easier time just going to a real thrift store and looking around. You'd also have what you buy immediately instead of after literal weeks of waiting. The pricing is also ridiculous, who in their right mind is going to pay the price of brand new clothes for something used? You're better off simply buying your clothes new. Thredup is such a joke.",1
1945,Love the price and the condition of the clothes ☺️,5
1946,I've tried everything - will not let me login with Amazon account,1
1947,"I get better results through sales on mercari, vinted, and poshmark.",3
1948,Thanks for being open to anything,5
1949,The app is glitchy,4
1950,Love this app and the clothes 😍,5
1951,Great prices and selection,5
1952,Love it,5
1953,Good filtering and navigation.,5
1954,"$15 sellers fee. Now not only do they get free product, but they get paid for it. And I see them charging more than what I paid in store for my items. It's supposed to be an online thrift store. I used the love thred up but clearly there is a management issue and people that have no idea what they're doing. Unfortunately I think these are the final few years of thred up. I hope something comes in to take their place. Threds ups new changes are driving people to just buy new and fill the landfill",1
1955,"Great products, reasonable prices, great follow-ups, and shipping. Love the rewards, but recently, I am repeatedly having trouble with the website not updating.",4
1956,I love everything about Thred up!,5
1957,Unfortunately I must give this app one star. It won't let me open the app at all. I tried to sing in and nothing. Very disappointed...,1
1958,Love this website always comes on time and everything I've ordered has been amazing size is sizes they said fit great just amazing all around,5
1959,"I use to love this because I could at least get some money as well fast empty spaces in my closet but now with the 14 dollar and 99 cent fee, even if I sell just 1 shirt out of the cleanup bag, I won't get any money. With the increase of fees and super long processing time and even clothes not selling, I might as well keep using poshmark because even though I lose space in my closet, at least I get more for the clothes I put out.",2
1960,love this app. I've made so many orders! I'm addicted. 😆,5
1961,Theft. They will sell your clothes and pay you nothing.,1
1962,"When first started, ThredUp use to pay well for one's items; however, their payout is very low now for name brand items. ThredUp now charges a mail bag fee, a 6 week processing fee, and taxes for a total of $18!!!!!!!!!!! That's as much as what they consider my bag is worth!!!!!!! I'll look for another online consignment company or a local shop. As for buying items, one can find good deals.",1
1963,Was good till update. It keeps refreshing my search list,2
1964,Smooth interactions,5
1965,"This is the site I use to by gently used clothing. I also sell on this site. Earn points for free shipping! Returns are easy. Clothing has always been as described and shipped quickly. This is my go to online shopping site. Prices have gone up. They charge to process your box and shipping costs have increased. There are more ""final sale"" items but final sale usually makes their prices less than Goodwill or other brick and mortar store fronts.",5
1966,Great,5
1967,I am obsessed with ThredUp!,5
1968,"It's a closeted heaven had and anything never happypaintanything talked your left me in a room he kept wanting to plat until i fininytold is old just carvile theses last few has been heard and we werent good anywhere. I don't we are on all want jokes, fired,beat to death, or shopping i knoweach especially the m0ney i am wasted.. sorry",5
1969,Love shopping for deals on my phone!,5
1970,Horrible! Can't get it to open on first use with Amazon or Google & I'm not on FB.,2
1971,"Easy to use, great options!",5
1972,I was very excited to try this out but I tried to log in with Google and the web page just wouldn't load. I'm very disappointed.,1
1973,"I love ThredUp. My only issue with the app is that while searching through items, if I turn my phone off for a second, I have to start scrolling down the top of the search again. Kind of annoying when you've been scrolling awhile and your place is lost.",4
1974,"I have no trouble with the app, and the selection of items is awesome. However, I can't understand why they only take two pictures, front and back only. I've never shopped any site that doesn't at least show the brand tag on the neck, and point out any flaws. All your competitors are listing alot more information and pictures. I just purchased a bunch during the memorial day sale, hope I'm not disappointed when I get them. Also they don't show the inside of bags, so I didn't get any. Do better!",3
1975,"I ordered two pair of shorts! They didn't specify childrens or women's and I got it it, and one was youth size 🙃",4
1976,"This is my absolute favorite shopping app. It's super easy to use, the concept is fantastic, pricing is incredible, check-out is a breeze, and I've received everything in a timely fashion, (in an adorable box with the thredUp polka dot tissue paper, to boot!).",5
1977,"I love thredup. The app is so fun to favorite what you like, and then you get search results for what you like.",5
1978,"Always So Much Fun! I shop Thred Up about 4 or 5 times a year and it has always been fun and I get so much bang for my buck! I have never been disappointed with the clothes, shoes or handbags I purchase from this online thrift shop! Give it a try, especially on holidays when they are most likely to be having a fantastic sale!",5
1979,Don't like what they choose to list. How do we know if they just keep them for themselves!!! I sent over 100 items. They listed some items that has lower value then the items they did list🤔,2
1980,Facebook authentication for an existing account is not working,1
1981,"Customer service is very slow, I sent in my first closet clean out and had several questions but couldn't get timely answers so I don't know what's going on with the things they didn't list for sale. I would l9ve to talk to someone.",1
1982,Great UX score,5
1983,"I wear cowboy boots A LOT as part of my daily attire, so bootcut jeans are a MUST. In the past month I've ordered and had to return, keep, or get credit for MULTIPLE I'm talking AT LEAST 7 pairs of jeans that the item description stated the jeans were boot cut; when they arrived they were skinny or straight cut. Needless to say, make sure your staff understand the difference between skinny/straight/boot/etc. But I've lost all my faith in their jeans dept. and will just buy them at retail price.",3
1984,"I tried to download this numerous times and it won't ""authenticate to the server"" so I can't sign up.",1
1985,Good value,5
1986,Wont let me sing up anything. I cant even open the app,1
1987,"I love this app, probably too much. Here's my feedback: 1) getting customer service is a little glitchy through the app. When they type a response to you it is very tricky to actually find it unless they email you back directly. 2) photos: more scale is needed especially for accessories, some photos are not 100% visible, too many repeat items,press or steam some things before taking a picture 3) needs more options for point utilization: let me use all points at once for a special item!",4
1988,"Love the website and company, hate the app. Can only get it to load about 10% of the time. The rest of the time it just spins likes it's loading but never does. I end up using the actual website most of the time.",2
1989,Missing packages from them . They use Fed EX worst shipping company...the USPS is so much better and more reliable....out $123 if they don't refund my missing package... customer service is pretty awful...just email and chat and they want you to wait 10 days before they willing to offer assistance.... prices are higher than Goodwill and salvation army and I don't think I will order again if they don't refund or offer credit or anything for my missing package from FedEx.... Fed EX is awful 😭😭,3
1990,"Easy to use. Can be a little overwhelming with all the clothing pieces. Would be nice if you could select multiple filter options per category. Pictures of clothing are ok. Not super flattering on the bust/mannequin, but sufficient",3
1991,"Easy to order, beautiful clothes at affordable prices",5
1992,"I use threadup but literally can not use the app. I try to sign in with my Gmail and it's just a loading screen. Forever. The UI is junky on mobile. Use the website, good luck useing the app.",1
1993,When you don't get what you wanted they don't let you return or refund nothing. This app is a mistake and waste of money. Shipping is way too high and the prices are freaking outrageous to be hand me down good will items. That are worn. Bad app your better off to go to the nearest goodwill and delete this app,1
1994,Easy to use,5
1995,I loved them so much when they started. Now they are charging too much imo.,3
1996,I have not been able to get on the site in 4 days. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still nothing. What is going on???,1
1997,Going to uninstall,1
1998,The app itself is a little glitchy and I have a brand new s22 it gets stuck on the thred up loading screen sometimes.,5
1999,The app is great. I use it weekly to check out new items.,5
2000,"Z, , , , , , ,",5
2001,Unable to sign in. Opens a browser but won't sign in on the app itself. Yikes. Please fix.,1
2002,"Love, love, love the site itself. The app glitches often though.",4
2003,"I love thred up, but the app has a few issues now and again. Sometimes checkout doesn't work and I need to close and reopen the app. Could be improved a little. Overall good experience though.",4
2004,Can't log in under any form of Google or Facebook. Never loads. Sucks cuz the website freezes my computer too.,2
2005,They send me discount codes all the time in the mail yet when I go to use them they never apply to anything I put in my cart. Whether it's a full priced item or something on sale it never works.,2
2006,Couldn't even sign in with my Google account. sticking to web browser,1
2007,"I like that I can find good brands for cheap, but it eeps logging me out and won't let me login. It keeps refreshing and it keeps crashing. I don't really like it.",3
2008,"The app won't even let me log in since it's ""upgrade"". I've deleted it and reinstalled several times. I can't even use it!",1
2009,Excellent site for quality repurposed clothes. Try it!,5
2010,"Takes forever to load. Saved searches don't always show up in my favorites section, and the notifications are so lagging that if it's a high profile item, usually it has already been bought by the time I get the notofications so it's basically useless. If I am scrolling through a search and my phone screen turns off for a moment, the entire search refreshes and starts from the top of the search instead of where I was last had scrolled down to.",2
2011,Makes your shopping needs easy to accomplish!,5
2012,"It's always fun shopping for clothes, it's so easy to find what you want on thredup. Some items I feel can be still expensive for being used, but they offer good sales or promo codes. I also love that they hold items you add to your cart for 12 hrs so you know you can get the item even if you can't check out asap",4
2013,"Totally annoying, my cart being emptied after 30 mins. You really think I can go back through all that @#@# and find what I had in my cart. No it's not happening. So I decided not to buy from here to much bs......",2
2014,"It's shopping without the walking, making finding that perfect (fill in the blank) easy and relaxing.",5
2015,Love the clothes and the prices,5
2016,"Great app. Runs well- quick, with smooth transitions. Numerous search filters with sorting options. However, it would be convenient if there was an option to combine a search for both juniors and womens, rather than one or the other. (Kids and juniors would also be great, for young girls who wear both).",5
2017,Thread Up is the only way I can find exactly what I'm shopping for & best of all I reduce my carbon foot print!,5
2018,"I love this online clothing store, but not the app. It uses up my cpu and has terrible response times. I finally gave up and started using a browser. Believe me, the brower version works better. I'm using this on a Samsung S6 lite with 4g of memory and a 64g of storage. Why is it happening?",2
2019,"Was very disappointed. I sent 6-7 bags of misc. & my things were sold for peanuts. Lots of brand new stuff, expensive brand clothing. I received near $50. Never again.",2
2020,"I can't check out with a gift card that was emailed to me from thredup after I returned something - my main complaint, a rep said i should use a PC to shop so i can use the gift card. No. I can't accurately check my sales (nothing loads). Now returns are not functioning either. I get multiple emails daily with item ads, but the email link opens to the app homepage, not the item.",2
2021,Don't work.,1
2022,My entire wardrobe is now eco friendly thrift inspired items which I've saved money on yet they look fabulous! Thanks thredUP!,5
2023,Doesn't work on Android,1
2024,"It's a nice app, nice concept, has a lot of nice things, but there's a lot of issues. First and foremost, the first time I bought from here, my order got cancelled and I received two things I did not purchase. It was a bit disappointing. Also, the return price defeats the purpose of returning something to get your money back. Lastly, I sent like 12 things to sell, 4 of them were listed, (took 3 months) had 20 days to sell, and I'd only make 3 dollars while they sell for 18.",2
2025,Please include waist and hip measurements for all bottoms! Thanks!,5
2026,With this new update the app sucks. It won't let me log in. I'm getting rid of it and using the website.,1
2027,I have found great deals on this site. I especially love that I am able to find ladies size 4 and 41/2 shoes and the items are in good condition some have had tags still on them and the prices are great!!,5
2028,Isn't letting me sign in or create a sign in. Very faulty. Don't even bother.,1
2029,"This was my first order with Thredup and it will more than likely be my last. I ordered my daughter some clothes for her birthday and I gave myself the suggested 11 day window. Well her birthday is Saturday and although the app says the item has shipped, all they have done is print the label, it has not been dropped off at UPS and it is not on the way. I really was excited about this app, but I am not very excited now.",1
2030,Great shopping on thredup! Very good descriptions on the clothing and the sizes. They make shopping an adventure! 🥰,5
2031,I love how easy it is to sort the results to find the clothes,5
2032,I like the app and the selection is fabulous.,5
2033,It's terrible I sent in a clean out kit took over 6 months for them to check it in than my stuff was only up for sales for a couple months half of what I sent didn't get listed I never could get any help from customer service there chat box is terrible will never use this again its a big rip off for the seller,1
2034,Great products for low prices.,5
2035,"A great app. They have unbelievable clothing, every brand you can think of, at unbelievable prices! They're very professional and offer many special savings at all times. You will enjoy getting to save a lot on all types of clothing. It's fun! 💕",5
2036,Love this app! So many great deals and they arrive on time or earlier than expected!,5
2037,"Do not use these shysters to sell anything from your closet. They will not actually look at anything, they will just throw most of it in the dumpster and only list like two things. I sent them hundreds of dollars in gorgeous baby clothes and they just got rid of them.",1
2038,"I love all the sort and save features and the promo codes they offer. Great app for searching, saving, and buying.",5
2039,"A go-to for me! If you can, do your homework about fabric and individual pieces to get the best quality/value, rather than just going for the lowest ticket items.",4
2040,Very good when it was free,2
2041,"Edited 5/16 (in : Clothes in good condition. Customer service contacted: ISSUE RESOLVED. Website needs TLC: during a sale, I kept getting kicked out when updating cart, viewing removed items, and when zooming in/out of photos resulted in me losing awesome stuff. IN MAKING MY 2ND RETURN, I WAS OFFERED INSTANT CREDIT IN LIEU OF RETURNING. AMOUNT OFFERED WAS BASICALLY PAID PRICED W/NO NEED TO RETURN, SO I ACCEPTED. ONCE ACCEPTED, AMOUNT CREDITED WAY LESS THAN OFFERED (LIKE 50%). CONTACTING THEM NOW",3
2042,"Great concept, but the app sucks. I've been trying to return a dress a ordered for hours now. I tried chatting with 2 customer service reps and they ended the chat before I could resolve the issue, and once the chat is closed you can't message to that person. They also have no way to contact them via phone.",1
2043,Love Thred Up!,5
2044,"Like shopping, not selling",4
2045,Love the deals.,5
2046,"Can't get a hold of anyone to help with an order I had q question about, once I get this straightened out I will be removing this app. Don't recommend them.",2
2047,Awesome way to thrift!,5
2048,Love the great things I find!,5
2049,"I had sent in a kit with nice clothing items in it that were barely wore and good brands. They listed those items for a decent price, but my earnings would end up being only a few dollars.",1
2050,"I'm still waiting for my first order to arrive, but have already placed a 2nd order. I like the price and the option to bundle together my orders.",5
2051,"Nice service, but frequently broken app. The loading screen takes about 10 seconds, and customer support has directed me to the website for returns (""The app is always broken""). There's lots of potential - I hope the company invests a little more in the future.",3
2052,Wrong description on bag. I like large bags and to pay over $90 for a bag that's 3 inches shorter than it was marked is deceptive. Had I known would have never ordeed.,2
2053,"Took my money, app need to be took down, do not believe the good reviews, believe the bad ones. Just a app, that trick you with good worn clothes and boom, you're money gone and nobody going to help fr! 🥺😭🤣",1
2054,Ok,5
2055,"Good second hand clothes. Good descriptions. The company is making a TON of money. They give you about 15% for your clothes that they sell (ie: $2.70 for $50 pants new w/ tags!) But, I guess that's better than nothing. If you itemized & take deductions on your tax return you're probably better donating to Goodwill. The online shopping is frustrating as website vs app look totally different!",4
2056,"Read the clothing description and your set ! They tell you if it has holes, worn or band new ! You can and should zoom in on the clothing , shoes or whatever your purchasing to really check it out ! I've bought some really cute new stuff for way cheaper !",5
2057,I can pay much less for great brands. Many are new with tags!,5
2058,Amazing deals on beautiful merchandise!,5
2059,Notifications suck,2
2060,they have cool stuf on here and it is so good if you have just a little bit of money,5
2061,I gave an expensive dooney and Burke handbag and it never made it to my bag. I paid 250 for the purse. The purse disappeared. would not recommend this site.,1
2062,"Excellent quality great 'store"". Shipping has gotten a bit steep but i just try to wait for free shipping events.",5
2063,"Cute clothes, good and occasional sales, but very buggy ^.^",5
2064,Love the variety,5
2065,Mad about my purse. It's peeling really bad and I've only had it 2 weeks!! A lousey 15% discount. Never use this company again.,1
2066,"I love thredUp but the app is awful. Even after changing notification settings to the bare minimum, it still sends way too many notifications. I love a good deal but the constant notifications made me uninstall.",2
2067,Wonderful,5
2068,It's annoying to browse when the page keeps refreshing back to the top.,5
2069,"WAAAAY better than the website, which is slow as heck and prone to freezing.",5
2070,Don't send your clothes to sell!!!,5
2071,Love accessability of this app.,5
2072,"Have I mentioned how much I LOVE thred up!!! I'm a single mom with a teenage daughter, so I don't have a lot of money to spend on myself for clothes. Thred up has made it possible for me to buy clothes for myself once again. Thank you thred up, you've saved my closet!!! Lol seriously though, great product, great prices. I just love it!",5
2073,Absolutely horrible 😞 The app itself is not functional. Not able to manage selling. Very low percentage goes to the person providing items. Takes up to a year for then to list items making sales difficult for seasonal and style time sensitive reasons. Customer service doesn't respond. Use another selling platform and for donations find a place that suits you. Don't use thread,1
2074,I have been using Thred Up for a little over two years now. It's when I first discovered it. It is now my go to for any type of clothing or misc things that I may need. There are so many wonderful choices in each and every category. And the sales are just fantastic too. But do not expect to get your goodies overnight. They come from several different places and take a couple of days to be united with each other. The wait of a couple of days is worth it. One box saves on the environment too.,5
2075,Love it! Great way to find quality items for a good deal. Way better than shuffling through the local thrift store when you can find your size at the push of a button. So many options for any style. Plus you can feel good about buying 2nd hand!,5
2076,Love it,5
2077,"Great concept but they can and need to do a better job with pictures, I want to see the inside of bags and shoes, the full belts and better desvriptions of the items",3
2078,"Quality of items has been decreasing in recent years. Also, I'm trying to shop for a wallet and they don't even include pictures of the inside or a description of the inside so that I know number if card slots, zippered pouches, etc.",3
2079,I could not return an item I ordered that was described incorrectly! I have been buying and sending clean out items of really great quality for over 10 years to ThredUP! I have messaged them about the error and called Threadup to no response!,1
2080,"No Men's Clothing? I'm a woman but it's important that I have usable pockets in my clothes and since this information isn't always given, I often find it easier to search men's clothing, but that isn't an option here...",3
2081,Love the Store. Hate the App. They need to fix the favorites/saved search sections because one or the other literally never works. The search tools can sometimes be wonky too. I've bought from them for years and always recieved what I'd purchased and never felt scammed. Prices can be decent and they frequently have sales. App just needs work.,2
2082,TAKING A VERY LONG BREAK FROM BUYING.N,3
2083,"I like this app, but I think that they are over priced on somethings just because of the name not the condition of the item!",4
2084,The shopping site is easy to navigate. The merchandise is of good quality and unique. There are a lot of fashion options.,5
2085,"GET THIS APP, it works so smoothly compared to just using the online website!",5
2086,I'd love there to be a way to also put in European and Italian sizing - the app seems broken with those sizes and I can't get my true sizes to fill in with my American sizing selected. Would love to test any improvements!,4
2087,I've had a good experience since I've been using this app.,5
2088,lovw it!,5
2089,Items that I have purchased are excellent as described. Very satisfied with the app and ease of use. Selections are awesome.,5
2090,App search stinks have to use filter Other wise good stuff,4
2091,"I love ThredUp and have been using it for years, but the new update that auto refreshes anytime you go off the screen and back on drives me batty. I want to be able to scroll down farther but if I answer a text then I get put back at the top.",2
2092,Super fun to explore thrifting options online!,5
2093,"Best online thrift store! Best prices for high-end garments. Don't trust the measurements. Sizes true to individual brand sizes. Usually, the better quality garments give more roomy fit. Can be up to 2 sizes difference. For discount store quality items, for best fit- choose a size larger than you would normally purchase.",5
2094,"The app is fine, but to have to pay money to return something that was not properly described is unacceptable.",1
2095,"I've tried downloading the app twice now, and both times the app wouldn't open once installed.",1
2096,"When scrolling through items, if I switch apps on my phone (for example open a texting app to respond to a friend) and come back to where I was, it reloads the screen and I lose my place.. it makes me scroll through pages and pages to where I last left off. Please fix this! This problem has been an issue for over a year!",3
2097,I really enjoy thred up I will say I was not to sure what it would be like at first yet I have ordered many things from them and yes I did run into an issue and was able to speak to them told them my concerns and they were able to help me with this so thank you very much,5
2098,thredUP has great in style and affordable clothes that are practically brand new. Ever since I came across thredUP I haven't shopped anywhere else since! Highly recommend!!!!!,5
2099,Where has this app been all my life! I have no complaints.,5
2100,Best online thrifting experience ever! 😊♥️,5
2101,"This app is decent. I don't like that the search refreshes if you switch to another app or your phone goes to sleep. I also find that the app freezes a lot. Everything else works great. Regarding ThredUp, their quality control needs to be better. I've received several items that claimed to be in excellent/good condition and they have irreversible stains, a hole or missing hardware. Sadly, I catch many of these flaws outside of the return window. ALWAYS request your items back when selling.",4
2102,This functions way worse than the website.,1
2103,Great app and the search filters are great!,4
2104,I love using this shopping site,5
2105,The app is unbelievably slow. It's unusable at this speed. I don't have the same issues as the website. Also no easy way to see rent the Runway items on the app.,3
2106,"Womens, Boys, and girls. No men's clothes. No use to me.",1
2107,"I really love this app - I've wanted something like it for years and the future is here!! I've already received one order and have been happy with what I received. My only suggestions would be to have at least a couple more photos of each item, and a way to exclude certain brands/styles/etc. from showing up in your searches. The app is also kind of slow.",4
2108,I love thread up. I prefer to thrift to help the planet and save money. I'm always telling everyone about this company. It's like thrifting but you can filter what you're looking for which makes it way easier than at a store in person. The return policy is not the best because most items have a $4 restocking fee and the best deal is to get store credit. But all in all the app is fast and easy to use and it's a good way to find what you want for a deal.,5
2109,This app is so worthless I was trying to leave one star accidentally hit 2 and now it won't let me remove one that's how deceptive they are this is the worst app I have ever dealt with I just think they were wonderful I used to shop here a lot but they steal your rewards you can't talk to anybody and it is worthless I will never ever shop here again,2
2110,"Great selection , hassle free shopping, I like the low price on some high end items",5
2111,"Absolutely incredible. I love this company & this app. Easy to navigate, top notch customer service, & beautifully organized products.",5
2112,"Great way to recycle and feel good about looking good! Would like more fitting filters (ie- inseam, bust size, etc.)",4
2113,"Great shipping, fairly easy app to use. I like the bundle system.",5
2114,idk never tried thecapp,1
2115,"The chat is hard to navigate. Talking to a real person is almost impossible. I sent in a big box of mostly NEW clothes with tags and in their original bags from Old Navy. They did not pick them, they picked some old worn jeans, did NOT make hardly any money at all. I believe someone, whoever picked through my clothes to sale, picked the new clothes for themselves. I DO NOT recommend Thred Up. Just don't. If you want to GIVE your clothes away, just drop them off at Goodwill.",1
2116,Clothes with holes and clorox stains.,2
2117,Love shopping this way!,5
2118,Great finds at awesome prices!,5
2119,"I use to use this app very often, unfortunately the search menu doesn't work the greatest & everytime I go back on it, it seems everything gets more expensive. We're you're almost paying the original full price. Not sure if this app is for me anymore.",2
2120,Best app ever,5
2121,"I love this APP! I've ordered so many times. My items shipped in a timely manner. I love that they put the sizes in the description of your items so you know you're getting the perfect fit. I would have given 5 stars, but ThredUP needs to put exact measurements on sweatshirts, long open sweaters, coats, and vests. You can't beat the prices though. They are so reasonable for any budget. I'll never shop retail again thanks to THRED UP.",4
2122,I got my Dooney and Bourke bag and I Love it! It's in great condition except a little scratch on the emblem but that doesn't bother me!,5
2123,I find great products on here for myself and as gifts (new!),5
2124,"i love 💚thredup, because they have abercrombie & fitch for low prices - which is extremely difficult to find these days.",5
2125,I absolutely love online thrift shopping and thred up makes it super easy!,5
2126,Nice app I'm glad I discovered it 😊,5
2127,I just made an order and got 60% off 1st time buyer I'm very excited to receive these items,5
2128,"Thredup is my all time favorite online shopping app. Best deal, coupon, and best clothing.",5
2129,"Easy to use, great name brand products for so cheap, great items in stock, but you better hurry because someone may put it in their cart first, kind of like a fun game to play!!",5
2130,THIEVES,2
2131,Easy to use! Love it.,5
2132,Support has gone entirely automated. They don't answer questions and a chat bot just sends you around in circles. Go elsewhere.,1
2133,Excellent products in perfect condition packaged beautifully,5
2134,Had a large order everything fit and customer service was good...lov the app,5
2135,It is great. I get really nice clothes for the price I paid. I also like that they look brand new for use clothes.,5
2136,Almost 1/2 doz orders I've placed now and every single thing I've ordered has been exactly what I wanted/expected. Wish I'd have known about this shopping secret gem years ago :) FF 2.5yrs still a HAPPY customer with this site/app!,5
2137,Clothes are gorgeous at a fair price.,5
2138,Prefer older version.,3
2139,Love the deals I can get. Shipping is fast. I get tons of compliments on my thred up threads!,5
2140,"It's not easy to use. You have to exit out of your search if you want to change categories. I accidentally dropped my phone, and it took me out of my search. Same things when I turned my phone in a different direction... Some items were mislabeled. I saw a tank that said long sleeve when it had no sleeves. If they can't label things correctly, what else are they going to mess up on. Read the most recent 1 stars, and you'll see what I mean.",1
2141,"So much fun, and such great saving",5
2142,Dangerously fun and exciting.,5
2143,I love shopping on thredUP. The clothes look practically brand new.,5
2144,App refreshes page when leaving and returning to app from different app.,5
2145,Nothing works on this site. I can't decrease the price without authentication but there is no wat to do that. I can't pull up pending sales. This app has gone downhill.,2
2146,"I wasn't sure after reading some of the reviews what to think but I took a chance and I'm glad I did! EVERYTHING that I ordered (8 items) was exactly as described, clean, right size, everything I invisioned. Thank you so much.",5
2147,Love the products this app has!,5
2148,"I've been with thredup for couple of years, now I'm trying yhe app.",1
2149,Wish they had better description of items,5
2150,Nice and Easy,5
2151,Only for women,1
2152,"An Awesome Appl. Great to shop at anytime, anywhere.",5
2153,"I struggled to get an actual customer service rep when I needed help. The chat bots aren't helpful. Once I did get an actual human, they were great. I've bought a lot of nice clothing through them.",4
2154,"If you ever make a tiny error- they will charge you through the teeth and force delivery of ugly unwanted items, rather than simply cancel your accidental order-5 minutes after you mistakenly made it-like decent humans. I have done business with this company for years and spent plenty- and they treat me like joke garbage.",1
2155,They got my kit. When I try to go on to claim my item back they say they can't find my credentials or the app crashes. I am so mad!!,1
2156,Happy... thank you,5
2157,I buy all my clothes from thredup.,5
2158,I have just started using the app. So far it's good.,5
2159,Good App,4
2160,"What a great idea, so many items like new.",5
2161,"Returns are IMPOSSIBLE because the app sucks, & it's terrible for making sales. If you have some cheap clothes you don't care about a return on, send in your clean out bag. I sent in two boxes of designer clothes worth thousands of dollars & have been deeply disappointed. Took 7 months just to get my items processed & listed w/o notice & payout schedule is abysmal. Walked away w/ about $40 in store credit, I'll never send them nice clothes again. Consignment is a better bet.",1
2162,I've found so many outfits on threadUP! I'm loving it!!,5
2163,"This shop is a real treat. Thrifting is great fun, but not always possible, so being able to do it in the middle of the night is wonderful. The app is a little unwieldy, just sometimes difficult to manage all the options available in it. Tho they allow for incredibly detailed & specific searching, it takes a little practice to be sure your search is as complete as you want. Also it's a bit too easy to get backed out of your results. Perhaps a redundant exit query would be a good idea. Great fun!",4
2164,"Shipping too damn high. $10, huh???",3
2165,"Not very user friendly hard to find simple tasks like starting a return or previously purchased, and shopping history. There are to many pop ups and side notes very distracting and miss leading. Why dodnt you just copy Amazon and make it easier for you and your customers all the layers of script just make it impossible to focus on a simple task like looking for a t-shirt, turns in to something else's and I run out of time so I don't buy any thing at all.",2
2166,"I no longer have to go searching for another app. This goes far beyond my expectations of a 2nd chance ""store"". The quality of the items purchased are superb. There are dimensions for evert article of clothing. The material of the item is stated. There is very little room for error. I have already bought 4 dresses for the first time in a long time. They all fit! Which was honestly a glorious moment. Thank you for enlightening on the waste issue that is so blatantly there. I hope this takes off.",5
2167,Takes too long to be paid.. and sells it for high price but gives you a small amount back,1
2168,Love this app,5
2169,I'm very thrifty by nature 🫴💐💜,5
2170,"I'm obsessed! I had to start over with my wardrobe since I've lost 140 lbs and none of my regular cloths fit anymore. I have found my favorite brands, in my sizes and was able to put together a capsule wardrobe. I have to stop but I LOVE thredUP!",5
2171,"I cant place an order. My card infos is correct. I been re typing it in and pressing the button for an hour. I just wanna buy some summer clothes :,,)",1
2172,Easy order,5
2173,"Great app, the only issue is I have to i put my sizes everytime I search. I tried to use the ""save my sizes"" feature and it doesn't work. But everything else is fine.",4
2174,"Honestly gave them several chances and everytime I got something at least half the clothes were messed up and not labeled correctly. I even order clothing that had no final sale posted anywhere and when I tried to return some, they were marked final sale after I had purchased them. They charge way too much for used clothing and their return policy is ludicrous. Don't waste your time with them.",1
2175,Got so many name brand items brand new and used for such an amazing price! Looking ballin on a budget has never been so easy😉!,4
2176,Love the idea but...the app glitches and stalls,4
2177,Magical.,5
2178,"Great shopping 🛍! However dont like The 4 hour shopping carts. Update...Have been trying to order a clean out bag for 4 months now, and App will not let me, however emails from thread up says I'm VIT, and can order?? Very confusing and customer service WONT reach back out to me..VERY FRUSTRATING!",4
2179,"good price,good variety",5
2180,Everything I got from here is small or not as good quality as they say it's going to be. I got a coach bag that was supposedly $480 for $80 and it had pen marks in it and the condition of the bag was not worth $80. Their return policy is ridiculous and annoying to figure out. It didn't not live up to expectation.,1
2181,"I've been trying to unsubscribe from their countless emails & it sends me to the app notification settings which do not work. Just keeps spinning & spinning as if it's loading. Ridiculous, I'll have to block their emails.",1

2183,"THREDUP allows me to shop my favorite designer brands all in one place, and from all the comforts of home. Customer service is warm and accomodating. As for the merchandise- its always recieved neatly packaged and as it was described. Shopping with Thred Up is a win win for sure. My favorite online shopping site discovery this year, without a single doubt.",5
2184,I love this app good deals I ordered for 1st time can't wait to get them,5
2185,"UPDATE: 04/09/23 I just now ordered my 10,11, and 12 items from Thred Up. All Handbags and wallets.. I absolutely love everything I've received.. everything is immaculate condition except for one wallet I had to throw in the wash. Just got my first order, two bags/purses and OMG.. the app is very easy to deal with, organized.. Cute. Everything worked out great. They have a point system as well. Think I got new spot to shop and my husband ain't complaining cuz it's thrift shopping and affordable.",5
2186,"App does not work regularly. It frequently freezes, crashes and won't let you reload (you just get stuck at the green loading screen)",1
2187,Love this app! Great place to find consigned designer brands at bargain prices.,5
2188,This app is terrible.,1
2189,Love it!!! Best app to get name brand's at a cheaper price ❤❤❤,1
2190,"I just used the app and made my purchase for the first time today, so far it's pretty good. I love that I preset my size, and it only shows that, so I don't have to search through everything.",5
2191,Good,4
2192,Awful customer service. Used to be much better but the whole company has gone down high this last year or so.,1
2193,The app is crashing,1
2194,"Shipping has become ridiculously slow. Resellers buy up all the popular stuff (I.e. Lululemon). Prices have gone up. And they keep making up more rules to make it harder and harder to get any value out of reselling. Watch out for endless lists of Old Navy, Walmart, and Kohl's brands at near NEW prices. I've compared dresses on ThredUp and Kohl's and sometimes the prices were the SAME. This used to be a great service, but has really lost its way in the past few years.",2
2195,Offers chat but won't let you type in field provided. No phone number unless you are visually impaired. I used to love this company/app but I have been very disappointed with quality and customer service the last few years.,1
2196,Love this app it's the best ever I would so download it if I was u great deals,5
2197,The codes don't work for me anymore. They used to in the past... it's all VERY glitchy sadly. I really liked this app.,2
2198,I love getting really nice bags at an affordable price!! Thank you 😊,5
2199,"I'm addicted to this app! There are so many choices, so little time.",5
2200,Love the ease of shopping on a great app!,5
2201,I have been super happy with the quality ratings! It is clear in the description as to what you will be getting! Super easy to use!!,5
2202,Occasionally freezes,4
2203,"This app is great, and the company is amazing. I love being able to get things from my favorite designers at such affordable prices, and I love that I'm giving clothing a new life and keeping it out of landfills. Their selection is wonderful and their reward system is generous. They have great incentives for both new and loyal shoppers. Highly recommend!",5
2204,Great prices for rly nice clothes. 👏,5
2205,The app crashes and closes no matter what I do. I have to force stop it and then try to open it 20 times until it works. Please fix this.,2
2206,Thred Up is so wonderful. So glad I discovered their website. And equally happy with the recycling program Thred Up has!! I have truly found my 😊 happy place to shop going forward.,5
2207,Easy to use. Decent prices. Some prices are a bit high for thrift clothes... happy with my first purchase.,5
2208,"Overall the app is good, but I hate the fact that once your looking in your cart you can't tell which items are outlet items. There should be a clear marking since the more outlet items you buy the bigger the discount. I also tend to only buy new with tags or like new. With good rating or lower the quality can be iffy & it can get pricey once you add in the price of shipping & costs of returns if the items don't work out.",4
2209,Love love love,5
2210,"I love the variety of all the different colors, and styles they have",5
2211,"I have found some wonderful things on thredup and saved a lot of money on name brand clothes, shoes and purses!  ❤️",5
2212,"Was great before they started accepting so many ""fast fashion"" items - (SHEIN, emery rose, etc.). These items all run small to begin with, and by the time they've been worn and washed however many times and sent to thread up - it's all garbage.",1
2213,Great quality of clothing at a great price. Shipping and returns are processed quickly...,5
2214,Great great deals and amazing clothes,5
2215,Great app,5
2216,"Lost items from clean out kit ... errors in listings, customer service is next to nonexistent. Items for sale are overpriced. Restricted rewards and discounts . After 3 years of both selling and buying, I am closing my account and taking my money elsewhere. If I could give a minus score, I would.",1
2217,Its a fun yard sale ... never know what you will find,5
2218,I used to really love this app but it doesn't work for me anymore. It kicked me out of my own account and won't let me create a new one. It's surprising to me because for many years I've had good experiences with this app and never had technical issues with it. Super bummed and hope the app gets fixed🤞,1
2219,"Terrible app. Unstable and some screens flicker. The search sucks- you search for corset top and get three wrist watches and a sun visor. Brand names cost literally almost as much as new - I actually googled the brand name to cost compare, and you aren't saving any money using this app. It costs about $15 to return one item, so you lose a good chunk of your money no matter what. Customer support is non-existent.",1
2220,"A good app in theory but it has drawbacks. First off, most of the clothes cost just as much as brand new clothes, even with sale prices. Secondly, there's no listed country of origin on the clothes so sizes/fit are definitely questionable. Third, I don't buy shoes - it never specifies width. Lastly, there should be subcategories for easier shopping (esp. w/accessories). After several years and purchases, it's smarter to shop elsewhere most of the time.",2
2221,"Awesome! I've told everyone about Thredup! I have found sure great buys! You will too, Enjoy shopping right from your home!",5
2222,"The faster loading, continous scroll, and default to newest first for results is a plus in comparison to the browser view of site. However, there is no bookmarking if your phone locks, so you will be refreshed to start of results. Was never able to see cleanout items that sold due an app error.",3
2223,"My biggest problem is they do not label petite sizes as such in the description. I'm 5'10"" tall. I need to know this stuff. Their size filters include tall--so why would they even show me a petite? Also, sometimes shipping takes weeks. Shipping times aew inconsistent.",3
2224,I wish the search would pick up where I left off if I have to exit the page for some reason. Instead it goes back to the beginning. Also the restock fee used to be $1.99 now it's $3.99. it's almost enough to make me not want to shop at Thredup anymore.,3
2225,"This is a great app with a great website. I spend too much money with ThreadUp but the clothes, shoes, purses, etc are such a great deal. The descriptions are always spot on and returns are easy and refunds are fast. Just wish there was a men's section.",5
2226,Below a 0 Never received my package and can't get coustermer services,1
2227,The app only unopened up once and it hasn't since,1
2228,"I want to like this app/store/service but it's full of red flags. From the re-stocking fee, to their seller policies that make you pay to ship them clothes (plus pay extra if you want them back if they don't sell within a certain time period), to the UI of the app doesn't properly filter searches and often items are not tagged properly. Also the suggested retail price is complete nonsense - I'm not big into name brands, but the stuff from Shein is SERIOUSLY over estimated. Sketchy.",1
2229,App has issues. I love thredup but the app is terrible. After every update it gets worse. Now the app won't even open. Very frustrating.,1
2230,The clothes from this reseller are always horrible quality and incorrectly sized. Fabric always feels stiff and shrunken. Sleeves are always too short and their return policy is never worth it.,1
2231,"women, girls, boys. nothing for men.",1
2232,great for conservative people,5
2233,"This company us a rip off. I sent over 12 very nice items of clothing. They posted to sell only 3. Pay out of 42 cents. Because I said to donate the items they didn't post, they kept them to sell in another way to make money off me. Threads up comes across as being so ""green"". But they are really in it just to make money!!",1
2234,I love buying new & like new clothes at a fraction of the cost of a fine department store.,5
2235,I love it.,5
2236,Sellers be aware when you ship your clothes they charge a1499 processing fee taken out of the credits they also charge you for shipping handling and the label is $2.99 and you print it. Shipping is way way way too high and they are the slowest shippers I have ever encountered. It's seriously takes a month. You get no credit for mainstream brands even tho they sale it. Read the fine print. It gets to Stars for one stop shopping and environmental awareness,2
2237,This company has no customer service. You cannot get in touch with them at all. I wish I had known before purchasing $500 in clothing that I never received.,1
2238,"Love the app, I'm a regular. My only complaint is there's no way to filter out ""one size"" or undesirable brands, so every time I search for pants I'm inundated with one size LuLaRoe leggings that nobody wants.",4
2239,Easy to use. Easy to find what I'm looking for. Great deals.,5
2240,"I love thredUP. But I have not been able to use the app in the last week. First it was stuck loading the home page. I tried signing out and went to sign back in but it kept reloading back to the sign up page. I uninstalled the app, and reinstalled it .... Still no luck. Now it won't even load the sign in page. It stays on the green thredUP screen and after a few minutes a message comes up telling me that it isn't loading and to try again. I press try again and the cycle continues. ThredUP help??",1
2241,I love thred up the prices are remarkably low great quality And always offer discounts both to buyers and sellers!,5
2242,Easy to find what you are looking for.,5
2243,"Even if I'm not looking to buy, I just enjoy the different clothes.",5
2244,I wish I could change the prices of the items on the app but it doesn't allow me too! Thred up is amazing. Been using it for 5 or 6 years now. I wish they didn't charge me $14.99 for the bag though. That's kind of sad - sometimes that's all I make off a bag.,5
2245,I always find fun pieces in my size and they are always in really good condition,5
2246,"Customer support is the worst!!!Literally none. Don't expect to ever talk to a human.There are no ph numbers and if your question doesn't fall into their automated category you're SOL. So frustrating.They have charged my order to a card I seldom ever use. I use it once in a while to show activity just so my limit doesn't get reduced. I've used it once for that purpose on Thread Up.My recent purch are on that card, unauthorized.I can't even find where to delete it. Website is the worst.",2
2247,Endless amounts of clothes that match almost anyone's style!,5
2248,"Some items cost more than brand new of the same thing. Lately I take a screen shot of something I like and search with Google lens. I currently bought the same exact cardigan, brand new, a dollar less and free shipping on Nordstrom! On thread up it was more, used, and $10.99 shipping. So just be conscious of the prices to make sure you're getting the best price.",3
2249,"Love, love, love this app!!!",5
2250,I'm having SO much fun buying quality second hand clothing! Happy with everything so far ❤️,5
2251,Not so great,2
2252,"Used to use this app all the time. About 6 months or so ago it was changed that any time you swap to another app, even if it's momentary, it refreshes the page. It completely negates the convenience factor of being able to scroll through and purchase. I have gone back to thrifting in person since. Everything about the app used to be great.",1
2253,When it comes to placing filters It's much faster than the site!,5
2254,"Aweful aweful shipping and tracking! I ordered stuff March 13th and it is now March 24th! And have not received anything, tracking just keeps changing dates saying it will arrive by 7 and never shows up on any of the dates it says it will be delivered. And when I do track it, it shows its been in the same town for a week now and has not moved. Tried contacting thredup but they will not respond and are no help at all. I feel like I'm never going to see my orders and just wasted $169!!",1
2255,"App issues with Android (cabt change price, authenticate, verify email, etc.) & non-existent customer support, only unhelpful bot.",1
2256,Awesome app and website,5
2257,Nothing for men,1
2258,"With threadUP, I can purchase higher end items at a reduced cost. In addition, it's a great feeling shopping second hand and knowing that I am helping the environment. It's a win win.",5
2259,"Awful design, and apparently men don't buy secondhand clothes, because I cannot for the life of me find the category. Every time I have tried to search, it diverts me to women's clothing. Don't waste your time, fellas. Even if it does exist somewhere, the app is difficult and annoying to use anyway.",1
2260,Trying to buy an item with PayPal and it's not possible! So annoying to try for so many times! I don't see the help button anywhere,1
2261,"I used to love Thredup. I never got my last credit for a return. I keep getting thrown around vs someone taking the time to return my money. Can't send in stuff to exchange for credit for near a year now. And no number to call or chat. Claims there is, but even during hours only option they allow is email. Most issues do not get resolved via email efficiently. It's also EXTREMELY frustrating to have money that hasn't been refunded for months now and only being able to email.",1
2262,Can't do anything in the app so many errors,1
2263,"The app glitches, and it didn't have any of the clothes I was looking for.",1
2264,"I sent 2 bags full of clothes in May, and they are still processing in December. They say it's because they are short handed, but they have new clothes up every day. I will NOT be buying ANYTHING else from them, until they fix thier problem. The reason why I downloaded this app is because it was free. They just took a high percent of selling my clothes. But now there charging for cleanout bags, plus the high percent from sales. I bought a purse off Amazon, there selling for over $30 and I get $5",1
2265,Two different orders had items on them that were not what I had ordered. It's difficult to get a hold of anyone. I'm totally bummed because I I this site until this happened,3
2266,"I really really want to love this app but the UI is so terrible and for some reason seems to get worse with every update... it used to have a few bugs but now there are so many it is borderline useless. Every single time I switch over to a different app and come back, even just for a second, or if I lock my phone for a moment and come back, thredup loses my place and resets me at the beginning of my search which is super annoying. They also got rid of the ""similar items"" feature which I loved",1
2267,"4 stars because there are some options that I wish existed for filtering that don't. Also I would love the ability to save filters and apply them at will instead of just one for sizes. Otherwise, I love the idea and sustainability of second hand shopping at my fingertips!",4
2268,"Product information is wrong 50% of the time. The pictures and description will say ""like new"" with no damage but when I receive them some buttons are missing or they have holes in them. They'll be listed as 100% cotton but the tags will say 80% polyester. Then shipping takes 2-3 weeks. This company is nothing but disappointing. Don't waste your money on money hungry millionares that only care about the bottom line. Go support your local consignment store.",2
2269,"Don't mind shopping, not worth it for selling. Sent in a large bag with some high priced name brand items in new condition and they were never listed and wasn't able to get them back. Also you can't change prices and the payout isn't worth it. To reclaim your items you have to buy back your clothes at their listing price. Not worth the hassle to re purchase my own clothes.",1
2270,It's been great I love shopping for clothes with you guys I just wish you guys would carry men's clothes so that I could shop for my whole family with ya'll,5
2271,I will no longer use thread up after my latest experience. Not only did they charge me to send them product (which I stupidly agreed too) but I send the product early January and it still hasn't been processed. Very poor service.,1
2272,❤️,5
2273,dont like the clothes couldnt find moves,2
2274,"I received a postcard in the mail that stated 40% off everything (not worded ""up to: 40%). This postcard said that I hadn't purchased from Thredup in a while. I spent a long time finding different items only to have the code not work! I read the fine print. None of my items were excluded. This upsets me because I spent a lot of time filling my cart. The app has definite glitches.",1
2275,Downloaded because of kallmekris and I trust her so. 😎👍,5
2276,"Thiefs!!! I've sent in several bags over the years, they went downhill. In one of my bags was a pair of jeans that they miss labeled as plus sized, I told them they just need to remove the word plus from the description and it'll be correct, they took the jeans off completely. I've sent in brand new shoes that never got listed, and new formal dresses (not prom) that just disappeared from my bags, I never got paid for them! The app just goes in circles as I try cash out! There's so much more 🤬🤬",1
2277,The customer service does not exist and the app doesn't allow you to create returns. Waste of money.,1
2278,"I am a clothes buying addict..... Since I found this site there is no other place I like to shop at online more than it. The deals are above all in comparison, and 80% at least of everything I've ever bought from here was brand new. You can buy so many more outfits on here that are new and fabulous than you could anywhere else and name brands too. I always recommend it to everyone I know.",5
2279,Just got 3 coach bags for under$90...awesome!!!,5
2280,One of the best apps I've ever used,5
2281,Thredup do not give you your correct amount that you deserve for the items you sale. They rip you off because they take more than they give to you. You only recieve $1 and some change for each clothing you sale. When the clothing you sale can be sold for $99.99 they will take majority of the money and give you a small amount. This app rips you Off to the fullest. l do not recommend this app to AnyOne. Read reviews before using this app SO you do not be Disappointed like me and Some Other userS.,1
2282,Love it! The best way to afford designer handbags all the time,5
2283,"The business is great but the app is not. Specifically when you are browsing and go to something else on your phone, without closing the app, it goes back to the top of the page instead of where you left off.",2
2284,I really like it,5
2285,Enjoying the shopping experience and the rewards are great. They often have sales offering deep discounts.,5
2286,"ThredUP is great and I'll continue to use it, but the app is super glitchy. Many parts of the app won't load consistently. I often have to restart the app a few times in order to see saved searches or favorited items. And I recently had to use my laptop to initiate a return because I couldn't get that part of my account to load on the app at all. Service itself is great, but the app needs work!",3
2287,"When selecting a category, for instance, ""Shoes"" I want to look for shoes, however there is still clothing and it's frustrating when I'm on a mission for something specific 😔😔😔",1
2288,I like the app. I find some good pieces for a low price and since I'm on a budget it works for me. I usually get deals on the items I purchase.,5
2289,There are no mens options for clothing.,1
2290,"Love this app. Bargain shopping w/ filters for sorting out practically anything; from sizes, price, condition, & a wish list too.",4
2291,Love thrifting and this is super convenient...and they have great brands.,5
2292,I bought a purse for 42$ and literally it's the size of my 3 year old nieces purses,1
2293,"I love thredUp and how easy it makes thrifting and saving money, combined with being more sustainable. The measurements, however, need to be more comprehensive. For people with different top and bottom sizes, shopping dresses and jumpsuits can be difficult and the chances of a return far more likely as only chest size is listed. It would also be nice to include a search similar styles function. Overall, the app is great and you earn rewards fast, but the search and measurements need updating.",4
2294,Yay!,3
2295,Awesome,5
2296,Great place to buy gently used well known brands of clothing and shoes.,5
2297,men don't exist,1
2298,"Use a local store instead! I am so disappointed with this app. Clothing is expensive for what it is, some arrive with holes, even when it states ""like new."" You have to pay a restock fee to return these items. Also, shipping is expensive unless you meet a ridiculous purchase amount. You can not get ahold of an actual person when you have a problem. You get an email saying they are busy. I have had items sell and they do not payout even the lowball amount they state they will.",1
2299,lots of stuff but it took 30 min for the money to leave my account and 4 days to even show I had an order. and you have to put in search filters every time you go in. can't save your searches or even just your sizes,2
2300,"Great selection, service, and app! I have been using ThedUp for the last year and haven't encountered any issues w/app or service. It is a bit labyrinth like but to me that adds to the fun.",5
2301,"First-timer here! The price is right, and I'm stoked for my first order to arrive next week! Variety!",5
2302,Love it,5
2303,"Just received my first order, I'm in love with the items I purchased! I struggle with finding modest skirts and dresses for church and this is the place to go! Everything that was gently used looked brand new! And a few of the items still had tags! Will be coming back for more!",5
2304,It's easy to use. I don't like if my phone closes I lose my place that I was at. But honestly it's no big deal.,4
2305,"Pros: Easy to use, reward points accumulate fast, constant sales. Cons: Have to search for any brand or specific style with search bar, and than way too many that do not meet your search appear, app refreshes and loses your search and returns to the main screen way to often, sales never seem to extend to all items, delivery is a nightmare if you live in an apartment, they will just leave box outside the building instead of delivering to designated package lockers or office.",4
2306,I like the app however when I shop I'm not able to select any filters and promo codes usually don't work even though it's a valid working code when I go onto the website. Kinda annoying.,4
2307,Love thredup so much! Love how easy the process is and all the different things available. I just received my 3rd order and have been thrilled with everything I have purchased.,5
2308,OMG..... I am totally insulted by this insured abuse of inflation. I seriously have spent years using this to recycle now I would have to pay them bags worth of clothing just to pay to send a one bag.. then if you ever sell .. which I've only got 19$ for all sorts of stuff and now I'm trying to use my 19$ but of course it's an arm and a leg to ship more expenses then an actual small item but barely.. I'm crying a incredibly impactful accessible to so many to do good is now only 4 elite,1
2309,Thieves,1
2310,Yuck too expensive and not enough products,1
2311,"Slow, doesn't load most functionality and refuses to add certain items to cart ??",1
2312,There's no where else I'd rather shop for clothes!,5
2313,"Well, I have bought a lot of things already, only being on for about 4 days. It's so easy to use, lots of items. Will update when items arrive.",5
2314,Excellent site,5
2315,I can't get it to open?? I unstalled it cause it was acting funny ! Now it won't open! Hey I guess I'll save alot of money 💰,1
2316,"Awful business. Bait and switch tactics used. Wanted to charge me over $200 to get some kid's clothes I sent in that didn't sell retuned to me. Process took over 8 months from start to finish. Thankfully, I didn't send in any other items. Save your time and money and do ANYTHING else (donate, eBay, etc.)...",1
2317,I can't change pricing for my items because not authenticated. But was never an issue before. Also it doesn't let me see what items expired which they never emailed me about them even being approved.,1
2318,Too many adds about your cloths. I can't keep up. Please stop sending.,3
2319,Customer service is horrible. Cant get people on chat- waited days for a lost order. Shopping here just isnt worth it.,1
2320,Thead up is the best second hand store ever.,5
2321,The absolute worst customer service ever. I sent items in August they didn't get processed untill! February and now when one of my items is sold and it's the 14day return period it still takes several days after to recieve payment for the item. The chat customer service I can never get through to. I would never recommend this company to anyone.,1
2322,So far so good.,5
2323,Love the reuse impacts on the environment and the reduced costs.,5
2324,"Good app! A few glitches...some items not showing the photo, have to restart app to fix. Also, if you get out of the app even for a few seconds (ex. To answer a phone) you will loose your spot in your search results. Not major but a bummer when you are scrolling through thousands of items.",4
2325,I love ordering from this site but lately orders are taking longer to get to my home and it is frustrating... hopefully it improves. That's my only complaint.,4
2326,I've had good experience overall using this app!,5
2327,Love it,5
2328,Customer service sucks! Can't get no answers on my orders,2
2329,Convenient but does not readily connect to a website. My last return I used reward points to wave restocking fee. But unfortunately when I click to the next page they were stocking fee was deducted from my return. I noticed this again on my most recent return and ended up going to the computer and submitting the return. Convenient to shop. Not very convenient for anything else.,2
2330,"***updated review*** it's unfortunate but this company is terrible now. They have a 4 dollar restocking fee for each item which really adds up. The ""rewards"" points system for ""VIP"" customers is a joke now. They've made changes and none of them good. Customer service impossible to reach by chat, phone or email if you have a problem.",1
2331,"ThredUp itself is awesome but the app is terrible! You have to go to the website to do any returns or anything like that. Then, when you go back to the app, none of it shows up.",1
2332,"I've been using this app on and off for about 3 years now. I say on and off because I keep waiting for them to update things so it's not so buggy and constantly crashing or giving me error messages. I feel like one thing gets fixed then 5 go down, making this app extremely frustrating to use. Which is really sad because it's such a great idea. If they invested more in making their app run seamlessly, I would probably exclusively shop/sell with them.",2
2333,"Great prices, quality matches description, measurements are accurate, good brands",5
2334,"The app is awful. Slow and laggy, search and filters never work correctly.",2
2335,"Easy to search, returns are painless. The quality standards are pretty high, so you can depend on products that are in good shape when they are delivered. Great communication and customer service, too.",5
2336,Updating account info is not possible using the app.,3
2337,Great filters. Took a star off because there are errors that pop up during checkout.,4
2338,I got this Michael Kors black leather purse @ 19.99. !! It's wonderful 🌻😃....but I was charged $105. 👀... maybe I read it wrong. Purse is nice tho.,5

2340,"This is a joke, if you are trying to sell your clothes. Takes forever to process your bags and doesn't pay.",1
2341,"Restocking fees for returns! A couple years ago it was great! Easy to return something if it didn't fit right, clean and not too worn clothes. Fast forward to now and it has gone downhill! 3 bucks per item is insane! Their deals are a joke since all their used clothes are marked up so high. Last order I got had sand or fine gravel wrapped up with the clothes. It's a joke.",1
2342,"I have a terrible time with this app, app never opens on my phone, just not user friendly. But, love buying from Thred up.",5
2343,Used to be better. Now takes a very long time to receive orders. Also got way more expensive. When I am buying second hand clothing I don't want to be paying over 50 dollars for a sweater I could get at an outlets for like 20,2
2344,"The ThredUp app glitches a tad, but that might be my signal. It's beautifully designed, just as good as the website. If you use ThredUp enough, definitely get the app.",4
2345,The app lags so much and I honestly wish they'd ship with someone other than FedEx because packages keep getting delayed by nearly a week. If I'm paying nearly $11 for shipping it should come within the estimated time frame,1
2346,"App doesn't work. When you try to log in with same email/password that works on the website, it keeps giving the error:. ""Oops! An error occurred when trying to authenticate with the server."". resetting password doesn't fix the issue",1
2347,I love thred up. I dont like thefact that i cant use a promo code along with one of my rewards though :(,4
2348,"Very easy to use, haven't had any problems with it",5
2349,"Do NOT, I repeat. DO NOT SELL TO THIS SITE. I use to love shopping/selling on here. Over the years it's just gotten worse. Not even worth it. Literally have had bags processed and they didn't even accept anything. And NOW they are charging for a processing fee?! 14.99* AND charging now for the bags when they use to be free. You already don't get much and now they are charging when you're already giving them plenty of profit for the company! They also have THE WORSE customer service EVER.",1
2350,"I love the purpose behind the app/business and I support it 100%! The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes, but not so bad you can't complete your purchases. Packaging from thredUP is always so cute and I always end up reusing the boxes for storage in my house.",4
2351,"I love the clothes and bargains that I find and purchase. I can buy clothes,purses and shoes that I would not be able to afford otherwise.",5
2352,"I went to checkout for review of choices I made. None of the items are here I chose! So I'm closing your app. Probably to never try ordering online from ThredUp again. Sorry about your luck. I thought this would be a great way to purchase quality items, but you failed miserably! Disappointed shopper.",1
2353,Love this app!!,5
2354,Could never get it to open after install.,1
2355,Great prices and quality clothing !,5
2356,"Love this app, quality clothes at a great price!",5
2357,Easy to search for specific things because of all the filter options.,5
2358,This app sucks when it comes to the Cash Out process. It makes it very difficult to receive the money you earned for the products you sold. When you try to Cash Out on the app it either takes you to a different location on the app or times out so you are unable to actually Cash Out. You have to jump through hoops just to figure it out.,1
2359,"Wonderful! Can be addictive. Have good deals, but not local.",5
2360,I love shopping 🛍 with tredup. Love bundle the best way to save in shipping. And the clothes are always nice.,5
2361,"I love thredup! But: PLEASE ADD A FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN SEARCH YOUR FAVORITES! I spend so much time ❤️-ing items that when it comes time to actually buy the ones I want get lost! It would be really useful to be able to search your favs with the same search function as the store, especially when looking for a specific kind of item and want to compare multiple options. ALSO- the app DOESN'T have a spot to redeem gift cards!! I had to log in on my computer. Please fix this issue 🙏",4
2362,I love all the sales and mark downs!,5
2363,I had a total of 5 orders. 2 out of 5 were delivered to the wrong address.,1
2364,Pictures are deceiving . Purses look way larger I guess they are using a miniature mannequin to style them on. Purse looked like medium bag. It's not. And there is no one to contact,1
2365,"SHADY PEOPLE RUNNIG THIS! There are so many fakes, and it is a waste of time to report them because they never look at the reports. I have reported items that literally had a different tag on them in the photo and they have still not been removed after months! They also list on eBay, with a BUY IT NOW price, but when you click on that, it says that it is out of stock. Then you go to their site and it is available. They are just using eBay to advertise their stuff. They are SCAMMERS!! AVOID!",1
2366,I'm pretty true to sizing and I love shopping with you but your sizing is all over the place. A size 40 shoe is not a 10 by any means. And one thing I'd like to see is ironed clothes not all wrinkled. Otherwise I enjoy checking back often to see all the new stuff.,5
2367,The items that they have look brand new. The items you receive are packed with great care wrapped in tissue paper and folded very neatly. You feel very special. It is very amazing items at a very low price.,5
2368,"I love this app, but I need more measurements listed on items. I need to know chest, waist, and hip measurements on everything. Especially waist and hip on the skirts. I'm not going to buy it if I don't know it will fit. Now the page reloads and goes to the top if I leave the app, even for 2 seconds to check a text. I like to browse throughout my day, and now I can't because it doesn't stay where I left off browsing.",3
2369,There is no way to unsubscribe from their emails. They will blow up your inbox. It is awful 😞,1
2370,"Have experience as both a buyer and a seller. The app is good Processing times for sellers are VERY, VERY slow (months). My last consignment has taken about 7 months and still is not processed. Processing times for purchases are not too bad, usually a week or so for delivery.",5
2371,Search function is not very good.,3
2372,"Please don't try to sell here, and when you buy clothes immediately dump the bag in the washer. I sent things that I never wore before and still had tags on it, from lane Bryant. They were never listed under me, but the two used ones. They only listed three things, and won't allow me to see the third. Sold two of my lane Bryant shirts for a $1 and $2. It would cost just to try to get that bs $3. OH! And it took literally a year for me to get the kit, for it to get to them and then get processed.",1
2373,Years ago I wrote: Easy interface. Great selction. Now: the return process is difficult and they always charge you something which might be okay but the pictures and descriptions aren't clear so it's hard to know what you're getting. Spam is constant. It's hard to cancel orders. Sigh.,1
2374,One of my favorite apps and the only place I buy clothes online!,5
2375,"Can't go wrong with clothes with tags on them for literally 90+% off!!! If this is ""too good for you"" then YAY...MORE FOR THE REST OF US!!!!",5
2376,"I'm trying ThredUp for the first time because I'm a thrifter and love the idea behind making fashion far less wasteful. However, I'm really disappointed with how intuitive it's not. For example, I'm trying to find brands that appear in the advertisements and it won't let me find anything beyond the limited brands listed on the first page. I don't know if it's just my phone, so I'll be attempting to use the site on my desktop. If it isn't much better, I'm just gonna stick to eBay and irl thrift.",2
2377,I love to search fashions I have seen for much higher prices and have them delivered for so much less!! It is a budget friendly way for this mom to stay in style :),5
2378,"Easy to use, great discounts, awesome selection.",5
2379,"I like buying seconding clothes, but using the app is a horrible experience. It constantly glitches and is poorly designed. And it shouldn't take over 7 months to process a clean out bag. I never feel like I can trust the measurements or fabric details given in the listings and items are regularly categorized incorrectly. Overall, it's a frustrating experience most of the time.",1
2380,"Great way to shop for clothing that is of excellent quality, well priced, and delivered as described. Purchases are very nicely packaged too. The app works very well. I've had nothing but positive experience.",5
2381,"Terrible app. The search results are continuous, so no pages and whenever you get out of the app it scrolls back to the beginning. Very frustrating.",1
2382,I picked out some very lovely outfits. However when it came time to enter my address it kept cycling back to the beginning. Very frustrating.,1
2383,Does not work to filter when you search,3
2384,I wanted things so bad an errored in check out. Awful. Took my money an no items. Awful all around,1
2385,Excellent variety of clothing. Love this app/site!,5
2386,I have used this app for years. Almost everything in my wardrobe is from Thredup. I always refine by material type and condition to get the best possible items.,5
2387,"Filter doesn't work at all. I'm searching for long or Xlong jeans and it keeps showing me regular jeans that are very short. Ive had to return jeans twice so far because information on these jeans was wrong and I bought them because of this info (leaving me with far too short jeans) then ThredUp took over month to give site credit from the day I mailed them back, I had to keep sending emails asking for an answer at least. I keep losing $ on stupid restock fee. Not impressed with this company.",1
2388,Won't let me reclaim my items and won't even let me checkout...total BS,1
2389,"After liking, a back-click exits app without warning. Unreasonably long load time esp when prior search term vanish on cursor. Clumsy frustrating UI, although ThredUp on its own is awesome - high quality merchandise. use browser for better experience. Update: still takes five minutes to apply filters, shopping is impossible because UI limited interface and no way to include brands that aren't top 10. Hard to find styles for young small adults. A+ for ""material"" filter for those with allergies.",2
2390,Clothes without all the guilt,5
2391,So easy and fun!,5
2392,They don't send the disscription of what you order. I ordered bootcut jeans and got all skinny jeans..,2
2393,Really nice web shop,5
2394,So easy. Nice selection,5
2395,"For the most part I really enjoy finding great pieces on this site. It's my first 'clothes' online thrift shop. There are a few things I really hope the app will update, like for instance -have a dark mode. The menus are so bare and blinding. I also wish that there was a lot of the same web features available on the app. For example when looking at an 'item', then scroll down below there are other similar designs/styles bases on the image of the item you have just pulled up.",4
2396,Easy to use!!! So many useful filters - thrifting can be so overwhelming and this just makes it fun and easy,5
2397,Great bargains to be found. I love browsing the site. It's addicting but so much fun!,5
2398,"Great prices, awful customer service. This app does not help you connect with any one who can help you. My chats went unanswered for over 2 weeks. And it's not on this app, but so did my Facebook messenger. thredUp is great until there's a problem that needs to resved and then you are completely out of luck.",1
2399,Easy to use and find anything you are looking for if you know the brands you love.,5
2400,Love this site. Narrow down the search for just your size and the shopping experience is amazing. Options go on and on forever. Building a fantastic wardrobe at a fraction of the price. Thanks Thred UP for all the great work. Affordable style and I cant get enough. 4 stars cause of the shady practices they use when you mail in clothes. I dont recommend cause they will rip you off. Disappointing.,4
2401,I ordered quite a few items two of the or very bad one had a stain on the back and on the leg and they were white the other sweater was very worn out not just slightly worn,2
2402,"I loved this company and app when I first started using it, like 5 years ago. As time goes on, more and more extraneous fees are added and the quality of the items is declining. Now they want to charge you to send a clean out bag. The customer gets a fraction of the items that are sold, so you know they're making money. I have credits from things I've returned. I'll use those up and probably delete this.",1
2403,Amazing prices. Never been disappointed.,5
2404,"Love this app. Safe to order, items delivered in a timely fashion! Great prices and discount coupons usually available!",5
2405,As a company - liking it so far! As an app - Filters don't work very reliably. The app functionality needs to be cleaned up in general,4
2406,HI I JUST RECEIVED MY SHIRTS I ORDERED AND I LOVE THEM. THANK YOU,5
2407,Only think that I would change is that if you leave the screen it resets all the way to the beginning so you lose your scrolling spot.,5
2408,Amazing,5
2409,No men's section,1
2410,"I sent in a clean out bag with a Givenchy top that was NWT and over $300 and it ""mysteriously"" wasn't found even though it was delivered. I have waited for my other clean out bags to be sorted for over 9 MONTHS just for them to list the clothes for less than 1 month? How is that fair? And the payout isn't what it used to be either. I have also tried to reach out to customer service 3 times since November and no one will give me a reply. I used to love this app but it has definitely gone downhill",1
2411,Easy to use. Love this app,4
2412,"For years, this has been my go-to for clothing, but everytime I turn around there are increased fees. Doubled restocking fees, decreased point benefits, increased free shipping requirements, all making the financial benefits of purchasing via this app obsolete. Very disappointing when loyal patrons are nickel and dimed. Visit your local thrift store instead.",2
2413,Edit again 2/13/23: haven't been able to create returns in app in a long time. No updates seem to fix this issue. Frustrating. Edit: they fixed the last annoying changes. App is fun again. Edit: New interface changes make browsing annoying. Too easily resets your search back to the homepage. Do like company concept and my purchase experiences have generally been positive.,3
2414,Thredup is a great option for thrifting clothes and the app makes it super easy to find what you are looking for.,5
2415,"Shipping prices are astronomical, and quite frankly the measurements haven't been reliable in over a year. I stopped shopping here because it's not worth the money anymore and it takes too much time to double check the measurements.",1
2416,"Thredup is a convenient way to shop thousands of second-hand treasures! I love how easy they make it to sell my own gently loved clothes, too!",5
2417,"I love using Thread Up. Lot's of really good clothing with great prices. I really like the variety, and all the different styles. Things you can't find in department stores. It's my new, favorite way to shop! The app is easy to use, and if you do encounter something you don't understand, customer service is at the tip of your fingers.",5
2418,"The app is buggy and hard to use. Usually takes time to load and often the filters won't work. But I love shopping at thredup, so I put up with it. Much easier to manage on the regular website.",3
2419,"I love the enormous selection of clothes ThredUP has to offer. They have regular used clothes, new clothes w/o tags, new clothes with the tags still on, designer clothes, luxury clothes, shoes, belts and more. BUT, the prices! Are unbelievably low and they always offer sales, every day! Definitely make sure you read through all their rules, like return rules. Something I didn't do. Final sales means you can't return. Have fun shopping wherever you shop!",5
2420,"Simulator to the website, a little clunky/slow but worth it",4
2421,Best way to give old clothes a new life!!! Love this shop/app ✨️💕,5
2422,"ONE STAR⭐ $19.99 FEE? just to send my items to you?? It was always Free or print a Label. I've been checking the app and in one months time it was..... $9.99 then it was $14.99 And now it's $19.99 (which they state will be deducted from your earrings) and January isn't even over yet...... I guess by March they will prob charge a $50 FEE Times are so hard right now with gas, rent, groceries etc. Please go back to your Original ways of requesting a Bag or Print a Label! Would give 5 Stars then",5
2423,"The app can be clunky and I often use the website over the app. The search options are broad, so be as specific as you can when searching for best results.",4
2424,"So fun to shop! It's fast, it shows me only my sizes.",5
2425,"Almost abandoned cart because the promotion field focus went away so quickly, even as I was typing in it. The values cleared as I typed. I had to quickly paste in the promo code and hit ""apply"" before the field cleared again. Additionally, after submitting the purchase, the app waited for minutes before showing an ""oops, cart not found for user"" dialog. Luckily I got the confirmation email so I know the order went through successfully.",1
2426,"Great buys, easy shopping!",5
2427,Really love shopping here. But make sure you like what you buy...the restocking fees can add up with returned items.,4
2428,"I love the clothes,but I wish I can win a lot of points, so I can buy more of my favorites, I've been buying a lot.",5
2429,"It has been 8 months since I sent a box full of clothes to sell through this app and nothing has come out. I asked to return my clothes back in November 2022 and I am still waiting for the box. THIEVES! Not updates have been sent to me or they have reach out to solve the problem. Same excuse ""we are full and process time is taking longer"" so go out of business! I need answers. Save your time don't sell or buy anything from them.",1
2430,"Items may not be clearly described , as in the description of any flaws an item may have. You cannot communicate or ask questions about the item. And the app sucks in trying to start a return. I follow the prompts for initiating a return and the app continuously logs me out so that I can never start the return process. Will not return as a customer. I'll stick to poshmark.",1
2431,Love that's I get quality clothing at pennies on the dollar it's a win win,5
2432,"Been finding some cute items and pleased with prices. Only complaint is some clothes have arrived unwashed. I dont know if thredup cleans items or just says ""stain"" in regards to obvious food on the front of an item. Washed it myself and was fine.",4
2433,My favorite way to buy clothing!,5
2434,"I was fan of thredUP, promoting them to friends/family for years & spent thousands of dollars as my primary clothing source, but I deleted the app today & don't plan to shop them again anytime soon. The $3.99 restocking fee is beyond ridiculous. I was excited to see a big announcement that the $1.99 fee was gone & then VERY disappointed to see, after placing a big order, that a higher fee was quietly reinstated. Too many final sale items. Glitchy app. Longer ship times. Diminished experience.",2
2435,It is nearly impossible to contact customer support. The site is not designed to be helpful to the customer.,1
2436,"Spammy notifications with no option to specify notification types (ie if you don't want spam your only option is to turn the notifications off entirely), an appallingly bad search engine, and filters that don't work. Their photos of items also grossly lacking in detail compared to eBay listings: this means you don't know what you're getting/if the price is actually fair - have had some unpleasant surprises upon item reception. Eventually uninstalled: this app/company is not worth my time.",1
2437,I love buying my clothes from ThredUP. No complains from me💯 #I CHANGED MY MIND I AM MISSING MY PANTS FROM MY LAST ORDER. I HAVE REACHED OUT AND NO ANSWER.. NOTHING 7 EMAILS!!!!!!,1
2438,"Was apprehensive at first, I ordered my first order & received it in timely manner. Was very happy with how easy it was & bery happy with what I bought. Just ordered again . Prices are very reasonable.",5
2439,Great product and great value love it,5
2440,"I requested a clean out kit and never received it. Finally got one after the third request. It took them over 6 months to process and they only listed two items. One item sold and I never received a payout. I tried to adjust the price of the other item and it would not let me. I have tried to contact customer service on multiple occasions and have yet to reach anyone, all they have is an automated response! Very frustrating because I love the concept behind this company 😢",1
2441,Great clothes for sooo cheap and points add up fast,5
2442,I will never send anything to these people again. I sent a bag full of clothes. Some were new with tags. I got .37. So I will just donate from now on. Now they want to charge you for bags and pay you pennies. I'll either donate or use Poshmark.,1
2443,"I received some shoes that literally started coming apart, & losing skin the one & only time I wore them. I understand things like this can happen, but I CANNOT seem to get ahold of anyone through customer service. I have emailed, but so far haven't received any help.",1
2444,Love the clothes. Customer service is nonexistent. If anything goes wrong you are completely out of luck as nobody will respond.,2
2445,Always great deals,5
2446,I have used this app numerous times and it's been very reliable!,5
2447,Great shopping experience qith quality items and prices,5
2448,Terrible. Takes 6 months to process your bag that you send in. Then they offer to give you .17 on a pair of jeans that they get $12!,1
2449,A fantastic way to shop on a budget easy to way pay and free returns,5
2450,I have very rarely been disappointed by my purchases. Love thredup! However I do not love how hard it is to get info about an order when the app us giving error messages,5
2451,Lv lv lv this site.,5
2452,I like to shop here but this app will not open up to do so,2
2453,Amazing products great prices love this app,5
2454,"The boots I ordered are cracked, the hide is ripped, and chunks of hide are missing in several areas. I wouldn't even give them away they are so bad. Than to return $10.99 fee and restock fee $3.99. My first buy is my last buy. Closing account.",1
2455,Re mceived all items. Very pleased,5
2456,Use this consistantly for my clothing purchases. Never have a problem.,5
2457,Great products at affordable prices. Clothes are in good condition and clean. Fast shipping even with bundling.,5
2458,No men's category pretty messed up,1
2459,The best website for saving the most money on the clothes I Love the most!,5
2460,Have been disappointed in conditions of clothing. Some our Goodwill conditions with holes. If that conditions I will stop.,4
2461,"I am so happy I stumbled across this site! I have been turned off by many sites that claim to be similar. They are priced way out of line with thrift or used items or are untrustworthy. The only other I am comfortable purchasing from similar is Poshmark. However, I am not happy with the duration of time some the sellers take to ship items. There are instances where it has taken weeks to receive them. Not here! I get my order so quickly, it beats my Amazon orders. Love, love, love Threadup.",5
2462,"For high-end brands, there are some great deals but the interface isn't the best compared to Poshmark. You can't select a specific category or price point in your hearted items to search for so if you have a ton of ""likes"", you're forced to scroll forever. The unpredictable shipping based on the area it's located in is a huge letdown! When I buy from Poshmark or Mercari, shipping is always the same every time and I like that. Really hit and miss honestly.",3
2463,Just purchased some beautiful items on this app. Prices were great. I can't wait to get them,4
2464,What's wrong with the app? Is this out of business? Absolutely nothing loads. Zero search results. Profile is empty.,1
2465,The size on the clothes and shoes are not always accurate. Plus the everything is expensive. I can find brand new for a cheaper price.,1
2466,It's a total rip off on shipping and discripsions of sizing,1
2467,The app works well. Not happy with the return policy received the wrong item returned it. They charged me a restocking fee. I emailed customer service no response I will spend the credit I have but will probably not order again.,2
2468,Love everything about thred up.,5
2469,Love me some thredup but the app keeps crashing. Please fix,5
2470,"Thredup no longer waives all restock fees when you earn rewards and trade them in. Not cost effective if you need to return more than 4 items, as they only waive the restock fees for the first 4. Everything else you return will cost you $3.99 an item to return. A rip off, to say the least. I felt robbed when I went to return and saw they had changed this. Often receive at least one stained item per order and one or more extra worn items. App also freezes up frequently. Will never use again.",1
2471,"Most of the time nothing loads when I open it, even after uninstalling and reinstalling the app multiple times. Tends to crash while I'm trying to check out, pretty useless considering its only function is to allow me to purchase things",1
2472,"User friendly online experience Wonderful selection of topnotch designers, fabrics and outfits Easy payment options & rapid ontime delivery",5
2473,Shipping has become outrageous and whoever is doing their measuring needs additional training. Products are not as described,2
2474,Scammed on first buy. Ill never buy from them again.,1
2475,"Products as shown, nicely packed and shipped.",5
2476,"Terrible rip off every time! Even w the discount codes.I always receive clothing that has design or craftsmanship issues. A weird seam, off balance dress hem, STAINS on at least one item in every order. It would be ok if they allowed you to return fairly. I saw the advertised $3.99 restocking fee if you want to return but I didn't realize it was for every single item! Now it's not worth the hassle or the $ I would get back to pack everything up and ship back. Left with 5 garbage dresses again.",1
2477,"It's difficult to search for what you want and the app is kind of slow. Items can be misleading/sizes can vary. Can occasionally find good, well fitting items but I would say most of the time I'm not satisfied.",3
2478,"I love the concept but there are so many bugs. Currently, I can't add any filters, they all just get ignored. Makes way less user friendly to shop.",2
2479,"Horrible, this was my second attempt (several years apart) using ThreadUp. They have let me down again. I had ordered over $100 worth of clothes and have received nothing because everything was sent to the wrong address. I have tried the in app chat, email and calling. No response from anyone. Thank God I use PayPal who issued me a refund for several of the items. Therdup take a que from Paypal on costumer service. They actually care about their customers.",1
2480,"Pleasantly SURPRISED!! I was a little reserved about this app and it's merchandise but after receiving my items, I'm hooked!! They are my go to app now for name brand quality clothing and purses for a fraction of the price. All my stuff has been in excellent condition at unbeatable prices and fast shipping! Customer for life!",5
2481,"some of the clothes from Target are priced not so competitive. But lot of huge discounts in every season. Lots of options for budget friendly and luxury shoppers. The clean out kit option is really worthwhile. You just need to request one, you send it in the bag and they take care of the rest. It was free for a while. But now they have added to and fro shipping charges. Inflation, I guess!",5
2482,The app format is a bit messy and it took away my points when I declined my order... I also wish it could automate email when your clothes you give away is out on their site for other people to buy.,2
2483,In the sky...,5
2484,Awful it's been 2 week since I have ordered and hasn't been shipped I did the live chat but of course no answer I recommend not to order from here,1
2485,Love shopping and enjoying my bargains on shoes..because I wear 10narrow...,5
2486,"Ever since the last update, I can't narrow my search. When I try to select a certain style, color, etc. It just automatically sets it to ""standard"" & has a loading icon if I try to get rid of it or change it that lasts forever. Won't be able to use until I can gilter my search again.",2
2487,"I love thredUP as a marketplace for thrifting anything from clothes and accessories to shoes and purses. The only thing I dislike about the app is that if you get interrupted while scrolling through a search, it starts you at the top again, so you'll never get to see everything they have unfortunately. It's a pretty addictive habit and thredUP keeps you coming back with their sales, points system and variety of items!",4
2488,Easy to use,5
2489,Everything I have bought on this site has been excellent quality and exactly as shown. Very pleased!,5
2490,Can be slow.,3
2491,"Great merchandise, horrible search function, disappointed 😞",2
2492,"The filters don't work consistently and it's such a pain. It would be nice to have a ""similar items"" to things you click on or pick out. Sometimes I start to fill a cart but then give up out of frustration.",2
2493,"App works well enough, though much easier to view items using a laptop. Filtering is very limited on the app. It filters well for some things and completely ignores others. Also, there is no easy way to go back to where you were in a search so you end up scrolling forever.",3
2494,Trash,1
2495,Love it !,5
2496,"I recently placed a large order with ThredUP. It shipped from 2 locations, the smaller shipment arrived fine, the larger one, over $200 worth shows delivered but uses the exact same picture as the first and was not delivered here. I started a tracer with FedEx but they won't communicate with me because I am not the shipper. I have made MULTIPLE attempts to reach ThredUP and have not received any response except a generic email saying they received the inquiry and will respond within 14 days. ☹️",1
2497,"Love the app when it works but it's not. Any specific filtering it's working and it's getting frustrating, I see other people are having issues as well, I hope they fix it soon",3
2498,"With 1M+ downloads, it would seem like you could fix this app so your consumers could actually put in the filters and they would actually work. Ex: womens/tshirts/short sleeve/$15 and under. Did your latest update and will not flood in the filters. Pretty frustrating. You act as if it's a new company or something and you're still trying to get the bugs out . You've been around for YEARS and all of the bugs should DEFINITELY be out by now. As a customer, your app is anything but impressive.",1
2499,The app doesn't work half of the time.,1
2500,"Easy, straight forward, good deals.",5
2501,"Good for buying, not so good for selling. Make sure you document what you've sent in.",3
2502,"Filters are broken! The app will filter on the Category (dress, top, pants) but won't apply any more specific filters (long sleeve, short sleeve, etc.) INFURIATING!",1
2503,"If I could give this app negative stars, I would. Filters do not work- filter tips by long sleeve, -down and get everything including tank tops.",1
2504,"The app is awful! This is not a review on ThreadUP itself because I have been purchasing from ThreadUP for years. And while their sales and promotions have gotten worse, they are still a great consignment shop. The app, on the other hand, just does not work. The filters don't function correctly, and likes don't always track. It's frustrating enough that I often just decide it isn't worth purchasing from them",2
2505,I still love this app,5
2506,Great experience. Everything ordered has been very nice. Will definitely continue to use!,5
2507,"I used to give this site a 5 star review but they are no longer the same. If you are looking for a for-profit business to donate your clothes, then you will be happy. If you want to sell them you will do better elsewhere. They are currently holding a bag of mine that they have had 6+ months they haven't put up for sale and are ignoring my requests to send it back.",1
2508,Best,5
2509,What a fun way to indulge my shopping addiction without destroying my budget or the environment 😄,5
2510,The filter flat out doesn't work. It's so frustrating to not be able to search through clothing. That's one of the main points of the app!,2
2511,I haven't printed my label out or gathered my clothes so can't comment on that but I did order about 5 items already as they give a pretty good disc on your 1st day shopping! Just ordered a few days away so I don't expect it yet. Hope I don't spend money instead of. Making it!,4
2512,"Always easy, professional and fun shopping.",5
2513,"Love the company, the app is sometimes a little glitchy, but their pricing is fair and the return process is painless",5
2514,Great selection of items and new stuff added daily,5
2515,I buy in bundles. Now they consolidate the orders and shipping takes forever! The return policy suck. They charge a $3.99 restocking fee per item!!,2
2516,"Less than happy with the app, purchasing, and selling process over the past several months. Would no longer recommend.",1
2517,"The app is fine. Thredup, itself, has gone seriously downhill. They have a bag of my items, about 25, for 5 months and have yet to process them. By now, my items should've been processed and sold. When ordering, be prepared to wait 3-4weeks for items to arrive. I've waited 2 weeks before they even mailed! I really liked thredup, for several years. I recommended it to friends. Now, I advise people to shop elsewhere. Thredup is not worth the aggravation!",3
2518,So much fun! So many options!,5
2519,"I love this company! But app wise, the search is glitchy and restarts constantly. And there is no ""similar items"" option.",4
2520,"It's hard enough to find things when the filter option works. Sometimes, it can be overwhelming to try to go through and find things because there is soooo much. Currently, the filter option isn't working, so it's beyond overwhelming. I wanted to find some new to me clothes, but I won't be using this app until the filter starts working again.",3
2521,Love this app. Reasonable prices. Cute clothes.,5
2522,"Jan 23 update: system has difficulty applying filters. Won't filter items, especially when looking at petite sizing.",3
2523,Why use the app if the search filters don't work and you can't keep track of where you are with endless scrolling?,2
2524,"I love it. Save money, find new style clothes and sell my old clothes.",5
2525,App use to work. Now I consistently have issues,1
2526,So accommodating in customer service. Great selection. Absolutely love!,5
2527,"I want to love it, but I don't. The idea is awesome, but theway they do things isn't great. I've gotten around 10 orders, it takes a while to get them which is fine, but sometimes I wish items had better descriptions because what I get isn't always as expected. The Clean Out bag process is atrocious. It took more than 6 months for them to post my items, and the app never works to allow me to adjust or even see all of the items listed. I wish I were better.",2
2528,I am angry my discount code does not apply to all I add to my bundle. I refuse to pay full price for anything as clothing is cheaper in shops vs Thredup. Plus I go for free shipping. I only used the bundle feature due to auto purchasing items in other buyer's carts only to find out I am forced to pay full price for them. That is wrong! Its still all one order regardless. I can't even get in touch with a live person on this website. Never again. I will go to brick & mortar shops for now on.,1
2529,"Faster, still room for improvement",5
2530,"Item received was not as described (minimal to no signs of wear) peeling finish, and nicks in leather don't seem minimal to me. Unfortunately, I erronously purchased a final sale item, so I can't return it, and it's in such poor condition that I can't even give it away. This was my first, and 100% will be my last purchase from Thredup.",1
2531,Returns are too difficult.,2
2532,"I have gotten so many amazing quality clothes from this site for ridiculously low prices. I will say occasionally I experience some glitches with loading, but overall it functions great.",5
2533,The company never picked up clothes Sent yo them in November..poor customer service,1
2534,"Easy, cheap and fun!",5
2535,Better than expected!! Great variety!,5
2536,I'm only giving 3 stars because 1. No more ability to shop similar items. You used to be able to do so on any item and it was particularly useful when you favorited something and it gets purchased. This is the biggest issue. 2. Restocking fee AND you have to pay shipping which is $10 or more. Unless you use points but even then you can only waive for three items. If something doesn't fit (which- sizing discrepancies in women's clothes) you're out $ 2. No more goodie boxes!!!,3
2537,Love this site!,5
2538,I love the selection and descriptions. This is my first order so it's TBD on the shipping and then arrival etc. However I detest the time limit on searches in my cart. With as much selection as this company has that time limit has caused way more headaches than not. I understand not letting things stay in a cart forever. But I need time for searches. If that could get expanded it would make this a 5 star rating.,3
2539,I love it! Pictures are clear and crisp. Items never disappoint! I love the cart timer. It helps me make a decision or let it go! I love how you can filter to exactly what you are looking for!,5
2540,Love getting great deals on brands I love and helping minimize fashion waste!,5
2541,"Good interface, good filters",5
2542,"I like the app, but the search and filter options are completely useless.",3
2543,"Favorite searches won't load 80% of the time, the circle just turns and turns. Chat doesn't work at all, and customer service doesn't respond to emails.",1
2544,My 1st. Order was perfect. The outfit I purchased fit me great. My second the pants where to small size 14? I have a rump of a butt& thighs. So Iam going up on pants size?,5
2545,Would be so much easier to shop if the filters actually worked.,2
2546,"I love, love, love ThreadUp. It is my favorite way to shop. Just keep in mind that the shipping can take awhile so order well ahead of when you want your ""new"" cloths. Also, paying close attention to size details and knowing your measurements helps. I just got my box and I am thrilled with everything in it. I love that I can reuse and re-love these cloths and create my own fabulous style. Now, I can look great at my new job and still save money. Shop your hearts out everyone and stay fabulous!",5
2547,"App is decent, wish there weren't so many prompts for notifications and that outfits favorited previously (+ bought by someone else) had recommendations on ""lookalikes"" currently available, and would appreciate style/fabric sorting options, but overall I buy on the app without problems.",4
2548,Ever since the last update I am unable to filter the necklines in the tops category.,3
2549,Love!! Great deals!,5
2550,Wonderful items with really fair pricing. I love to shop second hand for the economic value and to help the planet,5
2551,"Thrifting made easy. App is easy to navigate, great prices and fast shipping.",5
2552,It's a good shopping app,5
2553,Fast delivery to my door.,5
2554,"Terrible company and subpar merchandise. I was blocked on Facebook for giving an honest review. Skip this hassle and poor quality control , not worth it. The folks that sell them clothes also sorely disappointed. Utter trash.",1
2555,"The item descriptions are always lacking. Too many items state ""no fabric details available"" and it would be super helpful if a short, detailed description was included. Additionally, items are very often way over priced... especially for the condition that they are in. I'm unimpressed. Lastly, I can never access my account/order/return details. I get pop-ups that state ""failed to retrieve history"". Honestly, the app is a joke.",1
2556,"I would give this company negative stars if I could. I've been a loyal customer for years. This is the first time I've required customer service-- and I've found it's non-existent. I've gone through all of the channels listed on their website, but their chat feature (which they say is the best way to contact them) doesn't exist. I sent an email. They say they'll respond in 4 days. Over 2.5 weeks later, no response. This is by far the worst ""customer service"" experience I've ever had.",1
2557,"I just love love love shopping on this site, my #1 go to store ❤️🤗",5
2558,"I enjoy shopping in thredup. I like the fact that they give you the condition of the product. I also like that you can return an item if it does not fit, unlike some others.",5
2559,I love thredup. I love the app because it keeps my favorite online consignment store close. I can keep track of favorite items. Love thredup in every form.,5
2560,Horrible return policy. When you select return to original method it does not and only gives you non-refundable credit which is impossible to use.,1
2561,"Since covid this has been my main place for thrifting. You can sort sizes, colors, patterns, cuts, whatever you want. Makes it super easy and you don't have to sift through racks and racks of clothes lol. Prices aren't as good as irl thrift stores but considering how easy this app makes it you're basically paying for better quality and convenience. That said, prices are still very cheap especially since they have sales ALL the time.",5
2562,"My one stop shop for 90% of my wardrobe. Lots of options, good filters. Would like an option to exclude certain brands (like SHEIN) or sort via body type. I'd also like to sort by actual measurements of waist or inseam of bottoms since sizing in the US is anything but uniform. Overall my favorite resale shop! An excellent way to shop sustainably.",4
2563,Overall simple,5
2564,Great app for purchasing. Only one issue I've had is that it's difficult to find information on the status of your cleanup boxes that you've sent in. I have to go to the website for that.,4
2565,Cute thrift finds. Regular deals.,5
2566,Don't like signing in to see items. Unbranded items need to be named no matter what brand it is and as for the clothes do a better job at presenting them in a better way online No one wants to buy a wrinkle holey sweater or scarf,4
2567,"Easy to use, wish the shipping was based on weight or number of items, but that doesn't have anything to do with the app. It has been a bit sticky of late, but all of my apps have been, so it may be an issue on my end. ; )",4
2568,Im obsessed with this app. Great products and grate prices.. I tell all my friends about it. 😊,5
2569,My absolute favorite app ❤️❤️❤️,5
2570,Enjoying using the app without any issues,5
2571,Android app has issues.,3
2572,"I've only bought something once, but so far so good, good experience",5
2573,I've had great luck with thredUp so far & love the idea of thrifting from home.,5
2574,Amazing!,5
2575,Constantly takes you back to the top of the infinite scrolling. Keeps showing me things that aren't my size despite me updating my sizes over and over.,2
2576,"I received an item that was not what I ordered and the return process is impossible. I am not going to pay $10.99 return shipping and $3.99 restocking fee for an item that is not what I ordered. Their customer service is impossible to get in touch with (via both their chat and email) to try to find a better solution, I have been trying for nearly a week now. Don't buy from Thredup.",1
2577,The returns tab hasn't worked in over a month. Very unsatisfied.,1
2578,"Weird that the ""returns"" page on the app never seems to work. I always have to go to the website to check on my returns or start returns.",1
2579,"They owe me a refund and I been waiting weeks. I can't talking to anyone about it. There is no way to communicate with them. It's sad because I really like Thredup. I have to email them and it takes days before response then its too late, to stop order. They are not customer friendly.",2
2580,Love love love!!,5
2581,Good app,5
2582,Love everything about this app!!!,5
2583,There's nothing for Men and the shoe sizes only go to 12's when I'm a 14,2
2584,"Don't bundle. It will take literal weeks for them to even ship it out. It takes days for customer support to get back to you. Other than that, the clothes are good and obviously much more affordable than most stores.",3
2585,"Very buggy app. I needed to return a few pairs of pants, the measurements listed in the app were wrong. I would have requested a credit to thredup for them if the app, especially the return process, wasn't so buggy. You start the return process and get kicked out constantly having to log in to thread up app completely again and again. Not worth the hassle.",2
2586,Hard to cash out and you can't call anyone,1
2587,"Never choosing to bundle again. Takes incredibly too long to receive items. Chose to bundle on 26th & on 29th they r still saying we will ship your order n 3 to 6 days. Never again EDIT: I'm taking away another 2 stars. Description of jeans was wrong 3 out of 5 we're mislabeled on site & didn't find out till I received them. Don't know if I'm shopping here ever again, it's just one thing after another with Thredup",1
2588,"When there's an issue there should be some way of communicating or some form of contact , my other issue is my saves which are my funds should be private, I don't appreciate someone being able to basically steal my saves/favorites.",3
2589,"I enjoy this app, but I sent a bag of clothes for resell. Thought a few months latter I would be able to shop with the credits. Last checked I had $30.00 in credit. That I never got to spend. When I mailed items, there was nothing on post card. Or that I read online. A time limit which to spend the credit. I never recieved payment, or the clothes back. Which I did choose toI pay the 10.00 to get the Clothes mailed back to me if they didn't sell.",1
2590,The clothes are top quality and very affordable,5
2591,"I rarely leave reviews but ThredUp is so awful I feel I must. I ordered two items that should have been delivered on 01/02/2023. I have not received them as of 01/11/2023. It is impossible to reach a real person through customer service. There live chat apparently does not exist as it just takes you to their email. They only response to my emails have been a bot saying they received my email and would respond within 4 days, Wich they have not.",1
2592,My experience is always positive and I am never dissatisfied. I have ordered many times since discovering Thred-up in 2019. Love it!!,5
2593,"This used to be THE place to buy and sell clothing. However. They have now increased prices to buy, decreased selling prices, charge restocking fees per item, and charge you just to show them what clothing you have to sell... no guarantee to buy. I understand the economy is in the toilet but now so is thredup. You just lost a customer that spent over 5k a year.",2
2594,i love thredup!! it's amazing to be able to shop secondhand online. there are always so many choices available and always something new because of the nature of this store! they do a great job of detailing the items and it's easy enough to send any items that don't convince you. so happy they exist!!,5
2595,"It's pretty cool to look through so many things that I am interested in buying, and these are great prices!",5
2596,"Just placed my first, had to ..! The prices are exceptional !! The selections are plentiful and relevant, up to date styles. Ordering easy and discounts substantional enough to make a differance. I hope the actual clothes are as wonderful ... Will update once clothing arrives ..!!",5
2597,I used to love the app! Now it just keeps crashing and takes forever to load.,1
2598,Love ThredUp!,5
2599,"Horrible experience. You have to spend all the time hunting down what you want and then you lose it every 1 to 4 hours. Finally get to place your orders and the stuff never comes! Just an oops, sorry. First issue, took like 3 weeks for an order to get here, second time, lost the whole order, this time, missing item that I wanted most in order. But new, you may not get what you order and then they'll just resell it and call it a day. Horrible company and horrible experience multiple times.",1
2600,"I wish the app allowed multiple coupon codes versus having to set up separate purchases. Also notifications are extreme - and it does seem like the user is consistently ""tricked"" into turning notifications on.",3
2601,"Great, no issues",5
2602,"The items are not as described. I've made two orders, and each time, I've received old, old, outdated clothes, not in good condition, and the charge $4 for restock!@ Horrible!! POSHMARK is why better!!! You never get to talk to a live person. Customer service sucks!!",1
2603,Great deals and gives information on sizes in the descy. Only complaint is the item will say one size at the top but be another in the picture.,3
2604,"pretty good...but could use a few improvements...like easier to get to , costumer support.",4
2605,Easy to use. I love shopping thrift.,5
2606,Love this app! Basically online thrifting. With all of the filters you can shop specific pieces no problem ! My experience there have been some issues the app glitches quite a bit when going from searching to your bag and your favorites... it takes a few minutes to catch up or you have to open & close the app. Also a big problem is if you sell your clothes it hasn't let me cash out for the items that sell which is kind of frustrating. I end up having to spend the credit on more clothes.,3
2607,Never works. Takes forever to load. Constantly refreshes. In the middle of a filter? Sorry. You gotta go back to the beginning.,2
2608,Good except discount code doesnt apply?,4
2609,Love all of clothes I've received and the ease with with I can return the ones I don't like,5
2610,Easy to use. Lots of good finds,5
2611,"Best app to purchase designer clothing, shoes and accessories for a fraction of the price!!! I just wish you could have more than 35 items in your cart at one time.",5
2612,I love this concept & idea of recycling my clothes while earning a little money. I always find someone else's slightly used items at prices I can afford. Plus it helps the planet. Count me in.,5
2613,Good app and love thrift shopping from home. Only complaint is that when shopping sometimes it will refresh and you end up back at the top of the item list.,4
2614,You are not updating shipment or tracking info!!!!!!,1
2615,I wouldn't recommend buying from this site. I received a purse that was supposed to be in new condition and there were stains all over it!,1
2616,"My first order was better than I expected. Everything fit and the clothes were just as shown. I ordered from different areas so there was a wait, to put orders together and send altogether to me. If wasn't as long as I've had to wait for other sites and the packaging is so darn cute!!!",5
2617,"No one in customer service will help you. They closed their live chat until 1/9 for the holidays? What holidays?? New Years is over days ago. The rest of the world is back to work. Sent an email and the confirmation message said I'll get a response in 4 days. 4 DAYS. Which would be fine if the issue wasn't time sensitive. Can't edit a bundle order after I've started it, even though it hasn't shipped yet. So the item I don't want I'll have to pay return shipping ($9 dollars) and a restocking fee.",1
2618,"Have ordered through the app multiple times, all good experiences. Definitely would recommend to those who love clothes/accessories but are worried about their impact.",5
2619,"Wonderful quality options for less, love that clothes get a second chance for use",5
2620,"Returned items within the return policy parameters.Issued me a store credit instead of a refund,even though I paid my own shipping.Tried customer service NUMEROUS times.No one has replied in over a month.Then I go to use the stupid credit,and they BANNED my acct.Thieves.Needless to say never got my refund,and have a bunch of useless credits..Shop elsewhere, trust me..",1
2621,Love everything about this. Great clothes that I wouldn't get otherwise. Beautiful stuff for less than half what you'd pay in retail.,5
2622,Nice.,3
2623,"I love thredUP, but I really wish the app would be updated to get rid of the continuous scroll. After selecting an item to look at and then returning to the search page, it often refreshes, taking you right back to the top. It's very frustrating. I think the app would function better with pages for viewing rather than the continuous scroll.",2
2624,Never get what you order,1
2625,Get this app it's fun it filters your size comes pretty quick too all the name brands you love,5
2626,Easy to navigate,5
2627,Love this app,5
2628,easy to use,4
2629,Been over 2 months and my return kit is still processing. There's no way to speak to anyone. What a scam. Shouldve stuck to ebay. May file suit. Whereis my stuff???.,1
2630,Love that I have a way to recycle my clothes and to purchase slightly used clothes. Saves money and environmentally sound. Got a Coach bag free using credits from my clothes that sold. Win!,5
2631,"So far, so good",4
2632,"I seem to be having the same issue now the app wont keep me signed in.But, I love this app. Brand names at low prices. The only down side is if you order a few things they come in a bunch of different packages. Ever since I found this app I don't shop anywhere else. I love it so much the customer service is amazing if you have any issues they resolved it very quickly. I only wish they were still taken people stuff to sell. I think they paused I'm taking anything because they are getting too much",5
2633,Love the changes.,5
2634,"Overall great for buying secondhand. However, the app often crashes during shopping.",4
2635,"The app layout is easy to navigate, but it's hard to open sometimes. The opening page will freeze from time to time",3
2636,App was great but now the App either crashes or freezes. Sometimes can't even get on it.,3
2637,Easy to use!! Great deals!!,5
2638,"It's annoying enough that I'm knocking out two stars. Pressing the back button is a normal reflex when using your phone. I REALLY don't appreciate how pressing the back button just closes the app. Edit- last review was 3.1.22 Problem is not fixed It is NOT a problem on my end, as their response would insinuate It is a minor coding error on their end and I am pretty sure it could be fixed fairly quickly.",1
2639,"Some glitches, but good otherwise",4
2640,User friendly,5
2641,For Saving the Planet ☮️👍🏻,5
2642,Absolutely love great selection for everyone,5
2643,"Can't speak to anyone, my package is not updated the tracking. It's been over a month and still no package!",1
2644,"I am in love with this app! Of course, the time limit once you place your favorites in your cart isn't favorable. I still love it. I've always wanted to shop second hand clothes online. I am boujee on a budget and this app is definitely a favorite of mine. I havnt used the special shipping option where you can shop all week and ship your purchases together, but I like the idea. I've already placed multiple orders and I am going to start selling my old clothes with them too!",5
2645,Clean out bags are now $14.99 and cleanout kits are only available once a year. They are always unavailable.,1
2646,I sent a bag of clothes to sell in August and it is now almost 5 months later it has still not been processed. Not worth the long wait. I have bought clothes from them several times and they are not of top quality as they advertise.,3
2647,Once again another app full of people who just want more pictures of the clothes you're trying to sell so they can waste your time without compensating You by buying the actual item get your lives together people just go inside a story freaking weirdos,3
2648,"Nice stuff, easy to use app, love it!",5
2649,If you want to ripped off send your clothes to thred up. Then your points expire on clothes you send to them the points ( money) should never expire on clothes You sold to them. How crooked can you be. Don't get me started on how expensive their used clothes are. Rediculous!!!,1
2650,Easy to use.,5
2651,I SENT ITEMS SIX MONTHS AGO THEY HAVE NOT BEEN POSTED FOR SALE YET.,1
2652,What a great selection of items! Just made my first two orders. Wish it shipped a little faster but it's probably just the holidays,5
2653,"So hard to contact anyone. One item was missing from my order, there is no way to chat with anyone. Frustrating",1
2654,"Fun shopping! Great deals, and great quality items!",5
2655,Are you ever going to fix your app so that I can actually go into the notifications section of the settings tab? All it ever does is show that spinning loading icon. I would like to be able to stop the hundreds of emails I get from you weekly! It's obnoxious!,1
2656,So easy to shop,5
2657,Easy to search.,5
2658,"Great except that when you earn rewards, you can't use them with any deals. I always shop deals so never earn anything I can use!",4
2659,The thredUP app is an easy way to shop consignment and find great deals!,5
2660,December 2022,5
2661,Terrible,1
2662,"I made an order and forgot to update the address and inmediately contacted them and they told me they couldn't help me. Even though, the order wasn't shipped yet. I contacted fedex and they told me only thred up could help, but they chose not to. The order was received and now someone is happy with two purses that they didn't buy. And I lost my money. And thred up lost my business.",1
2663,I love this app this store I put in my size my favorite colors my favorite fabrics the type of shoes I like the jeans I like it finds them for me at a really great deal,5
2664,i love thredup. people pays me so mush compliment on my Clothing.,5
2665,Doesn't give a way to communicate. Can't cancel orders that have not shipped 15 days after ordering them. Items that were receivedliterally fell apart when trying on the first time. Won't be using again,1
2666,Love it! Prices are so cheap,5
2667,"Great selections, but I would NOT recommend using the Clean Out Kit. The last time I tried ordering a kit, the bag was never shipped to my door. So other than that, I love how you can get high quality brands for discounted prices. I've found so many cute pieces on this website that fit me and suit my style well!",4
2668,Love shopping here on the app. Easy sign in. Saves my searches. Such good deals.,5
2669,I have been trying for months to send things in and still have not been able to.,1
2670,Awesome way to shop for great items,5
2671,Delivery takes forever and many of the description are inaccurate so I have had to return multiple items.,1
2672,"As a very environmentally aware shopper this is an awesome idea. Every piece has been clean, great condition and affordable. Love it👍",5
2673,"Worst place to buy clothes. They have the ugliest and oldest styles of clothing, and for only a couple of dollars cheaper than going to your favorite store( For example Michael Kors purses. You can hit a sales at Macy's and get a brand new Michael Kors bag for about $20 more. I don't know about you ladies, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a current style with no previous owner crust on it! Just saying) Also I searched for a NWT item, so I purchased an item there. It came used with no tags. Ugh!",1
2674,"Been buying from thredup for a few years now, everything has been above my expectations. Have told a bunch of folks about this great place!",5
2675,My favorite shopping app!,5
2676,I shop on the app very often. I find so many pieces new with tags at very reasonable prices. Highly recommend.,5
2677,"I like this app when it works. I love being able to scroll endlessly on and off, liking items. Then when I'm ready to purchase a bunch at a time I can just go back to my likes and add whatever is still available to my cart. I love the variety and the quality of the clothes, but the app crashes and freezes on a regular basis.",4
2678,Nothing but a ripoff. Sent a trashed handbag and they can Not be returned!! Never again!!!,1
2679,I tried to clean out my closet but someone took my green bags so I gave up! Now I need my clothespins!,5
2680,"Awsome clothes , Awesome deals and it's super fast delivery with special perks!!!",5
2681,Delivery time or justbto get it ship tonu is ridiculous. I literally have to oder a month in advance.,1
2682,Love this app I buy so many cute things,5
2683,"12 items purchased, love every piece!",5
2684,I Always find treasures and I love how easy it is to return if the treasures are too small,5
2685,I bought all my clothes for vacation on this online thrift store app. I couldn't be any happier. Thredup is an amazing app. 👏 definitely recommend!!,5
2686,It's always the quality I expect! Cute clothes AND reducing fast fashion. EDIT: This is a year+ later and I still agree! Always check your email from thred up for coupon codes!,5
2687,I like to shop here but I feel utterly ripped off sending my clothes here and I don't recommend giving thredup your clothing at all. They don't even give you half of what they're charging for the items. You are literally getting pennies. I'm totally enfuriated to see what they make on my clothes. You're better off selling on Ebay. Big no from me.,3
2688,"Love the eco friendly option to buy thrift, and there are SO many of the brands I love!",5
2689,"I love getting clothes and shoes from here. I did send in some clothes and 7 months later they are still being processed. I will continue to shop here, but moving forward I will use another thrift selling site or just give them to charity. They did give me a $30 credit for the inconvenience.",4
2690,Super fast and easy delivery. Only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because I can't use my address had to send my stuff to a family members house.,4
2691,Love ThredUp but the app has turned to trash along with customer service. I had enough points to get free shipping so I made a purchase and my points were taken but didn't get the free shipping. I contacted customer service and never got a response. Most likely taking my business elsewhere.,3
2692,"I just love this app. All my orders have been great, and I love how nice and neat the package comes!!",5
2693,Love love it,5
2694,"Love ThredUp, but the app needs work - it's always crashing or buttons not responding",3
2695,I've purchased several items from thredUP and love them ALL. Who cares that someone else loved them first: department store quality at garage sale prices!,5
2696,Wonderful experience on thredup. While pics could give more detail it is a great chance to get top quality clothing in excellent condition for a fraction of their original price. Bundling your purchases is a very smart idea. Presentation is beautiful!!!!! Returns could never be easier. Accumulate points that qualify you for deals plus more!! I love threadup !!,5
2697,"Love the concept and app is easy to use. However, shipping has always been an issue. I am unable to track my packages until one day they just appear. Usually 3-4 weeks later. I love this site but will discontinue use at this time.",3
2698,"I love the app again! Now that it provides product details (inseam and bust measurements, color of item, its condition, what materials it's made of, etc.), I'll start shopping again!",5
2699,"Thredup took a lot of really good benefits away and now we get really notthing for what we purchase, hardly any good deals. The return section of the app does not work. Very hard to get a hold of customer service. Return function does not allow any returns for quite a long time now. I can't even return anything, because the return function is completely disabled! Hardly any customer service response!",1
2700,"I ordered on 11/23 & 11/24 and still have not received my order. I put free shipping credit. I'm about ready to request a refund for the entire order. I had been satisfied but I am no longer. Never, ever use your free shipping reward!",2
2701,"App does not load, after recent system update.",2
2702,I Mailed my kit and it still has not been processed. It has been 2 months. I have more to send but am reluctant because the first box has not been touched yet.,3
2703,"What happened to item descriptions? No more measurements, color, fabric, condition, etc.? The site is useless without this info.",1
2704,Easy to use but if you're planning on selling you won't make much money with this app. Also they tend to have low standards when accepting clothes since I ordered a sweater from here and it has all kind of fuzz and was in really poor conditions. Had to return and stopped buying clothing from here.,2
2705,I have no issues with threadup (other than their used items being way over priced) I just despise the app. It never works correctly and constantly crashes.,1
2706,Can't get/receive payment through cash out option in the app AT ALL. When you click on 'cash out' it just takes you to FAQ. What's the point in offering a 'cash out' option & you literally CAN'T??!! I'm gonna try logging in to the website & see if that works.,1
2707,App will not open past loading screen with new update,1
2708,"There needs to be more information about the items. Condition, heel height, etc",3
2709,"I placed an order which is traveling around the US for 3 weeks now. It been east to west coast, north to south 3x now. Customer service will not offer a refund and are ignoring this issue. Now I have to try to deal with my credit card company to get this dealt with.",1
2710,"Recent update to the app makes it impossible to see Amy details like measurements, fabrics, color, etc when selecting an item. When using a browser, I can see these details so it's definitely an app issue",1
2711,"Need working filters for skirt waist and blouse and cardigan chest sizes please! I would have purchased many cardigans by now, except without the chest size noted I will not do it. I'm not the only one to request this. I would give more stars with these excellent improvements.",3
2712,The quality of clothing has definitely changed. Wrinkled and stained items. The cost of returning items is not worth it. Big difference from a year ago. Very disappointed.,2
2713,"The app doesn't really work anymore. It won't load my saved searches, account features won't load. Easier to use the website.",2
2714,It was terrible I sent some stuff out to sell and I couldn't see what was sold or on the list to sell I sent an email and never got an answer at all I was finally able to sell something and it says there is a fee to get your money and on top of that you can't change the price all the stuff I sent was worn once I sent a Dereklam jumpsuit and still haven't been able to change the price this app is just a sham if you want to sell it go to Poshmark or other legit apps but not this one is not worth,1
2715,There is no customer service! They give you some bot to chat with and give you run around. The app keeps crashing. I bought luxury items that were damaged and not in the description and I can't get my money back! I'm never buying from here again!,1
2716,There is no one to talk to if you make an error on the app. I accidentally signed up for a bundle with my purchase &e there apparently isn't a way to correct my problem. Will not be ordering from thread up again ! The item that i received was DIRTY. The purse had a layer of dust & dirt on it. Never did get a response from customer service !,1
2717,"Customer service is not as good as it used to be and barely any deals now a days few issues I have is that some shoes are so black that I cannot see what they look like with the background being all white, I think it would help having a light on it. Also cannot update address, lastly WORST of all is how I go back to a different app while scrolling it puts me all the way back to the start even if I go right back to it or it does it after a while.",3
2718,I love the amount of clothing options and how everything I order fits.,5
2719,"I loved this app and rated it a 5 but with the new update I have to drop it to two. Where are the details??? As someone who NEEDED to know the chest measurement for items, this change means I cannot buy any clothes at all. It's just not worth it to get something too tight around the bust and need to return. Bring back the measurements and fabric details! Who can buy secondhand without knowing those?!",2
2720,"I love the things you can buy on the app I got a 42 follar skirt for 12 dollars!!! I definitely recommend this app if you love thrifting but not going out and love the prices, not only that but lots of the items are new with tags!!!",5
2721,Tumps up,5
2722,Love love love this app!,5
2723,"I ordered one item that was supposed to be Lululemon brand for my daughter for Christmas. By the time I opened the package and realized it was not that brand I only had 1 day to return it, and I lost money. Do not use this app. You are better off going to Plato's closet or some other consignment shop.",1
2724,TrendUp Sucks,1
2725,"Your package are always late, even if u paid extra money, SHAME ON U.",2
2726,"Great concept; TERRIBLE execution. Measurements they give are trash. So unless you know how a brand fits, there's no confidence in your purchase. They used to have a pretty low $1.99 restocking fee, making the gamble tolerable. Plus items were very well priced. But now they've changed everything and ruined the buying experience: restocking is $3.99 per item and most well priced items are final sale so you can't even pay the 4 bucks. No longer worth the risk. Googles online thrift stores ...",2
2727,"I love ThredUp so much and shop regularly. However, the app is just trash right now. The description section is gone, the app freezes and kicks me out randomly, I have unavailable items in my available items, some of the redirects from the home screen don't work. Honestly, I know these are first world problems, but I think an app should work correctly if you want people to buy from you. I'm currently looking for a dress for NYE but will have to go elsewhere if I can't even get a description.",2
2728,The biggest fan,5
2729,I do use this app all the time it's my go to for clothes and shoes but they used to have the items measurements listed under the item but I don't see that lately so I have to look up a brands size chart on Google I will continue to use thread up but the app is buggy and needs work,4
2730,"Desktop version is better. Has more options that should be applied to the app. Otherwise, so far, working well.",4
2731,"Don't get the app, just use the online site. For some reason they took off the product descriptions from the items so you can't see things like what they're made of (is it cotton? polyester? leather?, who knows), heel size for shoes, or even the item number. It's annoying to use the mobile site, but at least you know what you're ordering.",1
2732,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I received the wrong Jacket and you'd think they would correct their mistake?! NOPE! I'm out $40. Also, the clothing I received was poorly looked over. Holes, stains and incredibly old. The prices are very high. Pointer.. take a ss image search and you will ALWAYS find the exact same items on Poshmark or ebay for WAY LESS!",1
2733,"Probably the worst service to sell clothes. It has been more than 3 months to process my clothes, and they haven't. So I asked to return my clothes and they are just ""you will have to wait in line"" more ,4 weeks(it has been 1 month already). Don't use this service. The worst unorganized.",1
2734,"THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT HAS BEEN SINCE I'VE SENT OFF MY CLEAN OUT KIT IS CRAZY RIDICULOUS!! MONTHS LATER FINALLY SAID RECEIVED AND HERE I AM MONTHS LATER AFTER THAT AND STILL NOTHING MORE THAN ""RECEIVED"" .. BUYING FROM HERE, IS ALRIGHT... BUT MY GOODNESS I REGRET SENDING MY STUFF TO THEM. MOST STILL WITH TAGS. NO TELLING WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR IF THEYRE EVEN DOING ANYTHING WITH THEM.",1
2735,I absolutely love this app <3 <3 <3! I have gotten some really beautiful clothes for really low prices. I've also gotten a lot of compliments on them :D I'm super glad this app exists. People are literally stunned when I tell them what I paid for my garments. I cannot recommend this app highly enough!!,5
2736,Shipping is a rip off and they never offer tracking info. When you pay for over priced shipping you can't track. I've found same clothes at brick and mortar thrift stores for way cheaper too,1
2737,The app is great but does get stuck and/or crashes regularly.,4
2738,Filters don't work. Gives clothing sizes for shoes too,1
2739,"Guys, seriously. Shopping online is not a good idea. Received size 6 instead 12. Return policy: restoking fee $1.99, shipping cost $10.99. The purchase was for about $20. There is nothing left.",1
2740,Can't always load favorite or account history.,3
2741,Love the app. Very user friendly.,5
2742,So easy! What a fun way to thrift shop!,5
2743,"Great place to shop, fun browsing. I can't get enough of this website and shopping, so reasonible. Try it now!",5
2744,"Not worth it! I tried doing their clean out kits twice and was paid probably $20 for $1000 worth of clothes. I sent in many name brand items still with thr tags on. You have to pay to get the clothes sent back to you that they did not want. And when they say your clothes ""expire"" from the sale time frame, they don't send those back either. They turn around and sell it for straight profit to them. You are better off selling your clothes else where.",1
2745,"They don't do a great job at describing the item or the sizing. But that is online shopping in general, I guess. Some items are great, but it's 50/50.",3
2746,I'm trying to return items. And they said it was $1.99 for restock. Now it's $3.99 plus they don't give the return address. So disappointed. I have received items and kept them. So I don't know how to return the items I have. So Im going to give the homeless. The clothes I received.,2
2747,"All the upsides of thrifting or ebay, plus a great return policy and huge selection. Don't forget to set alerts for your favorite brands.",5
2748,Trouble loading features and searches,3
2749,Great app for finding cute items for less! Delivery is relatively quick too.,5
2750,At first I liked buying off of the app. So I decided to take a chance and sell some things. After sending in my items. The company only took a few things. Even though most things was new with tags. But that isn't what got me upset. When checking on my listings I noticed a Dress not listed. Nor did I receive it back with the other items. A few weeks later I checked the Dresses listed & found it.They said that it wasn't my Dress. Even though I brought it from them. Don't sell anything with them.,1
2751,"Dropping stars, the app us not functioning properly for at least the last month. I can't see pending items in my sales and When searching and going back it takes me to the beginning of my search. I tried to update the app there are no updates. Also many clothing photos look squished so the clothes don't look right, no wonder they're not selling.",3
2752,thredUP is by far the easiest way to browse so many great brands! And their shipping and return policy is on point-very fast and always packaged so cute!!,5
2753,I still really do love this app but they have changed from when they first started prices have gone up even trying to sell your clothes is ridiculous because you don't get anything back from it because they decide on how much to take from you so it's not worth it to sell but even then I was still happy with it because I loved buying stuff in this app but now the shipping price is crazy for one item it's like $10 I know shipping goes by weight so it makes no sense to be charged for one shirt $10,3
2754,I love this app! Easy to use. Cute and affordable clothing.,5
2755,Long shipping times and things do not arrive to address provided,1
2756,I want to check it out more,2
2757,"I love the offers, discounts and easy-to-use returns.",5
2758,Perfect and always on time,5
2759,Like that they donate what they don't use,4
2760,"I have no complaints about this app. Works well, doesn't crash and has loads of features. Update: excellent filters, very organized, excellent source of sustainable fashion! It's my fav!",5
2761,Find great clothes great prices!,5
2762,"App seems to be having some glitches. When I filter, it says there are 0 or a negative number of results even though clothes come up. Whenever I try to look at sales, I get 0 results. There are also missing features on the app that are available on the website like, viewing similar clothes. I used to be able to scroll for hours but now after I back out of viewing an item, I get sent back to the top of the results.",2
2763,highly recommend!! thredup is a fantastic way to shop ethically and inexpensively. the app is also very functional.,5
2764,Finding what I like for less!!!,5
2765,"I'm so excited because everything is so affordable!I get name brand stuff at bargain store prices, you just can't beat them!",5
2766,All the clothing I've bought was good quality and I love the prices!,5
2767,Love it! 💜,5
2768,Great finds & great service but the app crashes all the time. Update: App doesn't work at all for me now.,2
2769,"Ordering is so easy, never had any issues at all. The bundle options are awesome!!!",5
2770,Great experience every time,5
2771,Shipping times are terrible and there is only one option. Mail Inovations takes two weeks minimum to get orders anywhere.,2
2772,I love love love ThredUP but I wish the app wouldn't bug out and show me empty categories so frequently. Please make it easy for me to keep buying too much from ThredUP! 😂,3
2773,Best place to shop..,5
2774,"Meh. They don't check items for damage and stains well apparently. I bought several items. One pair of jeans, they sent me a little girls size instead of womens. I double checked item description and my search history and its definitely not my mistake...one shirt had stains and torn stitching, also was misshapen and shrunk. Ordered a body suit and the snaps are busted. Unwearable. So my first experience...definitely not enthused. App is slow and crashes as well. I'll stick with vinted.",2
2775,"I ordered one time from thredup and it went well, but I ordered recently and it's a nightmare. They lost my package and I asked for a refund. They have me less money then I spent and when I tried finding my order thredup is saying I ordered in 1969. I wasn't even born! I place the order last month and it's been the worse experience. I now have no idea where my children's clothes are, got less money than I payed, & out of luck on getting help. I don't recommend ordering from here at all!",1
2776,My items always arrive on time and in great conditioner at a fair price.,5
2777,Was supposed get sweater didn't come and got a 10 credit and took away used to use weekly bad experience,1
2778,This is my favorite way to shop for clothes!! Quality pieces for a fraction of the retail cost with lots of additional savings sales every year. Very satisfied customer.,5
2779,"LOVE this app! I'm able to clean out closets and get my daughter brand new, name brand clothes so easily. Great app and great deals!!! The app is so easy to use and the website is easy to navigate, too. I'm a fan!",5
2780,"A little too much fun to shop! I might buy a couple times a year, but I'm always looking for deals, and this app has so much.",5
2781,Best app for shopping used!,5
2782,App is wonky and crashes more than I like. Also won't let you navigate to other sections of the site. Tried to speak to customer service and the app crashed then too!,3
2783,Super!,5
2784,This app makes it too easy to spend my money,5
2785,Outstanding & fun 😊,5
2786,I downloaded this app today and it won't even open. It keeps saying there's a bug and to wait until the developer updates with a fix. Edit: Won't let me sign up due to server errors?,1
2787,"I can't get the PayPal interface to work, meaning I had to use a card.",4
2788,Back online:),5
2789,The new update makes the app crash instantly upon start-up.,5
2790,Update: I was unable to open the app due to a bug. Developer responded and fixed app with in hours! That's amazing so I'm changing the rating from 1 star to 5,5
2791,App no longer works after update on November 16.,1
2792,I've used this app for years and spent tons of money shopping. Can't open it today. Closes unexpectedly. I reinstalled but it won't open. BOO,1
2793,"Just downloaded, it says there's a bug, so it won't open it. I tried uninstalling & re-installing without success.",1
2794,"Wrong size, im a 3 XL and the items you gave me were for 1XL or for kids, it won't fit around my bust despite it saying 50 DD, then to return it its a restock fee, the whole thing is a scam and needs to be severely be fixed.",1
2795,App won't open keeps closing 😒,1
2796,I was never able to open app. I kept getting a message to clear cache because the app had a bug.,1
2797,"Slow opening, keeps crashing. I know I have returnable items in my most recent order but the return section is not loading.",1
2798,"Service is great! But the app occasionally will have issues and as of the most recent version it just crashes as soon as you open it. Hopefully they fix it because again, the business is great and I've gotten some amazing pieces for good prices through ThredUp.",3
2799,My app keeps closing saying it has a bug. I updated the app but it didn't fix it. Very frustrating.,2
2800,Sent in a bag of clothes three months ago that never got processed. Don't waste your time here.,1
2801,"App just doesn't work well and the clothes came in such poor condition though wrapped well. ""Minor wear"" should not include an actual HOLE in the crotch area to the point I can't wear the product. The app itself looks pretty but can't handle basic searches (it just crashes) and a lot of links are broken. Such a shame, the concept is one I would happily support.",2
2802,Didn't open on my phone,1
2803,After the last update yesterday I cannot even open the app. There's a bug in it apparently auto closes/crashes. Needs fixing.,1
2804,App won't launch even after reinstalling 2x,1
2805,"Just installed. Tried opening the app to check it out.... it crashes before it even loads? It said I had to clear the ThredUP cache (even though I'd never used it before in my life?). Cleared the cache cause ""what the hell"". Still crashed. Said F this and unistalled 🤣 I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra phone and just had a system update done today. Sorry but I think you guys are having serious bug issues. I tried but couldn't even get the chance to get to know you",1
2806,Cannot open after latest update.,1
2807,"Absolutely love this app, I love the clothes and the prices. Customer service is great also. Wouldn't change a thing!",5
2808,"Love the app, but the bugs and crashes have been horrid lately, and after the latest update it no longer works at all, even after uninstalling and reinstalling.",3
2809,"Whatever they did this update, it won't open now.",1
2810,The app keeps crashing. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still crashing,2
2811,This update will not let into the app at all and I am very disappointed at this conundrum. How are you going to fix this problem I have credit.,5
2812,Just downloaded the app. Crashes immediately on opening. Worthless.,1
2813,Love it! I am a frequent thredup shopper. Love the app - so easy to use. You can create wish lists. I also love the clothes offered here.,5
2814,"I got played for my clean out kit, I didn't make a sale on my sexy shoes or got the credit for the amount of clothing I sent to thread-up, I'm assuming my big party pumps were pitched when I should have made 80 dollars for selling them. I'm gravely disappointed in the time I had to wait for my kids to be processed and then none of my stuff sold I am so offended I feel like I should have made at least 150 bucks off of stuff I gave to thredup. To be honest it's just not fair.",2
2815,Great app makes life very easy when all i have to do is pack a box they send me the label they also out every thing thru a 12 point inspection great work thredup 5 stars,5
2816,Love buying from ThredUP! Great quality used clothes and AMAZING prices!!!!,5
2817,I tried thredup just to get rid of and possibly make a little money on clothes I didn't want anymore but they still haven't processed my items and they were received in July and it is now November.,1
2818,"I love ThredUp, but the latest update to the app needs some troubleshooting. If you click on an item and try to go back, it doesn't take you back to where you were in the search. Instead, it starts you at the beginning and you have to scroll down to where you left off. It also crashes much more now than before.",4
2819,Can't even open the app. I get an error immediately upon opening. What good is an app if you can't even open it?,1
2820,Lots of great bargains! Wish there was more detail on items but great if you know what you want,4
2821,"Love this app, I'm not very good at putting an outfit together but this app has an option that helps you ""thrift a look"" love it. Very helpful",5
2822,There is nothing for men. Not cool,1
2823,"Recently, the app has become really irritating to use and this is a comment from a Thread up superstar user (I've bought a lot of stuff here). The search filters for things like 'button ups' and 'sleeve length' under Tops no longer work. As the filters don't work, the site is practically useless to me as I don't have the time or inclination to look at everything which is what I feel like the site is trying to force me to do now. I just shop elsewhere - I used to consider this site 5 star.",2
2824,"Do NOT use their 'service' until they get their act together. They are running AT LEAST 5 months behind to sell your items. And if you are buying, know the consignor gets NEXT TO NOTHING. Shop local, sell local.",1
2825,"My app used to work great. However after recent updates, several things broke. Now if I go into a piece of clothing to look at the details, when I back out, it takes me all the way back to the top of my search. Very frustrating. Also when filtering, it tells me 0 or -1 available but there are lots. Lastly from the main page if I choose one of your sale links, it often comes up blank.",4
2826,Where is my sale? It's been 3 months and no sign of processing my sales. What's going on?,1
2827,"I love thredUP. I have been able to clean up space in my home, and make money. I feel like it's the ""set it and forget"" way of letting clothes go. Knowing the clothes either get sold or donated is a great and I'm okay with whatever outcome happens. However, if I can make some cash without doing any of the sales, that makes my life way better.",5
2828,"SuperStar buyer on ThredUp and 90% satisfied my purchases..wld have continued to spend hundreds a yr with them. NOT NOW! A buyer USE to be able to sort through offerings to find style, sleeve length, material, color etc, but no more. You go to those options and THEY'RE GRAYED OUT! This forces you to go through thousands of offerings of no interest. I thought it might just my app gone wonky so uninstalled and reinstalled TWICE! It's not. Why they thing this is good I've no idea, but I'm gone",1
2829,I decided to try this out. Thought it may be like Posh. Nope! I placed my order on 9/5/22. Estimated arrival was 9/13/22. It is now 9/20/22 and no package. Plus they give me the option to track the package but it can not tell me where it is. This is a bogus app and I will not be using it again!,1
2830,"Edit: Dropped another star because I can't edit my item prices, and one of my items is incorrectly listed as kids. Dropped a star because I currently can't view my returns. Overall great service, excellent if you are browsing or looking specific. 5 star until they upped restocking fees. Be prepared to pay $2 per item returned, plus cost of return shipping if you don't want store credit. The app works well overall; would be nice to not close out with the back button. Wish they carried men's too.",2
2831,"For the past week I haven't been able to filter anything other than size, color and category. I want to narrow my search further down to my warehouse and style. I wasn't able to give you feedback which I would prefer to do because I really like this app.",1
2832,This is my first time on that y'all have some nice stuff and nice prices I'm going to get back on there and order something else thank you Kimberly Johnson Baltimore,5
2833,"Unable to filter categories, all greyed out for 4 days.",2
2834,It has been 8 days and they still have not shipped my order,1
2835,"The app has glitches, when shopping and you open an item to inspect it, then when you go back to the list it starts you at the top again instead of returning to where you left off. When checking out, the redeem rewards step, (I have plenty) but it doesn't let me use them, when I click to go to rewards to redeem it only shows a screen telling me to use my points before they expire and doesn't give any option to use any.",4
2836,These people stole my clothes!! I sent a clean out kit and now they refuse to respond to my inquiries!! THIEVES!!!!,1
2837,Overall good shopping experience.,5
2838,Half of the options don't work on the app and I end up having to use their website. It takes the saved items take 5 minutes to load and only shows a small portion when it finally does load. Auto-buy never works on the app and it won't let me use my rewards.,1
2839,I'm totally addicted. Love it!,5
2840,"Purchases, good! Sales, not so good.",3
2841,I LOVE this app.,5
2842,Always satisfied!,5
2843,Love it! Easy to use and access to great clothes at affordable prices!,5
2844,"Scam Made account to see if they had men's clothes (which they don't, only ""boys"") and proceeded to try to log out, and it redirects you to a website then doesnt log you out. Good luck. Sus AF.",1
2845,"Great app! Only problem I have is that when you go back to browse after looking at an item, you have to start from the beginning again.",4
2846,Everything is great besides the taxes and shipping at the end.,5
2847,"Update: They changed the photo when you click an item it is just as small as the original thumbnail view. This is awful! More crashes and errors than there used to be. Easy to sort, easy to order. LOVE Thredup! The clothing options are amazing and they have every size, style, and price point. Returns are easy. I'm so impressed with every order. Highly recommended!",3
2848,"I paid for a Patricia Nash purse with my debit card which had my correct address on the card. I did not specify that my shipping address was different than my billing address. Normally if the address is different from billing then I would have told them when I tracked the package I saw that it was going ,2 old address from years ago & different debit card. I attempted to stop delivery before delivered thru email but they never replied and still have no response from what they call (a chat)!",1
2849,Best shopping experience ever,5
2850,Use 2 be great now horrible!,1
2851,"OK app but it crashes frequently and has a very frustrating search filter that often does not work (heel hight on shoes filter seems to be entirely broken for example, and if you click too many filters at once the search fails and/or freezes you have to entirely back out)",3
2852,Very fast delivery. Good quality clothes,4
2853,The app is good it's just that you can't see the bottom of the shoes to see the condition of the soles and you can't see like the insides of the purses or anything it's not designed for like rain boots or anything like that you have to literally type the beach brand sometimes other than that it's a really good app. There's no phone number to get ahold of them and they still haven't given me a tracking number! I'm wondering when they'll ever get kits so that I can ship stuff in. update this,1
2854,i always find great finds on thredup!! New wardrobe every season! Works for me.Thank you.,5
2855,Love this app,5
2856,The clothing I have purchased has always been clean and in excellent condition!,5
2857,I've lost over 125 pounds. I was buying clothes and shoes here once a month until August. I'm buying Christmas gifts instead. Some here some not .. your prices are so much better especially for name brand jeans and interview Clothes!!!,5
2858,Do not send your stuff to them! It's been 7 months since I've sent my clean out bag and they still haven't even processed it. The clothes sent won't even be in season by the time they are up on the site.,1
2859,Great app,5
2860,I love ThredUp. It's my secret to dressing well.,5
2861,I love you so much because if you catch it at the right time they have the best sales on designer clothes and half the time I can get clothes with tags still on them brand new for dirt cheap and they're great,5
2862,I really liked shopping here but i sent a clean out bag to try to make some money and they said that none of my stuff qualified even though i checked every piece to make sure they would accept it before i sent the bag out & I know I saw clothes they sold that were not as nice as the ones i sent. Then they wouldnt return the clothes to me even though i opted to have any items they couldnt sell returned to me. I have no idea what happened but they lost a good cust.,3
2863,Love all the unique clothing I can find on this app!!,4
2864,I love the clothes and the quality of them.,5
2865,So easy to use!,5
2866,My favorite app for buying clothes!!,5
2867,Takes you forever to get to their customer service. Tried changing the address of an order and their app gave lies that it would be sent to the correct address. It was delivered at the wrong address and their solution is to wait 10 days.,1
2868,When I created an account it wouldn't let me order a clean out kit because it showed that I already did even though I didn't. I tried to open the customer service chat and it wouldn't work. I'm not gonna waste my time on an app that barely works to also have to wait up to 8 weeks for my items to be processed if I were even able to get a kit anyway for only a small commission.,1
2869,Love everything about thredUP!! And the app is great. 👍🏻😃,5
2870,The worst app They never answer your question I sent a full bag with nice items and until today nothin!! Bad experience,1
2871,This app is trash. Constantly just shuts down. There are no new update to fix this issue. It's been like this for over 6 months. I have an Android get it together. Never buying again.,1
2872,"I absolutely love Thredup! I recommend it to everyone, it's my favorite way to shop online! However, I had to remove a star because the app is extremely glitchy. I thought for a while that it was my phone but I have a new phone and it is just as bad.",4
2873,"Good in the beginning, lousy in the end. Must be under new management.",1
2874,When trying to cancel an order this company rushed to mark it as shipped. I now have to wait for this item to arrive; then send it back before I can start the process of getting my money back!,1
2875,"ThredUp used to be great but I have had issues with the last several orders and/or returns. Items are not the right size, as described, the quality has been poor, even when described as ""excellent"". Returned items ever get credited back. Very disappointed",2
2876,"Can not retrieve or see account information such as, can not see returns, can not see when clean out items sell... The app is okay for looking and buying but not follow-up.",3
2877,Best clothing app out thete!,5
2878,"They don't seem to monitor their sizes very well. This is the 3rd time I ordered something that turned out to be the wrong ssize. I ordered a 12 for my stepdaughter and turned out to be 12 months. And the return process isn't worth it, especially since I don't have a printer.",1
2879,"My *favorite* store these days, and I'll continue to use this app, but currently, the App is ok. My suggestions/crit 1)Sometimes all my Saved Searches won't load.. just up to 10, when I have at least 20. 2)Wish I could filter my Favorited items(since I have a lot) 3)Wish there were suggested similar brands like there are on the website. 4)The few times I've had to contact customer service (who is always great), I've had to go on a wild goose chase around the app, & just switched to my comp",3
2880,"Easy to buy, great selection. Can't say enough great things about ThredUp in general. Great selection. Always great prices and deals. More deals the more you shop. Inventory is overflowing with goodies.",5
2881,If I could 0 would be the value. I loved this app at 1st but now this place does nothing to help you the customer they keep your bags of clothes to sell for months almost going into the new year before even processing and they all they say is staffing shortage. At this point I want my bag back but again not enough staff to actually offer any services. So tired of doing my own customer service,1
2882,First time to buy jeans on line that really fit. Love it.,5
2883,"There are some serious UX improvements needed. I looove shopping via the app, but between discounts not being attributed correctly to search filters incorrectly producing 0 results, I frequently get frustrated and exit the app. I want to spend money, but the app makes it hard to do so...",3
2884,"While I do really enjoy this app and it's purpose, I do wish that they reviewed clothes a little better before posting them. I've gotten a couple of bad pieces but due to living overseas it's not worth the price to return them. I wish they allowed you to do a refund for items that are not in good enough condition to wear. It would also be nice to have the option to negotiate the price. Some items I see on here are way overpriced for being used. We're all shopping here because we want a bargain.",4
2885,"Edit 2: is been 20 biz days and I'm filing a PayPal dispute to get my money back for a missing item. Edit 1: knocking off a star b/c I just got my order, but it's missing an item. The customer service site says it will take 13 BUSINESS DAYS for them to reply. Super glitchy. Endless 'loading', 'parsing error response failed', and login issues even after uninstalling and reinstalling. 3 stars cuz it's a great way to buy clothes. It has measurements and good filters and prices.",1
2886,I can't get a hold of customer support. It's automated questions that take you in a circle,1
2887,"Easy, quick selling and buying!!",5
2888,Very slow. Freezes alot. But I love all my purchases.,3
2889,"Well, I only had this app installed for about five minutes and it seemed to work well, however, it only took me about five minutes to realize that they do not offer any men's clothing whatsoever, and that's what I was looking for! Probably a great app and great to deal with, but only for ladies and children, not for men.",3
2890,Takes your items sells them for insane prices mailed two huge bags over three months ago show bag recieved that is all tried this back years ago same thing your better off sending ang expecting nothing in return . It's all profit on your end,1
2891,Great second hand clothes at great prices!,5
2892,Love this app!! So many choices!!,5
2893,I love thredup. I have been shopping with them since the beginning. I love everything I get there.,5
2894,Lots of options but some hard to see,4
2895,"Excellent app. I'm convinced! I have bought and sold countless items on Thredup and recommend it to any friend that compliments my outfit. They have to watch themselves, as I've noticed some prices rising lately...",5
2896,"Love to buy 2nd hand, user friendly app, saves your searches and sizes and saves time and money. Easy returns if necessary.",5
2897,"When I tap on a picture to enlarge, the app shuts down and I have to re enter the app. This is time consuming and frustrating. Please fix this bug.",2
2898,"The app layout and filter functions seem to be rather helpful, however I can't know because it's been loading for 15 minutes since I downloaded the app. All I've experienced with this app is loading. So that's all I can review it upon.",1
2899,Could ship a little faster.,5
2900,I love this app but it freezes up and closes itself alot. The recent update makes it so if you go into an item to view- when you go back it scrolls back to the top of the page. Makes it very hard to find anything.,4
2901,Love the prices selection & ease of app. I get alot of ppl saying they like What I'm wearing & when I tell them where I got them. They usually go to site & find stuff they love too.,5
2902,"Absolutely LOVE Thredup! Such an easy to use platform, the rewards are great, you get what you see, and their customer service is outstanding!",5
2903,Its cool and saves money,5
2904,"Love this App!! Great communication from staff and customer service, easy to use, great deals and rewards program. I have successfully sold clothes and bought stuff I love! You can also donate clothes. Best way to find great new stuff at very affordable prices!!",5
2905,Never loads when you open the app. Gets stuck on the thredup logo.,1
2906,This app works very well. I have not run into any glitches. My suggestion would be to take side angles of the clothes and list in the description whether or not it has pockets.,5
2907,"I love the app, the clothes are cute and they come on time. My main problem is it keeps refreshing itself whenever I go back to the app and when I'm browsing. That's SERIOUSLY annoying",5
2908,"Often times the product details do not seem accurate (measurements and fabric). I've also gotten maternity clothes and dry clean only items that were not labeled as such. That said, I have gotten many great items over the years to offset the duds. And can't beat the prices! I keep coming back!",4
2909,Excellent app great clothes great prices,5
2910,I am not able to login with my email. It just continually refreshes.,1
2911,Multiple happy purchases. My wardrobe has never looked so good!,5
2912,Love the prices!,5
2913,"Used to have better prices. Now things are on sale supposedly, but when you click into the sale section it says there's nothing available. I've sent feedback to the app about it several times. Never fixed.",2
2914,Super slow shipping. I paid for an item over 2 weeks ago and still haven't received it yet.,1
2915,"When I click to enlarge the image for viewing, the image doesn't load. I get that spinning circle suggesting that the image is loading but it just hangs there spinning. I've rebooted my phone, deleted all data and cookies, cleared the cache, uninstalled ThredUp, and logged out and in. It's still doing the same thing.",3
2916,ive got so many good clothes from this place!! :),5
2917,"I've not been able to get the Amazon login to work. I've used thredup for years with an Amazon login, but I can't get past the front screen in this app.",2
2918,Was supposed to receive my order 10/21 and still nothing on 10/23. Constant issues with app also. Cant even talk to ANYONE!!! Ridiculous....,2
2919,"I love the app! The garments are measured in a consitent fashion (ha!) And I'm now familiar with the lengths and sizes that work for my body. Also, I love my point rewards!",5
2920,App has a difficult time opening,1
2921,Great place to track down rare Anthropologie clothes.,5
2922,I love the choices available in plus sizes. They have pieces I can't find in my area. And I have gotten designer handbags in colors I normally wouldn't have bought.,5
2923,Absolutely horrible...could not see sales or reclaim my items. Worst experience,1
2924,The app is fine. My biggest complaint with thredup in general is that they don't measure the waist on skirts so I never know if they're going to fit me. Great company otherwise though. Convenient to thrift shop from my phone wherever I am.,4
2925,"Can't cash out, what's the point",2
2926,I love this app & everything about this company.,5
2927,Awesome experience..great shopping great items!,5
2928,"Love this app for great used clothing, especially for my kids.",5
2929,"The overall experience is really amazing! The app works pretty well but has some annoying issues. The biggest issue is that the filters are really annoying to work with...sometimes you go into ""Shoes"" from a notification or saved search, and you can't update the filter to a subcategory like Boots because it doesn't realize you're in Shoes. Some other issues: the My Sizes filter sometimes just doesn't work, shoe sizing can't be set differently for US vs EU.",4
2930,"Easy to use! I use my app almost exclusively for shopping on ThredUp. Customer service is most easily navigated on the main site, but this app is awesome! Updated 10/2022 On the Pixel Pro this app is extremely buggy with incredible failure of search features (rendering ""no clothes meet that search feature"" when the webpage loads hundreds of pages), and major dysfunction in accessing sale item links. I have to toggle between webpage and app to determine what is available and use my rewards.",3
2931,"Hard to process returns. Have attempted to contact support, no reply.",1
2932,"I find this to be the least overwhelming way to shop for second-hand clothes. The actual process of receiving items can sometimes be a bit slow so I wouldn't shop for anything that I need last minute but, other than that, I love using this. The app can be have issues every now and then but it always seems to be resolved pretty quickly.",5
2933,Don't know how to use my points At times would like to talk to someone How do I send back returns with no paperwork.,3
2934,Love this concept so much! Especially the fact that you can do returns on second hand clothing! So rare!,5
2935,"Likes appear and disappear at random, the same search provides different results on the app versus desktop. Plus the whole point is to sell clothes and it's been months since they've accepted anything from sellers!!",2
2936,"Love shopping online with ThredUp! The quality of second hand clothing they have is the best! Many items are new or barely used. I am addicted to their site. The pictures they supply allow me to view closely the condition of each item. Everyone should shop with them. You'll be glad you did. When the boxes arrive so nicely packed with pretty tissue paper and clothing folded so nicely, you will appreciate the time and effort they take. Check them out. Happy shopping!",5
2937,"As of 10/19/22 - Sent in bags back in June, still they haven't been able to process the bags. That's double what they state on their site. We understand they are receiving alot of bags. However, then open the ability to receive more bags. Waiting 16 weeks and not having ability to get more bags. Seriously.",2
2938,No men's section. Kinda disappointed,1
2939,Crashes so much,2
2940,Love shopping here!,4
2941,"❤ it , find goodies daily.",5
2942,I can't get the code for my Birthday month because it's too far down on the screen and it won't let you scroll down. Emailed them days ago and no response. They have no problem taking my $ though! I can get it brand new at Amazon for what they sell at. Deleting this app!,1
2943,"What experience is there to write about. You send in your clothes and they're lost into the abyss. No check, no updates in 4 months. Nothing. What a waste of my time",1
2944,So many issues. I couldn't get my money. Chat is never available. No customer support. Just the company and this app need serious work,1
2945,"I ordered 5 pairs of boot cut jeans and none of them were right. Tried to get a hold of customer service and haven't heard from them. I ordered gap womens jeans specifically looking for boots. Gap labels all their styles, with the size and straight, boot, ext. When I received the order they were not 👢cut,checked and the description from their website was all either bootcut or flare. I sent a picture with showing that all labels say skinny or straight. Have not heat from CS about the return",1
2946,Easy to use and navigate.,5
2947,They have really cute things in great condition but their shipping and customer service sucks! I have waited since the beginning of the month for a single dress while stuff I ordered later was already received! My package has been lost between UPS & the Post office being sent back and forth there but never coming to me! I try to chat with someone on the app but it doesnt work and there is no number to speak to a human! I want my order or refund NOW!,2
2948,"They get you to ""bundle"" your order and then it takes really long to receive! I ordered on 10/3 & my package is still sitting waiting for one more item. Not happy with this bundle thing!!!!! Updated. thredUP has reached out to me regarding the issue I have with the order time frame. I am happy they are at least addressing my issue",4
2949,"Love my purchases, delivery is usually excellent.",5
2950,"I sent a clean out into thredup last spring. They said processing was slow and it would be august before they could process. Since august, I've been pushed out another months, now until november. I do not recommend.",1
2951,"I love shopping on thredup (clearly lol), but the app is sooo inconsistent. I've had to reinstall it several times for a variety of reasons: extremely slow loading, freezing, inability to add saved payment/check out issues. This is especially frustrating during 1 hour flash sales.",2
2952,"ThredUp is a dream come true. So far I have ordered the greatest hauls of not only clothing, but accessories & shoes. Their prices r amazing, the choices r astounding, from no name brand pieces to designer fare. The interface is super user friendly, & they have awesome rewards w/ their point system. I can't recommend them enough!",5
2953,Very easy app to use,5
2954,Love shopping at Thed up!,5
2955,Always satisfied with purchased products.,5
2956,Like the clothing and fast shipping. I've never been unhappy.,5
2957,Great prices and service,5
2958,Great way to easily check on saved searches or for new clothes!,4
2959,Ordered clean out bags three times. FedEx page opens up then says the number that thredup created doesn't even exist.,1
2960,Sensational,5
2961,Great deals,5
2962,Great I love it here service great,5
2963,"Tends to load slowly. ""Favorites"" will show up as unavailable, but then I find the same item again. Wish there was better/more thorough sorting of patterns.",3
2964,Great app.,5
2965,"Always had great experience finding great deals! And I've been with this from their beginning. Not the best to sell with (low pay out if you don't care much, but freed from all things associated with selling 2nd hand online) certainly good for buying!",5
2966,"The app is sometimey. Sometimes I can't get in, sometimes I can't get to my cart, sometimes I can't view my favorited items. I love the items I have purchased but the app leaves a lot to be desired.",3
2967,love shopping here!,5
2968,"I love the prices. I just ordered a Kate Spade purse. I will know when I receive it. If it's good,then I will order a lot more items. So far I love this app. Thanks.",5

2970,Love ThredUp! Great deals and a great way to help the earth.,5
2971,Return instructions ??,1
2972,Wire Fraud - Price increase at check out Unable to cancel before shipping No phone support Shipping random items Email disregards cancelation,1
2973,I love this app it's easy and if u change ur mind on a order u can cancel no problem and they always ship fast and on time,5
2974,So far behind. Had bag for 3 months & not even processed yet.,2
2975,Love this app ~ Really cute clothes and prices are amazing !!!,5
2976,Very hard to get customer service. Very hard to return something that does not fit.,1
2977,Excellent services,5
2978,"Handy app for shopping, but lately my 4 saved searches never load, which is frustrating since that's all I want to look at.",3
2979,"Updated 10.12.22: still freezes up and takes a long time to open sometimes, but overall functional and enjoyable to use. There should be a way to see which items you've purchased have been returned. The filtering is pretty good and mostly accurate. I wish the photos of the items could be a little higher quality so you can see details and material condition better. Also, having mannequins with minimalist body features (i.e. no arms) makes it hard to know what the clothing will look like on you.",4
2980,Easy to navigate site. Great prices,5
2981,This version has been been failing for some time Very difficult to navigate Lots of glitches.,1
2982,"STILL love thredUp and have for years! I am so grateful for and wear my fab finds continually!!! LOVE thredUP!!!

2985,Favorite place to shop! App is easy to use.,5
2986,Very Happy with my purchases.,5
2987,Easy to shop clothes are well boxed to ship youre clothes.,5
2988,The qpp messes up and wont let me change to girls from women sizes and it would be awesome if you could search soecifics like super corpped or something along those lines,4
2989,I like the app but it can be glitchy at times. It would make things easier to search by filtering out specific brands you don't want to see and final sale items.,4
2990,Sometimes kicks me out for nothing and loading takes Sometimes long,4
2991,"Love your site use it all the time. Great quality, easy returns. What's not to love?",5
2992,"I've also had problems with quality and things falling apart. Then when I send in 3 pairs of lucky brand and true religion pants non of them were accepted and they were brand new. Also n my Samsung s9 I keep getting notifications for saved searches, I click ""stop notifications"" on the notification and they still happen. I'm about ready to go in and unsave these search brands just get the notifications to stop.",3

Give me the money you owe me already. How is it my fault or problem that now you received more orders and can't pay on time what your email stated. Zero clue as to why it was important for the clothes to be sold in the first place. Someone call or email me reaching out to your customer service chat sucks",1
2994,"Was a ,5 star but now keeps crashing so have to login from web. Annoying! thredup is great though-lots of new with tags, good quality at a decent price. Wish the sizing was more accurate",3
2995,literally no options for men...,1
2996,Easy to use. Everything comes just like its pictured.,5
2997,"I love the convenience Clothes are sometimes not measured correctly. Waist size on skirts would sell more. Better pics of shoes ,(more views) would be nice. I am waiting for refunds over $250.00. package received by your Ga. Outlet. I will continue to use your service in 2023 if I get my refund deposited on bank in next week or so.",4
2998,It's so nice to thrift shop without having to go into a stinky second hand store!,5
2999,My favorite shopping app!!,5
3000,"I guess this app isn't ment for ""men"" only gives you the options"" women, girls and boys while boys"" boys option being toddlers clothing, but no Men option.",1
3001,Love this app!!,5
3002,So far the best of the online second shops. Buying and selling are very easy.,5
3003,Love their prices and the clothing is so cute and in great shape. Purse's are fabulous and clean. Thank you for all you guys do....,5
3004,"EDIT- I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EMAILED BACK AND FORTH 5 TIMES AND THEY DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP ME. ALL THEY DID WAS ASK A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS THAT I ALREADY ANSWERED...This app isn't working. I've had thredup for years and spent tons of money and now all of the sudden it won't load. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and everything is up to date, my wifi works great so this is 100% on their end.",1
3005,"I've ordered from here so many times! It helps when there are promo codes or sales and whenever I've had a problem, which is rare, customer service has always been so helpful!",5
3006,"Obsessed with this app!!! My closet is packed with top of the line, name brand, trending fits. The best part is that I probably paid a quarter of the retail value. I used to think 2nd hand meant worn out, old, and out of style.... I couldn't have been more wrong. With prices this low on name brands that I love, I don't see myself going to the mall anytime soon. This is the ONLY way to shop if you're on a budget, but don't want to dress like it. Lol.",5
3007,Keeps crashing when I'm trying to look through favorite items can't shop,3
3008,What is this sexism? No men?,1
3009,Ordered clothes for myself and both my kids. The items arrived surprisingly quick and I was so happy with everything I ordered! Each piece was in excellent condition and couldn't be happier! Thank you ThreadUP!,5
3010,Terrible!!!,1
3011,"Great but wish alerts would take me to item. Way better service and selection than other online clothes items. The sudden stops to the app are frustrating too. If I enlarge a picture of an item, it will close the app.",4
3012,I love this app. Excellent place to shop for new and used. Fast shipping,5
3013,"Looking at an item when I'm scrolling always brings me to the top of the list/beginning, not where I left off...Awful",1
3014,Love it! 💖 The best selection and prices! Amazing customer service also!,5
3015,Great choice of clothing. I just love this app. I haven't bought 1 thing I didn't like. Picture is true to form. Just measure and choose correct size for each individual piece. All name brands fit different.,5
3016,The items I've received are good quality. The shipping time is decent and the returns are easy. Even easier now that it's free and the return period has been extended.,5
3017,Easy to search for brands and sizes!,5
3018,"Good shopping, app is a little glitchy",3
3019,Great!,5
3020,Glad to see an App for this!,4
3021,It keeps crashing but other than that I really like thredUP,4
3022,All items are very good great deals thank you,5
3023,Excellent!,5
3024,Only suggestion I have is Mens clothing to be added! Great way to get quality name brand at affordable pricing.,5
3025,Not a shopper fan,3
3026,Love it,5
3027,"I love, love, love shopping on thredUp. I've gotten some amazing high-quality, name brand items in excellent condition. Some with the tags on. This is the first place I look when I need anything. And it's the most sustainable way to shop.",5
3028,Never opens anymore on my Galaxy S225G. So I buy online.,1
3029,Love the quality of the product,5
3030,I put an order in on August 1st 2022 and I still have not received it on September 28th 2022. I have emailed the company three times asking where my order is with no response. I am also trying to cash out on my account and their website is not working and I've tried it four times now. I'm going to have to call my credit card company and report them as a fraudulent company.,1
3031,Sent in a clean out bag in June. They received it the beginning of July and as of the end of September they still have not processed the bag.,1
3032,"I would give this app a good review because I love Thred up, I love using their website and I love using every service they provide! I sell on Thred up and I buy on Thred up! However, just save yourself the frustrating trouble and use the website instead because you can't even use the damn app 😒 it literally closes everytime you try to do ANYTHING ON IT! You can't do anything without it closing and then it takes forever for it to open back up and it's just not even worth it to use the app",1
3033,"Basically works,but a lot of glitches & the back button doesn't always work.*Dropped this down to 3 because I didn't receive all of my last order. They split it into two boxes, one was fine the other not.*Down to 1 star, they no longer have customer service. You get an email... it takes 10 days. :-( *It's been 10 days, still no response from ThredUp.",1
3034,Great site! Easy to use. Search options could be better. But overall a great app.,5
3035,"I've spent too much money on this app, but the app is easy to use. My only complaint is that it's easy to accidentally add something to your cart.",4
3036,Great prices and discounts,5
3037,Never disappointed! Every piece is as described and always arrives in a timely fashion! The prices are fair and thredUP has amazing finds!,5
3038,Terrible customer service- lost my entire bag! No help!!!,1
3039,"Do your research before you buy! Estimated retail price is just that, estimated. Found a pair of shoes I liked on thredup for 26.99 with estimated retail price 76. Looked them up online and Macy's sells them for 59.50 full price and they were discounted to 24.99 for same exact shoes. Found the same thing with their H&M jeans. So basically research all the iteams. Just because it looks like a good deal doesn't mean it is.",2
3040,"Fantastic finds, great quality, and love their packaging!",5
3041,Don't bother. I sent in a huge bag that they received on 7/20. They said it would be 2 months to process. It's been 2 months and they haven't even STARTED to process it. I'd highly suggest going with a different app.,1
3042,"Love the service and products, but the app had more glitches than expected. The search function can use some updates.",4
3043,"There's still some features that could work better. For instance on their homepage it suggests a sale and to click the button to shop. However, it will then say nothing is available. Also, I tried to use my reward points but the sale was a better deal. I went with a greater discount, but now it shows I've used my reward points when I haven't.",2
3044,"Edited: The idea of this site is great and it is fairly easy to navigate the app. I'm very dissatisfied with the shipping. It is slow but worse than that, the delivery date always comes and goes with no order. I'd just appreciate knowing when stuff will arrive, whether that's a couple of weeks or months. Fix the shipping updates issue or find a more reliable shipping method.",3
3045,"Figuring out the sizing was difficult at first, as the sizes listed are usually different from the specific measurements. But I've been able to find lots of great pieces without having to buy new.",4
3046,"THE BEST CLOTHING SITE! PERIOD!!! I left that review way back in 2019 and I need to update it. I would give this app 10 stars if it was possible. I've got a walk-in closet full of clothing I've bought from thredUP and I just placed a new order for more today. They sell quality goods at great prices. I've never, not once, returned anything I've ordered because the discription of everything I've ever bought has been spot on. I 100% recommend this app to all you ladies out there !",5
3047,Expensive name brands at affordable prices on gently used items! Love this app!,5
3048,Just tried the app to get rid of some clothes and can only donate clothes not sell. If I wanted to donate I could do that on my own. Just wasted my time trying this.,1
3049,"Been a user for three years. The search and filter functions have improved over time, though they still need refining, and I'll sometimes see items that are obviously miscategorized(a ""report this item"" feature would be nice) My biggest complaint has always been the rewards system. Because only one reward or sale applies at a time, most reward redeems aren't worth it. Since shipping is $8 (below the free-shipping min), it is better to always choose $10 off the order. I wish they would stack.",3
3050,I absolutely love Thread-Up. The way they display the items makes it super easy to get the right fit. Love seeing those polka dots....... great deals.... for reals.,5
3051,"I usually really love this app, but I've been having issues. I bought 5 pairs of shoes, 3 of them fell apart after a single use. Unfortunately due to shipping delays I missed my return window. Also, the filters are not helpful; you can put on an ""under $10"" filter, and the first listing showed is $13 Now I can't even log in; all is says is there's an issue with the servers and it's been saying that for a week now. When this app works it's great, but it's got issues",3
3052,My first order arrived quickly and looked great. After unpacking I quickly spotted a hole in the BCBG sweater:/ we'll see how the customer service is...,3
3053,POLITE people,5
3054,Your customer support sucks,1
3055,"Basically, I donated my clothes and did not notice the time frame, so once I realized they were not going to sell ( which I doubt many things on here do because they are overpriced in comparison to other thrift stores ) I tried to get my clothes back but they just keep them. I wouldn't have sent them at all if I knew I couldn't get my name brand items back. I don't like the prices",1
3056,"I do love this app for buying second hand. However, I do not recommend using them to resale your stuff. They will rip you off. It is a well organized scam. Your better off doing it yourself on Mercari or OfferUp, trust me. IF it does sale you will get a tiny percent. A joke really.",4
3057,I ordered three times only got my order once and they kept the shipping money! So disappointed I will not ever order again!! Two stars because the app worked and they refunded most of my money but why keep the shipping?? Shady!,2
3058,Simple and easy,5
3059,The site has many new perks for shopping. My personal preferences are saved. There's always new and great selections to choose from. The new shipping options are great! I love shopping Thred Up! New comment:9/22/22: Still not disappointed. Updated options for purchasing great new selections!!!,5
3060,"Easy to browse and sooooo much great inventory. I also like the consignment option. Awesome perks, great prices and it feels good to thrift",5
3061,"Now THREDUP does NOT follow their own ""Return Method of Payment"" policy. Buyer Beware, the clothes are substandard and even damaged when you get them, animal hair or even stained. Returns are difficult to get a full refund, they want to give ""credit"". I'm closing my account after I settle with them. Good luck 👍. They use to be an excellent source for your wardrobe needs.",1
3062,Great app. Easy to navigate.,5
3063,I sent a very large bag of clothes to them months ago and haven't never received one single form of communication from them since. I have messaged multiple times with no response. For all I know they have kept my possessions and have no plan to pay for them or return them to me.,1
3064,"They pay pennies on the dollar, if you can even get them to place your items for sale. I sent a package of clothes to sell, they received it on June 30th, and now in mid September they still are not on the website.",1
3065,"Great for buying but THEY STEAL UR DONATIONS. I sent in clothes more than 2 items... and they only posted for sale 2 of them and the rest are just nonexistent. So i made no money from any of it. At first they were great i made decent money. But they emailed me what i sent in and what they posted for sale, but i sent in more than the 2 items they said i sent it!! Complete bs. Dont donate to them. Donate to ur local church, food pantry or shelter. Sincerely, a thredup shopper and EX seller.",1
3066,Great clothes at a great price!!,5
3067,"Placed my very first order on Thredup and I was so excited to recieve it. I love to shop secondhand, and found some really cute and unique pieces while browsing the app over a few days. Almost a month after purchasing, I had recieved no updates and so I got into contact with customer support only to be told my order has been lost. Not a great experience for my first time shopping on this app and I probably won't ever try to again.",1
3068,Favorite app for all of my online shopping! Love it!,5
3069,"The app itself works great, no issues or bugs to speak of. My problem is with how clean out kits are now handled. Only 30 day listing window for branded items like Gap, they no longer take ""misc brands"" so if you have a boutique store piece chances are you will never see it listed, and designer brands like Prada are a 45 day list window. These selling windows have literally been cut in half from what they originally were. I won't be using them anymore because of these reasons.",2
3070,Very easy to browse items with this App!,5
3071,"After a few months, I'm seeing that sizing measurements aren't available for what I need to fit my clothing, Ex: no waist measurements on dresses. The pictures often hide damaged cloth. I end up returning 60% of what I buy.",2
3072,"It's literally been almost a year, complete waste. Yeah, please don't waste your time, just stay away from them. You'd be lucky to get anything or the item you thought you were getting. You'd be real lucky if you're trying to sell anything, if they even ""get"" your bag. Such a disappointment, such a lie.",1
3073,Love it!,5
3074,"Love/hate relationship. Measurements aren't always accurate. Things have become overpriced. And I just received an order that was wrong. The shoes were supposed to a size 8.5 and they are actually a size 9.5. I know some people have had better luck with this app, so good for you, that makes me happy. But I've decided to end my relationship with thredup.",1
3075,"I love Thredup, but the Android app sucks. It's always crashing, never keeps up with the correct time for the sales and its slow while in use.",1
3076,Decently easy to find the things I was looking for did not have to search very hard for exactly what I wanted.,4
3077,"My returns have been inaccessible, and I am unable to return items that I cannot use. Customer Service has been unresponsive.",1
3078,Ive sold and bought clothes through this app. The process was easy and buying nicer clothes for work is very convenient. Even when I was pregnant finding maternity clothes was great. They also have great deals.,5
3079,Love everything I bought clothes and shoes,5
3080,Love this site! Good quality clothes for fair prices!,5
3081,"Happy to do my small part to reduce clothing waste! I appreciate that I can sort by size, pattern, and color. It makes finding much easier.",5
3082,"Can be glitches, otherwise it's okay",4
3083,"My favorite place to shop! My last purchase was 20 amazing items for $95, free shipping! I have sold clothes here, too!",5
3084,"I have ordered and am sending items to sell soon. It's a great way to ""thriftstore"" shop when I can't actively get anywhere to have the experience I want.",5
3085,Amazing!,5
3086,"This app always runs very smooth, works in every way I want an app to work. Never any problems.",5
3087,"Tried to open the ap, and just stayed on the ""ThredUp"" screen. LOVE ThredUp. Hate the ap.",1
3088,"Shopping is easy, lots of selection, easy to check out. Thank you!!",5
3089,"Easy to use, no ads, lots of great stuff!",5
3090,Takes way too long for bundle to get delivered... handbags are not returnable...but yet I have to wait the full time for payout..,1
3091,"Love ThredUp! It's my favorite place to shop! Clothes get a new life, I help reduce clothing waste, and returning what doesn't fit is easy. Love, love, love!",5
3092,I have sold and purchased on thread up and have never been disappointed. Decent prices for selling and great prices for purchases. Happy Customer.,5
3093,"An easy way to support slow-fashion! Help the environment while also helping my wallet by getting good deals on brands I was buying anyway. I also love scrolling through the app and saving all my favorite clothes, then going through my saves later and buying what I really want. This helps slow you down if you're a compulsive online shopper like me! 10/10",5
3094,It's been months and this app is just as bad as it was before. It freezes constantly and sometimes won't even open. Which sucks because I love buying my clothes from the company.,1
3095,Badl,2
3096,The most horrible company... lost my full clean up bag...and not communicating back unprofessionally Rude .,1
3097,"Easy to use, like that you can set up favorites if you want to keep an eye 
on something. Also automatically filters by your sizes. Nice!",1
3098,"Need more views of items, e.g. side view. Need ability to ask questions about an item.",3
3099,Amazing way to shop and slow down fast fashion!,5
3100,"Hh Hey n b h8cf vCard nzzns,were z z,i, x x",5
3101,The app no longer recognizes requests for notification when an item drops. It takes me 2-3 tries and closing and opening the app to get it to recognize my payment.,3
3102,Great,5
3103,So far...so good...love all my items,5
3104,Good deals annoying app. Hard to search for what you really want because it comes up empty. Only 2 views of the clothes (side view sometimes needed). Clothes are wrinkled. Can't ask specific questions about items like you can in poshmark. After closing a popup it comes back in less than 30 seconds over and over again which makes scrolling annoying. Honestly poshmark is way easier of an app to navigate but you have to pay shipping from every seller as opposed to thredup where its a one time fee.,2
3105,"Some items are a little over priced, but overall the deals are good.",4
3106,An easy way to shop thrift! They do all the sorting and you just get to scroll in comfort!! Love my first order and looking forward to getting my next.,5
3107,Thred up is great. Fun to shop on there site too.,5
3108,I need to use the app more before I say anything negative or positive,3
3109,Poor customer service,1
3110,Contacting customer service is close to impossible. I have waited in the chat system for hours for a response. Nothing. Can't even cancel my order without talking to a customer service rep either. Once this is resolved I will be deleting my account and app.,1
3111,"This app/site is very easy to navigate and filter out what I'm looking for. It also saves sizes for easier browsing. Saving favorites and going back to them is also very convenient when you are ready to order. With there was a bit more info for the items, such as if pants are button or stretch, etc. Checkout was also very easy. Can't wait to get my first order.",5
3112,My only complaint is you can't really search for a specific style of shirt( for example if you were looking for babydoll tops you can't search for them only brands ),1
3113,Good,5
3114,Love being able to have access and buy things I wouldn't normally be able to afford. I like how they put the clothes on the maniquin with different angles and list the measurements.,5
3115,I find the cutest outfits and so many fun items on this website!!,5
3116,Not customer focused. Points you earn expire instead of roll over.,1
3117,I love this app! And I love that they now offer Afterpay!,5
3118,Cannot get enough! Love it!,5
3119,Awesome!,5
3120,"I understand yall are behind, but I sent in kits going on 4 months ago. Still hasn't been processed. Can't reach customer support, only computer responses. I am unsure about anything this company is doing.",2
3121,"The customer service is pathetic. Waiting 5 days for a response is not customer service. Ordered items Aug 25th, paid for immediate shipping. Sept 7th....still no items. No response, no reimbursement, no customer service.",3
3122,"Love app, love the website..only have had great experience will every thing i have purchased Update 9/10/22. Check your bingo cards, they removed 2 stars from mine with no notice which took 4 entries to the drawing from me. I had it 100% and have pic of my card showing those 2 boxes were complete on 8/8/22. And you can't trust their measurements are correct. I ordered a swimsuit cover up in the women's sect. but was a little girl's size. And 3 shorts were not even close to the waist size. PO'd",1
3123,Love thredUP! (:,5
3124,This is an amazing place to thrift! My only wish would be more pictures of the pieces or more thorough descriptions.,4
3125,App is always exiting me out.,2
3126,Love your store with ♻️ recycle results per account,5
3127,"Really enjoy shopping thru this app. Everything is so convenience, except payment process, it always shows error when I place the order :(",4
3128,"Love this app!! Placed my 2nd order today & have had a great experience so far. The app is easy to navigate, I sometimes just scroll through when I'm bored..they have everything from basic essentials to high end items so there's something for everyone. They offer rewards & special deals regularly, which is definitely appreciated. It's my new favorite place to shop!",5
3129,I love this app!!,5
3130,"Have a love hate relationship with ThredUp. The app improved since I first reviewed but has recently started being glitchy again - issues with filters, discounts showing up, and just generally super slow on my Pixel 6 Pro regardless of my connection. I also just had an issue with bundled shipping not working properly which customer service was unable to resolve aside from refunding the shipping cost.",1
3131,"I ordered on 8/27/22, here it is almost 9/6 and they only created a label...lol. I was a loyal customer for over a year, wont be buying again as this is unacceptable. Will be deleting app when my order arrives, if it ever does. What happened to you guys???!! What a shame.",1
3132,Great resource for thrifting. I've found lots of gems.,5
3133,Everything is simple and easy to use even returns. I have nothing but a great time shopping and helping the planet. If you love thtifting is app is for you.,5
3134,"I've used thread up for a couple years and for the most part the app always worked fine. Recently though, I can't use it. My favorites aren't saved, clicking on an item to view does nothing, the filter doesn't seem to filter and sorting resets the filter anyway, app shuts down suddenly and sporadically. It's a bummer for sure when a favorite app goes bad. :/",2
3135,I'm addicted to this app!,5
3136,"Crashes WAY too much! I can never predict when or why it will crash. Sometimes while I'm trying to pay. Other times when I try to zoom on an image, and sometimes for no reason at all. I'll be scrolling along and it just crashes. And this happens EVERY TIME I use the app. I hope these kinks get ironed out.",3
3137,Just love it,5
3138,Easy to find exactly what you are looking for!,5
3139,"I have purchased from thredUP 5 times and have enjoyed purchasing items that I normally would not have purchased brand new due to NEW retail prices and my rural community with limited stores. What I appreciate with thredUP is the measurements provided with MOST items. I have orded over 50 pieces. 1 had a stain, and 5 have not fit. Returns were easy. The rest of my purchases due to measurements by the company provided have fit perfectly and have looked new. I have received many compliments!",5
3140,I absolutely love this store online. I have had great experiences with them.,5
3141,Ridiculously slow to get your order even consolidated and shipped. So far that is my experience and I have had to return everything for one reason or another at a fee. Definitely pay attention to all the details before you order. I'm gonna try the selling experience hopefully that's better.,3
3142,Great way to save $$$ on gently used clothing.,5
3143,Feels so good to get great deals on quality clothing.,5
3144,Easy to us,5
3145,"My order is still processing after one month and a half. Oh, and I was also charged twice. What a rip off!!!",1
3146,Every item I've purchased from Thredup has exceeded expectations. Sizing is always perfect and the clothes are in great condition if not like new. You cannot beat the prices!,5
3147,Love the app love the clothes and value !,5
3148,"I guess only women are allowed to want cheap clothes, because there is no men's section",1
3149,"Made my first order. Got a great deal. Needed some maternity clothes and hopefully what I chose will work for me. Enjoyed the selection. Ordered today, looking forward to my new to me threads. Having measurements made choosing my new clothes far less stressful.",5
3150,Made a order a month ago not yet received,1
3151,I enjoy Thredup,5
3152,I really love it's time for a good,5
3153,It would be a 5 star and was but the App does not let you sign in with Google. I can now not sign into my account on the app,5
3154,I love this app. Thrifting is one of my favorite ways to buy my clothes and the set up and ease of use this app provides makes it great!,5
3155,Great Way To Get Quality Clothing On A Budget!,5
3156,It worked great until one day I tried to open it and it hasn't shown me anything but a green thread up screen since. I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it to see if that would make a difference. It didn't :(,2
3157,"A great way to buy quality used clothes. I usually can't find plus sizes in a regular thrift store, but thredUP has plenty to choose from.",5
3158,There's no option for men's clothing.,1
3159,Great products. Been a customer since 2014. The search does not work correctly. It used to be more precise now it brings up a lot of items that shouldn't be there for that particular search. There used to be a way to find similar items also but that is gone. Bad customer service. There also used to be a way to follow a person's closet of items. But that is also gone. Seems like now you have 2 search longer for what you r looking for and not getting anywhere due to bad results on searches,5
3160,I have been satisfied every time,4
3161,"Too easy to accidently close app. The developers should consider adding a warning about closing before it happens. I look at an article, then back out to the search results, then try to back out to the homepage but the app closes.",4
3162,Love everything about this site,5
3163,I like this app. I find all my nice Victoria's Secret pink items on this app. For reasonable prices.😇😇,5
3164,"I like shopping here, but I've been waiting over 2 weeks for my last order. That's ridiculous. I won't order again from here.",1
3165,"It is impossible to get a hold of customer service. They haven't gotten back to me I'm unable to create a return on a package that was delivered to me. There is a 14 day period to get a return in but when I try getting a hold of someone you're just navigated through an unending loop and never get to speak to anyone. You finally get a chance to send an email but they give themselves four days to respond. Ridiculous. Four items were sized wrong, and I got the wrong pair of shoes. Horrible horrible",1
3166,I love that you now have the measurements of the clothing with the pictures...,5
3167,I always find many things and ThredUP is a site you can trust that you are receiving quality products,5
3168,So easy to use! I love all of their products and the app is very user friendly.,5
3169,I love thredUP. The app crashes sometimes.,4
3170,My experience with ThredUP has been excellent. The clothes are unique and interesting sizes and variety.,5
3171,I loved the desktop site but the app won't let me sign in.,1
3172,Very glitchy after last update.,1
3173,App continually crashes even though it's up to date. It's easier to shop via the browser.,2
3174,Love it,5
3175,Never used it,2
3176,There aren't any men's clothing.,1
3177,Great deals. Easy site to maneuver through,5
3178,This company is an amazing company. Not just because they are helping the world be a better place but because the care they have for their customers also. I had a simple chat about my order for my teenage daughter and the person I spoke to was such a blessing & so kind. Thank you ThredUP for making this hard working momma smile again. 🏵️,5
3179,"I had situation about an order that I never received thru FedEx,and it took some time for it to be corrected....But threadUp finally resolve the problem and I just want to say I really appreciate it,Thank You!☺️",4
3180,"My only complaint is that some of the following isn't flawless, but overall it's a great app.",4
3181,Love thred up....,5
3182,Need men's clothing.,4
3183,"Ever since the August update, I can no longer see my saved searches or make returns from the app.",2
3184,Love this app!,5
3185,The app is easy to use and navigate,5
3186,Customer support reached out. Still half the clothes are not labeled right the tag says a completely different size than what it is. I've gone up in sizes in hopes that the clothes will fit and they still dont,3
3187,Love the variety!!,5
3188,The descriptions aren't always accurate and the shipping time is awful. I still haven't received an order I made and paid for 08/06/2022. It is now 08/25/2022. I feel they could do better.,3
3189,"Thredup has quickly become the only place I buy basics. I've picked up several more unique items as well. Every item I have received has been in great condition. I love being able to return items that don't fit well for a small restocking fee. Overall I think I've saved hundreds of dollars at this point, and I've been able to afford high quality cotton, wool, silk, and cashmere pieces that will last a long time if I take care of them properly.",5
3190,Love the service! But App crashes a lot,4
3191,Sent wrong merchandise and charged me for the more expensive item. They always charge for upgraded shipping and items always come week later than when it would with regular shipping. Items recieved are almist garbage garments and not shoes that were ordered,1
3192,"While the items available are solid, the current version of the app is glitchy and crashes often when trying to look closer at an item.",3
3193,I love the clothes I've bought. Great prices.,5
3194,Great store and app design - but it is very glitchy and shuts down constantly!,3
3195,Simple process and great product pictures and descriptions.,5
3196,"So far, so good! I cleaned out my closet and got more money than I would have at my yard sale. Also, I have some new stuff coming.",5

3198,The app keeps closing out on me in the middle of shopping,2
3199,"Dudes just don't bother with this app; this is another female-focused fashion app. You can buy Women's, Kid's, and baby. No men's section. No easy filters to find explicitly unisex items, for the most part either. Otherwise a decent app for ladies and babies.",2
3200,"The app actually fails to authenticate my login, which is fine on the browser. But you're forced to ""sign up"" as a new customer... Which defeats the opportunity for a returning customer to login. It's only good for new accounts... Can't login with Google, Facebook authentication.",1
3201,Love shopping here,5
3202,Excellent clothing great prices!! We love it!!,5
3203,So glad to have found this site!!,5
3204,Always good product in good shape. Occasional mistakes you may or may not be reimbursed for but overall very happy.,5
3205,Still best online thrift shopping experience! Quick shipping too.,5

3207,Constant harassment with the notifications,1

3209,"Great service and love the layout. The app crashes here and there. It also glitches sometimes. Other than that, it's a great service and love it!",4
3210,"Won't load. I've had this app for a few years and it was fine. Suddenly it stopped working, kept getting stuck, now it won't even load. I've tried everything from clearing data, cache, forcing stop. I've uninstalled then reinstalled. It simply won't open.",1
3211,"I use to really like thredup. But they raised their shipping, and now ships even SLOWER than it was before when shipping was cheaper.",5
3212,"2nd review August 21, 2022 still no filter options in the favorites view which is stupid. There are no recommendations at the bottom anymore when you view an item. It's on the web version but not the app. The only pros, to the app vs the web, is the continuous scrolling (the web you have to go ""next page"" after a limited number of items) & better snapshot info so you don't have to open the item details. 1st review need more filter/sort options, especially in the favorites tab.",3
3213,"This is so much fun! The app works fine for me, and I've been receiving 'new' clothes that are clean and nicely packaged . I love it 😊❤️🌻!!!",5
3214,Love this app & I have placed orders & haven't had any problems at all.,5
3215,This app gets stuck a lot. I have difficulty bouncing from screen to screen. Love thred up and hoping these app issues are addressed soon.,3
3216,"I've placed 3 orders & have been very pleased with items I purchased. Thousands of designer & brand name apparel and shoes. I like that you can choose if you want New w/ Tags, Likw New, Gently Used, etc. Returns are easy. Just ordered & filled a Clean Up Kit to sell clothing I don't wear. We'll see how that goes. App shows the positive environmental impact of purchases.",5
3217,Lots of good deals to be found. The interface can be frustrating to navigate. Would recommend.,4
3218,"Most of the info on my account/kits is unavailable due to error, so not very useful. Also the banner at the top telling me to install the app when I'm literally on the app is pretty weird. It's basically just sending me to the website then? I don't get it.",2
3219,You lose 70 lbs and need to buy a complete new wardrobe. This is the best way. Also being able to sell items helps too. I love buying thrifly:),4
3220,"Love thredup, the app not so much. Frequent crashes, filters don't apply, etc. Items disappear from my cart before times up. I'll look in search, recently removed from cart, favorites, nowhere to be found. Then I check my desktop and there are the shorts in my cart. It's frustrating you can't stack rewards with coupon codes like most retailers. Though I appreciate that points don't expire for a long time. I wish you could filter favorites, and that there were more filter options overall.",3
3221,Love getting credits for clothes that I can use for new items.,5
3222,"I enjoy shopping Thredup. I do have suggestions that would make my experience better. ** Pictures of white clothing needs a contrast color background. I love white but often pass over items due to bad pictures. ** Items are often categorized wrong and sizes are marked wrong. ** I use the styling suggestions often. When i choose the picture, the search is not pulling only the items which are similar, it pulls all similar items not specific enough. Causes lengthy shopping. Thank you",3
3223,Freakin love this app! They always have sales and promo codes to add to your already discounted purchases. Plus everything I've ordered has come complete and ontime and the products are in great condition! Love it!🥰,5

3227,Very happy with my orders the package takes a while to get to you but other than that I have been happy,5
3228,"Thredup is by far by favorite app. They make it easy and fun to be environmentally conscious while placing emphasis on sustainability. The best part however is the easily customizable search engine, which allows you to narrow your search down to exactly what you are looking for. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing their personal style.",5
3229,It's pretty intuitive and I can only imagine how much work it is to set this all up. The only reason I'm doing 4 instead of 5 stars is bc it's laggy and often crashes (and this has been true on both my different phones). But who cares. Love ThredUP enough that I'll put up with it :),4
3230,Occasionally the app will crash.,4
3231,Love love love....Thred Up!!! I spend $100 of dollars with you all every year lol....I feel like almost 90% of what I own has come from Thred Up and I verbally refer people to you all the time. Great Company!,5
3232,Great!,5

3237,Love my new pyrchase,5
3238,Great App. Easy to use. Great merchandise and prices.,5
3239,2021-The best app on my phone by far. I'm completely addicted. Update 8/17/2022: I am still addicted. I love this company so much I purchased 118 shares of stock.,5
3240,"My favorite way to thrift. You can filter results to your sizes so I always find super interesting stuff that's in my size range and never get my hopes up over things that won't fit. And if I don't love something I buy, it's easy to return and restocking fees are small. Plus insane deals, like 80% off sometimes. All around a great app, I recommend it all the time.",5
3241,"I'm addicted! Great clothes, great prices! I love that it shows the measurements of each item, so I can be sure it will fit. I got me mom hooked as well. We love it!",5
3242,I absolutely love Tredup. It's my favorite app.,5
3243,Love It! Still love it 2 years later!!,5
3244,Love this app. It makes thrifting so easy and is fun to use.,5
3245,Difficulties with payment methods and deliveries.,5
3246,"I am rating this app two stars because the app works fine. It's the company. ThreadUp allows you to send a lot in for them to sell. 100% of the time your regular clothing from your closet doesn't sell. If it does then you make 0.x amount of cents and maybe 3.00 dollars based off of the brand. I am unhappy with the lack of real money that sellers make. Don't try to contact them either because customer support is incompetent. One of my ""lots"" also got ""lost"". Would not sell though them again.",2
3247,"Nice brand name clothes at low cost, that cannot be found at a department stores anymore, quality has decline and price gone up at department stores",5
3248,"Needs a lot of work. Anytime you click on a link for an item from an email or third party app, it never goes to the item you clicked on. It takes you to the thredup app homepage. This has been happening for almost a year now. Also, just generally slow and when you switch from this app to another and then go back, it has to restart. You can't just pick up from where you left off. It's been years this app is in some sort of Beta version. It has crashed 10 times today.",1
3249,Returns are Impossible to do,1
3250,"Love the choices and the prices, I had time to browse and check out was great , I fully recommend people to come to this app , it made shopping for me a lot easier cause it really is hard for me to find clothes that fit .",5
3251,"I love the service, but I wish they had a catagory for too and bottom pairing like a two piece",4
3252,Great way to recycle and help the planet!,5
3253,5-15 percent payout on listing prices under 20?!? Are you kidding me? What is wrong with you?,1
3254,Update: I really wish you could filter your saved items. At least by clothing type. I absolutely love the company! There are great pieces available. The only thing is sometimes it's hard to find something specific but fun to browse and happen upon your next favorite piece. I've been trying to only buy second hand clothes this year and so far no one has noticed 😊,4
3255,"User friendly, huge selection, always new items.",5

3259,"I love shopping here. I just got like 6 things- two for my toddler and 4 for me, for 79 dollars, and free shipping. That's like one thing usually! I do wish you could search but more patterns, but other than that it's great!",5

3264,Purchased many great clothes! Wish the search function was better.,3
3265,Terrible app. Thredup is losing sales because this app seldom works.,2
3266,HORRID glitchy app 😡,1
3267,"I like ThredUp app, its easy to navigate. But as another reviewer said and I agree 100% is that the company uses FedEX which sucks and I've lost packages quite a few times, so its a risk shopping here unfortunately. Unless they switch to UPS, I will be rethinking my purchases which have a 50/50 chance of being delivered..",3
3268,"Won't even open. Download a few hours ago, tried reinstalling, power cycling phone, etc. Just stays on the green screen and says there are problems loading the app and to try again (I've tried many times now). No option to troubleshoot or report the error 🤷‍♀️ can't log in or anything.",1
3269,It is a very good experience. I like what they sell and the things that I have purchase has very little ware and is not dirty.,5
3270,Love this app. Love these clothes!!!,5
3271,Amazing shopping app. I love Thredup! There's a huge variety. They offer everything from designer handbags to workout clothes. So easy to shop and make purchases. And they deliver on time and it's packaged beautifully.,5
3272,"Sometimes there are funny glitches like when placing an order but customer service has been pretty responsive and seems to have resolved things when it's actually presented a problem. It's pretty overwhelming to look for anything because of how much they have, and I'd really like more details with more accuracy (material breakdowns, measurements, etc.) to help me (1) find what I'm looking for and (2) avoid returning items. Overall, it's a very useful app even just for window shopping.",4
3273,I love thredup,5
3274,Great products and prices. I highly recommend you give them a try.,4
3275,"I love this app! 10/10. Would recommend! It's so cool being able to save the clothes that I like, and having notifications sent when anything is marked down even further! I haven't made my first order yet. But when I do, it'll be nice knowing that I've benefited the earth.",5
3276,"Great app, great selection, awesome prices!!",5
3277,Ok,5
3278,"So far, so great. Going to send bag of gently used clothing that doesn't fit anymore so another ThredUp client can wear and enjoy!",4
3279,"ThredUP is a great app! It takes thrifting to another level. Very simple and easy to use while being organized. You can tell that there has been much thought and consideration put into the app. From the search to placing an order, its a breeze. No adds, good reward system, no spam notifications and good alerts on items you like (like letting you know when something you saved has gone down in price!). With a wide range of clothing, shoes and accessories for sale, the app is an essential.",5
3280,Love the choices for my size. I get excited when I get my order.,5
3281,Doesn't include men's clothing.,1
3282,Won't let me update,2

3285,"I would like it better if there were a few more filtering options, eg exclude jeggings when I am looking at jeans. And if the service had more garment measurements. It is a bit hard to know if something will fit right when you have the waist measurement but are missing the hip measurement, or in some cases there are no measurements at all just a ""size"" which can vary wildly and even change over time for a given brand. The browsing experience works pretty well.",4
3286,Loved everything i have purchased!!! Found some excellent deals.,5
3287,You have everything but men's stuff,2
3288,Excellent app. Superb search engine. Very intuitive and serving a good cause.,5
3289,I only wish there were more descriptive words in the listing to make it easier to search and if they cancel part of your order I wish they would tell you why. Other than that I'm loving the app and the experience,4
3290,Wonderful.,5
3291,"The app makes shopping so easy! I had been trying to do it on my laptop, and it was always frustrating. Now buying my clothes is fun !",5
3292,The app makes it so easy to help the planet while shopping!,5
3293,"Your app is the worst with trying to chat/send email regarding issues. I am trying to get an update on a return sent back on 7/22/02. All I get with your chat option is waiting for someone to pick up, with no way to select the email option, and I cannot connect to anyone, nor does it state where I am in the queue. I ordered Doncaster pants and received Donna Karan pants. At this point I would like a full refund of the pants and return shipping fees as this wasn't my mistake.",1
3294,Recycling at its best. Plus sell your stuff too!,5
3295,Love love love it,5
3296,Great,4
3297,"Ships quickly, accepts returns.",4
3298,"ThredUp has changed my life. I have rebuilt my entire wardrobe through ThredUp! I'm finally proud of my new-to-me custom looks and it's guilt free because I know I'm participating in sustainability. The value is incredible, the options are endless and I'm totally hooked.",5
3299,"Love this app! Love that I can filter by ""new with tags"" and see measurements of the articles of clothing. Awesome way to thrift!",5
3300,Great deals for my large family. Im saving so much time and money!,5
3301,"What I like about ThredUp is that it's easy to browse categories, filter, etc. and a LOT of new items are added daily. Shipping is slow, averaging around two weeks. When it comes to selling, it can take several months for your items to be received and processed, which makes it hard to gauge what season of clothing to send in. Another problem is that they use FedEx, which is increasingly unreliable (my last ThredUp package was ""misdelivered"" and is now nowhere to be found).",3
3302,Love this app. Wish they would add ways to search favored things better,4
3303,"I have a ton of good things to say about ThredUp, and it certainly has helped me up my fashion game. However, there are some things I would suggest adding: chest size for all shirts, waist size on skirts, transparency clarification, listing the weather type the article is best suited for, and a search option in your ""Saved"" section.",5
3304,"Why I thrift: 1. Less environmental impact. 2. I can afford brands that don't participate in forced labor. 3. Better quality. Why I like ThredUp: So many choices. 2. I can bundle my purchases and often get free shipping, just like new retail sites. 3. I can send in my clothes to sell. In fact I often use the $ I have earned to purchase more clothes!",5
3305,Great shopping experience never left home,5
3306,Good,4
3307,Very happy with my pocket books just one I thought would have been bigger but thats my fault ....I didn't read the measurements.,5
3308,Wonderful way to replenish your closet lessening your carbon footprint!,4
3309,"I adore ThredUp. I find the coolest clothes and the best deals. I love how much money I saved just by becoming a regular shopper on this app. They really have the best selection of brands that fits perfectly with my style, and I'm constantly finding new brands to try. There's really no reason for me to shop anywhere else. I can find everything here at a discount price. When complimented about my outfits, I'm always recommending ThredUp. This is the best online secondhand store. 100%.",5
3310,High class resale store without the high class price! Monthly or weekly specials and earn points on your purchases for extra stuff in app. You're also able to sell your own clothes to them for credit!,5
3311,It's kinda false promotion cause it doesn't say anything about it not having men's clothing that should be a disclaimer,1
3312,Great,5
3313,"Just downloaded the app again today (Aug 7, 2022) but it won't open. I used to have this app and ended uninstalling due to some issues before (2021) but oh boy! Looks like it's not better yet...",2

3323,Ive had good expierince with thredup,4
3324,"The app was not as easy as the website, to begin with. Search criteria could be so much better. I downloaded the app so it would save my info and Favorites. But, for the last several WEEKS, maybe months, it won't load. I tried the usual erase and reload, but same thing, 'trouble connecting to internet '. But m y connection is fine. I recommend the site frequently to friends, BUT NOT THE APP. Maybe if they redo it or announce corrections, otherwise I will just use the site.",1
3325,This app has made shopping easier and is helping the planet by reducing the amount of carbon emissions produced by the fashion industry! This is the best thrifting app out there!,5
3326,"I enjoy the convenience of having multiple brands at your fingertip. I also Found the quality and organization of website makes it maybe a little too convenient 😉 makes you want to shop! Also very well packaged and shipped, it's like a gift eveytime the box is at the front door!",5
3327,Love it. Use it all the time.,5
3328,I believe I received a fake Tignanelloe hand bag...It fell apart on week ONE...A fake plastic covering on the handles peeled off. Bag is in the Garbage....I've learned my lesson....I was scammed. There is no direct way to contact customer support. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,1
3329,"Honestly, your local secondhand store is probably just as good, quality and selection wise. But if you prefer to shop online, you could do worse than ThredUp.",4
3330,I will NEVER order again! Total waste of $55. I had to give the whole order away because NOTHING delivered was as advertised.,1
3331,The best on line thrift store I have used . I will continue to buy from thredUP.😁,5
3332,"Although not perfect, compared to other shopping apps (even Amazon), this one lets you filter and save so much more. Really convenient to use often. As for the rewards points, they are useless. If you elect to use them, they negate any other discounts. It is NEVER beneficial to use rewards points. NEVER.",5
3333,"Somrthings are difficult to use on my phone, but I lo e ThreadUP!",4
3334,"Favorite place to shop!!! I buy as much as I can on thredup. As a Petite/Curvy Woman, the choices are so much better than any store. Thank you thredup!",5
3335,Good app for the most part. Using my rewards is a little clunky (several steps) but I bet that will improve in the future.,4
3336,The app isn't great. It crashes all the time for just simple things.,3
3337,I genuinely love thredup and the best pieces in my wardrobe have come from this app. I wish they still die similar pieces at the bottom of an items description page.,5
3338,"I purchased a coat for my son via ThredUp and it was true to size and the picture. I am beyond pleased with this app and with the seller. Also, it actually arrived faster than I expected. I would give ThredUp 10 stars if I could.",5
3339,Always fun to get new clothes for a good price.,5
3340,"I sent 4, 50 lbs bag of clothes and shoes and there were some nice things in them by the time they went through my bags and all was said and done I made $4.35 I could not belive it they ripped me off big time and don't try to get ahold of anyone through the app cause u can't I was so upset about it I'm just letting them keep the $4.35 they must really need it even tho there used clothes r so expensive! That was my experience",1
3341,",🤪",5
3342,Data hog! Too much Vincent for app to use properly. App needs a complete rework!,3
3343,"I have an addiction with ThredUp! Half if not majority of my wardrobe has been from them. I find the perfect worn in hoodies and t-shirts, and they have some amazing unique pieces. The amount of brands they offer is astonishing. There return policy is also a breeze and the amount goes back on your account even before sending the stuff out! I am so impressed and love thrifting, but my area only has so many stores. ThredUp brings the thrifting experience everywhere I go! Love!",5
3344,Exciting and wonderful waiting with bated breath for my delivery. . VU PS ThredUP is definitely the bulls eye VU 💌💯,5
3345,"I shop here regularly; am pretty happy. But...when a stain/hole is mentioned location on garment not provided. When measurements are omitted there is no way to contact seller or post a question at the garment page; you must contact admin. who answer, but too late. When a favorite is sold the "" find similar"" shows all sizes instead of mine. Search only permits you to pick 1 category. Bust sizes confusing. 26-44"" for Womens size 16. ??? Do I double 26? No Women's 16 is 26"".Hoping for improvements.",4
3346,No section for Men.,1
3347,With the economy like it is its good to know a person can still have nice clothes at affordable prices. thredUp is a great place to start a wardrobe.,5
3348,"I was thrilled with this app initially. Admittedly I have scored some major deals on amazing items. However, the very first item I purchased had to be returned due to sizing issues. ThredUp has had that item for SEVEN WEEKS and still not issued my refund AND will not respond to my inquiries about my return. I can't find a customer service phone number anywhere, only a ""chat"" selection that clearly is automated... no matter how you word your inquiry it just shows that your return is processing.",2
3349,Nice things to choose from. Plenty of items.,5
3350,Awesome I enjoyed everything that I have bought,5
3351,"The clothes are alright, but theyre shipping times are as bad as the pre-internet days. In fact I probably recieved things quicker back then.",1
3352,"Pros: Just bought 5 items valued at $818 For $109. I'm upgrading my closet❤️ Cons: measurements are not consistent. 22- 24-in chest?????? measure from armpit to armpit and then double it. It's frustrating because I don't want to buy something that's not going to fit. Also no measurements on jackets dresses.. UPDATE: was 5 stars now it's 3. Had to return five pairs of jeans listed as bootcut turned out to be straight leg. Their error, no refund- only credit. One pair of jeans were filthy.",3
3353,Flawless and effortless,5
3354,Love love love it,5
3355,"Easy shopping, great discounts, frequent promotional sales, prompt delivery.",5
3356,"I purchase alot of things from this app, until recently they sent me two pairs of shoes that should been donated and a jacket that look like it was forgotten on a heater. I emailed them multiple times and no call back as yet mind you we only have 14 days prior to delivery, these 3 items cost about 80 dollars . I think im gonna check out Shein....",2
3357,Best online shopping app out there. The detailed filters and accurate photos help you determine what you're going to get. I never have a problem with quality this way. It can run slow if you look at items for a while but I just restart it and it's fine.,5
3358,"Great Deals. This thrift app cares about our Mother Earth 🌎 ❤!!! If there was another 5 Stars, they'd be marked too.",5
3359,"Very easy and customizable. You can put in your sizes and mark favorites, that you can still see after items have been bought, so that you know what brands you've liked in the past. You can click on the brand and it instantly gives you a search in that brand in your sizes. And it's all for lower prices!",5
3360,One of the worse customer service chats. Didn't answer any of my questions just kept skating around it with same copy paste answers.,1
3361,Awesome buys !,5
3362,"Service is solid, app is barely passable. As others have noted, there are issues with navigation and controls that often lead to losing your place in a search. Also the app frequently just doesn't load and instead gives the spinning ""load"" wheel of death. Restarting doesn't help; just give up and try again later. All issues are long standing; TU clearly just doesn't care enough about UX to fix the UI or bugs.",3
3363,"Some very good deals, some items over priced.",5
3364,No complaints here!!,5
3365,"I love buying thrift. My experience on ThredUp is mixed. ThredUp is continuously changing their rules, sales, even the layout of their platform, so be mindful of that (return policies, hidden fees). I have received items with stains & holes marked ""Like New"" but I also received an item that was in excellent condition marked ""signs of wear"". The restocking fee is supposed to be waived if the quality isn't as described but I have never been refunded. I didn't contact Customer service.",3
3366,"Usually always find great clothes, some returns. Love the filters for finding my sizes and what I'm looking for. The only thing to watch out for when you return something is, is there is a restocking fee and it varies.",5
3367,"Awesome , thanks!",5
3368,Better to shop here than to sell.,1
3369,The best app for thrifting. I have had no issues. I love everything I've purchased!,5
3370,Great bargains diverse right to your house with no hassle returns. I miss the old reward system that allowed you to waive the $1.99 restock fee for all the clothes in your order.,5
3371,I couldn't even log in I was trying to log in and it wouldn't work. Tried 6 times,1
3372,My FAV!!!,5
3373,Just got it,5
3374,No men's items seems extremely sexist.,1
3375,Didn't care for the quality or the prices of garments I veiwed,3
3376,ThredUp is wonderful and has helped me find exactly what I needed for a way better price! Definitely give it a go!,5
3377,"I shop thread up, they always have good sales, and it helps to support climate. Im a addicted to thread up, I can always find decent clothing on a budget.",5
3378,So fun to shop here!,5
3379,No Men's Apparel?,1
3380,My experience with wish has been a been 4 most of to the time but sometimes I get items that are not the same size as I ordered or like one time I didn't receive and item because it was said the could not find it? This week i was told my package was arriving this Wednesday by FedEx now it's delayed.So I might have to go down a star.K R,4
3381,"Great value, everything I've gotten is in excellent condition.",5
3382,"Fun way to recycle your closet and get fabulous new clothes....however, they lost a bag I sent to them along with another one last year and I could not track it (sent together). In EXCELLENT condition and some never worn. Got one they claim...no effort to help.",5
3383,This app is awesome but not always the easiest to navigate.,5
3384,My fiance loves it. I'm shopping for her.,5
3385,They say it's a thrift store but DEFINITELY NOT thrift store prices I'm good on this app I think I'll stick to my VOA. nice try tho good luck.,1
3386,Great Overall !!!,5
3387,Love this site!!!,5
3388,"The app takes forever to load and its difficult to search by product name or brand without a bunch of irrelevant items. Also, push notifications don't work. It's like random things are hashtagged and again totally irre5to my search. If my saved search is for Ralph Lauren I should not get notifications for Old Navy.",2
3389,"This app refuses to work on my phone. I've installed it and uninstalled it about 5 times and it just will not let me log in, plus it will freeze everything where I can't even ""quit"" the app I have to straight up uninstall it. I like shopping on the site but the app needs a lot of work.",1
3390,Crashes constantly.,1
3391,I could be dumb but is there a mens option? Thats a lil sexist right?,3
3392,I like most of the items I get. One thing I look for in sizing is type of material and Thred Up's measurements to be sure it fits. I have not had a problem so I will recommend.,5
3393,I have loved thred up since it was moms packing their own boxes and sharing!,5
3394,"While I really wish there was a way to sort and catalog favorites, and a section for men's clothing (seriously why no men's???), I absolutely love this app and have ended up buying most of my and my son's clothes from it. Great deals, easy to search, and lots of fun to just browse as well.",5
3395,Easy to use app for a fun thrift site.,4
3396,"I've found some beautiful clothes and very reasonable prices, and the rewards program is quite useful for further discounts and occasional free shipping.",5
3397,Sizes with short or tall are never listed. So you end up getting an entire cart full of short sizes or tall sizes it's never the regular and of course they're going to charge you $2 per each piece that you get to return them even though they never listed whether they were shorts or tall. I would have never purchased them if I knew they were shorts or if they were tall I'm a person of average height this is very annoying.,1
3398,Addicting! But seriously the shipping and handling is ridiculous for used stuff lower the prices on the clothes more.,5
3399,"Great value, easy returns. Love it!",5
3400,At times not all selections load,4
3401,Love this app! Love them ❤️,5
3402,I really enjoy buying clothes from this app. Descriptions and measurements are accurate. I keep getting comments on my new inexpensive clothes!,5
3403,I had some issues logging in. The support team did really well fixing the issue. I love the concept of this app and being able to thrift shop from home.,5
3404,I use to buy from here for years. I sent in a clean out bag a year ago. I followed the rules for cash out. Well they said it was never there and they have no record. It wasvover 20 dollars and now I have sold more and still can't get my money from them. Rip off there's no way they like the clothes enough to keep and I sold over 30 bucks worth and all those ppl refunded. B TO THE S. Your lucky of you get to talk to a human,1
3405,"thredUP is amazing. The prices are shockingly affordable, the clothes are fab, and they are so generous with store credit and sales. Thank you so much 🌼",5
3406,I can't find anything in Men. Please update this app so we can find clothing in the Category of Men,2
3407,I love thredup so much as a company and the app works fabulously. Highly recommend buying secondhand if possible!!,5
3408,I can't delete my account after my identity was stolen... the only new account I made and used was thread up. Please let me delete the account.,1
3409,Addicted! I haven't used any service except to purchase lol but omg. I really hope this is legit cause I just made a couple large back to back in orders for me and my daughter. If all goes well I'll update my review and probably go into debt 🤷😂😂,5
3410,I like them a lot,4
3411,This online thrift is a awesome place. They have the best clothes in the greatest condition. I love it.,5
3412,Good so far,5
3413,Good app,5
3414,App no longer works with Amazon login. Have to use browser instead. Update: tried app again 12/11/21 and 7/20/22 still won't accept Amazon login.,1
3415,"The app doesn't work as well as just going to the website. It also limits some of the search criteria. For example when shopping for pants in the app, I can't select what inseam I prefer, but I can on the web page. Also, I geta lot more errors from the app than the web page. For example, sometime my favorites won't load, add to cart gives an error on occasion, checkout sometimes gives an error, and was unable to process a return through the app so had to go to the web page to complete it.",2
3416,Love this app. Been able to buy hard to find items for myself. Easy transactions.,5
3417,Using threadUp is such an amazing way to save money and the planet at the same time! Shopping on threadUp as opposed to regular shopping has had such a positive impact on the environment and my wallet. It allows me to buy clothes that I couldn't afford at full price. It's very personalized and they have ample options for people of all shapes and sizes. From juniors to plus size they really do have it all! I'm very happy with how my first purchase and I already know I'll return soon.,5
3418,Got a brand name purse new with tags $110.00 for just $22.00 thanks for the great deal!!!!,5
3419,Items are reasonably priced,5
3420,7/20/22 - Edit to original 5 🌟 I can't log in from the app anymore. It keeps saying it can't connect to the server. There's no available updates so I can't access it at all. ********************** Love finding clothes on here,1
3421,Great prices,5
3422,Great products,5
3423,"Really love the idea of being able to buy 2nd-hand from such a large selection of GENTLY used clothing—all online—and I *always* find stuff I like. Their sales are a decent % off and freq., but also often short & segmented; rarely reduces things to a BIG bargain for avg. shopper. The app could be improved, like having the option to select the ""junior,"" ""premium,"" or ""designer"" categories from the search filter menu.",4
3424,"Can't even get logged in. Everytime I put in a log in, it doesn't work.",1
3425,"To put it simply, I have an addiction to ThredUp",5
3426,These are not thrift store prices. I can go shop and get a lot cheaper.,1
3427,Had a little trouble navigating but once I figured it out it was very easy!,5
3428,Love it,5
3429,"I love thredup! Amazing prices and really cool and unique finds. Plus the selection is basically never-ending. The app works very smoothly and I've always had great experiences as a shopper, though I've never sold anything.",5
3430,Great place to get clothes for a fraction of the cost.,5
3431,"Decent selections. The condition description should be taken with a grain of salt. I received a item ""with minor wear and tear"". But there was a strap that was almost completely ripped off (held on by a thread). I will not be as trusting as before! Be mindful when shopping on this app! My other items fit their descriptions.",3
3432,"Excellent choices and descriptions, quick delivery. Love this site!",5
3433,This site is amazing.,5
3434,"Better loading times than using mobile webpage, but has a lot of little bugs. Like filtering by price most results were a dollar or more above my filter. So make sure to keep an eye on the details",3
3435,Awesome website,5
3436,love it! easy to use and great deals!,5
3437,Love this app. Buying used clothes is best for the environment and do I try to only buy from second hand shops. The app does what I need it to do.,5
3438,Great app. Addicting!,4
3439,"App is easy to use. The clothes are great, plus helping keep clothes out of landfills! Win, win, win!!!",5
3440,"I most definitely preuhferred the original ap. The newer version shows everything at once which I find confusing. I really don't like that I can no longer blow up the tiny little pictures to look at details It makes visualizing the clothes just about impossible since I can no longer see, for example, if a print blouse features flowers or bulldogs. On the good side, the new ap is lightening fast and one can immediately see what's happening with one's orders, a problem with the old version.",5
3441,Great app!,5
3442,"The bad: Dont trust the delivery dates. FedEx drops it off at usps so the original date it gives you is for when it will be delivered at usps. Also they charge you restalking fees when you return items. The good: you get name brand clothes cheap. You are reducing waste by thrifting. They have lots of sales so you get things even cheaper. They have a ""new with tags"" category. One thing that would improve the app is if you could filter your saved items by type, price, oldest, etc.",3
3443,"I loveeee thrift shopping, and the deals you can find are truly unbeatable. I am obsessed with this app.",5
3444,"This app has become an addiction, but I love it a lot and will continue using it! 💕",5
3445,"Occasionally locks up with lots of filters added at once, but otherwise app works great. Love Thredup and this makes shopping even easier. Getting notifications of products added to my saved search parameters is awesome!",5
3446,This is a great place to buy almost anything you want. I love it,5
3447,Does Google login ever work?,1
3448,"When shopping, too bad you have to start over when you come back later,( i.e.1000's of handbags to search thru. ) I'v noticed the prices going up which is ridiculous for secondhand. Clean out your closet bag is a major rip-off. Also The items in your cart disappears before the 24 hr period. Prices go up on your cart items. also, sizes are confusing. Chest siizes vary from size to size . A 44in. Chest measurement on XXL differs. Otherwise I love the handbag selections.",2
3449,Great designer clothes for a great price in excellent used condition.,5
3450,Very user friendly,4
3451,The app is very user friendly.,5
3452,Great great selection at great prices.,5
3453,Great app for finding deals on pre-owned items. Some glitches with saved searches not appearing and favorites not displaying properly which makes you have to close and restart the app.,4
3454,"My machandise arrived very quikly, and its easy to contact them",5
3455,I love thredup. It has great pieces that I use for work and the sales are great as well.,5
3456,I can't connect. That's disappointing because I've used thredup in the past and was very pleased. I can't use it anymore and that makes me very sad. 😭,1
3457,"Overall I'm satisfied my ThredUp experience. They have good customer service, and the clothes are very accurately described. My only issue with this app is that the search function and filters aren't as detailed as I'd like. Sometimes a search turns up thousands of items and I get overwhelmed by scrolling through, so end up giving up!",4
3458,Love this app! There is always a deal going,5
3459,App won't load up. I open it and have full bars but it says it can't connect and to retry. I've reinstalled it and it's still not working. I have good wifi connection?,2
3460,"I order 4 things and out of my 4 only 2 were the correct sizes I ordered. When going to my order summary, it shows I had the correct sizes.",1
3461,Can't print return label or reach anyone for help!,1
3462,I love this site. So much. Such a good idea and I'm so glad someone is helping control the material build up us humans create.,5
3463,Dawg the app doesn't even work,1
3464,I love this website....so easy to work with!,5
3465,Love this app 1st time using it was very easy,5
3466,"Don't shop here takes months to get your clothes, there are places in which you can get bargains and get clothes that day. This place has literally gone down the toilet 🚻 😕 Over a month later they still Have not provided my clothes or a refund!",1
3467,Not useful,1
3468,I was in the beginning very pleased with this app I have placed five orders with them I just received my fourth one! Now three out of the five items I am not happy with in their description they were described as minor stain on the inside that is so false it is not a minor stain on the inside there's stains on the outside I would not have purchased these items had I known this I'm now out $85.27 cuz they were final sale this is enough to discourage me from placing any more orders with them,2
3469,Ridiculous return policy. Seriously.. a Restocking fee?. Who does that? Don't waste your money,1
3470,horrible clothes,1
3471,No men's clothes :(,1
3472,Lately their products are in terrible condition. I used to love this company.,1
3473,"Some things are hit or miss until you discover your sizing, but I would say overall I've loved most of the things I've bought. Most things are still in great condition and I get compliments on my clothes that I've gotten all the time!",5
3474,"Love this app!! Easy to use, tons of different styles, returning items was no hassle(some items are not returnable but it's clearly stated in a place you can't miss before ordering), only thing I wish it had but doesn't is men's clothing.",5
3475,"App will not work. Won't allow me to login- gets stuck on the loading page after I click ""login with Google"".",1
3476,"Didn't like the ap. Clothes are not the type I would consider wearing. Was going to delete my Info, but there is no screen for deleting my information.",1
3477,Never used it just looking,5
3478,Wonderful!!!,5
3479,Very happy with all of the clothing and shipping,5
3480,No matter how I try to log in it will not do so. Keeps telling me that they couldn't access any of the choices provided & to try again. So I tried again and still won't let me log in. Sad it won't work 😢,1
3481,"Love the service, hate that the app won't let me sign in. Had to move to pc to use.",3
3482,So this is my updated review I finally got customer service after a week they finally reached out to me after numerous attempts to get someone. I also just received my first item I purchased which were jean shorts and I thought they were lovely until I went to button them and there was no button and I could see where that area had so much wear and tear it on it. I looked at the pic on website and you can clearly see it had no button. I have to now go spend money to have one sewn on. Who inspects,2
3483,A very satisfied new customer! I will most definitely be a new regular,4
3484,"I am DONE with this business! It took FOREVER to get my item, cost me $8.99 shipping, $1.99 restocking fee and ANOTHER $8.99 to ship the return!!! I can buy BRAND NEW items at Marshall's and TJMaxx for less or equivalent and return for free!!! Unhappy customer 😑",1
3485,I wish photos showed wear and tear on items but overall love the site 🤠,5
3486,"I am updating my score to one star Save yourself the frustration. 1st of all they steal your clothing and act like they donate the stuff but then you see your items they refuse to pay u 4, listed for sale. They don't give you any real money for the items they do agree to pay 4. only pays like 6 dollars for something that cost me 100. Plus it took over 3 months to list 6 items out of the 50+ items I mailed.I wanted my stuff back.they won't pay me for the items but I see them listed 4 sale.awful!",1
3487,Fun app.,5
3488,The app can be a little buggy once in a while but I love shopping at ThredUP.,4
3489,"I am a sucker for online shopping. Thread up allows me to show for the styles/brands I want while still fitting in my budget. App interface works great, almost too great for all my impulse buying 😜",5
3490,I haven't been able to sign in for weeks even when I changed my password,2
3491,Been waiting for a response for 2 weeks,2
3492,"I'm giving ThredUp a 3 star review although I didn't actually buy anything, I ordered 2 dresses for a wedding but I planned on returning one which I thought wouldn't be a problem, but after reading their return policy I couldn't fathom spending a restock fee and a processing fee which would amount to half of one of the dresses I ordered and if I needed to return both that price doubles, so sad to say that's why I won't use ThredUp, it's a great idea but not for me for used items",3
3493,👍,5
3494,Amazing prices for amazing clothes!,5
3495,"Love shopping here, but wish they would allow you to use a discount code and redeem your points to pay for your purchase. Unfortunately it's either one or the other, which is disappointing, especially if you enjoy shopping as much he as I do.",4
3496,"Everything I've received from thredup has been exactly the condition described. It takes a bit longer than traditional online shopping but it's entirely worth it. The prices are always affordable and *more importantly* it's a better environmental choice than buying new, especially ""fast fashion"" online clothing. The app works spectacularly, making it the ultimate shopping experience 👌👌",5
3497,"I mailed out my items on 4/15/22 they received it on 4/27/22. It's been over 2 months and it still has not been processed, I sent them a message and they never even answered!",2
3498,"thredUP is great, app is a little spotty.",4
3499,"Selling Services have glitches in App. Everytime I try to view my Cleanout bags in the app I'm prompted to ""get"" the app. Non of my pending sales are viewable, and I'm not sure if because of this error my cash out total is incorrect. This issue occurs on Apple devices as well. Super annoying. Current apps are fully updated.",1
3500,"BUYER BEWARE.. I HAVE NOW RECEIVED NOT 1 BUT 2 PACKAGES THAT HAD BUGS IN THEM. ON TOP OF THE ODD PUNGENT ODOR THE CLOTHES HAVE (EVEN ""NWT"") THEIR CLOTHES/BOXES (BOTH?) ARE INFESTED WITH BUGS.. I AM FURIOUS THIS HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AFTER BEING REASSURED THE 1ST TIME IT WOULDNT HAPPEN AGAIN... DO NOT IF YOU VALUE YOUR MENTAL PEACE & WANT A BUG FREE HOME.. DO NOT BUY FROM THREDUP. DISGUSTING. TOTALLY FOUL & DISGUSTING!",1
3501,You can get BETTER and CHEAPER clothes in a store. This app is a joke.,1
3502,I love thrift deals$$$,5
3503,Love this app so easy,5
3504,I love this app. It's so easy to shop high quality thrift!,5
3505,"I think this has the potential to be a good service. Don't know if maybe it could use a reorganizing of managing and supervision. I am a very picky shopper and research everything. I submitted a few items for sale but was told that they were ineligible for payout, but would be kept anyway instead of returned with other items. These were really nice items. I think buyers deserve a chance to see ALL accepted merchandise. They deserve to decide for themselves if they can appreciate an item.",3
3506,Super!! Choices are always very good every time.,5
3507,Very much I appreciate you it it's my life to live with my pay is to live in the same place as my hardest part they were in a hurry to get rid of me I don't want to offer a military quick and easy part of it I will be there mill in the morning to offer a hurricane in the same spot to clean up all day and then I'll be back to offer you the house and then we can talk about the house and separate o people to offer you some of the same as last time we were together for everyone to live with the sake,5
3508,Better and cheaper to recycle ♻️!!,5
3509,Amazing,5
3510,Ponderous slow and don't touch anything or it will go in the 🛒 cart.,3
3511,"the search and filter functions almost never work, and the update only made the problem worse",2
3512,Great,5
3513,"This is reviewing the app only. My review of ThredUp is below. The app will not open certain pages (Favorites, Account, etc) unless I restart my phone. No other apps do this. ThredUp presents the clothing beautifully. I love the fact that I can save both individual favorites and searches. They give a heads up about a long turn around time, however, my bags were processed within a week of their arrival. They also keep you posted on the progress of your purchases. Thred Up is my new addiction.",3
3514,"i understand they have a lot of clothes to photograph, but sometimes information like measurements are insufficient. you should also look very closely at photos to see the texture of the fabric; it's hard to tell if it's velvety, shiny or otherwise textured",4
3515,Love this app.,5
3516,"Quick, convient, quality thrifting.",5
3517,I really like this app for getting decent 2nd hand clothes at great prices. I love how I can sort in many different ways to narrow a search down. Their customer service was really solid too the one time I needed to use it.,5
3518,Easy to browse and order.,5
3519,Great quality and prices. Feel good shopping.,5
3520,Great way to update your wardrobe and thrift responsibly! Great customer service and easy to send in items or returns.,5
3521,"Easy to use, reliable. Shipments take some time, but they are reliable with estimated arrival time.",5
3522,"I like some of my orders , you can't find them in stores",5
3523,Great for the most part. I wish there were more detailed photos of each piece.,3
3524,Slow process for being a seller . They received my box of items June 6th and it's now almost a month later and they still haven't processed it.,2
3525,"They don't sell Mens clothes just woman, girl, and boy 😐😐😐",1
3526,Wonderful shopping experience with endless volume and variety to select from!,5
3527,"Great ""online thrift"" app. Better than postmark (I still use both) and I take advantage of the frequent sales offers. It's good to build a wishlist, wait for a bargain, then fill a cart while everything is on sale. You can get name-brand products at an amazing price!",5
3528,I can't use my thredup app is keeps saying not connected to internet when I hit my Gmail login. I am and always connected to the internet. Also on my last order I did not get one of my items :(. Other than that this one of my favorite stores. You can find anything but sometimes it's a little spendy for second hand garments.,1
3529,I love the idea but they didn't really have the tipe of close I would wear.,3
3530,Too too slow to load. The worst 😫,1
3531,"At this point about 80% of my closet is Threadup. Easy to shop, easy to return if necessary.",5
3532,VARIETY OF FASHIONS WITH HUGE DISCOUNTED NAME BRANDS.,5
3533,Love it. Only suggestion is to add the waist measurement for skirts.,4
3534,"It can be a little slow to load or glitch on rare occasions, but is a great app. I wish they would have more ways to organize your favorites. Example: separate shoes from clothes or dresses from tops. Great app overall!!!",5
3535,"The app is pretty good, I use it all the time. Thread up is awesome too.",5
3536,I need payment ASAP. It's moving very slowly. I can't take it.,3
3537,Great!,5
3538,Easy to use and great quality,5
3539,I love shopping on ThredUP but the app randomly closes and glitches a lot,4
3540,"I've always had a pleasant experience with threadup. They have such a vast variety of clothing, shows and accessories that I'm 100% sure they have something that will suit whatever need you may have.",5
3541,Various bugs still show up but love the convenience,4
3542,No reasonable customer service,1
3543,I have never had a bad experience with thredUP. I love the options and prices. Great clothes! Thank you! UPDATE Still buying from thredUP. The options are great. Thank you!,5
3544,"Every item is wrinkled, like it came from the trash heap",1
3545,Love it...find good deals and enjoying,5
3546,Great deals!,5
3547,"This app is sexist asf, nothing in men's at all, no shoes, no clothes, no nothing.",1
3548,Love this app. Great stuff cheap and the best part is that it's already been washed so you know it's not gonna shrink!,5
3549,"Constantly lagging and glitching, and conveniently the link to ""contact customer support"" always seems to be broken",1
3550,Great app👍5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I've gotten my shipment early all three times. Love the selection in women's jeans,5
3551,I really like this app. I can get nice name brand clothes at a good price. I can also sell nice clothes that I no longer need.,5
3552,Wonderful shopping experience. Bad customer service.,4
3553,"Everything on ThredUp is really nice.The clothes are nice and clean.I recently purchased two dresses and a wristlet.I have bought stuff before,and again,had no issues with my items.I am on a budget,and this is how I fill up my closet.I will always buy from here.",5
3554,"I end up hating half the things I receive, sizes are out of wack, measurements can't be trusted, and the few pictures we get are unhelpful.",1
3555,Brands you know and love and other brands of classy wear you only imagined for way less.,5
3556,"You just raised your shipping costs from $5.99 to $8.99. Absolutely unbelievable!! Previous 5 stars ""I love this store. I have always shopped second hand and now to be able to shop on-line, fantastic"" but now changing my review to 2 stars. To sell clothing, you request items to be perfect & top brand names when i have seen Walmart brand clothing and i have purchased items that were advertised as 'mistaken as brand new' but were far from it! JUST WRONG",2
3557,No mens clothes,1
3558,When I tried to order it said error and took the stuff out of my car but the next day it charged my card and now it's pending. horrible app don't get it,1
3559,Love,5
3560,Not so happy with Thredup right now I have ordered clean out bags and NEVER RECEIVE THEM !!!! Customer service is not reachable the B.S. with chat or email us never get a reply !!!!!! So maybe this will THUMBS 👎 UNTIL I GET A RESPONSE TO MY PROBLEM,1
3561,Great,5
3562,"Such a frustrating experience! I love thredUP and shop often, but lately the app has (1) taken forever to load (2) loaded saved searches with the wrong parameters somehow??? (3) displayed errors when trying to add an item to my cart, among other things. Tonight I can't shop at all. Really disappointing.",2
3563,"App is fine, a little lacking in information, but overall usable. The company however, is not. Hopefully you never have an issue and need to go to their support for help. They simply won't help you and make it very obvious that they are only interested in making money, not retaining customers.",1
3564,Such a huge selection!! Too may to choose from!!! Great prices great clothes!!,5
3565,"I STILL haven't bought anything! I just get soooo lost looking at all of the clothes, but I love it! I have reccomened threadUP to several friends and I even own several shares of ThreadUP stocks, even got my fiancee on ThreadUP stocks 😁. Now I just need to stop browsing and friggin buy!",5
3566,"Love, ordered multiple times. However I've been trying to get into my account to check my order status and it won't load.",4
3567,"I like the idea, but the app works so poorly. Takes a while to boot up and loads slowly when other apps are working just fine. Just tried to looka t my saved listings, said it had an issue bringing up my account data for that, so I closed and reopened, and still booting up again :(",3
3568,Good,4
3569,I really enjoyed browsing thru the catalog and finding what I wanted .,5
3570,Exceptional ! An amazing site for fashion lovers and I love the idea of recycling gorgeous clothes!,5
3571,WAS HAPPY WITH MY ORDER RECIEVED RIGHT AWAY IN EXCELLENT SHAPE,5
3572,A great way to thrift with their team taking care of all the leg work. I use Poshmark as well but I like that this company gets things done faster when I'm selling.,5
3573,Excellent,5
3574,great selection inexpensive and best of all eco friendly! 10/10 highly recommend,5
3575,Wonderful app!!!,5
3576,"I love thredUp so much! I found a pair of Vince. pants at a store that were on sale for $118 but still didn't want to pay that much. I downloaded thredUp to see if I could find them and I found the exact same pair, with the exact same size! And this pair wasn't $295 or $118, it was $18! Totally will be buying from here more!",5
3577,Absolutely love this app an the layout so easy 2 use never have any problems love thred up,5
3578,I usually find what I'm looking for. The quality of the items I find have always in great condition.,5
3579,Found so e great items. Great price and great for the environment!,5
3580,Good finds at a great price,5
3581,Horribly frustrating experience. Did better with local consignment shop and better customersl service.,1
3582,"Great app, easy to use. Perfect for a few minutes of shopping while waiting for kids, hubby's, etc!",5
3583,I can dress the way I have always wanted to for a pinch of the cost. Love love love ❤️❤️❤️ Recommend highly!,5
3584,I always find something to love 💕,5
3585,"I downloaded the app, it wouldn't open. I deleted it and reinstalled it and it still won't open.",1
3586,Good except technical issues,3
3587,Every woman's dream app shopping,5
3588,AWESOME!!!,5
3589,"This app is awful, takes forever to load. I used to love this company but now they charge so much money for returns, $2 per return which is outrageous and they take forever to ship and do not listen to customers when they complain. I would highly recommend no one buy from them you were just wasting your money",1
3590,"I love the idea of this but they took months to process my bag. I contacted them several times to ask if I could pay to have my whole bag returned but they've never answered. Now all of a sudden they can email me to say my bag is processed, again, AFTER I asked for the whole thing back. I also ordered and it was sent to my old house despite the new address in the system, again no customer service after several tries. I'm never dealing with this again, it's ridiculous.",1
3591,"Unbelievable! I am totally obsessed and have/will tell everybody about ThredUp. There isn't another app out there like it. Easy to navigate, easy to view, easy to make All your purchases, easy to return (if you absolutely have to), friendly, knowledgeable, easy access staff. Weehoo, I'm out of breath! Better rest and shop! Oh, great sales and loyalty points.",5
3592,"Most part very good, sometimes horrible.",4
3593,"Holes, stains, sized wrong, narrow shoes..threw most of what i ordered in garbage",2
3594,It's beautiful and was early,5
3595,Great for shopping used clothing and have great items at good prices,5
3596,SCAMMERS!!!!!!!!!!,1
3597,Needs some updates for search term accuracy. I searched for a youth size 5 and got toddler sizes mixed in.,4
3598,The best secondhand designer clothes app for women! It's honestly addicting. The only downfall this app has is it doesn't offer a men's section. But other than that 110% 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ rating!,5
3599,The app is super glitchy. Constantly shuts down.,3
3600,"Quality of clothing is awesome. Sizes are 99% true. Love this app, and it's savings is a life saver right now",5
3601,Ive been with T-Up for a while and I can say with certainty that they are a top-drawer company supporting a great cause. The selection is vast and the sale prices are exciting. I just purchased a 100% rayon blouse for $11.00! I HIGHLY recommend Thred-Up. See ya there! 😀,5
3602,"Thredup is an amazing resource. They way you can filter and sort items, zoom in closely... all makes your time shopping well worth it! The quality and condition of the items I've received have been wonderful.",5
3603,Soooo many brand options : ),5
3604,App freezes up frequently or kicks you off. When this happens you have to start all over since it does not bring you back to the place you were. This even happens if you are in the middle of a purchase.,2
3605,Great experience even on returns,4
3606,"I've gotten some great deals! many of them ""New WITH TAGS""!!",4
3607,"From my recent experience their version of 'minor signs or wear' is heavily worn, a large amount of piling. I find clothing much better described on Ebay and Mercari and pictures are way better too. Any defects should be shown close up. Not impressed. I liked the free shipping & discounts for first time customers but I won't be returning.",2
3608,This app has great clothes at great prices.,5
3609,"I love this site! Great clothes, great prices. My only complaint is that the items are poorly displayed; haphazardly pulled onto a seamstress' dummy torso, and only have two photos each, one front, one back. No side view, no shot of the item lying flat, etc. It's incredibly difficult to get a good idea of what the item will look like worn because of this. If you fixed this, the app would be the best damn online thrift store in the world.",4
3610,This app is my go to. I no longer shop directly from stores for clothes. The deals are amazing. Today I got 8 blouses for ~$23 with their summer sale!!,5
3611,"Finally decided to check out ThredUp and glad I did!! Had fun finding clothes. And the prices were amazing!! I just ordered 5 things after being on the site for 20 minutes. Plan on ordering more, I just want to wait and see how the whole shipping process goes. And if that goes well, I will be shopping again soon!! Check it out!! It's worth your time :)",5
3612,Not what I thought it was. Thought it was similar to OfferUp. Nope.,1
3613,"Always received my order on time, returned stuff without a problem, I love I am able to donate clothes as well and get a tax write off on top of it, love the clothes designer or not, love this app and I tell anyone order once and you will be hooked! No glitch ever with the app.",4
3614,The design of the app is user friendly and the deals are great! I've found really good deals on brand names.,5
3615,I love these guys my boss introduced me to thredup and now I'm addicted. You find great items for great prices and as long as you put your sizes in it auto shows you item that fit to you. Two thumbs up.,5
3616,Not bad,5
3617,"Works really well, much better than the website",5
3618,Love it,5
3619,"I love the selection and the thrill of a good deal! But thredup recently changed their acceptance criteria for sellers and aren't paying for 100's of common brands like forever 21, mossimo, shein, etc. which I expect will severely impact the great selection of items they have. I've stopped using the app because it continues to crash when trying to view item pictures. And I likely won't be sending in any more items to sell, since I'm not rich and can't afford the few brands they'll pay for.",2
3620,"Huge selection of items to look through, easy enough to navigate. Would be nice to have separate favorite lists- that you can label for either different people, items, etc. Can do with save lists but was unable to with favorite.",5
3621,Great filters on products. Enjoy he favorites section with the distinction of what available and unavailable,5
3622,Love this store! Get great deals !! No issues with the app.,5
3623,I LOVE this site! Finding decent clothes at decent prices is awesome. Shopping online has become my FAVORITE new hobby.,5
3624,"Update: Was 2☆ now 1☆. ThredUp changed the way they ship. Now they send items to 1 warehouse before shipping it to you. It takes 3-4 weeks to get orders when items come from multiple warehouses. Also tracking doesn't always update. I've been waiting a week for my items update so I can return them with other items and avoid paying $8.99 return fee twice. The only way to contact them is email or chat. I reached out 5 days ago and am still waiting as my return window is closing. Lovely, huh?",1
3625,favorite place to thrift online,5
3626,Great quality and great prices! I love ThredUP!! I love the idea of recycling clothes rather than just always buying new.,5
3627,Very easy to use,5
3628,This app is great!,5
3629,Love this app. Very good prices so i dont have to drive across town and have to spend it on gas,5
3630,This is a phenomenal site! The clothing here has almost unlimited inventory and very helpful info on each item. The quality of items is terrific and packed and sent beautifully. The presentation and organization of the many genres of items is unbelievable. It all depends on your ability to make good choices and the fitting info provides good guidelines. I have placed three orders already and am absolutely thrilled with my purchases. Try it you will love it!!!!!,5
3631,I bought bags for Excellent Condition here.But the bags I received are like trash.What should I do with these trashy bags?The bag I bought is one Burberry and three Louis Vuitton bags are really the worst conditions.I am really angry.Is this trash in the Excellent condition in your store? I can't use it because it's dirty . I am very disappointed.,1
3632,"Easy to find, good quality and prices",5
3633,I love the plus size clothes on here. They're brand names. The shoes are adorable 🥰,5
3634,"Don't believe the app reviews like I did. Rather do an internet search ""thread up reviews/complaints"" to discover the truth of their customer ratings. Placed order and given date to be received by 6/17/22 I have been tracking package with updates sent via email. Update as of 6/16 to be delivered 6/17 between 10am and 3:55pm. Today an update came at 2:45pm saying my PKG will now be delivered 6/18 between 10am and 3pm. I live in the U.S. Have an event at 9am tomorrow I had bought my clothing for.",1
3635,Love this app,5
3636,I just really love shopping on here... Probably too much! 🤣,5
3637,I have received many items from Thredup and they are my go too for online thrifting I can only give 3 stars (as much as I like them). Customer Service can be a hit or miss I've had both good and bad experiences and the new reward system is anything but a reward. It's way harder to earn reward points and as quickly as you get points you lose them upon returning items you don't like. Processing things you send in takes FOREVER too.,3
3638,"Frequently items are not described correctly. Shoes are often sized incorrectly or items are in poorer condition, like shirts described as ""excellent"" have holes. Then I still have to pay return shipping for their mistake. This happened at least three times in the last six months. I'm over it and deleting the app. 10/10 would NOT recommend.",1
3639,Easy to use. I like that it saves items recently removed from my cart...in case I change my mind.,5
3640,Love this app lots of amazing items ❤️,5
3641,BEAUTIFUL 😍!!!!!,5
3642,"If you are selling items on this site, expect the slowest service ever!! My box was received on 2/17 and it still will not be processed until 7/3. They can change anything they want whenever they want; prices, processing dates, showing an item unavailible to buy, and aweful customer service. It may take a year for to get pennies on the dollar.",1
3643,Wonderful experience thank you. I love your sales thank you.❤,5
3644,"Love, love, love.,..",5
3645,"Description measurements not accurate. Wish there was a communication tab to ask for correct measurements sizes. Searching size 31 jeans and some measurements say waist is 33, 36, even 39. Rise measurements inaccurate also. A little disappointed when I received my order and items didn't fit.",3
3646,I love the fact if the outfit doesn't fit you can return it for a store credit,5
3647,Have both bought and sold on this site. Love it and highly recommend.,5
3648,"I ordered a size 4 in women's and gott a kiss pair of jeans, the shirt said barley any wear and it looked like it was 4yrs old stretched out!! Omg please be careful ordering very bad experience I won't order anything else",2
3649,"Fairly simple navigation, good product",5
3650,Too expensive. This is supposed to be a second hand app. I find no use for this app anymore.,2
3651,"Cute clothes, great prices!",5
3652,"Thredup used to be great, accurate about condition and decent pricing...now not so much.",2
3653,I will never order through this app again everything in my order does not match with what I received in the mail...not just that but it was their mistake but in order to make it right I have to give more money for restocking fee then wait another 3 weeks for them to correct it plus it takes up to a month just to hear back from them to make it right so I lost 40 bucks cause I will from now on just buy from original seller hollister they r much cheaper and reliable and only 3 days to recieve..,1
3654,"4.5/5, really. I love ThredUp, they are a great company doing great work. Their website is slightly more reliable than the app, though. The app always has a long load time on my phone, sometimes even when it's already open and I'm just switching between it and other apps or my home screen. I've had glitches here and there, mostly with my favorited items, but nothing that heavily impacted me shopping. The problems I've encountered have been mildly annoying at worst.",4
3655,The app wouldn't even open :/,1
3656,"I feel like thredUp has gone down hill. Prices have gone up and algorithms don't make sense. I've been waiting over a week for my items to consolidate, and then I will have to wait for them to ship still. Won't be using anymore once my order arrives.",2
3657,Missing item from order! Tried customer service with no avail couldn't even get an answer from your company. No item yet no refund!,1
3658,"I wish there was a men's consignment option, but love the site overall!",4
3659,Not at all gear toward the male shopper,2
3660,"I love this app, shipping is a bit expensive for how slow it is but with things these days I guess it makes sense.",5
3661,Fabulous,5
3662,"Great search technology. Great items, too.",5
3663,"Love to shop with ThredUp! I do wish there was a free return policy, instead of $1.99 per item return fee.",5
3664,Fastest delivery...world record!!! Ordered on a Thursday and received them very next day! I have told everyone to check this site out. So far I've gotten at least 3 people to check it out.,5
3665,Great app! Helps you buy entlu used clothes with coupons and has very low prices.,5
3666,The filter system is very detailed. I love being able to search for only petite clothing and the brands I like.,4
3667,Always good stuff! Amazing deals!,5
3668,Easy to explore and easy to use. Love the shopping. Great quality items.,5
3669,The finds are incredible and the prices are unbeatable. I feel good about the items I send in and I'm excited for the purchases made.,5
3670,Great way to save.,5
3671,Best thrift store app EVER!!!,5
3672,I keep coming back for more.,5
3673,Awful 😞😞😞,3
3674,Awesome well taken care of clothes,5
3675,Like the selections. Like the ai customer service. Love the sales.,5
3676,"This app used almost 5GB of background cellular data on my phone last month. 😮 I pay per gig, so I spent $50 just having the app on my phone. It also used 34GB of WiFi data. This is ridiculous. I've disabled its ability to use background cell data now, but it seems really irresponsible that the company would have a default with such high usage. No other app comes close. It makes me not want to shop there anymore, knowing I threw away $50 just for them to advertise clothes I might want to me.",1
3677,"Very nice. My ""go to"" site mostly for great denim jeans!",4
3678,"New fees for buying (!?) and 1.99 per item when returning. Bad quality clothes, I almost always discover holes that need to be mended. The eco footprint is mostly marketing nonsense. Shipping takes FOREVER sometimes. App breaks regularly. Updates break my saved searches. Only show some of my saved items with no filtering. No way to filter out materials you might be allergic to. Clothes labeled incorrectly - size, measurements, fit/style - not usually accurate. Pretty sure they're buying reviews",1
3679,Easy to use.,4
3680,"I absolutely love this sight, it makes shopping so much fun and easy! There is no way I could ever look at the amount of clothes that y'all have to offer and that's a great feeling lol thank you for putting this app up!",5
3681,Great experience 👍 I love it,5
3682,Love love love this place,5
3683,"This is my first time ordering and I was excited to receive my items. When the arrived they smelled so bad!!!! Thred up sent dirty clothes that I feel were inaccurately described. One shirt had a terrible stain/smelled, one was not measured accurately, and the pants had flared legs with a picture that showed straight legs. I would return the items but after the cost of return shipping plus restocking fees it's not even worth it. I wouldn't use this app and just go to the store.",1
3684,Great idea for an app! I love it!,5
3685,Saving the earth,5
3686,I can't cash out!,1
3687,"The customer service could be faster. I wanted to buy some items on my account and the algorithm had suspended it. For what, I'm not sure. Anyway, it took a week to get resolved and by then the items I wanted were gone. All and all not a bad app. Getting some live chat representatives during buisness hours, would solve the customer service issue. Once they do something like that, I'll give 5 stars.",4
3688,I always get great deals,5
3689,"I liked it better when you were able to ""see more from this seller"".",4
3690,Excellent,5
3691,"Great way to buy second hand without having to go to the thrift store! Saved searches notify you when there's something that matches your filters (and they say they're working on expanding filters, like sleeve length for dresses). Bundle lets you keep adding to save on shipping. Overall, a great app! Update: Still haven't implemented additional filters 3 years later.",3
3692,Absolutely love this shopping 🛍 website.,5
3693,"I been requesting update on my returns status money, it's been a month, contacted several time via customer support, but I never get an answer.",2
3694,Freezes constantly,1
3695,Love love love,5
3696,"I love ThredUp! Not only am I helping the planet, but getting awesome deals, too!😀",5
3697,good,5
3698,"Bummed, Wish I had read a few reviews before shopping. I love the concept of buying used and helping environment and sending clothes to charity but your return policy is terrible. I am just going to write off my purchases and not shop the app.",1
3699,Love your App!,5
3700,Better than the website,5
3701,Great clothes,5
3702,"Item marked as delivered, never received. 3 days after I reached out, still nothing from Customer service :-( Only able to use one coupon code, no incentive to use credit instead of cashout. Minimal payout.",1
3703,It takes forever to get your order I ordered 2 weeks ago qnd didn't received yet,1
3704,"Returns cost $11, you can't remove your card you just have to delete your account.",1
3705,Favorite way to thrift shop!👜,5
3706,Thredup is my favorite online clothing store to shop it has everything you need and more thanks thredup!,5
3707,Why is there no mens clothes? I was so excited for this app but then I realized it's only women and kids. Is there a plan for mens?,1
3708,Easy to use app love the business!,5
3709,Great app and sote!,4
3710,Love it!,5
3711,"I'm sorry , but at this point I would have to warn anyone who asked about thredup to run ! It's not worth the headache and the worst thing about it is that they don't care . They have the worst customer service of any business I have ever dealt with and they just don't care !!!!",1
3712,"App is good. Filters work well. Easy site to use for consignments and I guess reimbursements are ok. If I see a trend or something classic, this is the first place I look for me.",4
3713,"Works well , useful, sometimes gets picky about wifi so I need to turn the wifi off on my phone due to app confession issues.",4
3714,Missing lowest prices for good clothing,5
3715,"I'm addicted!!! Awesome prices, easy to earn reward points, huge selection, great sales, I love it!",5
3716,If I could give it 0 stars I would. It literally has not worked once for me in viewing/managing sales,1
3717,Great 👍,5
3718,Fun thrifty shoppers best friend.,5
3719,"They just changed the points system in the recent update. I had somewhere around 2500, which would have been redeemabke for free shipping for 5 different purchases . Now my account balance is 300-something (nothing recently expired) and I could get free shipping redeemed maybe twice out of that. Disappointed that they screwed their users like that.",2
3720,Finally clothes I love that I can feel good about buying. Used clothes feel great from the minute I put them on. Thank you,5
3721,"I love it. What a good way to make a positive impact on our environment. We have to hand down our planet to our children, we have to improve every action we have to work on saving it!!",5
3722,Super great. I have no complaints at all. Thank yall!!!!!!,5
3723,Love the app!,5
3724,I really enjoy this shopping experience.,5
3725,"Easy to use. No lines,no hassles and nice stuff for a fraction of new. Plus you are truly recycling and thats really cool too!",5
3726,Thredup is one of my favorite places to shop now...so many beautiful pieces at a huge discount. Thank you for this amazing app!,5
3727,Great improvements!,4
3728,I never received my order and all the app does now is buffer.,2
3729,The clothing on this app is hot garbage. They aren't even trying.,1
3730,So. Many. Things!,5
3731,Great app!,5
3732,Helpful agents. Nice clothes /handbags / shoes size at a great price. 👍,5
3733,"Kind of glitchy, items in my favorite that are already purchased should be removed automatically, sometimes the app crashes unexpectedly.",4
3734,It has good clothes but there are no mens items.,3
3735,"Great avenue for slightly worn clothes I found great buys, including designer ones. You may have to check for when discounts apply. I I have purchased dresses, tops and shoes. Happy with them all.",5
3736,"This app is quite excellent. They have address the issues since my prior review. Really easy to use site, I can find things pretty easy. Love this app. It can be a little glitchy when you are expanding the detail immage of the clothing. I can't pay with Amazon pay through the app. Some of my order and return details don't show up in my account and I have to go to the website directly. Otherwise it works great. It is much easier to scroll through items with the app. Pretty good experience.",5
3737,Economical,5
3738,"Love the clothes, the description, and the points system saves money for you right away, or on the next purchase!",5
3739,"I love shopping Thred Up and the environmental impact, but reporting a problem isn't eas6y. I recently received a dress ilove, but it's missing a belt and I would like the belt or a credit and can find no place to make the complaint. Otherwise I have loved shopping Thred Up. Thank yoi",4
3740,It came late. Next time was better.,3
3741,"best online clothes shopping app! great selection, great deals, great customer service. All around 5* experience!",5
3742,"Every item I have purchased has been clean, folded and packaged neatly and fit me very well. I ❤️ ThreadUp!",5
3743,Excellent service,5
3744,"Excellent selection, Wide range of sizes! One out of ten clothing items have never been used or worn! When special discounts are offered all items in your basket.............. I'm not so pleased with this app any longer! ThredUp PRICES are now astronomically Sky High! Poshmark has just as good merchandise and the prices are affordable! Thread up sucks due to charging prices that are no longer affordable! MONEY MONEY MONEY IS THREDUP'S AGENDA!",1
3745,Wow! Really nice website - the various categories- It's easy to find what you're looking for! Good work 👏,5
3746,Nice apps,5
3747,"Love thredup and purchase all the time but the app Shuts down on me frequently, doesn't usually load my unavailable favorites list. Both the website and the app have a bug where my favorite items show up but without the hearts checked, making it hard to remove them from my list. Filters of the favorites section would be a nice add.",3
3748,"Great app you just need to know what you like and the brands you like, it's really good and reliable so long as you keep that in mind",5
3749,Love it!!!,5
3750,Awesome clothes at amazing prices!!!! Wow!,5
3751,Blah,2
3752,Fab,5
3753,Great way to reduce my carbon footprint and save money!,5
3754,So far so good..we have been able to donate some nice things..that we hadn't worn in years.. making way for great new clothing.. really great..OMG !,4
3755,"This is absolutely my favorite place to shop!! The quality is great and shipping is pretty quick! My only critique would be: they could use a little more/better detail in the product descriptions. But, all in all. . . I LOVE thredUP!! Are there any plans to offer men's clothing?? That would make ThredUp PERFECT!!! I would love to be able to shop for the whole family in one spot.",5
3756,This is my favorite go-to app when shopping for clothes! The app is very user friendly and always have an amazing selection to choose from.,5
3757,"Love thread up , I get most of my clothes from them",4
3758,Love it,5
3759,"Fun to use and you feel better about environmental impact when purchasing and making returns than typical retail. Selling with them is easy as well. Pretty high prices for second hand though, particularly for cheaper brands and quality, and they could afford to add more filters to help users find what they're looking for.",4
3760,I always find cool and unique clothing that suits my eclectic taste.,1
3761,Paying 10.99 for shipping and it's been a week since I order is ridiculous!!!,1
3762,Excellent!,5
3763,Everything I have ordered from this app has been clean and shipped fairly quickly. Sizing can be a bit tricky. I live being able to shop here!!,5
3764,"Great, but could be better if the skirts and dresses featuring pockets were easier to find.",4
3765,"Love ThredUp💕💕 Amazing bargains on really nice quality clothes. I do miss the feature of showing similar items when you select an item to view☹ Love the points reward system so you can wave restocking fees and simple, free return shipping with USPS is soooo much easier than tracking down one of those other shipping stores.",5
3766,BUYER BEWARE! Bought a blouse that came in ripped. Sent them a huge bag of high-end unworn clothes to sell and they never got back in touch with me. Finally after a year they only paid me $30. Just go to goodwill.,1
3767,Great! ThredUp is Amazing. They do their absolute best to assist with all purchases. Very professional and careful packaging,5
3768,Good deals!,4
3769,"I always shop with ThredUP! I love the ""#outlet"". Make sure you get 20 items or more to get 40% entire haul! Love love love this app!",5
3770,Love this website!,5
3771,"I love love love 💕💕 thread up I'm so addicted I'm constantly buying stuff unfortunately now my closet and dresser drawers are all full what do I do now? 😭😳🤷 they have so many cute clothes & way cute purses and everything is at such a good price & fast delivery all items are in very good condition some are new with tags still on them, shoes always look brand new as if never worn, purses are to die for & again at such a great price it's hard to say no I'm a customer for life.",5
3772,Love the clothes,5
3773,Love this app! I've gotten so many cute clothes and returns are super easy. I am curious if they are ever going to do men's clothes though? Many women like to get some clothes in men's fits. I also know multiple men who would love to get good quality secondhand clothing. 🤷,5
3774,"I love to shop secondhand, and ThredUp's app makes it easy to shop for your sizes, favorite brands, and price ranges. An environmentally conscious was to find fabulous fashions with so much life left to give!",5
3775,Love this place,5
3776,Excellent !!! All my cloths just sells all the time.,5
3777,Love the clothes! Love the rewards! Love the app!,5
3778,"I love Thred Up so much. I have very bad anxiety issues and one of my most valuable coping techniques is to just browse the endless and ever-growing selection of second hand clothing and shoes. You can have a long like list so i just love finding great new graphic tees and affordable well fitting jeans. I do however experience quite a few technical problems with the app itself. I have to shut it down, force-stop it and then try reopening the app. It helps me deal with my anxiety without drugs.",5
3779,Just wonderful. Love it...,5
3780,I am very pleased and thankful for thredup.,5
3781,I really like this,5
3782,Clothes were excellent value and looked great.,5
3783,Great deals on kids clothing especially girls...and wonderful bargains throughout women wear and foot fashion.,5
3784,"Edited rating- Thredup has rectified some practices which were unfair to certain sectors of client base (ie, only iOs users could access certain features such as bidding). I've noticed prices are a bit higher but honestly understandable with the state the economy is in -inflation rampant, gas prices sky high, labor shortages. I will continue to use ThredUp to find unique and fun pieces :)",4
3785,Great for side hustle.,5
3786,"Pros: Love the deals I find on here, alot of options/brands. Cons: hard to narrow searches by brands, long time shipping, sizing are all over the place for pants/jeans (eventhough I set my size, but it still give my sizes that are bigger/smaller).",4
3787,"Really easy to sell or donate, only reason I'm not 5 starring it is because the credit you end up with isn't really worth what you're putting in,....just saying cuz I sold brand new with tags items and I wasn't offered very much ☹️ Not sure if you have the option to refuse and get items back???",4
3788,"Love it. I've gotten some great pieces from here, like brand new!",5
3789,Amazing site. I have loved everything Ive ordered. Highly recommend!!,5
3790,I love my red purse it's brand new and the price was great very happy..the app gave me no issues,5
3791,I have gotten some of my favorite outfits from thred UP and the awesome thing about is I do not break my bank account or feel guilty when I'm done!!!!! SHOPPING HERE IS STILL THRIFTING AND SOME ITEMS HAVE BEEN WEARABLE ONLY ONCE OR TWICE ..,4
3792,Shoppers beware!! They're Scam artist. If you order clothes that work out with absolutely no problems then you may be in the clear. But many of their clothing jeans especially have altercations made to them that isn't listed in the description. If you have to return anything you can take the free route which seems awesome unless you get the notice about there being a restocking fee. Oh and if you don't want store credit and prefer to have your cash back your automatically losing $10 bucks so. ✌️,1
3793,Quality merchandise at great prices. The trend of the future.,5
3794,Not sure yet,5
3795,I like the app so much. It's easy and very well set up. I would like the consignment 101 feature added to the app. That would be very useful.,5
3796,Find goodies for my kids. Take a little long to chose but is worth it. I recomend this to every one. Try the offers and the bundles.,5
3797,Super easy...love buying great barely used things!,5
3798,Love ThredUP. The clothes are in amazing condition.,5
3799,"You send in your clean out bag, and it can take months before you see anything in return! Customer service, what's that? Doesn't exist with this company.",1
3800,I love this store! The app has issues sometimes but it's always so easy to use and I've only ever purchased through the app. I seriously have found some great pieces on here and it was SUPER easy to purchase through the app! Love it!,5
3801,I can't unheart certain clothes. And it randomly breaks down. But the people are honest and deliver. I'd give five stars if I could unheart items in my available stuff anytime.,4
3802,"Like the app, wish there were more photos (inside bags, side views etc) and a little slow but otherwise :)",4
3803,"Love, love, love thredup!! I will be buying stuff from this site again and again and again!! Love that you can bundle all your purchases for the week and get free shipping for doing it!! Love the prices and the honesty about the clothing if they have any damage or wear.",5
3804,Everything I order is always so clean and smells so good,5
3805,"The app freezes so many times, and restart when you reenter so you lose progress on searching. Sometimes when searching by categories, it freezes when you want to refine the search, so you actually have to leave the search to do it all over again. Not all descriptions are correct. I ordered some things labeled cotton, just to receive them being polyester or acrylic. They are very nice about accepting the stuff if you contact them. I have had more hits than missed.",1
3806,Great app! Easy to use,5
3807,"The app won't let me sign in with an existing account. I had to create a new account, then sign out of that account and back into my real account to be able to access the app features.",3
3808,Item's arrivederci earliest than expected,5
3809,"app works great, and thred up is honestly my favorite place to shop.",5
3810,Item filters don't always work. Clothes are sometimes mislabeled as the wrong gender for kids. Also have gotten some damaged clothes.,3
3811,"App seems to work fine for me. The measurements just seem to be way off. I ordered the exact same brand and style Lululemon tank top in 6 different colors and after getting them, some were skin tight, some were loose fitting, and 2 were way oversized and did not fit at all. I went back to look at their measurements just to confirm and one of the big ones had small measurements, and one of the ones with larger measurements that I wad concerned would be too big was too small. So confusing!",3
3812,Comprehensive and very easy to use,5
3813,First time was very easy,5
3814,Love this app! I can thrift without touching things! It rocks!,5
3815,"Absolutely love all the great deals, quality clothing and new outfit ideas.",5
3816,"Easy to shop, easy to buy and return when needed.",5
3817,Keeps freezing or shutting down completely at checkout. I have to reopen and go back through checkout. It does save everything in car. Also noticed in app and on site don't always carry over my saved.,4
3818,Extremely over priced items. No thank you,2
3819,Love this!,5
3820,Luv the miss me jeans!! That's all i wear and now my collection is at 38 pairs ...half do to thredUP,5
3821,I love the ThredUp app.,5
3822,Variety!! I love that there are so many brands in one place. I only gave it a 3 for now. Once my order arrives I will update my review.,3
3823,The ability to shop and help the environment at the same time is great. I always love a good win win!,5
3824,No styles or brands that I wear or interest me.,1
3825,"Even Better. Just when you thought they had the best website ever, you find the app. Eveb easier plus much more rapid navigation from page to page. Press and hold to add to cart!",5
3826,"They are making a fortune off of selling ""kits"". Poor dummies sending their clothes off to some strangers, never to make a dime. I would never bother with this .",1
3827,Easy to navigate and purchasing is a breeze. There are exclusive offers in app which is really nice and the selection is plentiful!,5
3828,"Quality Items, easy to use app",5
3829,Just love how organized ThredUp is and the awesome deals!,5
3830,Always a good experience. I have bought many items and never been disappointed.,5
3831,Huge selection of gently used clothing and accessories!! Five stars for the environment :),5
3832,too many emails,1
3833,"Love it most of the time but they raised their shipping $3 more with no warning ,don't deliver on the date they say and the sizes aren't always correct! I ordered a size 14 in women's & they sent me shorts from the children's department. NOWHERE on the site did it say it was a ""girls"" item yet when I received it, it clearly stated on the tag that it was from their girls line!! Why wasn't that on the description?! Wasted $30! I'm busy& don't have time 2 go return the item bcuz of their screw up!",3
3834,Love saving the planet by looking cute,5
3835,"Never arrives on time, once again said the 27, where is it.",1
3836,Works well on Android.,5
3837,"I LOVE this app, it's an online thrift store!! They have THE BEST CLOTHES, a GREAT business precedent/philosophy, and it's SUPER FUN!! They have great sales like really often that are timed- I just LOVE this store this is now where I get ALL my clothes",5
3838,i dont love the new point system but overall i love thredup! its a great way to enjoy dressing fashionably while staying environmentally friendly and keeping some money in ur pocket. 😉,4
3839,The app has loooots of bugs. 1 you cannot search for shoes in the app 2 sometimes saved search results do not show up on the screen 3 sometimes favorites do not show up and I have to close the app and open it again for it to work 4 the similar items part that had been added is a great feature in desktop but it is not available in the app,2
3840,Best thrifting app around!!,5
3841,The customer service features are kind of terrible and send you in a lot of circles and certain categories could use more filtering options but I love the ease and accessibility of thrifting that is provided through Thredup.,3
3842,"best online thrift store ever... EDIT: But, my favorite part of this app was when you click on a item it would show you similar items at the bottom. What happened to that? It's harder to find what I'm looking for now :(",4
3843,Good app. Use a lot. Only bad feedback I have is they updated recently and changed a few things one of which is related items don't show up when you scroll down anymore which I really liked.,4
3844,"No response when I contacted company on a shipping issue right after placing an order,even though they claim to respond within a certain time frame. They do not. Therefore, that created a problem for me. Definitely changed my mind on how often I will shop with them going forward.",3
3845,"Makes thrifting clothes A LOT easier, 10/10 would recommend.",4
3846,Love Thredup,5
3847,"Fast, reliable and great quality. Outfits look new and amazing, I highly recommend this site.",5
3848,Doesn't work most of the time!😢,1
3849,Cancel Me,5
3850,"I am months into using this app and it works great! I enjoy it better than the website which has always been a bit slow. It is one of the easiest apps to use and it rarely breaks down. I love it, thanks!",5
3851,"Other than occasionally not loading for a few hours once or twice a month there arnt any major issues with the software. As far as the company the items I've purchased have been good quality, worn but still good. And good pricing for the quality of products. Personally I love that you can see when someone has something in there cart that you have been looking at. The only thing I wish was higher quality photos of the fabrics but somethings just don't translate digitally so it's understandable.",5
3852,I love the website but the search option is inconsistent and does not seem to be sensitive to certain commonly used descriptors. I have to search multiple ways in order to find what I want.,3
3853,I love this.. personally it works for me.. others would need to really try it for themselves... most will love thredup as much as me.... I tell everyone to check it out,4
3854,Good but I hope I'm happy with my order.,4
3855,"Love how easy it is to shop.. but after almost a month since I placed order, according to tracking is still sitting somewhere in Utah. I tried messaging thredup customer service and I haven't gotten any response.",3
3856,make this app accessible to male presenting people. why doesn't this app include masculine clothing?,1
3857,Looking for cheap church dresses,5
3858,Great experience. Easy returns when needed. You won't be disappointed ❤❤,5
3859,"Nice selection, but I've gotten a few stained items, sent a message and never heard back from them. Overall I do like the items I've gotten.",4
3860,"Would be so much better if they did not take longer than a snail stuck in honey, for everything including responses to chat. I have done clean out bags. (3 months and still in a process) responding to chats (took my entire lunch hour for them to respond). Ordering (almost a month to arrive)..... After all that!! THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!! Find another site.. postmark, versatile, real real, NOT THIS!! this site does not even deserve the 1 star",1
3861,I don't receive any money for my clothes,1
3862,No men's clothes,1
3863,Shipping still waiting i tjink you could do better,1
3864,"Up until this March I would have given 4 stars.my last clean outfit was received by Threadup on 3/10/22 still waiting for it to be processed, have sent several emails with no response. My points for sending clean out bag in are about to expire and it's still not been processed. Promised date has come and gone by 2 weeks now. Predicted 8 weeks it's been 11 almost 12 now. No stars would be my rating!!!",1
3865,It's a Awsome place to buy used clothes and sell.,5
3866,"When I saw there was no filter for Men's I Uninstalled, why ignore half of the world?",1
3867,Loove Thred Up but the app is really glitchy. The filters reset while searching/shopping and freeze.,3
3868,The app takes a long time to load compared to other apps. I updated it and that didn't help.,2
3869,Nothing in my size,1
3870,I order my stuff 2 weeks ago still have no ideal where it is or anything about it even being shipped im not sure if ill keep using this app or not the clothes are great prices but still not sure if ill use it again after this.,2
3871,Stylish clothes,4
3872,To Pricey!,2
3873,I have always loved bargain shopping but let me tell you... thredUP is a whole new level of awesome! Everything is always exactly how it's described!! Love it!!!,5
3874,I love this app..don't buy clothes anywhere else,5
3875,"Needs more angles/pictures of the items other than front and back. Otherwise, it's great higher-end-used-clothing. 👍",3
3876,Customer service the chat is a joke if you have a problem with your order they do not i repeat do not respond,1
3877,Amazing. I found the perfect dress within 3 minutes of opening the app,5
3878,It has been totally great,1
3879,"I love ThredUp. I would give 5 stars, but for some reason the company won't let you change your home warehouse if you move which seems ridiculous to me and a waste of time and resources for all parties involved. Not really a technical app issue, but that's my main complaint.",4
3880,"No men's clothes, absolutely useless to me :/",1
3881,I can't actually reach anyone in customer service.,1
3882,Fun to look at clothes are your disposal.,5
3883,Just placed an order. I was amazed at the amount of clothing available. Can hardly wait to receive my package.,5
3884,"Love my items, received them quicker than was expected. The items are exactly as they show in the picture. I love this app",5
3885,You can't search what you want. In terms of style. So the brand thing is unhelpful. It's great that they have it for some people. But I just want some bell bottoms. It's unhelpful when I can only search the brand. If they don't have Bell-Bottoms in that brand.,2
3886,Rip off. They don't give you jack for your clothes. Total rip off,1
3887,"There's absolutely no reason why there is no men section. They have plenty of clothes for boys, so why are there no clothes for adult men? We want to be sustainable too!",1
3888,Will not open,4
3889,Was so easy to purchase! Can't wait for my purchase to arrive.,5
3890,I just placed my first order and it was so easy! Update: I have just placed my 3rd order. The merchandise is very reasonable and exactly as described. I highly recommend this app.,5
3891,Yes 🥰 love it,5
3892,Boy idk who they're paying to keep up these good reviews but I placed my first order ever and woke up the next day to see it has been cancelled with no email or reason at all. This isy only account. What a waste of my time .,1
3893,Don't use it,1
3894,Sizing in descriptions are not consistent or accurate.,3
3895,Great place to find a variety of second hand clothing.,4
3896,The clothes I rcvd fit well and were extremely affordable. The items were shipped quickly as well! Some other sights I dealt with previously I had to wait almost 3 weeks to receive my items.,4
3897,"Continually going to previous pages, does not save preferences, makes you go back to the very beginning of search not just the previous item, preferred shipping provider is unreliable and there is no way for You go to resolution on the matter it can be days upon days of the preferred shipping provider rescheduling your delivery due to them not making delivery attempts with no delivery updates on their part after signing up for them until the end of day on both sides",2
3898,Love this app!,5
3899,App won't even start,1
3900,The app works great most of the time. Every now and then the app will decided to freeze or to close on its own without saving what was in my cart.,4
3901,"Easy app to understand, Ive loved every item I've purchased to-date. Thank you thredUp.",5
3902,"A great way to build a wardrobe, with a big plus for plus size options!",5
3903,"OMG I love this app. Sometimes the filters get to be complicated, but for the most part it's really easy to shop from my couch. A bit too easy...eek",5
3904,Cant get rid of the push notifications. I delete them by selecting off to those and email alerts but they turn back on automatically. So frustrated with the app that i'm near to deleting. The last shipment was a dud and at 1.99 per item to send back i'm just not sure its worth it. Sizing is hard with so many brands that i'd almost rather spend a little more and skip the fruatration. The annoying alerts at the bottom started recently but.... As soon as i x out of one another pops up!,2
3905,"The app is useless now. Won't load most of the time, loses my favorites, just garbage.",1
3906,Gnarly,5
3907,"Charging me $44 for a $35 order, no chat help, email in 10-11 DAYS. NOPE. Tell, me, please, how $9.46 + $25.99 = $44 and change BEFORE tax. No way to get a human being to fix the problem, just boilerplate answers to prewritten questions in the ""knowledge base"" and a 10-11 **day** delay for the only way to ask my own questions...meanwhile my order goes away in 3 hours. They were cute pants but overpriced at $35; no way am I paying $44+. Forget this.",1
3908,Items 'NWT' didn't come with tags. Petite sizing not designated. I bought a womens fishing shirt and it was a child's size Large. Some items are more expensive than buying them at the store. You really have to check pricing.,3
3909,Love this app!!,5
3910,GREAT DEALS!!!!,5
3911,"Love the items! App needs some work. I'm a bigger girl, and even though I put my sizes in the filter, I still get tons of listings for items way too small for me. Measurements on items are not accurate. They would really save time on returns if their measurements were more accurate and able to filter items better.",3
3912,I love 💘 ❤ everything that I have purchased and can't wait to receive my merchandise.,5
3913,Great. Love the store.,5
3914,I sent in new tees n some addias maybe 10 teams and got 2.79 wat a laugh n its been there fa 1year in half like dey not right n dnt like to pay fa wat you send to them to help one get funds fa new or name brand stuff very disappointment n that dey keep ur stuff chargein more to get ot back Dont use dem they aint right just gettin over!!wen someone really lookin fa extra funds no gud!!,1

3916,"Great , love it!",5
3917,I absolutely love thred up.I only buy my clothes here now!😃,5
3918,"I love thredUP! I have used this organization to buy/sell all my clothes for the past few years! One pet peeve is not mentioning if items have sparkling/shimmering type fabric or color, which is not my favorite. You are unable to see the shimmering/glitter in the photos. I wish this aspect would improve.",5
3919,My sister loves it and now I do too!,5
3920,Don't try returning EVERYTHING!!!,3
3921,I love this app,5
3922,"Won't allow you to CASH OUT, credit only!!!!! FRAUD!!!!!!!!",1
3923,Love it!!,5
3924,I want to like the app but it freezes occasionally and hasn't let me place an order the last few times I tried (error messages). I finally had to uninstall the app and place the order through the website to make it actually go through.,1
3925,Always been a great experience!! True to descriptions....on everything I've been ordering for about 2 yrs. Now....😁,5
3926,I love this app! It has some of the best deals Ive ever seen.,5
3927,Cute clothes. Great prices!!,5
3928,Love..love..love!!!❤ I've ordered 38 items In the last month!! Yikes!! But everything fit perfectly and everything was in perfect condition!! There was just one pair of pants that were too big but I gave them to a friend....😁 I'm very happy with ThredUp!!! Thank you soooo much!!! 5/14/22..soo now I'm going to have to change my rating because of the shipping methods they have..boooooo!!!boo-boo!!!! Almost a month and I haven't received my package!!!!,2
3929,The clothes were marvelous but I don't understand how people can go in my basket I'll be waiting for Friday what you're wonderful and thank you,5
3930,Amazing should really try it great prices a dress was $71 and I got it for 8,5
3931,Love this app. It makes it easy to thrift shop online and the tools that tell you the impact you are making on the environment really make it even more fun!,5
3932,Love buying from this app.... these folks are top notch!!!,5
3933,"I still love this app. I have gone down and up and then down again in sizes, and it's always affordable. I used to complain about the waiting time for delivery and also returns- especially returns- but honestly, I had to recalibrate my expectations because of over tech-ed places like Amazon. I like the idea of a smaller carbon footprint, and im willing to wait for it. Love LOVE this app",5
3934,I love the option to bundle. This service makes all the difference to me.,5
3935,No options for men?,1

3937,"Usually it's great, only problem I received a pair of jeans the zipper was ripped from the jeans on one size, I bought a pair of cute blue jeans, checked the waist size they said they'd fit, got them they are china size, so they definitely don't fit. Other than that, I love this store.",3
3938,"Have bought lots of clothes from here, and sold some too. Massive selection you have to root through with patience because the search tools don't really filter out much, and the sizing isn't always quite right, but they have any easy return policy for anything not on final sale.",5
3939,Excellent,5
3940,"Great prices on quality products. The descriptions are accurate, and the few items I've had to return were handled quickly and professionally.",5
3941,Absolutely love it!! And I love to re-purpose and buy re-purposed. High quality items at better than local thrift prices.,5
3942,I have been waiting Months to get money#!#!,5
3943,"Well, don't know really what to start with, 1st order everything went smoothly, I couldn't wear somethings and returning was easy, 2nd order, couldn't wear somethings and when I went to return page, most of my items didn't come up, so I'm stuck with a pair of size 2 toddler H&M shorts, supposed to be a size 2 woman's, 3rd order, same thing, I don't see anything I can return bc it's not there, and I've ordered over around $1000.00 worth of clothes for me/son, and Noone to contact, IRRITATED",1
3944,When I buy clothes from the internet I can't see if there is any thing wrong with the outfit so if there is something wrong with the clothes I should be able to return it easily. I bought clothes from thredup but there was something wrong with the sewing so I requested to return but for 15 days the return label didn't come so I sent emails and texts several times but didn't get a solution or a reply. I couldn't get my money back and I don't know what to do next.,2
3945,"Updated yesterday, not working today. I've closed and reopened the app several times, restarted my phone, tried to access it via a push notification, and all I see is the loading wheel where the home screen should be. Hoping for a fix soon.",2
3946,Excellent,5
3947,🎉,5
3948,"I found a handbag here that I have been looking for for over 20 years! Received it in perfect, like new condition! Love ThredUp!♥️",5
3949,The app will not open even after update.,2
3950,I love this store. I use quad pay to pay so most orders are around $25 every other week for about 20- 24 new pieces of clothing if you shop the sales.,5
3951,"I love ThredUp!! The only thing that I will say, is that I have trouble with the APP randomly kicking off. Idk. It's been a thing. Otherwise, im pleased. 😊 Just try and keep that glitch in mind.",5
3952,"App works well enough but item display is lacking. The item description *like new with minimal wear, if any* seems a rather variable interpretation based on perceptions of the viewer. For example, when looking at a skirt, slacks, Coach bag, etc., the first thing I want to see are ALL of the seams and hems. It's hard to agree to potential restocking fee for returns when viewing option doesn't include 360° zoom.",2
3953,Still love thred up after several years! Yes I do!,5
3954,"How fun. A little expensive but they give rewards. In my old age I have found certain leggings, jeans, tees,bras and shorts I only want to wear from a few brands. I can order all of the at one stop and I love they are used it makes me feel less guilty.",5
3955,"Thieves: I sent a box, it had been received. Months ago they had given me cents for my sale of an item. Just logged in to check my sales and my package ""hasn't been received"" if I'm donating just say that...",1
3956,Your promo codes do not work,5
3957,Love it!!,5
3958,Great stuff love the prices,5
3959,I've found great clothing items I needed,5
3960,"Good selection, most items we'll described, would prefer ALL items has measurements on them",5
3961,Love this app. Very easy to use and understand.,5
3962,"I still love thredup. When I have time, they have beyond great deals and make me feel better about helping the planet. Still want their subscription box back. Maybe I'm part of a niche market, but I don't have a lot of time outside of work and family. I also appreciate having a person with better taste than myself to help me look better. Your stylists are amazing! Your mission is amazing!",4
3963,I've ordered from thredUp multiple times and every time I want or need to change my wardrobe.....thredUp. I love the selection 😍 especially for the lux brands. I've even ordered kid's clothes and I've LOVED every single piece I've ever gotten. I'm always going to be a loyal buyer ❤️,5
3964,Love the easy navigation and great options and prices Sometimes too many alerts and the app freezes alot!,4
3965,"Everytime I open the app I get an error message saying ""we are having problems loading the app currently. Please try again."" I have uninstalled and reinstalled. It has nothing to do with my internet connection. It is the worst.",1
3966,"First time I shop here. I got some shorts that were described as size S but it's M, and 27"" waist, but it's 34"". An item that was in ""excellent condition"" but it's faded. I can't return because they were final sale. Also I want to return 2 items that didn't fit. The return label is no where to be seen, I am trying to contact customer service since a couple of days ago but shows an error in the app, so frustrating!!!!!",1
3967,"OMG, I bought 8 pairs of shoes and boots for less than $100. WORTH EVERY MINUTE SEARCHING AND EVERY PENNY PAID!",5
3968,great service and many more to choose from and love to shop here !! Wish can chat wirh someone always show wrong size in bust and waist..I dont like how shipping work !,5
3969,Easy to use,5
3970,"I love the clothes 😍. I was so excited when I got my first box, but I do hate how the app kicks everything out of your cart if you don't buy the items before the sale ends. I have to go searching for my treasures all over again. 😑",5
3971,"Almost too easy to use, i keep shopping! I love to thrift and the ease of online shopping...easy returns.",5
3972,"Love how the clothes you get are in really good shape but for such a low price, that's awesome!! Recently ordered a dress and had recieved it in the mail within 2-3weeks could have been a little bit less(honestly wasnt paying close attention)but got it sooner than I expected it to get to me",5
3973,I like thredUp but I believe your search engine could use some updating. I find it more helpful to be able to type in what I am looking for and then be offered the items that are in that category or similar rather than clicking on the filters individually. Also a lot of your products are mislabeled.,3
3974,I ordered a package 2 weeks ago to get the bag stills and cane so today I contacted them on Mother's Day hi I was wondering if you guys would send my bag yet their answer was they sent it on 5522 okay that's fine today's 5/8 that's 3 days now my father works for USPS that's United States postal service they tried to advise me that it takes 3 weeks and it comes in regular mail now I contacted my father and he said absolutely not he said it takes 3 to 7 days liars,1
3975,Love the selections! Needs better pictures,5
3976,FUN!,5
3977,Placed an order weeks ago. No receipt sent to email. No tracking or update about order. Customer service part of app does not work. Tried to ise the website and won't let me reset my password to get in.,1
3978,Easy app to navigate. So many options!,4
3979,Great Experience!! Items are quality in great condition. What a great way to decrease waste!,5
3980,I sent a box of clothes and no response. Don't know if they sold any or not. Have not heard a word.,1
3981,"The site just keeps growing in every way. Rewards, promos, options, customer service, etc. Their descriptions are accurate and honest and their return policy is easy. It is the only way I shop now.",5
3982,Great products and easy to navigate the app. You can do a ton with the filters.,5
3983,It's cool,5
3984,Prices are really great but sometimes it runs a little slow but other than that it's a great app,4
3985,First time and get a survey before using.,3
3986,Great shopping options Best to buy when they have sales,4
3987,Guys like to thrift too,5
3988,Too many push notifications even after they've been disabled...,1
3989,Love clothes especially dresses.just need them at least to knee,5
3990,Normally gpod clothes that look like the picture but sometimes are more innacurate and discolored irl. Way too long processing times and shipping date is constantly pushed back a week or two after ordering. Takes an insane amount of time for packages to be delivered.,3
3991,Easy experience,5
3992,"Easy way to buy and see clothing. Some adjustments needed often when I scroll I see things I just saw. I wish skirts had a waist measurement. App does get ""stuck"" and I have to quit and restart. If you want to start a lower waste clothing practice it's a great way to start",3
3993,No men's. Just women's..........no thanks ...I'll stick with poshmark or merchari,1
3994,I am in shock that a company that excludes adult males from this app. Equality gose both ways. I wonder if it's men or gay men. I'm sure it's both. Such a complete disappointment.,1
3995,I have shopped here twice & always get killer discounts & premium clothing.,5
3996,"This app has changed so much. Shipping fees now are more expensive, even for just one piece no matter it weights. Shipping to Puerto Rico and Hawaii may take weeks. And now we cannot use expedited method, because it's only for the 48 states. Why is that? I feel like it doesn't worth it anymore. Maybe is better to delete my account and find other place to buy.",1
3997,I SENT A BAG IN JAN OR FEB AN STILL DONT KNOW IF THEY ARE SELLING MY STUFF. THEY PROBABLY GOT GOOD MONEY TAGS WERE STILL ON SOME THINGS. . BRING CLOTHES TO A CHURCH THEY GIVE THEM TO THOSE IN NEED.,1
3998,"$9 shipping?!?! Plus overall too expensive, not a real thrift store. This is more of a glorified, pricey 2nd hand boutique. Nice dresses cost $ 50 and up. What's the use then because for that money I can buy new clothes. I don't care if it is a brand or a label. Fact is, it has been used before and I will not pay that kind of money for a used dress. Only 2 photos, inaccurate size info and the fact that you don't return the misfits cause it's too expensive would warrant cheaper / fairer prices",2
3999,"Great app. Although, there have been a handful of occasions where I ""click"" on an item and the app closes. Other than that, love it!",4
4000,Awesome. Great prices,5
4001,Thrift shopping at my fingertips! This is a great app with plenty of filters to quickly find the clothes I want.,5
4002,Very unethical. I sent back item because it was wrong size and they refuse to refund me. My credit card company helped resolve the matter. Thredup has terrible customer policy and worse trying to reach a service person. Never do business with them again.,1
4003,This was my first purchase and I will keep purchasing. It was easy and shipping was fast. Thank you,5
4004,Slowest shipping imaginable. It's been two weeks and it's not even close to being delivered. Buyer beware.,1
4005,"Love your app! I purchase alot. However, I wish you guys would ship faster. I know there's several warehouses across the country, but it needs to be more streamlined. Maybe employees need to be more encouraged to get orders out faster. I've actually decided against some purchases just because it takes so long to get here. But I do love ThredUp.",4
4006,Probably got some music,1
4007,I love all the new things i find!! Its a good app to have. Thankyou!!!,5
4008,"Fun. I got some stuff for my fiance, true. I'm sure she'll love it.",5
4009,They are having lengthy process time to sell Your items do not recommend to use to sell items.,2
4010,Awesome app easy to navigate,5
4011,"ThreadUP is a keeper! Its legit, easy to use, visually appealing, offering insane deals on their fantasticly vast selection of quality fashion. Recycling apparel is the core focus and concept promoted here. Goodbye expensive, throw away fashion, Hello: ThreadUP. Order the clean out bag, fill it up, set it by your mailbox. Within a month or so you will receive notice of your order status, confirm the suggested price ( their cut is lil steep), once your item sold, cash out or pick something hot",5
4012,"I would give this app 5 stars if they didn't have SheIn clothing on it. SheIn is the worst quality, it is horrible quality. I bought a nice looking sweater from SheIn from ThredUp. I couldn't even wear it once. I washed it by hand, the sweater fell apart. I have since did a lot of research on SheIn. It is fast fashion in the worst way. There is so much SheIn products on ThredUp in the past months. I would hate to have to stop buying from my favorite second hand clothing site. SheIn=Sadness",4
4013,Do not follow their standards. 6 days is definitely on a different calendar. I got to 10 before I canceled my order and Uninstaller the app.,1
4014,"I love love love this site! I basically buy a new wardrobe and then sell it back, its a win win and I always look fabulous for an affordable price( which is so hard to find these days) Thank you tredUp!!!!",5
4015,Great,5
4016,"Update, May 2022, saved searches also not working. You see the search, it says 21 items, you click to see all and it pulls 100,000 items from other brands and not the one you saved. This app has never worked properly but this problem with the saved searches just started a couple weeks ago and makes the saved search worthless. So glitchy on my Google pixel 3.",2
4017,This is a great idea 💡,5
4018,Love how it only shows you the clothes that are your size.,5
4019,Fast shipping packaged perfectly feels like you are receiving a gift. Site is so easy to navigate. Awesome experience.,5
4020,Love the clothes,5
4021,"As a student, buying fine quality clothing at full price - is almost impossible. Thredup allows me to shop for designers I enjoy, at a price I can afford. With their professional images, annnd too the tee, accurate measuring. You can't go wrong.",5
4022,Thred up has been a life changing for this busy mom! I can still look stylish without having to go shopping in a store. Delivery is fairly quick and always great quality!,5
4023,No men's clothes.,1
4024,I find everything I need and more for my son and I. I love this place!,5
4025,Sooooo... I guess men don't thrift shop?,1
4026,"Very poor, my phone was very slow and did not want to remove items I wish not to buy!",1
4027,Always love everything I order.,5
4028,Love this app!,5
4029,Love it!,5
4030,"Absolutely mind blowing! The most customized shopping for any size budget. Fantastic selection app is incredibly easy and fun to use. The only thing you may come across that might be difficult it's too many items to choose from. 🤗 lol. But they have the most incredible prices, tons of sales, and even great 😃 free shipping offers too. Filters make it easy to customize your shopping. Now you can own that dress or designer bag you've always dreamed of ! 👠👗👖😁❣️",5
4031,Don't like app. Disorganized can't easily find anything. I'm going to delete now!,1
4032,"The app is super glitchy for the selling side. I'm never able to actually see my sales let alone adjust pricing, etc.",2
4033,It is fabulous!,5
4034,Love this app would recommend it,4
4035,"Love it, I just wish that they knew how to measure correctly. I have purchased over 10 items that were off by INCHES. Then.... you have to pay to restock the item they themselves measured incorrectly. 🙄 EDITED: Decided to give them another shot... people still don't know how to measure. It's VERY important for jeans to be measured correctly. PLEASE train your people on how to measure CORRECTLY and inspect clothing. 2 items marked ""excellent condition"" had tears in them.",3
4036,"Very poor customer support for lost packages. Edit: They are very slow to address lost packages, but they will get back to you... eventually.",2
4037,Super easy and cheap.,5
4038,Meh don't like that I have to send my clothes to get evaluated. Kinda dumb in my opinion. I sell from my own home faster than this.,1
4039,Ordered some summer tops. All in great condition and sized just as described. Will definitely use again.,5
4040,I think you need to specify that it is only for women and no men clothes are there.,1
4041,"Always find treasures here, accurately described by thredUp, for great prices. They also have a super easy way to donate your clothing which can receive thredUp credit if it's in good shape and what they are looking for. The app works great.",5
4042,"I have bought my first couple of orders and I'm very pleased! I love thrifting in person, and this really gives me that same fix when I can't thrift IRL. I've had to return two items and the return policy was a breeze (just a small restock fee, which honestly doesn't bother me, I'm just grateful to have the option to return really). I got my refund immediately, so I could shop with my refund even before my return got back to thredUP. I've found steals on expensive brands. Yay",5
4043,I am1 22 years old and I 22,1
4044,"Absolutely love this!!! Beautiful clothes, affordable prices, and easy to use app!! Who could ask for more??😊",5
4045,I wish I could search whether or not something has pockets. You can't always tell from the pics.,4
4046,All the clothes I want at less than half the $...while being ecologically responsible. App is easy to use and keeps my favorites and ordering history at one-touch access.,5
4047,I love the great deals that I can find,5
4048,Easy to use. I order using the app 90% of the time.,5
4049,It's truly awesome,5
4050,Would like to have the 'shop similar' feature back. I used that all the time.,5
4051,Always great experience.,5
4052,"I ordered 2 shirts both"" 5x (plus size)"" and I received both shirts, both ""small""very disappointed, now I have to go through the trouble of returning them.",1
4053,Unbelievable blitzkrieg of emails. No way to unsub so I uninstalled. Ferocious over emailing.,1
4054,Their clothes fabric is really good they are my new favorite place to buy clothes I just recieved my package and the dress that I bought is my mew favorite dress that I own!!!,5
4055,This site is so Cool! TkU,5
4056,"Loved the initial discount for joining, can't wait to see how the rest of my experience is with them!! Will for sure be back! I'm a huge user of other apps like Po$hmark but like this even better because the cost of shipping doesn't always make the others even worth the savings, so this is way nicer with being able to bundle together!!!",5
4057,"No! Don't let them screw you too! They call damaged items ""like new"" and shipping is going up!",1
4058,"Easy to navigate. Best thrifting experience for size range 12-16!!! Each item measured so you know what you order will actually fit. Saves me hours of thrifting time, gives me a way wider selection and really generous returns policy which I have yet to use. Thank you Thredup for helping me upgrade my wardrobe while being financially and environmentally responsible. Every one needs to use this. Only SUGGESTION is that you don't take or offer mens clothing! I would love to see that in future!",5
4059,Can't get an answer from customer service.,2
4060,Awesome,5
4061,Love this app,5
4062,Great clothes!,5
4063,Very Professional and good stuff!!!,5
4064,"I love secondhand and you actually get your package other secondhand sites are a nightmare , only thing is Victoria secret pink is expensive even buying it secondhand that being said 3 out of the 4 items were way more worn out then they described I mean not even good condition more like fair boarding lining poor I'm ordering again this week hoping it won't happen again",3
4065,"Have bought some great things on this app, just sometimes i do think things could be cheaper",4
4066,The app is completely useless to track orders.,1
4067,Great service,5
4068,Great deal! Free shipping!,5
4069,Everything is super cheap and very nice quality! I recommend this app to everyone! Love Thredup!,5
4070,"It is no longer worth it to shop here. Shipping just skyrocketed. Between that and my other issues, I'm uninstalling. Other issues are: a recent dress I bought said 'minor signs of wear', I would say signs of wear are moderate, and will get rid of it. Items are frequently mis-catergorized and sized incorrectly. I'll just shop locally from now on. And sell my things in a garage sale.",1
4071,Love everything about this thrift store. Everything I have gotten has been exactly as described. Fast shipping is great too.,5
4072,"The app is okay. Sometimes it won't load anymore nor switch between tabs, so I'll have to close out and open it back up then it works fine. A bit annoying. Pros: easily sort by size, price, style, searching is easy, love the like function. General measurements are included (length, waist, bust). Return process is easy too. Cons: I feel so pressured to buy things! Because it's a thrift shop, you never know if what you want will be there the next day or if someone else will buy it before you!",4
4073,Can't even deactivate your account in the app. What a hastle trying to delete an account if you changed your mind. It's 2022 it shouldn't be that hard!,1
4074,"Love the variety, easy to use, but beware very addictive!",5
4075,App locks up...clicking the menu bar doesn't always take you to the page selected.,2
4076,App seems to be glitching a lot - saved searches are no longer correct and several big brands disappear from the drop-down menu in the search feature (but do still exist elsewhere in the app). I keep thinking there will be an update to correct these but I haven't seen one yet.,3
4077,"Love the selection, love the prices! I've been looking for ways to dress in better quality clothes, not break the bank, and lessen my contribution to the issues of fast fashion. This was the perfect response! I pretty much only buy from thredup and a local high quality 2nd hand store nearby now. Amazing deals and a fun way to explore your fashion while being eco-conscious.",5
4078,I love this app. I'm able to purchase designer labels at a great price. The items I've chosen look new or are with tags still attached.,5
4079,Items are terrible and not much is available. $13 for a wrinkly plain tank top? I can buy new for cheaper.,1
4080,Everything I bought seemed in great condition when it arrived at my house not even a month later I started noticing holes in the clothing. No it's not caused by my washer I have clothing from years ago that I wear weekly and get washed and still have no holes.,1
4081,I love all the kind of clothes and accessories they have.,5
4082,"Love love my purse,top,pants excellent condition!!!!",5
4083,No men's clothes,1
4084,I can always find what I'm looking for on ThredUP. The best part is I can return it if it doesn't fit.,5
4085,I like this app. Easy to use. I love that I can save items and come back to my saves over and over. Fun shopping experience.,5
4086,Unbelievable Selection,5
4087,"I usually like what I get from Threadup. But on this occasion the package was over a week late. The dress I ordered said it was 100% silk and it is actually cotton, it also said only light signs of wear but is black and has some obviously unintentional bleach marks as well as a tear in the strap. This is terrible mismarketing never would have bought if I had know the condition it was in, Threadup, plz fix this.",1
4088,I wasn't aware that the app was exclusively for women's clothes. Should probably specify that in the app description.,1
4089,"I like the extensive filter options they have for finding specific articles of clothing. I hope they'll add evenn more to the filter options. Sleeve length options for all tops and dresses would be nice, as well as different options for baby clothes like onesie sets etc.",5
4090,Always has been great experience,5
4091,Love this App! So easy to use!,5
4092,Love the clothes and the prices but I couldn't use my birthday stuff on this order for some reason,5
4093,"Will not let you delete account throws up ""oops we are experiencing trouble"" messages only. Will not respond to account deletion requests",1
4094,"Pointless for selling your clothes and make money unless your already rich and have a bag full of high end brands. If they don't take your clothes you have an option for your clothes to be returned back to you where you pay them $10.99 or sent to be recycled. So if I send In a clean out kit and you don't accept anything and I want them back to sell I have to pay you? No win. I'm sorry but if your not gonna pay me for my clothes Id like them back,you just lost business ,I'll sell them elsewhere.",1
4095,I just love thredUP. It's my go-to whenever I want to change up my wardrobe. My things always arrive quickly and I love everything I've bought.,5
4096,Fun.,5
4097,No mens clothes.,1
4098,I absolutely love Thredup my when it comes to buying. I unfortunately since all of my clothes and pocketbooks to them though and their payout is sad it's under a dollar for name brand stuff you don't get anything for your clothes so don't send them any of your stuff to sell.,5
4099,"I have bought a purse from thread-up awhile back. It was in very good shape. It really was as good as new. I really think of thread-up first before I buy a purse. It's really hard to go out and buy the purse for you. You can run around from store to store trying to find the purse for you, and still go home empty handed. Thread-up has so many styles and price ranges. You can actually buy a name brand purse for only half the price you would brand new.",5
4100,"Love it. Customer service is excellent. Shipping takes a bit longer now since they're working to reduce impact on the environment but that's why we thrift, isn't it?",5
4101,Quality of items as described! Shipping is cute with their personalized wrapping! I save and reuse! Addicted to the sales!! Love the Outlet!!,5
4102,I love this app.,5
4103,only catered to women nothing of guys unless ur a toddler,1
4104,Your app is very glitchy. I cannot access my sales and returns. I prefer to open your website on my notebook browser.,2
4105,Love this app! Im going thrifting on the go. Love the trendy new ways Thred Up has made me keep coming back!,4
4106,Always excellent!,5
4107,LOVE this site!! so much stuff to choose from at great prices!!!,5
4108,Addictive! Every item in New or like new condition at unbelievable prices,5
4109,"My favorite place to shop for clothes. They have sales very often, and the selection is fantastic with thousands of new stuff every day. I love how particular you can get with the filters, it helps me search for exactly the styles I want. Thrifting has never been so easy!",5
4110,Deals are good but it wont let you make any purchases. Keeps saying you already have an account when you know you dont.,4
4111,"Love the clothes, service and promptness of delivery.",5
4112,Love finding great deals!!,5
4113,LOVE EVERYTHING I GET!!!!,5
4114,Have shopped thredup for years. The app is easy to use and makes it convenient to add items to your favorites. Check-out is quick and easy.,5
4115,Great Finds Easy shopping experience and I love the ways to narrow down and search for items. Love this ap.,5
4116,No men's?,1

4119,I ordered this order on the 14th up April and it still has not shipped I just want my order canceled and return my money and I will not be ordering anything else from y'all.,1
4120,Great app and great buys! Love it!,5
4121,"This company only offers one form of shipping and it's FedEx smart post. It takes forever to get your merchandise and they give you a delivery date and then change it the day before until 3 days later. I WAS a VIT and spent thousands of dollars with them and I will not spend another penny with them. As far as ""customer service"", it is nonexistent. You can't speak with a person it just has automated cookie cutter answers. I would NEVER EVER BUY FROM THEM IF YOU VALUE CUSTOMER SERVICE.",1
4122,Love the 55% discount on your first order! A lot of things on sale too. You have to dig to find the gems because there are a lot of filler pieces but the prices are great.,4
4123,Great clothes In a timely fashion. Love the environmental impact.,5
4124,"I'm finding quality clothes for great prices! The best part about this sites design is measurements are listed of every article listed on their site. No more surprises like I get from other sites only to see that it has shrunk or is in foreign sizing which translates to wasted money. Now that people are desperate for earning addition income, some items are thrift store quality or worse. ThreadUP inspects each article of clothing and separates from quality and sub par. Shop now and ENJOY!",5
4125,Awesome shopping!,5
4126,Easy to search and use,5
4127,"Terrible, they had two items in 4X woman's plus",1
4128,App doesn't work following the recent update.,1
4129,Love thredup! It has saved me so many headaches and returns are easy when things do not work. I am a ThredUp fan for life!,5
4130,"The app works fine on my Google Pixel 6 Pro. But I won't be using this shopping platform in the future. Buy at your own risk. Sure, you can return your purchase if you're not happy with it. BUT first there is a $1.99 restocking fee. Then if you want your money back instead of store credit, they will charge you an additional $8.99. So they would charge me $10.98 to return a shirt that I paid $11.99 for. Nevermind. I just donate it to Goodwill, and in the future, I'll know not to shop on this app",2
4131,"Scam! They say they ship and it never gets to you. You can't speak to anyone and when you do ""chat"" for support, you get a condescending lazy rep who only reads the status of the app and pretty much tells you to deal with it. I did all the leg work to find thsle status of the order and explained to them that fedex is ""holding my order"" and that ThredUp needed to call and they said wait a few more BUSINESS days. Would never recommend.",1
4132,I love shopping again! Beautiful quality and selection,5
4133,Easy to search and filter,5
4134,"love the favorite button, all easy to use, tracking is spot on. Still doing a great job.",5
4135,Eco conscious site. Fun to use!,5
4136,No men's clothes.,2
4137,"Great items, great prices!",5
4138,Well I love this with today's prices it a real help although the quality is not known my order has not come but they seem to have a great site here!😁,5
4139,App works well except when trying to view orders or returns. Otherwise I like it and love shopping at ThredUp.,4
4140,"It's my first time buying here, Love the bag, nice packaging, many thanks",5
4141,Love thredUP! I have not purchased new clothing in over a year. Just wish the app wasn't so glitchy when refining searches.,4
4142,I open the app looking for something particular and next thing I know hours have passed and I have to go through my cart and prioritize what I can buy that day. Lol,4
4143,Love this app!!,5
4144,I love this company's purpose in reusing clothes vs buying new and supporting the mass pollution some countries experience due to mass textile and clothing production and clothes filling landfills because textile recycling isnt easily available everywhere. The selections and variery they provide are good to high quality at affordable prices and the app is easy to use and navigate on a mobile. I haven't had any technical issues with this app.,5
4145,"Love this website! User friendly, awesome deals!!!",5
4146,"Sent a box to them 8 months ago and it is still ""processing"" exceedingly long wait time for selling. When they do process boxes they give you pennies on $30 sales. They upprice everything. I can find stuff much cheaper on other resale apps. Try your luck on Mercari or Poshmark. I originally like the app. Now it feels like a scam.",1
4147,Most of my clothes and my kids clothes come from thred up! I love this app,5
4148,Love how easy it is to find great clothes and great prices! I find it easier to find what I'm looking for using this app more so than shopping at a thrift store in person!,4
4149,♥️,5
4150,Thrifting helps nature!!,5
4151,Everything i buy comes very well packaged and looks like new,5
4152,Doesn't work...won't even open after just downloading the app for first time.,1
4153,Love Thredup!!,5
4154,Large variety and description of conditions is mostly accurate,5
4155,I love the app. I love the clothes. I love ThredUp!,5
4156,What a great way to find clothing at great prices. The thrill of the hunt for the perfect item from your home. Easy to clean out your own closet to let them sell you gently worn clothing you no longer wear.,5
4157,I love this app. I don't have to scrounge through the racks at the thrift store for rare nice things. Everything is nice!,5
4158,"Kinda hoping to find a tab for men's clothing, but I guess that not. A thing with you guys.",1
4159,"The shopping was great, my Bible App. recommended the thredUP app., and it was great.",5
4160,I love that I can shop second hand all from the comfort of my home.,5
4161,I need to change where my kit is being shipped or cancel it but I'm having a hard time with customer service. Either we should be able to cancel or we should be able to get in touch with customer service easier,1
4162,"I have been beyond impressed with this clothing app!! The prices and quality are impeccable. Fast and easy shipping, the packaging and cute little green polka dots is always a bonus. So much to choose from. I especially love the breakdown of the sizes and the waist and rise of jeans and shorts. I'm tall so shopping for pants that fit is hard to come by. #thredup",5
4163,User friendly,4
4164,I absolutely love this App. I have changed my whole wardrobe and now I have the most unique and beautiful clothing. The cloths for the most part are very good quality.,5
4165,Love the app and the reusable clothes,5
4166,"Loved this app until recently. Constantly crashes when click on pictures of items and now MORE THAN HALF of my favorites are gone. It's like they decided to only let x-number favorites now, but we had no idea. Really unfortunate and turns me off of them. Why the cart time differences on accounts? You've been saying for over a year you're testing out different times, but still practice seems to be unequal. Customer service is zero help. Yeah, thanks, whatever, basically. Don't bother!",1
4167,"Much easier not having to sift through pages. But sometimes the page numbers helped me find my way back to an item (online browser version). Everything on the app is faster than the browser, though, so i prefer it. Thanks!",5
4168,Great resource for reuse and reasonable prices 🙂,5
4169,There's tons of variety and it is easy to return things if they don't fit,5
4170,Best place to get quality clothes for cheap!,5
4171,"Enjoying the app, so far. Good experience and some really good deals.",5
4172,"Great items and prices. Fast shipping. Love that it saves and shows me ""my sizes"" only so there is no wasted time looking thru everything else. Love it!!!! 😉",5
4173,"This app has been my hero during covid. I love thrifting and I have found some gems on here that are unique, which is my preference. I have been a member for awhile now and it has been a positive experience with threadUP!",5
4174,"Easy to use, love the clothes",5
4175,"Customer service is horrible, if need help,or need to talk with someone. Forget it! No one reads your texts or emails! Products are good, but if you are having a problem with the site or a return, good luck!",3
4176,"You're charged a restocking fee even if they send you an item that is stained, torn, or a different size than listed.",5
4177,Great selection of clothes. App is super easy to use and also very detailed if you are looking for something specific! Checkout was smooth. I love that it holds your choice in your cart till you decide.,5
4178,"ThreadUp, has not reached out to me concerning my refund I've overpaid and sent back returns and no one has bothered to get in touch with me about my situation or account 🤔 for credit or a refund. I will not do business Threadup 😤 again I would like a refund not credit.",2
4179,I have bought most of my work wardrobe from thredUP. Great quality and better prices!,5
4180,Everything has been great so far!!,5
4181,Didnt get to put in todays ECODEAL on my order.,4
4182,"Overall I love what Thredup has done for secondhand shopping. I think there is more potential for sales when it comes to measurement accuracy, fabrication details, and visual presentation (detail shots, models wearing more of the garments, etc). I also think ""final sale"" items are a really hard sell because it makes sense to always have a return option when you have no clue if the item is what you think it will be once you hold it and put it on.",4
4183,Great! Easy and fast!! Love it!!,5
4184,"I love being able to purchase such an array of brands, get them delivered to my door, and ship back is they aren't perfect. This app is always loading new items and never gives me a hassle to return if needed.",5
4185,The app is not loading since yesterday. Re-installed many times and the same problem is there 😔😔,2
4186,"So easy to use, good variety and style.",5
4187,"Shopped for years. Sometimes measurements are WAY OFF...& sleeve lengths,.measurements on skirts, cover ups, jackets would be a HUGE BENEFIT. Plus having to wait while things are shipped to one location prior to shipping to you is a ridiculously long wait time. SHOP AT YOUR OWN RISK bcuz returns COST MONEY & YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME TO RETURN. But you will find gems if you take the time to search.",3
4188,A total disappointment. Not one article of men's clothing. I am deleting this app right now. There isn't even a category for men's. ZERO Stars,1
4189,I now buy almost all my clothes from Thredup and I've referred many friends. I filter for Under $10 and now I have a closet stuffed with $5 dresses.,5
4190,I love the jeans i got from thredUP its so hard for me to shop for myself... And i ALWAYS have to try on clothes... But thanks to thredUPs accurate sizing chart it works great... I'm a small women so shopping is not always easy... But this was great....,5
4191,Great!,5
4192,Easy to use Love the clothes!,5
4193,Loading...This app will not load.,1
4194,Me encanta😋😋😋😋,4
4195,Absolutely obsessed with this app! Love everything about it!,5
4196,Have not used it,1
4197,I love just mailing so easy,4
4198,I love this site your items are wonderful and is at a good price too.,5
4199,"Can't login. I enter my email and it takes me to the page to enter my password which I know is correct because I just reset it, and when I hit the ""start shopping"" button, nothing happens.",1
4200,"Very supportive. I downloaded the app and THAT solved ALL of my question. Intuition and insight from start to finish. Great response time too! Highly professional. I'm from corporate level. This organization really IS good. My very first experience too. I worked at it for a long time before I bought. Before I got into crypto, I had much to learn. And, double-teaming my skills built proficiency so my online experience was...gee wiz...it was really nice. Okay?",5
4201,It's impossible to get back to your chat with customer service if you leave to do what they ask you to such as checking an item # or starting a return,3
4202,This app used to be my go-to shopping site but since they've changed their rewards system it isn't as glamorous. I've noticed I will shop on other sites now since their change. Which is sad because prior to their change they were phenomenal but now mediocre at best.,1
4203,Love it!,5
4204,You guys are terrible..no customer support just a robort who can obviously not answer all your questions..,1
4205,"I shop here often, once didn't receive something purchased and customer service was amazing about refunding my money quickly. Because of it, I'm a customer they will not lose.",5
4206,They suck they lie and they rip you off,1
4207,I love the clothes I get here ..,5
4208,"It works pretty well. The only glitch is that the notification don't always link to the right page and I just end up on the home page instead of a saved list, etc. Update: glitch above got fixed, but the app in now consistently freezing on page (e.g. I can't click on a item to view it, while within a saved search. I have to keep exiting out of the app and trying to more direct try view the item.)",4
4209,Nice easy to navigate. Can be glitchy with my Google phone.,4
4210,Easiest way to thrift. Highly recommend.,5
4211,"good value for shopping, wish the little dealio like tracking your package was more useful.",5
4212,"Overall it's awesome! I wish there was a better way to get in touch with customer support, but overall I think the app and the service are great. Update: April 11, 2022. App freezes and crashes constantly. Saved search is not following the filters applied. I don't know what happened, but the app is extremely frustrating to use now.",1
4213,It is sad y'all only wanna accept rich people items I have stuff I need to sell and it's not rich people items. Clothes that I can't fit anymore and clothes my son can't fit anymore. Such a shame screw yall,1
4214,It's a great place to buy secondhand clothes (I love all the search filters) and fairly accurate/thorough with measurements but the app itself doesn't work 100% for me. I can't look at my orders and many of the things under Account never load or show up very strangely.,3
4215,"This app used to function so much better, but it seems like every time there's a major improvement to the website, the app gets glitchier. The search function is MADDENING. If you decide to change your parameters mid-search, often times it will just show you everything from the category you're in, even though your parameters are clearly displayed at the top. I really like the company, but the app is a pain to use.",3
4216,Good app,5
4217,"I love the concept. I purchase clothing from here all the time. However, the app continually fails. It won't load, and I just get the little spinning wheel. I end up having to use the website.",3
4218,So convenient to find items you really want rather than constantly going to consignment stores. The convenience and access to quality products alone makes it worth while.,5
4219,I love this secondhand store. The clothes are always in good condition and the prices are fabulous for what you get. I could do without the restocking fees.,4
4220,"I kept getting an error message message after I entered my payment information it was telling me that, Request for configuration has failed retry retry limit has been exceeded try try again laterRequest for configuration has failed retry retry limit has been exceeded try try again later. Well I tried again later and later and later and later being 2 to 3 hoursWaiting in between.",2
4221,Updated to 5 stars. It was worth the wait. But it did take 5 days for the bag to actually get shipped. This was very disappointing and trying to reach customer service was a headache. But later it got to UPS I received the package within 2 days. The purse is beautiful and looks brand new. Was definitely worth the wait.,5
4222,"Such an endless amount of choices! I use to use a monthly service, and would pay $300 and up for just 5 pieces. Half of the clothes they sent, I did not like. Now, it is My choice for a great price. Love it!",5
4223,No mens clothes,1
4224,Hard to find what I want. PRICES HAVE DOUBLED,3
4225,I'm impressed. Nice clothes bought inexpensively. I've gotten 3 dresses so far and 2 skirts. I'm glad I found this place.,5
4226,"Quick, easy, and affordable and in the exact condition, as described... I can't love this online store, anymore than I do... I've been doing business with them, for a few years now, and I have never been disappointed once....",5
4227,The only thing that I wish was different with this app is when you are looking at an item I with the had similar items suggested at the bottom.,4
4228,Great,5
4229,"The app is not the best to shop on, definitely has a bunch of bugs and freezes frequently. I do most of my shopping online through the website. I do however, love Thredup and as much as I've used it I would guesstimate a 3% margin of error with orders. Customer service is great though. Great company, app needs some work.",5
4230,Easy to use & the company its self is great!,5
4231,My New favorite way to shop! I get so many compliments on my outfits from my thredup finds and the return process is so easy. I recommend it to everyone!,5
4232,I have nothing but love and praise for this app. My overall experiences are all positive. I give thread up a 5 star rating,5
4233,"I wish there was a feature to excuse specific brands, otherwise the app is great.",4
4234,"Fabulous! Great way to shop for clothes. I love that they'll tell me chest dimensions for tops, and fabric content. Linen, cotton, cashmere fabrics! And let's me hunt for name brands at drastic reductions. Love it. My sister loves too",5
4235,Love it. Easy to use.,5
4236,"If u love designer, high quality and high fashion at the same time break out in hives from retail prices and love to help the environment this is the promised land. I've bought and sold and its been a fantastic experience. Selling stuff is easy. They take care of everything but it does take quite awhile. Understandable considering how they must process every article sent to them. Research pricing . Its tedious. Worth it though! I sell, then buy. Its the BEST!!!",5
4237,"Like Treasure Hunting, delivered!",5
4238,One of my favs...simple and user-friendly,5
4239,The app is great! It is a little slow in some features for Android sometimes.,4
4240,I was skeptical until my first order. Everything fit like it was made for me. The descriptions made shopping easy. My only complaint is there was no return or packing slip enclosed.,4
4241,Is there a reason why there is not a mens department,1
4242,User friendly. The best!,5
4243,"Good, but i can't select how i want to pay for shipping easily",5
4244,No men's.,1
4245,"I took my time, but I found some great items! Very easy to save items, and simple checkout.",5
4246,I love thredup! They make it so easy to thrift and shop.,5
4247,"My order 20 days still not here yet ,taking too long",1
4248,Easy to use. Quality items.,5
4249,"I downloaded this app and it wont let me sign up now, STUPID MUCH!!? Why advertise the app if no one can even sign up -5 ☆",1
4250,My first experience so we will see,5
4251,"My sign in is through Amazon and it won't work on the app, so can't even get past the welcome screen. Guess I'm just stuck with the desktop site.",2
4252,Been ordering from ThredUp for a few years now. Find great deals and good prices,5
4253,Love this app!,5
4254,Can't even get into the app! So annoying,1
4255,Great way to shop used!,5
4256,Super easy to use and navigate!,5
4257,I love this app! I find alot of great deals!,5
4258,"Mostly positive, great shopping experience, easy to sort and find what I'm looking for. Processing of sent-in clothes does take a long time, clothing does ""dissappear"" without explanation, and the payout takes a long time. I wish they would also be more accurate and more detailed with the clothing measurements. Why don't they measure bust with cardigans and jackets or waist with skirts???",5
4259,I ordered over 2 weeks ago and my items still haven't shipped nor can get any help,1
4260,They don't label the correct department on cloths they have cloths marked as a woman but was actually a junior. And I was unable to get a refund because it was a finale sale it. Very frustrating,2
4261,There's no men's section/option. This is unfair and injust. There should be a men's section.,1
4262,"I enjoy this app so much. Easy to use, find best prices, and best bargains!",5
4263,Love! LOVE!,5
4264,"Great company, love the selection..",5
4265,It been nice buying clothes here during covid. Lots of choices & sizes!,5
4266,No mens clothes,1
4267,Great app. Sometimes glitches during an update and can't print from the app but used everyday,3
4268,I LOVE thredUP. And the app is super easy to use!,5
4269,I love this app. I've found some of the most beautiful dresses that I could have never afforded retail.,5
4270,Nice but yall might want to consider getting a steamer for the clothes,5
4271,"The fact that you don't have real human people that I can talk to, makes me feel so frustrated. I never received a tracking number therefore I did not receive my order yet I was charged for it! Goodbye ThredUp.",1
4272,"I absolutely love thredUP! I've gotten a whole new wardrobe of quality, name brand clothing at an amazing price. This is my new favorite app and will be using it for a long time!",5
4273,"Many things take a long time to arrive. I've had an order that arrived with missing pieces, and have not received a response yet. I would not call this company highly responsive. When you use the app to try to chat with customer service you get in a loop of buttons with choices that don't match what you're trying to resolve. My second order has been sitting there for 10 days and still hasn't shipped. I've tried to contact customer service three times and can't get through to anyone.",1
4274,"Cool concept, BUT there are no mens clothes...",2
4275,So far it's been a pleasure shopping. I absolutely love the updates daily on new arrivals. Sometimes more than one.,5
4276,Love thrifting through this app!,5
4277,I've been buying from thredUp for years and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed! They have such a wide selection of styles and brands to choose from. I feel like sometimes half the fun is exploring what unique finds are out there. Plus there's the added bonus that buying second hand means good things for you AND the environment!,5
4278,Best way to shop,5
4279,"A wonderful site to improve your wardrobe and you never have to leave home. Quality clothing, shoes, etc. I made my first, second, third and fourth purchase in less than a week. The variety is exceptional and brands are a plus!",5
4280,Not a men's section in sight. Did everyone forget that guys wear clothes too?,1
4281,My favorite way to shop. Always find something I like.,5
4282,"I absolutely love this app, the selection is amazing. It's very helpful to have it setup with the filter for style, price, color, etc. I am pleased with browsing thru the clothes this way. I think it's convenient to do this shopping",4
4283,Totally addictive. Very organized.,5
4284,"The app is very unpredictable. My saved items and clothing brands may fail to load, showing incomplete or empty lists when I know items are available. In these cases, I have to quit and reload the app for the items to reappear - this becomes very annoying when I want to look at multiple items that are saved lower in my lists. Shopping thru the app shouldn't feel like a chore",2
4285,"I am going to try it out 😉 I Love the idea of reusing everything and getting the absolute most out of a product before it's retired!!so many times things are thrown away way too soon, especially baby items.Thank you for the great opportunity to reuse stuff.💜",4
4286,"My only complaint is that some brands, like Talbot, have different size cuts, which some are made for larger hips, etc. Such as their Heritage. This is not indicated on the item. I ordered jeans much too wide in hips, not knowing they were from their wider style. Also hard to reach someone if there is an issue. Simply locating a person to ""chat"" with was frustrating. That said, I am addicted, need to stop and willprobably drop out. Not sending clean up kits. You have to print a label, box it up",5
4287,I can go to a clothing store..alot cheaper.....prices to high and the clothes have wrinkles....Not impressed...,2
4288,"Easy to use and fun to shop, rewards make the prices even better I've renewed my wardrobe on thred Up. I am taking a point off because the mobile app doesn't work that well, much better on desktop site.",4
4289,"Love this app. Easy to use, browse and buy.",5
4290,Has been a great experience! Ordering and delivery so quick,5
4291,"Best guilt free shopping ever! I've been looking for more sustainable options to shop and ThredUp does exactly what it need from it. Great filters and app, easy to find exactly what I want, excellent options, clothes that arrived were great quality too",5
4292,I love threadUP! They've got great deals on clothes and accessories and have frequent sales. They also give you the ability to sell clothes to them (be prepared for a very long processing time though) and give you points for every purchase that you can begin to use as credit. The only thing I wish they would change is to start offering men's clothes!,4
4293,"Lovely service, I love that I can shop consignment, for whatever I want: by size, style, brand, color, etc. Every outfit I get major compliments on, I bought on thredUP. I tell everyone to use thredUP! My only complaint about the app itself is sometimes it just sorta stalls and kicks me out... And I have to reopen the app and start my search again.",4
4294,"App is for women and kids clothing only so if you're a guy, don't bother downloading. I only downloaded because they had their Facebook ads target me and the ad didn't say anything about there not being men's clothing.",1
4295,"Thread Up has been such an amazing experience! The prices and selections are unbelievably awesome, and the measurements provided make it super easy to make sure you get exactly the right size every single time. There are always great deals and sales on the already majorly discounted items. I love shopping here! The only issue I've ever had is that the app and site do freeze up a lot so you have to close it out then re enter which causes you to lose your place. I still give it 5 stars!",5
4296,Quality app. Is good. Very easily navigated and user friendly.,5
4297,User friendly The app is very easy to navigate. I love the saved searches option so I don't have to keep entering information.,5
4298,"The best site I have stumbled upon. I love this site and have been only purchasing cloths through here. I also send the cloths in to them that i no longer wear and if they cant sell them they donate them for no extra charge. highly, highly recommended trying. They are an amazing team of people. Try at least once and you will be satisfied from how easy the site is to navigate, the ordering and delivery time are great as well. They also keep very good communication for the ones that do send clothing in for resale or donation.",5
4299,Absolutely best selection for plus size! Love the price!,5
4300,"I've received 2 orders so far and have another on the way since I started using this app at the beginning of the year. I love everything I've purchased, the prices are terrific, and the clothing comes exactly as described. Would highly recommend over competitors like Poshmark, etc.",5
4301,Clothes wrong size !!!!!! Listed as correct size.most bad condition return policy you pay ship and restock fee. Won't ever buy again,1
4302,Walking around back got to piss,5
4303,"They have had my box of clothes for over a month, and still haven't processed them!! I won't be sending anymore clean out boxes! Or buying anything either for that matter!",1
4304,Awesome,5
4305,I love their deals!,5
4306,I love shoping here wish we could get mens close on here.,5
4307,"I ordered my first order, so excited to get my new to me clothes! Unfortunately, FEDEX never delivered it. I sent an email on the 10th day of my missing order per customer services request to let them know it was never received. I have not heard back yet. I really hope they find my order and deliver it. If not, I hope they refund the order.",1
4308,Order was not as described and can't get any help do not recommend,1
4309,Payout percentages are highway robbery. Just donate to a thrift shop with nonprofit status and take your tax bracket percentage off your taxes. It's more than you'll get from these clown shoed thieves.,1
4310,Great app!!!!! Its a virtual thrift store absolutely love it 😀,5
4311,Lots of reposts of the same items and the filters don't work sometimes.,2
4312,"Not horrible but the cloths are bad, definitely not for anyone looking for anything but plain ugly boring clothes",2
4313,I wouldn't do business with them again after my results...,1
4314,Perfect,5
4315,"Shipment of orders has always been a very slow process through Thredup. Now Thredup bundles your order without the customer choosing the option. Bundling adds an extra 10 days to an already long process. It shouldn't take WEEKS to put the order together. And Thredup has no live customer support, which is pathetic.",1
4316,I purchased a few items just to start to see how the delivery and product quality was. I was very surprised!!! My order arrived fast and in excellent condition. I was very impressed and will definitely buy from thredup again.,5
4317,I have pretty much updated my entire wardrobe on this app! I tell everyone about it! You can get beautiful clothes for next to nothing!,5
4318,"I can't find my personal shops anymore, and my account info seems to be in a different place every month. If you're gonna make an app, provide the same experience as the website. Update: this feature is back again but there should really be messaging to the user about changes somewhere. The main problem I have with this app now is the way search and filter work. The filters are not adaptive so you have to figure out whether to go in via the Home or Shop page bc they work differently 😤",3
4319,God awful. Can't express my displeasure enough of how incredibly misleading the ads for this app are. Never once do they say anything about this being for women.,1
4320,Love this 😀,5
4321,No mens options,1
4322,I'm so grateful for an app like this! Saving me so much money and the planet!,5
4323,"I've used this app for a very long time (at least five or six years), the prices used to be reasonable, and on some items they still are, but over the past two years they've gotten higher, probably because they started letting consigners edit the amounts on their items, and now you see some really high prices sometimes. I tend to only buy when there's a sale these days",3
4324,My go to clothes store,5
4325,"Easy, convenient found exactly what I was looking for and for a great price paying is simple and easy have not yet received my order but so far so good. Cant wait to see it.",5
4326,This app is sexist asf towards man the6 only sale clothing for women and children you can't be a male on here trying to buy clothes your size because they don't give you the option to look for male clothes they assume your gender right off the back.,1
4327,Such excellent prices!,5
4328,Easy to look through with the filter options.,5
4329,Really interesting concept,5
4330,I've found that as long as you know your measurements its all good.,5
4331,"I absolutely adore this app💕💕💕 All of the clothes are beautiful and never in bad shape. I bought something in ""good"" condition and it looked amazing on me like brand new. The app gives me rewards and perks like free shipping or $10 off. I am on superstar level. It's really tough to not check the new items being added every hour",5
4332,How do I print a B2NB-2WPCC label?,3
4333,I love shopping at thredUp. Everything I get here is great.,5
4334,"Cute stuff, but I ordered a clean out bag and all I got was the link to a shipping label I can't use. Reached out to customer support and heard nothing back.",2
4335,Enjoyable....,5
4336,Why is there no men's section? Completely useless for me I'm out. Don advertise to me in my Instagram feed if I'm not your demo. Wth?,1
4337,Im soo IN LOVE!!! I don't think I'm ever gonna go to a clothing store again 🥴😍,5
4338,This has become my new addiction. Awesome clothes at more than reasonable prices,5
4339,Great selection of items. Arrives fast and easy return process. The app makes it even easier to shop!,5
4340,"Good pricing, reasonable shipping cost and time, good contact regarding purchase",5
4341,"User friendly, great deals on everything, it's like a kid in a candy store",5
4342,Fantastic descriptions of clothing. Great purchase experience. Easy returns for a credit.,5
4343,Great clothes for a fraction of their original price!,5
4344,Don't even bother with this app if you're a man. Totally sexist. They have been around for years and don't even bother to have any clothes for men. What a shame. I gave them two stars instead of one bc when I read the description they are at least forward about their sexism and state that it's clothes for women and children. Unfortunately for me I downloaded the app bc of an ad on Facebook and made the silly assumption that they would cater evenly to all potential clientele.,2
4345,Love it,5
4346,"The best place to buy clothes, hands down! I'm never paying retail again.",5
4347,Great app! I buy all my kids clothes here!,5
4348,"I'm an ""Economical Fashionista"" savvy lady that loves to dress with flare, style and spend my monies wisely. I absolutely love Thredup's variety of lovely merchandise!",5
4349,Thredup have gone down hill for me. Can't earn money anymore. Only credits.,1
4350,"It's for women and kids only, no mens clothing",1
4351,Great selection awesome prices making an impact!,5
4352,Im Happy 😊 I'm a Regular Now 😂 at the Threadup Store Website 🎉 I like it 😎 its actually way better than eBay😃 and they ship very fast and the Coustomer Support Team is Very 👍 💕 Nice and Helpful I Recommend Threadup🌹🌹🌹Most Definitely a 5+⭐ 💜❤️,5
4353,Too expensive for.used items,2
4354,Great prices love it,5
4355,Very good quality easy to buy and return.,5
4356,ZERO mens clothing,1
4357,"No mens clothing, just women, girls, and boys",1
4358,"If your app is just going to continuously crash for no reason, the VERY LEAST YOU COULD DO would be to offer saved searches and a way to sort favorites by style, type, color, etc. That way, when the stupid thing crashes (which it always does), I at least wouldn't have to start COMPLETELY over.",2
4359,"I absolutely love this app. So easy to browse by brand, color, material, pattern, and price point. Keep up the great work guys, 2nd hand is the future!",5
4360,Havent had the first issue yet couldnt be more satified 🖤,5
4361,"Have found many ""New"" and ""Like New"" items that I have added to my wardrobe! Items come nicely packaged and returns are easy. Shipping fees can be waived if you meet total purchase amount required and can waive return fees with points earned from previous purchases if available.",5
4362,"Love ThredUp!! But the app is still shaky. App closes out on me quite often and then must be relaunched for new session. App search results of a specific brand/store name does not necessarily show ALL items...? If I come across something I like, then clicking on that brand name or filtered search to see what else is available by them, the items I have JUST looked at & saved are NOT even shown in the results. How come?",4
4363,Awesome place to find great bargains on designer clothing.,5
4364,Love thredup. Obsessed.,5
4365,"I love this app and use it constantly, but recently it's almost impossible to filter your search because the descriptions haven't been included all of the details they typically do. You can search by size, color, brand, and sometimes fabric but lots of items fabric content is unavailable. Right now you can't search for style, length, sleeve length, accents, pattern, neckline and so on; which you typically can but I guess people are being lazy about uploading the items.",5
4366,Awesome selections and true to size. Fit perfect.,5
4367,Love love love ❤️,5
4368,I ABSOLUTELY love this site,5
4369,I wish there were more product photos sometimes... Every so often I feel like it's hard to get a good look at stuff... But I've ordered from here twice and was happy with my purchase both times.,4
4370,Randomly crashes sometimes but otherwise it's great,4
4371,App wont even open,1
4372,Won't show items given or sold,1
4373,They brake there rules. They use cookies to comtrol they relable the merchandise like getting something inexpensive and relabeling it with a Couture shopping points away hundre,1
4374,So frickin' cheap 💯,5
4375,Quality products delivered nicely packaged. Haven't had a bad experience .,5
4376,Favorite Favorite Favorite If you haven't downloaded this app yet you should do so now! Amazing amazing,5
4377,"Horrible customer service. Fed ex never delivered my items, although they were marked as delivered. Customer service said I was unable to receive a refund. The last shipment was in delivery status for weeks, and never received. Shame on me for trying again. I deleted my account, and do not recommend Thredup.",1
4378,Easy to use and to navigate through,5
4379,"Love thredUp! Most of my family's wardrobe is from here at this point! It's good for the environment, prices are reasonable, and I've gotten a ton of nice brands in new or like new condition for a fraction of the cost that they'd be elsewhere.",5
4380,Love thredup. Helpful search filters.,5
4381,The app has actually been improved in the year since I discovered thredUP. It's usually easy to navigate. One thing I 'd really like is to be able to fast-forward to see what's available towards the end of the listings.,4
4382,"Amazing clothes and awesome shopping experience! Love shopping from my couch! Super sustainable, too! Thank you!",5
4383,"biggest option for waist size is 34""????",3
4384,they r OK but I've been buying from them since the first started and there's a huge difference in the price the past 3 years the just keep going up on price for being used clothes they r selling it in price like they were new I know cause I look up the idem and see how much they sell new and its about the same or the same price it's crazy how much they had went up on price every year I use to buy skirts for $5 to $8 and now they r 20 to 30 dollars its a rip-off I'm done buy there its crazy,2
4385,No mens clothing,1
4386,"The prices are great if you are the buyer. But I would NOT recommend sending your clothes into them to sell for you. You'd have a better chance to make money if you took pictures and put them on the internet yourself. I sent in at least $300 worth of clothes, and they offered me $16. Ridiculous!! Never again.",2
4387,I ordered ten dresses.got them very quick .and each one was exactly what i wanted if not better.i am super satisfied with all aspects of thredup,5
4388,No men's clothing,3
4389,"If you love fashion and great prices, then you'll love Threadup",5
4390,"The store is ok but the app crashes frequently. Also, I got a notification with a discount code that didn't work",3
4391,"I have been using the up for many years at this point. I received a damaged package from them this month. I have been attempting to contact them since that time maybe 5 days. I have NOT been able to connect with a human to solve this problem. Their ""bot"" it absolutely worthless!!! It will not connect you with a human and also does NOT respond to my requests appropriately. I am just strung along in a circular conversion. I used to love thred up. I may never shop them again honestly.",1
4392,"ThredUp is now the primary way I buy clothes. They are very honest and transparent about the conditions of used garments, prices are great, the customer service experience is awesome, lots of great perks, and I feel better about my fashion knowing I'm shopping second-hand. I can't count the number of people I have gotten into ThredUp, I'm a super fan. My only critique (hence 4 stars) is that it can be time consuming to find exactly what you want: the keyword searching can be a bit clunky.",4
4393,Clothes arrived in good condition and as shown in the pictures. Shopping on the site is fun and easy. Plus the rewards and discounts have been great.,5
4394,"I'm hooked! I love browsing through the site. The selection is HUGE! I buy 90% of my clothes, shoes, purses through thredUP now.",5
4395,"Truly has been an amazing choice & the fact that they care about the environment enough to give their customers a discount in order to help. Prices are reasonable & if you think they're too high, mark them as your favorite and wait for the next sale- you won't be waiting long!",5
4396,"Love, ThreadUp. Always get fantastic deals. I've never had to return anything.",5
4397,Easy to navigate...Always find good deals !!,5
4398,Love it. Everything mailed quickly,5
4399,Just a great app! I don't any problems using the app. I do like the low price and a good merchandise.,5
4400,Update...LOVE!!! Clothes have been great. Had a problem ordering for 3 months but they fixed it so i am a happy shopper again. Update March 2022: shipping takes forever now. Also they didnt take a huge bag I sent in bc of strong odor they said. Every piece was washed in tide b4 I sent items. If that is a strong odor I think they should smell the disinfectant they drown the clothes in that I recieve from them. Think i will buy new from now on.,3
4401,"The convenience is nice, but when you purchase items from different locations, it is IMPOSSIBLE to track them- even on a pc. And customer service is trash too- as in nonexistent.",3
4402,Love it. Been a fan for years!,5
4403,Wasnt good,4
4404,Haven't seen 😕anything to purchase!!!!!,1
4405,SLOW DELIVERY Placed an order 2/18 for a polo shirt I needed by March 4th it's now 3/20 still haven't recd yet? There's no reason for this it's unacceptable!,1
4406,"Love, love, love this app! So easy to use, great prices, and super cute outfits! 😍",5
4407,I love ThredUp. I always find amazing items for great prices!!,5
4408,I am beyond addicted this app!,5
4409,I like what I've seen so far. Did my first purchase. So hoping it's quick. Just wish you had men and boys available,4
4410,"Love thredUp in general. But since I've been on the road, I've been using the app. Makes it a little too easy to shop. But it's nice that I can get notifications when something I'm watching drops in price or moved out of someone's cart.",5
4411,"I don't see a ""men's clothing"" section ?",1
4412,Easy-peasy to order. Impossible to contact customer support or initiate a return.,1
4413,Love the App and the product and prices only thing is the SloW:ness of browsing and adding Items to cart.,5
4414,Amazing deals,5
4415,So frustrating navigating the ap. Running in circles. Waste of time.,1
4416,"Search engine is terrible. Looking for ""sheer"" tops produces everything but sheer fabrics. Mostly designers named Shear. Not even close!",3
4417,"Always open when I need it, always new items loaded, App is well organized.",5
4418,My first order was great. My second one not so much. It has taken almost a month and Im still waiting to receive my package. I have tried to contact customer service twice and I am still waiting on a respond.,2
4419,Good deals and a wide variety of choices.,5
4420,"Click on shoes department, it goes to clothing. Every. Single. Time. Why?",2
4421,Found so many good deals on clothes and shoes it's amazing.,3
4422,Didn't like this shopping experience AT ALL! The photos of the clothing are horrible - sizes are hit & miss. I guess if you regularly shop certain brands it's OK but definitely not for trying out new stuff. Won't be purchasing again.,1
4423,ThredUp is a freaking joke !!!!!,1
4424,"Love ThredUP, but I do not like their new app.",4
4425,"delivery a huge problem as a buyer and a seller. Things get lost and there is no tracking. As a seller I lose money, as a buyer incredibly frustrating. happened multiple times and always brushed off.",1
4426,Pleasantly surprised with every order,5
4427,Easy to use,5
4428,"I made a little extra money by selling clothes I don't wear and then I got to buy some ""new"" stuff. The clothes are in good shape and there's so much to choose from. I got a pair of Jean's that are like new.",5
4429,The site is ok. Would be better if there was better description of the clothing. I've been less than satisfied with more than one of my purchases. Don't think I'll be shopping here anymore.,3
4430,The first couple times I got bad items I just shrugged it off. But it's happening way too often now. I've gotten items that were supposed to be excellent condition and they have holes and stains. That's not what excellent means. I think who ever is checking these items need to check them more thoroughly. A lot of the stuff I buy isn't returnable and now I'm stuck with garbage. I really want to keep using thredUP but I can't keep getting bogus items.,2
4431,I love Thredup! I had a return and it was so easy to do. I highly recommend this app!!,5
4432,"Very concerning practices. I requested a cleanout bag from them last year. It was, understandably, delayed due to covid. I mailed the bag back to them with my items in Nov 21. As of March 17 the bag is still listed as being on it's way. I have had bags listed this way even after threadup notified me that they were received. Threadup asks for 6 weeks for this process. It has almost been 5 months. Customer service is a bot that doesn't help with cleanout bags. Did you steal my stuff? Contact me.",1
4433,Horrible. I sent a bag full of clothes . They received 11/18/21. No other communication. No tel # to call,1
4434,"Environmentally friendly and great selection. I like being able to get only slightly worn more expensive clothing that I might not normally have access to buying. I would like a separate section for adult gender neutral clothes, such as tshirts that are not specifically female cut. My young (9 and 12 years) boys are in larger sizes, but I like getting tshirts on this site.",5
4435,I love thredup I have ordered so many new pieces for Summer. The app has been so easy to use and navigate and makes it easier to shop from my phone.,5
4436,Not good,1
4437,"I love this app, ive purchased alot of items (including my beautiful wedding dress) and everything came just as described, it came fairly quickly, its so easy to use, would and have definitely recommended this app to anyone looking for new2you clothes or shoes or accessories 😀",5
4438,Ordered 7 pairs of pants and absolutely LOVE them! Just put in a second order and can't wait to get it!!,5
4439,"I love this company they have good merchandise, only the bad thing take long time to send the item",4
4440,I am always pleased with the quality of clothing that comes from thred Up.,5
4441,Great clothes and customer service! So far I've gotten my orders fairly quick,5
4442,Great app and user friendly. Prices are a little high.,4
4443,Designer clothes at working women's prices!!! What a perfect match!!!!! Love every transaction...,5
4444,I will definitely shop here first! Clothes are clean and odorless.,5
4445,Great finds. Ordered multiple times already.,5
4446,Clothes looked all raggedy and worn and not washed.,1
4447,Selection. Quality. Affordability. So much fun to browse!,5
4448,I will buy a couple of Garments ......,4
4449,Love all the treasures I find here! The details for each item are very helpful in making me confident in my purchases. I would say half my wardrobe is from thredUp.,5
4450,Great app and store! I love it so much!,5
4451,"This app lags and often will not load. Images take too much time. Items are mislabeled and not sufficiently described, such as measurements, colors and patterns. The search function doesn't work well. You don't get what you are looking for and have to search again and again. It will add items to your cart when you don't want it to. The double-click like function is redundant. Why click twice when you can click once on the heart? It's fairly easy to navigate when working properly.",3
4452,Absolutely disappointed in the quality of what I paid for! Looks worse than what I can get at GoodWill. I paid $70 and only 2 tank tops were in good shape. Everything else was damaged or in poor shape.,1
4453,"You'll communicate with customers are poor. Nice merchandise, but poor communication",1
4454,I placed my order 10 days ago and it is still being processed when it clearly states on the website my order should have been sent out within 3 to 6 days. Also there is no way to contact customer service.,1
4455,"I just got a purse ,it was really cute 😍",5
4456,I love the app. Quick way to make my purchases. Love all the details before I buy anything! Dea M.,5
4457,No mens clothing.,1
4458,"I have order multiple items on multiple occasions, and have been exceptionally pleased, and I am picky as hell. If you know your sizes in the brands you order. You will be successful in ordering.",5
4459,I haven't used this app in a while because it simply won't load. Also I saw that they don't wash the clothes which does have me and I'm sure others about bedbugs 😱,1
4460,Love Thread Up! I love thrifting but making time to do it is not easy. This has helped me so much!!,5
4461,Love love love! Very easy to use.,5
4462,ThredUp is my new OBSESSION!!!!,5
4463,Good place to get high quality products,5
4464,"Reviewing app, not store. Doesn't always like to open and just sits on the entry screen. Can't zoom in to tell what designs they have. Swiping back in a way that would return you to a previous screen on other apps closes the app. Adding a rewards coupon isn't intuitive-you add it then have to go back to the rewards page to copy the code. It just needs updating overall. Checking out is easy. The search works okay (on par with the website). I love getting notifications about searches.",3
4465,Love this web!,5
4466,I've found some really amazing stuff on ThredUp. Great selection.,5
4467,"The app is great and easy to use! Not on the app, but on ThredUp: their filtering capabilities for searches are pretty inaccurate. It's not problematic when browsing, but if I am searching for a specific thing I could be scrolling for a long time in between inapplicable results.",4
4468,Not so great. Uninstalled app.,3
4469,"Great. Notifications can be overwhelming, but also helpful",5
4470,AWESOME 👍,5
4471,"The clothes are great but when they use Fed Ex ground it takes FOREVER to get the package, well beyond the estimated 7 day shipping time and no one will help me. Now I have $300 tied up waiting for my shipment and can not get answers to where it is or when it will arrive. I've tried contacting Thredup and Fed Ex and have come to no resolution. I'm furious!! I want my order or a REFUND!!",5
4472,Love shopping with Thred Up,5
4473,Sometimes the descriptions on the clothes are inaccurate but I generally receive what I'm expecting other than that. The app is easy to use and returns are easy.,4
4474,"Good but links sent to me in texts and emails do not open in the app. I click them and the app just starts at homepage. Would be nice to have the similar item feature back. Either way, easy to use and easy to return unwanted items.",4
4475,Do not like their clothes.,1
4476,Everything I ordered was in great condition and the packaging was adorable.,5
4477,"The first time I shopped the app I was trying clothes that I was uncertain I would wear...not a good way to judge the app. I just tried again and I am pleased. The items fit, they smell good, the quality is there and they were packaged by someone that cared. Super happy. Thanks ! I have 9 new items in my closet that I really like. 👍 👌 💛",5
4478,"Crashes a lot. Difficult to search a category without it snapping back to a different dept. I tried to look under Accessories, each time it changed to Women, no results. I can't get my Saved Searches to stay the way I set them, and they won't all load. I end up having to search typing the keyword myself. Also, would be great to sort by price or style, e.g. grouping dresses. Waist/hip measurements a MUST!! Impossible to be sure of fit without them! Fabric stretch also helpful. But love the store!",3
4479,I am very pleased with the timely manner in which my orders are delivered. Usually about 7-10 days.,5
4480,No men's,1
4481,"Great clothes and prices. I love the multiple filter choices. I heart or save items and watch them go on sale until I'm ready. Mainly golf, athletic and casual now that I work from home but have used for dressy work and party clothes too. Love that is good reuse . I even send stuff to sell.",5
4482,"Items arrived in a timely manner BUT I ordered Women's Jeans & was sent Child's size jeans. Thredup leaves no way to get in touch with them. There is no actual email & no phone # to contact them. The Return button selections send you in circles. ""You do not qualify for Returns at this time."" This stmnt seems sketchy. If Thredup wants customers to love to shop w/their company, contingency plans need to be in place & Returns/Exchanges need to be clear & user friendly.",2
4483,I enjoy shopping at Thredup!,5
4484,"I really enjoy saving, shopping and saving $",5
4485,I've been thread up shopper for the last 5-6 years and I've never been disappointed I get a lot of compliments and I do definite give it Friday.,5
4486,Love everything except I can not shop the outlet!,4
4487,"I love the concept of this company, and I've found some great items on here, but the sizing filters need work. I would LOVE if I could put in my measurements to filter clothing, rather than rely on a sizing system that differs wildly from one brand to the next. I would buy from thredup much more often if I didn't have to face the frustration of seeing a cute dress under ""my sizes"" only to find its 5"" too small in the bust. If that option were implemented, I would definitely rate thredup higher.",3
4488,"Pros: Excellent items, good deals, good for the environment. Con: There are several return fees ($1.99 restocking fee per item, $8.99 return shipping if you don't want a store credit). The return window is also 2 weeks. That's a bummer for an online apparel company that doesn't provide measurements. Overall, I continue to shop with them occasionally for the good deals. But I'd order more if the return policy was better.",4
4489,Experience was awesome! Did not have to send anything back!!! The problems I had was checking out. Took a couple days to resolve,4
4490,"Great clothes options. Easy to order from the app. The filter could use work for the kids clothes. I tried to filter by size, but when I applied the filter it still showed clothes in all sizes. I can filter by size for women's clothes, but not for the girl's clothes.",4
4491,"I love it! Before looking anywhere else, this is the first place I always search. Most of my clothes are from ThredUP I always find the most unique styles for such a great price. Thank you! 🤗",5
4492,Great APP so far. Love this APP,5
4493,"App is mostly good. Some frustration sometimes when trying to cash out (easier to just do that on a browser). But functionality is mostly good. One suggestion in the search: please add Sleeve Type to the filters. It would be extremely helpful to filter between sleeveless and long sleeve tops, and I know you have that data because it's in the product description.",4
4494,Everything is exactly as described,5
4495,"Eh. This app really has its ups and downs. The app crashes alot when I simply press ""back"" and it takes me off the app completely. I've returned so many items too. ThredUp needs to post more measurements. Some items have measurements and some don't so its hard to know if it will fit you or not. Also, I just received an order and it smelled bad and poor quality. I probably won't use ThredUp anymore. Don't waste your time!",3
4496,Love this concept. I recommend adding men's clothing to the mix so they can shop sustainably as well!,4
4497,You always get a great deal on exactly what your looking for!!,5
4498,LOVE the Coach purse and Coach wristlet! In beautiful condition! So happy and we be ordering again SOON!,5
4499,I love this app. The clothes are like brand new,5
4500,Easy to use!,5
4501,A little slow to load sometimes but otherwise great.,4
4502,Great deals,5
4503,Filters need improvement. The maternity filter is basically useless because it returns about 50% non-maternity items,3
4504,There isn't a men's section lmao.,3
4505,Perfect so far...one thing that is confusing though is the measurement for sizing...,4
4506,"Birthday reward never given. Clean out kit has even processing for almost 4 months now. Emailed support, never responded. Poor customer service",1
4507,I wanted to try buying from thredup wondering if it would be satisfying and I did and it is outstandingly exceptional!,5
4508,"Love this app, such great prices on clothing and everything I've bought is in great shape",5
4509,"Would appreciate showing pictures of ""tiny flaws."" Would like the ability to save favorites or make a wishlist.",4
4510,VERY good. I find cute outfits all the time.,5
4511,great experience!,5
4512,"It's a great way to get quality clothing at crazy low prices and you make a positive impact as well. The app shows what some people's cart, and what's sold in real time and it's really worth the look.",5
4513,Your sizes 5x are not correct when Bust and waist measurement are to small for a 5x,3
4514,"I love the service ThredUp provides and have found some amazing clothes for super affordable prices. I wish ther was a way to filter for measurements instead of S/M/L, 8/10/12. So often brands are different, but measurements are always the same.",3
4515,"My overall experience with the app has been positive. I have added great items to my wardrobe and really appreciated the mayernity items I saved on. There are a few technical issues I think could be improved; 1) Items that have been saved, but are no longer available should just be automatically deleted. 2) Saved children's items could be separated from adult items when you save them. 3) When I updated my sizes, I was still shown items in other sizes that I would not be able to wear.",4
4516,I absolutely love this app. I have saved thousands of dollars and get to wear nice clothes i could never afford to buy brand new.,5
4517,Best vintage cloths off of South Street Pa.,5
4518,Good app! Nice development!,5
4519,Good experience over all.,5
4520,"I love shopping with ThredUP but at times it, will just shut down.",5
4521,"The app is terrific when it works. If it's not coming up, I go to the website.",4
4522,I won't shop anywhere else ever again! My dream come true,5
4523,I was disappointed upon my first purchase from this company. I ordered a hand bag and received said hand bag with an obvious stain on the front. I'm not happy 😒,3
4524,Amazing deals! Love it!,5
4525,Awsome app & shopping,5
4526,Love this app/store. And they love me right back.,5
4527,Well my first order didnt go well. I ordered jeans which stated in the ad FLARE CUT LEGS...and the pic shows that. I received SKINNY JEANS...now I have to go through the return process and contact customer service for refund. Thats poor customer service!!! I only gave 2 stars because shipping was quick. Very disappointed!,2
4528,"It took 6 months to get clothes listed. They sold in a couple of months and now its been another 4 months of trying to get the $18.00 cashout. Every time I have tried to cashout, all the app does is take me in circles. This is a scam. Of course that includes customer service...round and round. Just take your clothes to Goodwill or another charity.",1
4529,Great way to upgrade your wardrobe.,5
4530,"Love the idea and love getting used clothes, don't love the app",2
4531,❤ love thredup!,5
4532,"Fickle App! I don't appreciate that certain links don't work at all in the app such as under Customer Support, only the chat option takes you someplace...all other options nothing happens when you try to select it. Also, I should be able to see progress on a return just like I can for an order. There isn't even an option to see this in the app. If there is, it doesn't work. It also sometimes just crashes and closes and yes I've cleared the cache. The app definitely needs work!",3
4533,I am obsessed with 100% linen and I have found so many great pieces at incredible prices!,5
4534,Perfect way to shop,5
4535,Very Nice Stuff!,5
4536,I've shopped on ThredUp for over 3 years. Still love seeing my polka dot box sitting on my doorstep when I get home from work! I get all my jeans and purses from Thredup! I won't pay retail ever again!,5
4537,Best shopping app EVER! Easy to use and very neatly done!,5
4538,Some stuff is a little over priced to be used but overall I love this site,4
4539,"Huge selection of clothes. Always check actual size though, some items are XXL but detail states 30 inch chest. Still very pleased with choice and service.",4
4540,Great experience.. Really enjoy recycling items through my phone vs. going to a smelly 2nd hand store. When i get my items they are nicely packed like a new gift. Prices are amazing..Luv..Luv..Luv... ThredUp!!!,5
4541,It's been more pics would be nice to make viewing better.,5
4542,Just finally decided to give them a try and downloaded it on my phone which automatically is a total game changer. One the clothes are so cute great shape to be thirfted and last but not least at all the prices are amazing 🤩😍 they might as well just take my bank card and that way I won't have to worry about missing something sexy or cute that I want for the low but now we just wait and see how shipping is going to be . Stay tuned :),5
4543,I had a great 1st order. Everything was like new.,5
4544,Horrible Customer service. Never get a response. I placed an order over a month ago and still have not received it. The tracking of your package doesn't work either. Never buying from Thedup again. Update: reached a number of more times and no response. Still haven't gotten my package either. If I could give a zero rating I would!!!!!,1
4545,Love the app!,5
4546,"The products have been delivered in a timely manner, well packaged. All my items have been true to size and exactly as I saw when I ordered them. Great company and I will definitely be a regular customer.",5
4547,I love thredup! The app is easy to filter and monitor my purchases.,5
4548,"Hit or miss, sometimes deceiving.",3
4549,"I love ThreadUp. I buy most of my clothes from them! Sometimes the app crashes and I wish that they'd buy and use a steamer. But otherwise, a great app. Sustainable too!",4
4550,"Love 💞 best quality, amazing prices 🥰",5
4551,"The clothes I have gotten are in really good condition. Shipping is on time. I love that I can enter my sizes in, so I can shop by size.",5
4552,"I absolutely love thredup, but the app is kinda glitchy. Sometimes my saved searches will just disappear, but they reappear if I close and reopen the app. If I click a notification it doesn't always go to the right spot, sometimes it'll just go to the app homepage. Otherwise it's a good app, the filters for searching are pretty specific. I prefer the notifications for my saved searches over the emails so I'm not overloaded in my inbox.",4
4553,Great store,5
4554,No category for men only women girls and boys,2
4555,Love it.,4
4556,Have been waiting over a month for refund on order never received. You can call as no number and there automatic customer help is useless. Unacceptable,2
4557,Not good,1
4558,"Love the clothes and good prices. What you purchase looks like the photos! Plus, buying thrift clothes is better for the planet and this company is dedicated to helping save it.",5
4559,"Shipping could be faster, but clothes are in very good condition and look great!",4
4560,"Incredible prices on amazing selection of brands from Walmart to Gucci, whether u are buying used or New with Tags!! App is smoother than website and loads my full wishlist (its massive). Items always discounting and thousands to choose from! Also frequent sales on top of the great deals and lowering prices. You can also sell or consign your clothes to them. Amazing environmental impact and low carbon footprint, committed to saving the earth by upcycling fashion! ♡",5
4561,"Mixed Feelings. The app is pretty bug-free on my Android. One of my recent orders was lost in the shipping process and customer service offered me a refund. I've had a few items that arrived damaged even though they were listed in Like New condition. My top two suggestions to make Thredup amazing are to have more than 2 photos of items, and to publish all available fabric details on each item. A picture of the tag showing fabric and care details would be a great feature.",3
4562,Great clothes,5
4563,App has come a long way in terms of accessibility and ease of use. Filter their thrift selection by size and it will notify you when something comes up that matches your previous likes. Pretty cool and makes me feel sustainable.,5
4564,"Overall I really enjoy ThredUp. It's a great way to find styles and sizes that aren't as common, and shop sustainably. However, their interface and information on each item needs work. Primarily- measurements and stretch. I need to be able to see the chest measurement of a shirt and waist measurement of a skirt and whether the fabrics stretch to know if I want to buy it. I've ended up with various items being too small for me as a result of this problem, which frankly, is easy to solve.",4
4565,Good stiff use coupons,4
4566,"thredUP is my new go to, it's the only way to shop. There are literally hundreds of thousands of items to choose from at great prices. And there is always a promotion going on. I jus love it. Thank you thredUP Team! Keep up the great work.",5
4567,"The app is easy to navigate, able to filter by preference, reduced price on numerous items, love the 1 hour sale.",5
4568,"It's so hard to connect with anyone when you have an order problem. The agent they have set up on chat takes forever to reply, when you need an immediate response.",1
4569,Is the app down? I haven't been able to access all day.,5
4570,Thank you... great experience,5
4571,"The deals you can find are alright, but the details of what you're buying are lacking. I would raise my rating if the listings had close up shots of the products and more detailed descriptions.",3
4572,Excellent 👍. Love thredup and the app makes it even easier to shop!,5
4573,To spendy,1
4574,Prices are great 👍 clothes are also great!,5
4575,"Hi...Everyone, It's Angie, 🤗 I Enjoyed Shopping at ThredUp. 👍😁 You will find Rare & Vintage Things, Try it out & Enjoy!!! Thank You & Be Safe! 🙏😉",5
4576,"This app is generally good and I'd normally rate around 4/4.5 stars. However, Ive been unable to access the app at all the last 5 days or so despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app, rebooting my phone, etc. Once that's fixed the app is a great way to find high quality clothes at reasonable prices. Additionally the email support team is super helpful.",4
4577,Love it. So much better than in-person thrifting. #IsaidWhatISaid,5
4578,"I love for buying, deals are epic bad for selling. I seen 5 out of 9 items told didn't sale had sold when I clicked individual link. Out of 3 bags of clothes gotten 3 $. But I just got their brithday gift, 10$ off or free shipping code, my choice. I still say 5 stars because buying wise hell yeah but if selling isn't don't expect much. Pennies extra is bout it",5
4579,"I love the app. I just wish all the clothes were on manicans. Most of them are, which really does help you see the form of the shirt and how it would lay, but they do have a few clothes that aren't photographed on the manican, and you really can't see how the shirt or jeans lay",4
4580,"ThredUp had a great variety of women's clothes in good-great condition, and a more accessible return policy than most other secondhand/consignment stores I've worked with. The app is well layed-out and no major bugs. The deals are worth keeping an eye on and the ability to favorite items and check back on their availability is wonderful.",5
4581,"Good items for sell, however measurments for items are inconsistant. I've seen three of exact items with bust measurements all different by many inches! I've seen this several times. It is very hard to tell if item is going to fit properly.",4
4582,Good and I love it 😀,5
4583,"Received 1st order so quickly, I ordered again. It will arrive soon.",5
4584,So far so good,5
4585,Great for buying good quality clothes for a discount. There's high quality designer as well. I've also been able to donate a lot of clothes for free.,5
4586,Never had a problem with the app or the company.,5
4587,"ThredUp made me happy until Christmas time. I received poor quality and completely battered items i could not get refunded. I reached out to Customer Serice about a pair of boots where the majority of the sole on a boot was barely hanging on and I did not notice until wearing them. The sole came undone & I almost fell over. I received a gift certificate for Christmas to ThredUp and did not spend all of it, thinking I would have a credit for the unused portion and did not. Not happy anymore.",2
4588,So far it's good,4
4589,This is nothing but fun. Shopping for beautiful things you want and thanks to ThredUP - can afford. Everyone should try it,5
4590,Very surprised there are no Men's clothes on offer here!,1
4591,I decided to try to shop second hand for everything that I can. Thredup has been an amazing resource to help me do that! Easy to use and affordable.,5
4592,Great site,5
4593,I love this app. I can't stop buying clothes,5
4594,I love this app & I'm slowly becoming addicted to it lol Not a negative thing to say.,5
4595,I liked the collection. I'm waiting for them to be delivered ☺️,5
4596,The app works well but it's easy to accidentally hit a button when you're scrolling and loose your place.,4
4597,"Thought this great, but spent all this time shopping and can't actually place order",1
4598,Thred up is great for updating your wardrobe! The only thing is I wish shipping was quicker!,4
4599,Very nice products and quick shipping.,5
4600,"Quality, hardly worn Chicos clothing for a fraction of the original price. I'm very happy with thredUP.",5
4601,I purchased 6 dresses for my granddaughter and they were all in perfect condition. I was truly pleased with all of them !!! Thank you !!,5
4602,Good experience,5
4603,"Something is seriously messed up with the search filters, I know this app is really fun to use but not when you search for Blu and pink skirts and get black shirts as the result, do better thred up",1
4604,You cannot talk to anyone about your orders. Online or by phone.,1
4605,Love the variety and low prices!,4
4606,"ThredUP has changed the way I shop! I love being able to buy brand new, high quality clothing at a fraction of the cost. Give ThredUP a try. You won't be disappointed.",5
4607,Great,5
4608,Very affordable,5
4609,Very good blessings,5
4610,I have an addiction 🤓,5
4611,I flipping love this app/site. 100 stars.,5
4612,If you like nice clothes and on a budget. This place is addicted and so awesome. I can't stop looking. The returns are awesome. The service is excellent. I wish I had known about threadUP. One shipment and after you get your first shipment you will understand.,5
4613,Thredup has very high standards you can bet everything you purchase looks brand new.,5
4614,"Well.....my early experience with ThredUP was so much better. Kits were turned around quickly, and could be expedited for a small price....NOW, it can take months and nearly a year. I cannot remember what was in my kit and the number of items in my most recent selling cycle is very small. I DO NOT send junk. Everything clean and in good shape....perhaps ThredUP has decided it is easier to donate items than photograph and market properly. Grrrrrrrr.",3
4615,Always easy. Always rewarding.,5
4616,"So far so good! Huge selection, lots of promo codes offered, don't have to wait forever on packages which is always nice. My only issue is I've noticed with some of the shorts and pants sizes it will be labeled as having a bigger waist size but when I read measurements for the same item the waist size will not be the same as mentioned in the label. For example, ""Zara shorts, 33"" waist "" then you click on it and scroll down to measurements and it will change to 27"" waist.",4
4617,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!",5
4618,"Slow, does maintain my size, shows everything instead of my choices so too Pages and then it gets confused",1
4619,"Would have given a 5, but they r gently removed the ""see similar items"" feature, and now I'm not sure I'll use the app as much. Was great while I used it though, loved ordering new-to-me clothes! Just not as convenient now as I tend to wait til there are lots of items I need before ordering, and now that I can't see similar items to what's sold it's too much effort when I'm ready to buy.",4
4620,Great idea but limited. There is no mens section? It's very women focused. No section to get boys clothes unless your a kids size.,3
4621,Easy to navigate and understand,5
4622,"Love love love. Go ahead, take more of my money. I enjoy thrifting and this site is fabulous & dangerous!",5
4623,I love this app. Not only do I find clothes I love but I buy for my whole daughters also.! And you can't beat the prices!!,5
4624,"I have fallen in love with thredUp. It's relaxing to shop here. No lines, no parking and great deals!!",5
4625,"I'm not happy! I received a jacket that was not the same size as advertised, that was okay because they said I would be reimbursed, well I wasn't and it's been months! I chopped it up as a loss and thought well okay everyone is human and mistakes happen. So I ordered more. I had the same thing happen again! I tried to contact customer support and it will not allow me to choose that option, but will let me choose other options.",1
4626,This is my number one place to shop! Love the outlet selection and great quality!,5
4627,Cannot reach customer service. Sent in a large bag of clothing oaths ago that has not been processed.,2
4628,"It was advertised as a place to *sell* my unwanted items, but it seems all they want is high-end *brand* names. All I got was a bunch of annoying emails & notifications to ""buy, buy, buy!"" I don't need any more junk! That's what's wrong with this society! Not what I expected at all. Deleting.",1
4629,"I've had a good experience so far with purchases. The only glitch for me is their policy on final sale items. I purchased an item that had been listed with the size wrong. I believe I should be able to return that item at no expense to me, for credit at least. No email for customer support is another downer. Chat takes forever. More descriptive options, like pockets, for searches would be appreciated. But the clothes I have ordered have overall been in the condition described and no bad smells.",4
4630,"Earth to thredUP All I wanted to do was order a Close Out kit, but I can't find out how you can do this. You can't ask using the Chat feature because it's ""unavailable"" 100% of the time. You can't ask about anything unless you have an order in process. I'm totally disgusted! There's nothing worse than a company that makes it difficult/impossible to contact them.",2
4631,"Ordering is easy, and so are returns. I like the sales.",4
4632,Good,5
4633,Some great stuff ... not expensive at all. Love it!,5
4634,"Great selection, unbeatable prices, fast shipping. All my orders have come nicely wrapped and all items appear new, even when they arent. Thank you ThredUp!",5
4635,"So easy, better than shopping at goodwill in person.",5
4636,I really want to like this app because it's an awesome concept. I would give it more stars if they had a men's section,2
4637,"Amazing deals, and I love how eco conscious they are. App is easy to use. Never had an issue with payment or shipping times.",5
4638,I love this app the clothes are so cute.,5
4639,Love it!,5
4640,Some Items are Deceiving,2
4641,I love shopping here and the app is the only way I go about it,5
4642,"Great selection, even better prices, easy process to both buy and sell, love that I'm also keep clothes out of landfills 😊",5
4643,I love shopping on thredup but it takes a while to get your clothes. Day 9 since my order and I still dont have an estimated delivery date.,4
4644,"Love the shopping experience and I place MANY orders, the only issue is I always have to do the checkout process twice because the shipping method button never works the first time around.",4
4645,Currently being ghosted over an order that I didn't receive. I was sent the wrong box of clothes and my $100 order is missing. No one will reach out to refund or credit! So frustrating and disappointing.,1
4646,"I was surprised to read a lot of the reviews, I have personally been totally pleased with my ThredUp experience. Packages arri e on time, all the products I receive are excellent quality and the refund policy is great. Overall I recommend and I am pleased!",5
4647,"Quality is NEVER as described, size is ALWAYS wrong, and if you DARE question it they'll just delete your account rather than refund the money or fix the issue.",1
4648,"Great clothes very very nice, very very nice price and fit very very well",5
4649,A little glitchy from time to time but really easy/convenient. Great way to save money shopping and help the environment!,4
4650,"They literally do not sell clothes for men. Only women, girls, and little boys. This app is useless for half the population!",1
4651,Very disappointed with clothing size and also I tried to get customer support and it did not work no one got back in contact with me and I cannot believe how long the items take to get shipped out it's ridiculous yes,1
4652,Great fast shipping. Like brand new product,5
4653,Super concept with great deals !,5
4654,I get more money if I sale them on my own,3
4655,Amazing site!,5
4656,I love this app and this company. I fully support what they are doing and I'm totally addicted to buying & selling clothes on this app!,5
4657,Excellent,5
4658,Been waiting since November to get my selling kit accessed. No news or emails. There were no 12 week notices when I sent my stuff in. Not ordering anything until I get my money from them.,1
4659,Love Love love this site!!!!,5
4660,"Very buggy. The app will randomly crash. When I receive emails from Thredup and click on a specific offer or item, it doesn't take me there, instead it just brings me to the main app page. Search functions don't work, especially for kids items. I'll try to filter by a specific size or type of clothing, and it just doesn't. It's frustrating trying to scroll through thousands of unfiltered items.",2
4661,I've been using this app for over a year now and it's been my main place to buy clothes from. Very affordable and cheap clothing to also nice and expensive clothing. It took me a second to get used to the search bar but once I figured it out I am always able to find what I need.,5
4662,Amazing and super easy to use!!! I love Thred Up!!!,5
4663,Sweet,5
4664,"Sometimes when I'm checking out the prices won't be the same any more even with the promo code the app provides besides that this apps is pretty cool, clothes are in great condition and didn't have to wait forever to receive them",4
4665,Best apo ever used,5
4666,Good app.👍,5
4667,"I love ThredUp but their recent changes bug me. They need to go back to modeling the bags on a mannequin. I shows the dimensions better and how it actually looks on a person. Also, it takes a minimum of 3 months for them to process the bags of items to sell. I also wish they'd put the color of the hardware on the bags in the description. Sometimes it's hard to tell in the pictures.",3
4668,"Quick delivery, great prices for quality consignments. Love it.",5
4669,"Luv the app! Easy to use, easy to navigate and able to put my sizes in.(which comes in handy for lazy people like me. ) I prefer using apps for shopping after the covid outbreak. My only complaint is that they do not always include the measurements. But otherwise it is a really great app for used clothes.",5
4670,In one word Love,5
4671,Love the clothes... wish I was rich!,4
4672,"The prices are great but they make it almost impossible to return anything or contact them. I dont have a printer so once I request the return unless i have a way to print right then, i will not be able to get a return label . It really is criminal",3
4673,"I have gotten SO many clothes from Thred Up, I'm in love with this app. It's better than thrifting at my local thrift store, there's better options and more designer wear. I've absolutely loved all my pieces that have come in. Nothing bad to say, I recommend Thred Up to everyone!",5
4674,Very slow speed despite my high speed internet. App freezes. Filters don't always load. Too frustrating.,2
4675,"Great clothes, phenomenal prices. I love ThredUp!",5
4676,Its cheap which is nice but it needs a better search system,3
4677,"Love ThredUp but the app is very glitchy. Doesn't show all items added to ""Saved"" and the app crashes regularly.",2
4678,My new Go To for clothes! I do not always like the clothes in department stores and this site has the clothes I pray to find in stores and the icing on the cake......at a DISCOUNT RATE!!!,4
4679,Great app! It would be nice if you could sort by saves to see what's popular and if there was a way to see items you may like based on past saves and purchases.,4
4680,Update: Emailed customer support and resolved. Should still be in the FAQ section. The app kept insisting I was in South Korea when I live in the United States and my account had a shipping address that is in the United States. I wanted to buy so many stuff but could not! The FAQ section does not answer the what to do when the app thinks you are in another country. I don't think I should wait around for customer support to open over a problem that should be in the FAQ on what to do.,2
4681,I tried to buy items many times and EVERY time I went to check out it would not let me get past the shipping address part. I reached out to Customer service support and that was a joke they NEVER responded back one time.,1
4682,So far so good! Measurements are key. :),5
4683,I doubt I ever shop in a store again!,5
4684,Good app affordable clothes,4
4685,I can always find what I'm looking for & in the right size. love this app its just like going in all the thrift stores around my area.,5
4686,App randomly crashes or stops working properly all the time. Makes shopping super frustrating.,2
4687,This is the BEST place. Items are of good quality and like new.,5
4688,I sent clothing to sell to this company back in October. My bag is still not being processed and it's February 17th. Customer support will not assist me. I want my clothes back or pay me. Come on.,1
4689,"When an item is listed as leather and is it polyurethane and peeling when you get it. No word about my complaint either. I'll never use thredUp again!! Almost 30 days later and still no reply or help from customer service on an item labeled leather that was actually polyurethane. Beware. Not sure how they get a 4.2 rating, but that is 100% false or stacked reviews.",1
4690,New stuff everyday great deal environmental consious,4
4691,"This store used to advertise as high end resale items. I was soo disappointed seeing how limited the selection was, the quality of merchandise and the cost. I understand it is a ""resale"" type shop, but at least consider the buyer side when showing items. Most of items are cast offs and should not be selling for these prices. If you reply, I will ignore you, You know I am speaking in all Honesty. But again, that is my experience. Others may have a different view.",1
4692,"ALWAYS a struggle trying to cash out...have to go to customer support again just to get the money from my clothes I sold to them. Good for buying stuff I guess, selling on here is not as great.",3
4693,"you have everything for women, girls and boys and leave the men out....great.....",1
4694,Why isn't there a men's section?,1
4695,(HANDS DOWN) BEST HAND ME DOWN APP ON THE WEB!!!,5
4696,Very good time to get some new clothes. Thredup are a good company. New or slightly worn is good for me.,5
4697,"I just placed my first order. I found so many items I love, I'm obsessed with thredUP !!",5
4698,Great bargains..it's like shopping garage sales from your couch..,4
4699,Some things really look wear out,2
4700,"No phone number to call, only chat or email and site Shouldn't allow sellers to sell products that are misleading. Now, i have to wait for them to email me back to start a return",1
4701,Won't ship to my address!!,1
4702,Excludes adult men category,3
4703,Its a fun app. I love clothes. It has a wide selection for reasonable prices. Get more for less.,5
4704,First time using thred up and it seems pretty good. The clothes I got (summer clothes) is in gently use condition. My order came fast. Yes i will order again.,4
4705,Customer service doesn't help very much at all. I tried to make a payment for some items several times over a 5 hour span and it still wouldn't go thru. This site could have limitless possibilities IF there was actually a service for Customer service.,1
4706,It's fun to shop and you can get some really good deals.,5
4707,"It's a cool concept and everything but they overprice so many items, even items that are damaged and unfixable. On the app there was a shirt that was NWT and I zoomed in on the tag, it was originally $9.99 yet Thredup was charging $17.99 for it? Make it make sense. You want to save the planet Thredup? Then lower your prices.",1
4708,"I used to love this company, but everything they do is buggy, and they are totally unwillingly help or accommodate their customers if there is a problem. Their customer service is abysmal, and if you send in clothing, they give you the smallest amount they possibly can. I no longer buy anything from thredup because their prices are ridiculous as well. I am sad to say, I'm deleting this terrible app and I am never buying from this awful company again. Seriously, use Swap or any other thrift shop",1
4709,"Although I still think the site deserves 5 stars... it has one negative. Last year, after my first purchase, my credit card info was saved and automatically was used. This year, every purchase requires putting in all my info. It asks if I'd like the info saved for future purchases ... I'll click on save... but it still makes me redo it every time. I've never had a problem with my card or purchases... it makes no sense. I have contacted them in regards to this problem... but no response.",5
4710,Easy to use and it has everything that your looking for,5
4711,I have had good experience with the app and Thredup in general. Only thing I ran into was I had a cart full that was getting ready to expire and I was in the process of checking out and one item expired while checking out and was gone by the time I finished my transaction. Wish when you add things to the cart it would make them all the same time,4
4712,"Amazing! I can now enjoy designer labels at a fraction of the cost! I have been ordering from these guys for a couple of years now and have not had to return one item. If you measure yourself according to their ""How we measure"" chart, you should get a good fit like I do...so go do some fearless shopping!!!",5
4713,Easy and quick to use. I always check the items quality prior to purchase. I have saved thousands$$$ by shopping here.,5
4714,Absolutely horrible!! I returned stuff. Still have not received my refund week's later. But I know that they received my stuff. Can't get a hold of anyone to chat or talk to someone to help!! I also ordered 2 Clean out bag's over a month and a half ago but haven't seen either one of them. Don't waste your time. The clothes you order are usually not washed smell as if someone had just had them on. Still waiting for my $113.35!!!,1
4715,Wonderful loving this app,5
4716,great,5
4717,"Very disappointed in the quality of items received. Some items were great, while others were stained and shrunk, lots of pilling, stains, and wash wear. Ebay for the win, when compared to ThredUP!",2
4718,App keeps closing when trying to shop outfits.,2
4719,Best place to buy gorgeous clothes and accessories at mind blowing wonderful prices!,5
4720,The app is great. I really enjoy being able to find items in many ways. The thrift the style photos are even better! Returns in 3 different ways! Shop anytime and save money.,4
4721,Bought several things that were damaged or not at described,2
4722,"UPDATE: Dropping a star. I still love ThredUp and will continue to shop here, but I feel like it's lost a bit of its luster for me. I'm hoping it's just pandemic related. I was disappointed to see the goody boxes get dropped, and I miss the ""other items like this"" feature, so would love to see those return. ------ I'm addicted to this site! I love the concept of online thrifting and always find unique styles and brands I either normally wouldn't have access to or couldn't afford. Love it!",4
4723,The first way I look for anything now.,5
4724,Crushing all the time,1
4725,"If you know your sizes you won't regret buying from thread up. Even the 👟 are great 😃 the second time around. I've bought everything I need from thread up now. I was shocked at the good condition s of their merchandise. Needless to say, I love 💕 thread up !! As long as they keep up the good 😊 work, I'll continue to buy everything I want & need from them. Julie Hendon",5
4726,"Thred Up is terrible to try to communicate with, I've sent at least 3 messages, and NO response. I sent items in, and still waiting to hear back about processing since September!!",1
4727,"Fabulous app to find all kinds of quality used clothes, shoes, and accessories at great prices! Easy to search and sort. And great for the environment, too.",5
4728,Awesome items at small prices! I am hooked!,5
4729,"Good place to sell clothes and shoes, lots of other accessories too.",4
4730,Really easy to search! Best thrift store! Great sales 👍,5
4731,Super easy to use. Doesn't crash.,5
4732,"There is not place to put specific delivery requests, such as a code for a door/gate. This was difficult for me because you need to have a code to get into my apartment building. So either my package would be left on the door step and stolen or the FEDEX delivery driver would just re-deliver it each day till I happen to be home to accept it. This would cause a delay in me actually receiving the package for DAYS.",3
4733,"The website for thredUP is great, I really love it, the app however is terrible. The tracking for returns just doesn't work, the help chat just closes itself constantly and none of the 'only on the app' perks work for me. When I reach out for help through their slow emails nothing ever gets resolved",1
4734,Very positive,5
4735,"If your goal is to sell clothes on here to get some new clothes with the amount you make, I recommend selling them yourself on depop, ebay, or through a well rated consignment store. Not very big payouts, not quick either. It took months for my kit to even show up as ""received"" in their system. I filled a bag, many items were accepted, I've made maybe $2 and my listings are about to expire. It is worth the effort to photograph and list your own items on a different platform. Even a garage sale.",2
4736,"I love the ""favorites"" option and how it tracks when items on that list are on promo.",5
4737,I really love shopping on thred up. Just a little disappointed that you can't use your points with sale codes.,4
4738,"Lovely site, clothes were terrific, nice support team!!",5
4739,This app is so easy!! And the items are incredible!,5
4740,I love the selection of clothes and page design. Easy to use and find exactly what you want. Prices extremely reasonable. Makes me happy and I'm going to spend alot of money on this site. Very addictive to look up things I been wanting only to find it affordable and findable.,5
4741,U love this website and the app makes it even easier to get new clothes😎,5
4742,Works great for me,4
4743,"I really love that I found ThredUp. The app is easy to use and you can even find NWT items at deep discounts. It's like a visit to the Thrift store without leaving your couch. Oh, and now that I understand the benefits of bundling - it will be tough to contain myself!",5
4744,Website could be easier to use. I wish there was a way to get faster shipping. Nothing ever arrives on time. The tracking system is garbage. It tells you that your item is going to arrive one day but it actually arrives two days later. I also wish they would quit making you wait for orders to be consolidated and just ship from each location,4
4745,App and site are frustrating. I hate the never ending scrolling especially when it's constantly closing out and you have to start all over so eventually I give up. They are losing out on sales because of this. The items that no on ever gets to....,2
4746,It works well....but it does glitch out quite a bit. I also miss the function of being able to shop for similar items if something is no longer available.,3
4747,Love getting clothes here,5
4748,"Actually a pretty great app for the most part. Process is simple. Returns are easy, but not everything is returnable. But there is absolutely NO customer support. If you have a problem you are encouraged to ""chat"" with customer service. This is just an automated question and answer thing, not a person, and it fails every time. Emails get no response. And there is no phone number listed anywhere on the app. They make it as hard as possible to ""bother them.""",2
4749,The search feature could be a little more user friendly. It's hard to pinpoint what I am looking for.,4
4750,Women and kids only ... Without an advertised second platform for men or even a negotiated partnership to consider the other sex?,1
4751,They sent me stuff that was way to big and not what I ordered. They make really hard to either get what u ordered or refund your money. SUCKS SUCK,1
4752,"As Being VIT @ THREADUP, their customer service really suck! Need a lot of work!!!",1
4753,Everything is ugly and expensive...,1
4754,They have went down hill with quality control and its frusterating when you have to pay for restocking FEE when there are issueswith products ive kept cllothes ripped and with holes because in the end it wasnt worth theheadache to send back its sad youd rather keep unwearable clothes then send back becausee all the fees make it where its impossible to buy an item to replace the damaged peaces you recieved I still have them and woulld load pics of the items but I don't think its poss.,2
4755,Awesome stuff I love shopping here such great shops just keeps getting better. They have lots of great clothes outerwear and accessories. I buy something every time I go on site. Thank you...keep up the good work!!,5
4756,"OMGOODNESS. I am in love with thredUP. I just received my first order (happy dance) and everything was just as described/pictured. I went with the bundle (multiple orders bundled together over 7 days to save on shipping) because I kept finding more treasures I couldn't live without. (LOL) By the time I closed up my bundle I had 26 items. All around great prices, excellent promos, super fun browsing (much better with the app) easy sort functions. If you haven't checked it out you really should.",5
4757,Wow! Totally shock to find Brand items for a great price. Definitely upgrading my wardrobe.,5
4758,"This is undoubtedly my favorite place to shop online! I love the outlet store within the app and the numerous discounts available for every purchase! The Goody Box is also a favorite of mine! I am never disappointed with the high quality items I receive, and the prices are unmatched anywhere!",5
4759,Great!,5
4760,Don't use it,1
4761,Love the name brands at cheap prices. Everything is good quality also.,5
4762,"Love the great selections and buys!!! Thanks, Thread Up!!",5
4763,"Great merchandise, Great prices, and Super easy website. Love it !!!",5
4764,"Easy, Convenient and Great Selections! Wish quality and measurements stated were more accurate - sometimes i receive ""like new"" items with noticeable flaws on them or waist/rise measurements are totally off! Also, pictures of wallet/handbag interior would be helpful!",4
4765,Love to recycle👍,5
4766,"The instant I open the app, it opens a Facebook login tab instead of letting me sign in.",1
4767,Shopping till you drop while lowering your carbon foot print!,5
4768,"Easy, fun, and satisfying",5
4769,No men's stuff? You may want to check out ebay as nd and see how user friendly they are So now I have to uninstall. pretend you are a prospective customer abs see how easy it be to find what you want. So far ebay and craigslist only work,1
4770,Do not do business with this company.. If you have a item to return or a few items they will try to over charge on shipping label.. and then not refund you the amount you paid for item. It is impossible to get a hold of anyone.,1
4771,Exactly what I was looking for and could find nowhere else...love this...great service..great prices...very happy customer...,5
4772,I just recently received my first bundle of clothes and what a surprise 😮 to see that they are exactly 💯 what I ordered. Thank you for helping me get my summer wardrobe started Thrdup!! I love it. The prices are great!,5
4773,Always a perfect fit.,5
4774,"So easy to use, so easy to find beautiful affordable clothing",5
4775,"I literally do not shop anywhere else for clothing purses or most accessories....thredUP has me covered and the items always arrive timely, and exactly as pictured and listed. Where else do you buy brands like Neiman Marcus or Gucci, sometimes new w-tags...? Loving this app and love being a Superstar thrifter too! 🥰",5
4776,No items for men 😡,1
4777,"I really enjoy searching for clothes. I'm able to limit my search by size, condition, etc, however I have difficulty just searching for petite clothing. The option ""include petite sizes"" but it doesn't exclude regular sizeS. I have to search through a lot more items. Also, the limiting seam length option is not available.",4
4778,I have gotten small orders from them and it has been fine. Just recieved my first big order and it came with not a single item I ordered.,2
4779,"I love shopping here. I can avoid the crowds, the bad smells of used clothes and skimming threw things that should have been discards 20+ years ago. I get to filter by brand, color and size. Everything I have purchased has come to me fragrance free and clean so I can wear it straight out of the box!",5
4780,The selection is fine but it's really expensive. Less of a thrift shop and more of a consignment store. Save your money and go to an actual thrift shop irl it'll be way cheaper,3
4781,They never have any ads on the app. It is really easy to make purchases and check on your points. Good app for looking up specific styles.,5
4782,I love some things about the app and I dislike Alot of things like it takes way too long to get your items checked in when you mail them in. Your Not making any money really. But if you don't have the time to sale it yourself then this app is great. It would be perfect if we can make more money and it didn't take almost a year for them to go through the items. I have been using them for 2 years now and it's because they really take a year to go look at items so I don't know what to do,4
4783,It's awesome I just wish it had mens clothing cause my oldest son wear men sizes,4
4784,"Eady to use app, quality items",5
4785,It's hard to find the vouchers and the 50% off stuff,1
4786,"The app regularly fails to show details and pictures of the garments when you click on the photo. I often have to put the item into my cart and then close the app and reopen it and go to my cart to actually see the details of the item. Also, Thred Up in general has been a major let down and has not been honest in it's processing times. They have had my Clean out kit for 4 MONTHS and have yet to process it. I'm done with them.",1
4787,"Great thrifting app I have 2 complaints. I wish the condition of items was shown better. My ""like new condition, some wear on item"" had 2 holes on the back side. It looked like a damaged, brand new item, which is different, so maybe a different option for seller to choose. More than 2 pictures per item might also help so the seller can better disclaim the condition of items. There is a section where seller can write measurements of items- Nice!",4
4788,I love that I can shope by my favorite labels!,5
4789,"This my first order. Fast shipping!! Just ordered yesterday and it's on the way already. So excited, and waiting for my ThredUP items to get here 👏",5
4790,"I've managed to find several items of clothing for a fraction of the cost but the descriptions about an items condition need to be more specific. ""Light signs of wear"" implies to me that there is less damage than a massive tear or a noticeable stain. Contacting customer service is difficult, making it more frustrating. That aside, it's easy to order and shipments are quick.",4
4791,I love love thredup.,5
4792,Love love love!!! I've wish I found this app sooner! Saved my wallet and opened my closet to more fashion! ❤❤❤,5
4793,Very easy,5
4794,"Great, unique, recycled clothing for a decent price.",5
4795,"omgoshhhh do not buy anything. I got my package and it SMELLED bad. like old man sweat. then they made me pay $9 in shipping and a TWO DOLLAR FEE FOR EACH THING I RETURNED ON TOP OF THAT. I also received a pair of jeans with a hole in the belt area, and I got some items I liked but again, they smelled like old man sweat. bad quality and I was basically scammed. I haven't even got my return money back yet.",1
4796,Over priced,1
4797,Good overall. Wish it had a sort and filter option for the items in your Saved. Also the Saved Searches appears to lose some of my searches then they magically reappear.,4
4798,"Great app it's like having a garage sale on line. I love sending my cloths to your app. Thank you plus you offer so much for each customer. Keep up the good, the great work.",5
4799,"Finally, an affordable solution for my cothing addition.",5
4800,"Found some really awesome designer clothes, some new with tags for cheap!",5
4801,"My experience with thredUp was great. I purchased 3 dress and they all fit. I used the measurements offed. The only negative that ha e 4 stars is the shopping cart doesn't allow you more than 12 hours, but when the 12 hours runs out it does save the items. Thank you!!",4
4802,Love the prices but is taking forever to ship it to me. It's day six and they still haven't shipped my purchase.,5
4803,Ok,3
4804,"Clothing marked wrong size on app. Trying to return, can't access app/site provided return label. Pop-ups are not blocked, so I can't tell why it won't load. For a $5 item I'm only going to get $3 back on because there's a $1.99 return charge... Pretty useless. May as well donate the clothes.",1
4805,Love the idea and the app works great! The clothes ordered are good quality and shipped quickly!,5
4806,I always find what I'm looking for and I find new and beautiful items every time I log in. My favorite clothing store!! 💜,5
4807,Some things are cheaply made. It is a hit or miss with their merchandise.,3
4808,Easy peasy ordering!!,5
4809,"There is absolutely no men's clothing. So it is blatantly sexist. It is so bad, I want to give you a zero, but that's not possible, so I give you a one.",1

4813,I love it,5
4814,Cute stuff at affordable prices.,5
4815,I'm always finding those special treasures that's hard to find anywhere else.,5
4816,I've enough $'s 2 do the sale what up saying oops!,3
4817,Ok app - but they rip you off on clothes.,1
4818,Never an answer to questions.,1
4819,Absolutely love this company!!! Always get everything I order on time an in great condition. Never had to deal w customer service but I'm sure they are excellent as well. I refer everyone I know here!! Keep up the good work. Thank u so much!!!,5
4820,"Do NOT use for resale!!! Only send them what you're actually willing to get rid of. They will charge you $10.99 if you want anything they ""reject"" back. Then they take an enormous percentage of the sale. And if you want the clothes back that don't sell they charge $5.99/item. Basically, you're buying back your item. I sent a bunch of WHBM cocktail, higher end retail and one couture dress and they marked them as ""casual."" Retail value is in the thousands and I'll make $100 minus the fees.",2
4821,Haven't bought anything yet,1
4822,"Such a great resource, have found many new closet pieces. Love all your filtering and points!",5
4823,Good but crashes sometimes,4
4824,Fantastic!!,5
4825,Simply the best,5
4826,This isn't really set up for anything but women and children... There's no men's pants no men's clothing no men's anything section... I was so disappointed I was ready to pick things up off of this app,2
4827,"thredUP is a joke. They want to help with sustainability yet charge 2$ per item to restock AND leave it in the very fine print that you have to pay your own shipping label otherwise be charged $8.99 to be refunded by original payment. Had I known the last portion, I would not have purchased a damn thing. Two items were in poor condition and not like photographed either, yet I have to pay lol.",1
4828,"My first order was disappointing to say the least. I ordered an American Eagle shirt that was supposed to be New With Tags, it was not New With Tags and it has a stain on the back of the shirt. FedUP with thredUP! Will not be making another purchase.",1
4829,I found great dresses for my son's girlfriend on here. She has been a happy young lady!,5
4830,Such a great experience the 1st time I've ordered again. Referred several family members & friends!,5
4831,Easy browsing. GREAT PRODUCTS.,5
4832,"Get ready to never shop anywhere else EVER AGAIN. I work as a GM at a restaurant. I am expected to dress business casual, but bussing tables, cooking, expediting...my clothes get ruined in a flash. I first tried ThredUp to find some nice clothes that were recycled and inexpensive so if after one shift it was trash it didn't feel as wasteful. Fast forward to 2 years later and I don't shop anywhere else. The app helps you find exactly your style every time. Amazing.",5
4833,Excited for my order that's coming. Can't wait,5
4834,"Worst experience ever! I decided to give this site a try, oh how I regret it now! I order premie size clothes ( even there were not cheap at all) but they are hard to find, and they send two 12 months items and one of them it's not returnable and the other I HAVE TO PAY 2 DOLLARS FOR RESTOCKING FEES + DELIVERY WHEN IT WAS THEY'RE MISTAKE!!! LAST BUT NOT LEAST NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL!!! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. GOODWILL WILL BE CHEAPER PLUSS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT WEEKS FOR DELIVERY !",1
4835,"There is so much to choose from, and I never have to leave the house!",5
4836,So far ive enjoyed this app!!!!!!! Also the transaction process is great!,5
4837,Fast easy accurate site,5
4838,"My wife used their program that sells clothes for you. They charged just enough in shipping and fees, so that even when some of my wife's clothes sold she hardly ended up seeing any $. We weren't really surprised but I wouldn't recommend",2
4839,I hate this app And I want my money back,1
4840,Works perfectly,5
4841,So far so good just placed my first order.,5
4842,Right now I have 3 clothing items I can't wear because the sizes were incorrect A childs pair of boots size 12 2 dresses marked 3X that's clearly not for a plus size women I don't have a way of printing out a return strickers (I just have my phone ) also with Covid Concerns its difficult to go to a post office !! ( your return time is too short !! ) Because of these issues I have lost appx $150 dollars !! I have ordered things I love also !!,4
4843,"I love this vibe and I love the app. My only area of improvement would be: in the product description, please tell us if the item has pockets!!! Every once in a while you can tell from the pictures, but more often than not I'm guessing based on the brand.",4
4844,2nd time ordering. Products are exactly as described and ships quick. I will continue to use this awesome app,5
4845,"My clean-out bag was received Oct 21, 2021 but still has not been processed.",1
4846,So much to choose from!!! I really wish I could get a discount to buy multiple items and sizes at once.,5
4847,Thred Up is great but the app is garbage. It's slow to load and freezes and crashes every time I use it.,2
4848,Easy to use.,5
4849,"The app makes it easy to find petite sizes even if some items in that category are actually regular size smalls. Easy to find size tall, too.",5
4850,Just ordered my first order 8 items for less than 60 bucks seems pretty good so I'm hopeful!,4
4851,"App tells me to download the app repeatedly & kicks me out every selection I make, req me to sign back in only to tell me my info is incorrect 1/2 the time. Horrible search options, yet I can only select search, not anything else cause it kicks me out, forcing me to re sign in. This used to be my go to app & online store but whatever changes have been made are for the worse & the app design director should be fired. ....and don't tell me to uninstall/reinstall cause it's a new DL.",1
4852,Love it. Better for planet. Better for my pocket.,5
4853,was kinda skeptical of this app but decided to try it anyway and im just blown away got the cutest outfits and love it all.,5
4854,"Awesome prices on name brands, some items still have the tags on them!",5
4855,I got directed to thredup from another site I saw a purse that I really liked it showed in the picture it was a baby pink and it gave the size dimensions I received it and it's horrible it's a terrible pink it's small smaller than the dimensions and now they won't let me return it not happy at all they should show more true pictures and size by getting better pictures and allow for returns,1
4856,"1/30/2022 upgraded to 3 stars from 2. Reinstalled the app and it's working again. But still a no go on the Fire. 1/26/2022 The app hasn't been working for the past few days. Tried logging out, now I can't log back in. 🙁 8/9/2020 No longer able to use on Kindle Fire. 👎",3
4857,"A great way to recycle gently used clothing. They send postage paid bags for you to fill and return. If you items sell, you get shopping credit. If not, they will even conscientiously dispose of them. I have both purchased and sold items on this site and have not been disappointed. You won't make a fortune but you'll shink your carbon footprint!",5
4858,I regret sending my stuffs to them to sell,1
4859,"Don't expect quick service if you're sending in items for processing & sale. I sent a box of items to sell last year, which they received 10/8/21. I was told it would be processed by 12/31/21. That day came & went. I checked again & it was updated to 1/31/22. I checked again this week, as time was approaching & I was curious if they got to it yet, & the answer to that would be NO. The new estimated processing date is now 10/9/22. A FULL YEAR after they received my items. Would not recommend.",1
4860,I bought 40 scarves for under $5 a piece in shades of purples and greens and gave them away at my wedding. It was gorgeous! I'm addicted to this app!,5
4861,Fumb sss,1
4862,Takes a long time to process the bags. It says typical (due to pandemic) 12 weeks. But I have bags still in process for 16 weeks.,3
4863,Easy,5
4864,"It has everything, it is great. BP",5
4865,Always happy about my experience and the clothes are always in great condition,5
4866,Goodness!! Optimize your app! Why does it take 5 minutes to load the app?,1
4867,"I had to switch my 5 stars to 2 stars for ThredUp. The app is kind of nice, not the best, but the information is so unreliable. Be wary of the measurements. Trust what the photo shows more than what the measurements say. I've had a few gems from ThredUp before, so it hurts that I have been disappointed too often now to rely on them for accuracy. I've been disappointed too many times and returned too many items to make this app worth it to me anymore. Shop your local thrift stores instead.",2
4868,Easy and quick service.,4
4869,"I love this app, but sizing is... Yikes. How can a pant be a size 2, high rise, but have a 34"" waist??? Or how does something listed as a 26"" waist actually have a 37"" waist measurement??? This is a huge flaw, I don't know who measures items when they come in but theres a big issue there.",2
4870,Nice to long to get clothes sold,5
4871,"They get it right about 90% of the time. 5% of the time they send you the wrong item and charge you when that item isn't returned because you never had it. 5% of the time they just don't refund a few returned items because whoever checked the return missed some, especially if it was a large order. Quality is good and items ship quickly - I really like the clothes I decided to keep so I will continue ordering until I run out of non-refundable store credit despite losing good money to errors",3
4872,The app format has changed and I cannot see the status of my two recent kits sent. Prior to the reformatting I could see what part of the process my kits were in. This is a lack of transparency and now I'm leary of doing business with ThredUp,1
4873,Love.,5
4874,"It is a bit overwhelming at first, but I will get the hang of it.",4
4875,I love it the prices r incredible and the dresses r buetiful,5

4877,"I can't rave about this company enough! Everything I've ordered fits perfectly, was shipped quickly, and you can't beat the price! This is where I will be shopping from now on 😊",5
4878,"My clothes came in a great box, everything was packaged so well.",5
4879,Such amazing deals on designer names! Keeps me in style every season.,5
4880,I ordered 2 clean out bags and never received them and tried to contact customer service but never got a response or through to anyone. This app is great until you have a problem.,1
4881,Great,5
4882,The items for sale are accurately described.,5
4883,"I followed a promotional ad from my social media feed, but there's nothing at all here for men. We like to wear clothes, too.",1
4884,Just love thredUP! Especially with the occasional added discount of 35%,5
4885,4 starts because the app freezes periodically and having to close and open again which drops all my search filters,4
4886,Fun to shop ...,5
4887,Good rewards program but it would be nice if you could search by clothing style as well as brand.,4
4888,"Terrible company, terrible app. Recommend poshmark or anything else over this.",1
4889,Worse than it was,1
4890,"Horrible company. Don't get the app, don't buy from them. All descriptions and pictures are a joke and it's hard to contact them for help with an order.",1
4891,"Terrible customer service, cancels orders at thier whim & does not respond to questions, still have not seen a 248.00 credit back to my card on an order THRED UP (not me) canceled. If I could give negative stars, I absolutely would.",1
4892,"The app is full of glitches. Trying to cash out is ridiculous because it just routes you to the clean out page. Same thing when you try to shop now. There is no valid chat, just a bunch of canned responses that are extremely unhelpful. Why have chat if there is no one to chat with?!These are issues that desperately need to be worked out. Cashing out should be a simple process, PERIOD!!",3
4893,"This is such a wonderful app! I love the ease of shopping, the deals, and variety of clothing. Not to mention I feel better about buying used rather than a bunch of cheap new clothes that are so bad for the environment. Get ThredUp!!!",5
4894,I would have to say that this app is okay. It runs slow. It loads slow. I wish they would leave the stuff you send them on their site a little longer and the payout was better. UD: The new reward system suck! I had over 3000 points to now having only 300 points. They say they have tiers of rewards but I'm a superstar and still don't get free shipping on orders over 59+ but nothing. I still have to pay for shipping when my order is over that price!,1
4895,Easy to use.,5
4896,"Items are hit or miss as far as correct sizing (e.g. UK vs US), have holes in them, stretched out, etc. I understand having to pay the restocking fee for most items, but if it's no fault of the customers (such as the problems mentioned above) i don't think the customer should be responsible. I was initially very excited about this app but i think the employees are so rushed with all the orders they try to process that they are sacrificing quality... Which is very disappointing. :(",2
4897,"Love this app! The filter is a great tool if I'm looking for something specific. But I wish I could pair it down even more, for example, I would like to search just maternity clothes.",4
4898,Very slow. App Losses SERCH OPTION CONSTANTLY. Latest Order: The Bathing Suit crouch was disgusting. What a Joke. The 'Tights' were footless and crotchless... What the HECK??? I waited forever for This???,1
4899,Great selection! Great prices!,5
4900,Can never email or contact anyone!!!,5
4901,"No men's clothing ?? What a joke , discrimination like this still happening is crazy Poshmark , real real other app as such all are inclusive for men it's 2022 men should have a option as well boy even get a clothing selection crazy",1
4902,Very user friendly! Love the items I've purchased!,5
4903,Love the sale's,5
4904,So buying from them is easy and effortless. Selling is a nightmare. I sent a bag back in over two months ago and it's still not processed. No word from threadup,2
4905,My items where lost and now I can't cash out screen keeps going blank this is a rip-off,1
4906,"Can't seem to find my address at all somehow, first time I had this type of issue before. Kinda pissed about it.",1
4907,Thred up app is fun and easy to use. I liked getting a cute box with cute shoes inside just for me. I intend to shop more!,5
4908,I love how easy the thredup app is to use.,5
4909,Love items I have received!!! Great quality!,5
4910,"Used to love this site, rapidly becoming disappointed, which is a shame. Selling- Their standards and explanations are not always clear. Understand the terms but have questioned how they are applied. Purchasing - Have had multiple packages lost, was refunded but since ship ground packages keep sitting too long at facilities and then have gotten lost. Dissappointing and have mentioned it a few times. App freezes up often but it's easy to use.",2
4911,Of coarse now that I look at the apps description when I come to bash them I see right away that they specify that they sell women's and children's clothes but it doesn't explicitly say that they don't sell men's clothes so hopefully this review helps other men to not waste their time download the app,1
4912,"I'm pissed! I bought a pair of heels and I get them and they are peeling bad, I mean really bad!! Can't return them!",5
4913,No men's clothes?! You should mention this in your adds!!!,1
4914,"GREAT!!! PRICES ARE GOOD, PRODUCTS ARE GOOD, SO FAR SO GOOD. CAN'T WAIT TO RECEIVE MY 1ST ORDER!!!",4
4915,I have been waiting since 9/29/2021 for my bag to be processed. I have another bag to fill but I am waiting to see how much longer it will take to see if I will try it again.,3
4916,Obsessed with ThredUp - super easy to use and easy to return things that don't fit.,5
4917,Customer support is nonexistent,1
4918,So far it's been pleasant except for 2 different orders was missing something and I've had covid so I have returns i haven't been able to send yet other than that its been great and the help I got on getting my money back was just amazing very helpful and understanding of the situation and was more than willing to help me resolve the problem I give 5 star's thanks threadup hopefully my returns go as pleasant,5
4919,"There's no ""Men's"" category.",1
4920,"Easy to use app with good thrift options. Wish it wasn't so expensive, but if you're willing to put in the tube, you can find good deals.",4
4921,I can't change my clothes size. I search for one thing and it gives me everything. I'm a newby to the app. I'm sure I'll figure it out.,1
4922,I've always loved this app but recently there was an update to the app that changed the reward points. I went from having enough points earned for free shipping to now needing 70+ points to earn free shipping.,2
4923,"I really enjoy this app - such a great way to find new-to-you & higher quality items I wouldn't normally be able to afford new. I do wish there was more info listed about items (i.e. does it have pockets, how many, etc). I get frustrated w/the swipe left to go back function as it will exit me out of the app instead of going back to what I was looking at previously. You really need to utilize the page selections at the bottom of the screen or back arrow in search bar. Still, love & recommend it!",5
4924,Well I lowered stars to 2 because it won't allow me to order a clean out kit. And I cannot figure out how to print a label because when I click the link it shows a blank screen and that's it. And now it just says clean outs are unavailable. So that sucks.,2
4925,What i ordered took forever to get a week past the date they told me. And what i got 2 pair of jeans were not what the picture looked like..Garbage! Waist of money.,1
4926,The app is easy to use however I wish there were more pictures of the garments and a bit more detail about them as well.,4
4927,Absolutely love Thread up!!! Is very addictive and so easy!,5
4928,"Found 2 pair of Anne Klein dress pants for $5.99 each (normally $90 each). Arrived VERY quickly! Awesome conditions! Fit is great! Thredup is new on my ""go-to"" list!",5
4929,Love it!,5
4930,Love,5
4931,I ordered shoes for my wedding and they are beautiful and a perfect fit.,5
4932,I love shopping here. Everything is in great condition and it arrives in a timely manner.,5
4933,"Complex cash out, hidden costs. Boring corporation like any other, enriching other corporations. Maybe disclose ahead of time that cashing out means thredUP forces you to pay Wells Fargo if you don't want store credit as compensation. Yuck.",1

4935,"Great app and site! But I wish that they'd make it so that we can sort our wishlist/liked items list by price as well. As well as a ""report an item"" for miscatagorized items.",4
4936,User friendly,5
4937,"So easy to use. Great features for shopping. Love the 7 day bundle, love the shopping cart hold for 3 hours. I can't say enough good things.",5
4938,Easy to use,5
4939,App works well. Enhances the shopping experience.,5
4940,Loves it. Too much. Way to easy to find lovely clothes that I know will fit because the measurements are listed.,5
4941,Always a superb experience!,5
4942,As a person trying to get at least a dollar for each piece of clothing totally waste of time. They charge for ex $8 a piece and give the buyer .24c. When trying to opt out of sales its difficult and notifications are sent whenever no set time so you could miss from opting out. I sent in boxes of items and they kept only the items with tags and sent everything else back. I read and followed their instructions. i should have just stuck to my gut and donationed to moms and children. Never again,1
4943,Love shopping with this app. Checking out new stuff everyday!,5
4944,I love the handbag I purchased,5
4945,Cool idea but takes for ever to ship items. They talk about being eco friendly but they ship all the items to one location then ship your items. Not impressed,1
4946,Love this site. Took me some time to learn the app. I like it now.,5
4947,Would be nice if they would like u affirm 😥,5
4948,"They don't refund your money back, only give in-store credit. I have bought some cute items but when I wanted my refund back it's been hell. Never again with them.",1
4949,"Not worth it, you get next to nothing for your clothes",3
4950,Haven't been there yet?,1
4951,"Do yourself a favor, do not purchase from this site. This place has bad practices. Haven't received my order OR a response from the company. My friend got her order and the items are NOT as listed on the site.",1
4952,Fun to use,5
4953,"Easy to search, very user friendly. Lots of options and much more enjoyable than shopping on a traditional department store app!",5
4954,I love thredup.,5
4955,Bad experience,2
4956,Moon and stars Feel like a kid in a candy store 🤩🤗😁😉,5
4957,"Convenient App!! Its quick and easy to order. I love their customer service who is ready to work out any problem I have. The items can be narrowed down by color, size, brand, etc. You can even bundle items and save on shipping. Love Threadup!!",5
4958,"Deplorable. I reached out after realizing that my order was placed but my new address wasn't saved. I was told I had to work with FedEx. FedEx told me only the sender can make requests. ThredUp cont to refuse help. I emphasized how important it was because the tenants would steal the package, which they did. ThredUp told me they'd refund me when it gets returned to sender, which it won't be. Save your hard earned money and spend it somewhere honest.",1
4959,My #1 preferred place to shop!,5
4960,I sent my stuff in back in October and they still haven't gone through my bundle,1
4961,Did not use,3
4962,"Haven't ordered anything yet but so far, LOVE everything about thos app!",5
4963,"Excellent, so many choices and options to share and shop. Thank you, cannot wait to see my order.",5
4964,"Thred Up came very recommended to me, but every time I install I'm excited by what I find, but actually searching for things in this app is very frustrating. I will get items recommended to me but when I go to search for them it pulls up no finds or hundreds of thousands of items that aren't what I'm looking for with nonfunctional filters. It's to the point where I find searching Thred Up products through my internet browser and using the resulting links easier. Great concept, but a bit clunky.",3
4965,"Cannot track returns. Takes multiple times to go to different places on the app. It gets stuck and stays stuck. Example: saved items, will not let you view the item no matter how many times you try! Sometimes it works and most times it does not. The one thing that is great is viewing items in a continual feed. This app needs a lot of tweeking. Right now it is not properly funtional.",5
4966,I love this app! It is a great way to buy used (like new) clothes at an affordable price!,5
4967,"Love thredUp and enjoy the app. I live in a rural area, with very limited shopping options, and I very much prefer to buy second hand when I can. I've found lots of items to add to my wardrobe that I adore!",4
4968,Addicted,5
4969,"Shipping is awful! Come on thred up you can do better! It takes weeks to receive orders and month to process a return/refund. Yikes. Good luck, I'm going elsewhere....",3
4970,WAS AMAZING...but I guess they got greedy because since Jan 2022 their prices jumped up considerably. To the point of store prices! For hand ne down clothes!!! Wow. I will never shop from then again.,2
4971,A really good way to online thrift :D I've loved all the clothes I've gotten from here and you don't contribute to fast fashion too so a big plus! The online store is good and user friendly from what I've experienced~,5
4972,Like what I see. Pretty easy to get around. Wish there were more pics of the inside of the purses and wallets,4
4973,"Good consignment, challenge to sell clothes when they shut down accepting clothes for over six months at a time. If they improved that, then they would be five star",2
4974,I love ThredUP! The only issue I have is the prices sometimes. For USED stuff the prices can get a little high but for a single mom of three this is my go to place for my clothes and clothes for my kids. Thanks ThredUP.,5
4975,Every time I get on this Thread up to get anything I can not get nothing from you all you do not take money orders and that's the only way I can try to get anything and so I think that's not right at all. That's what I think. Thanks. SheilaC,5
4976,"So far, it's easy to use. Simplified so you don't have to get stuck on anything. They have discounts, but I just wanted to order one item and see how it goes. I was reminded about this app from a person complaining about how another app, site was so bad, she was going to shop in Thread up only. So I wanted to see what they had. They have a lot! I have not even got out of the pants department! I do like VERY much how they post, the inseam, waist, color make ect. Thanks..😁💙",5
4977,"The only place I buy clothes now! I tell EVERYONE I know about ThredUp and really love their app. It makes it so easy to find exactly what I'm looking for, for myself and my children!",5
4978,I was so happy I learned about ThredUp from a YouTube video. I am very happy with their app and service.,5
4979,I find the best prices and everything has been in such great condition! Best way to shop!,5
4980,Only some of my saved searches load on mobile.,3
4981,I'd give 5 stars but have only done the buying part not selling yet so nor sure how well that part is.,4
4982,Love this app and concept!! I've ordered 2 times this week!! And omg quality name brand clothing and shoes at VERY CHEAP cost!! Download meow 💎💗,5
4983,"I live thredUp! I buy all my clothes used and this is a great way to buy used. Clothes are in great condition. Many items are returnable or exchangeable if they don't fit. Great company, great app!",5
4984,Not for me I like to be able to easily delete my accounts if I am not satisfied with that I'm sure somebody else would like it but not for me Plus I had to go on like three different website and still don't know if my account is deleted,3
4985,"I understand help is hard to find everywhere but the service sucks to the point I wonder if anyone does actually work there. It took 2 months to get clean out bag. And it's been 4-5 months since the bag was relieved by the facility. If you want to get rid of your clothing take it to a donation center or a consignment in your local area, at least you know you're not getting anything back. Don't waste your time here, a clunky app as well.",2
4986,"Easy to use, great selection!",5
4987,"Tried to login it says my email,and password was invalid, how can that be when I just install the app,no good, unstalling the app.",1
4988,way to expensive these are used clothes not even great ones . 34$ for a used hoodie lol no way,1
4989,Love love this app!! It rlly has great deals with great items to purchase!! I love their message as well. Would def recommend!!!,4
4990,If I could give a negative 20 stars I would. Their policies are best read by attorneys for any understanding! They stole over $200 in a return of mine because of loop holes in the return process. Finally they listened and returned my money so I am willing to give them another chance,1
4991,Good deals on clothes,5
4992,Do not get my reward points for all my clean out bags sent in. Messaged customer service about this never got a response. And the proceasing time for kits is bwyond slow. Sent a kit in August still waiting for processing. Looking for other selling options,3
4993,They have nothing i am looking fo,1
4994,"Installed this and when I opened it, it kept popping up to log in through Facebook. I deleted Facebook a year ago and don't miss it. I ended up uninstalling this app because it wouldn't let me do anything else except log in through Facebook.",1
4995,The app usually does not load.,2
4996,I love this online thrift store and appreciate that it's in an app form. My only issue with it is that when I click on a link to take me into the app (to a specific location) it only takes me to the home screen.,4
4997,Wonderful prices good quality return foes fast and easy,5
4998,"I love this app!! I've gotten some really cool stuff, love how it also tells you if the items are new with tags or slightly worn, also will tell you when items become available if someone decides they don't want it!! my only issue is the shipping, it's super expensive compared to like Shein app so therefore I don't use them too much! but overall awesome app and company, definitely recommend! haven't had any issues so I'm not sure about the customer service portion of it..",5
4999,Easy and fast,5
5000,No refunds given on lost merchandise through mail. Buyer's be aware.,3
5001,Easy to use. Affordable.,5
5002,"Needs (a lot of) Improvement. Search function is basic, with a lot of items not being listed and/or measured correctly. Notifications for searches etc are pointless, as they don't take you to the item that you are being notified about, only the landing page. App is slow and buggy. Rewards system is also bit pointless, if you use points for say, free returns, and you actually magically get an order where everything is as it should be you lose that reward. Nice in theory. Terrible execution.",2
5003,Very wide variety of gentally used clothing or new with tags. Sales all the time and rewards for purcgases are good.,4
5004,Found some good deals here,5
5005,Often crashes and won't let me search so I can't buy what's in my cart or look for other things. Very frustrating.,2
5006,Love it ! Fun way to shop and easy,5
5007,Need more 4 my size n taste,5
5008,I like browsing the app.,4
5009,Love it! Clothes in great shape and a great deal. I wish there were men's options though!,5
5010,Don't know couldn't get it to work,1
5011,It's pretty good and I like that you can save searches. It glitches every now and then though and works slowly for me at times. Also loading is an issue after making filter selections.,4
5012,"New.. am anxious for the ""*Thred Up Experience!!",5
5013,Many mistakes and descriptions,3
5014,I love the wide selection and the prices are great for the product quality my favorite place to shop for sure 😊,5
5015,"Easy, safe.",5
5016,"So, I've tried to purchase but the system keeps telling me ""We don't ship to Korea"". Emailed the company, no response. I live in the USA but USED to live in Korea. Dumb that they can't fix this. Lost a customer",1
5017,"Everything, EVERYTHING!!! I have recived from thred Up has been just the right size and has been on time! So i guess U can say that im Very happy with ThredUp!!!",5
5018,I love thredUP the company but I hate this app. It crashes and freezes ALL THE TIME.,5
5019,I love this store it's by far my favorite online store to shop at. Thanks thread up,5
5020,"I really enjoy the app! Great deals, good quality. Everything gets shipped in recyclable packaging and in a timely manner. Now they only have to start selling items for men so I can shop for the entire family.",5
5021,Easy!,5
5022,I love this website/ app. To get all these cute clothes and for cheap is fantastic.,5
5023,They dont have clothing for the whole family i need toddler boys clothes but thred up dont have anything for them,1
5024,I can't believe the beautiful clothes not to mention incredible deals I have found on this site! Unbelievable inventory too!,5
5025,I am very Happy with my two sweaters.🌹,5
5026,I really like Threads up and love prices and all. I believe better lighting and steaming the clothes before showing wouldn't cost a whole lot and make all the difference,4
5027,Very good love it,5
5028,"Love this app! Details on products, great photos and amazing prices. My favorite clothing app by far!",5
5029,"I love the eco friendly way to shop,and I love the deals. This app however I don't love, I'm going to say we are not even friends. It crashes, is slow,and if I have a gift card I have to go out of the app onto the website to put the gift card in so that I can use it.",3
5030,Love love love my thredUP app! Use it at least once a month it's crazy how much money I save for everything I get!,5
5031,Price high for condition. Only ordered once👎,1
5032,Great,5
5033,Takes 4 weeks to be delivered from a city 2 hrs away!,2
5034,Very Interesting and good prices.,5
5035,"Love it, so cheap and great quality!",5
5036,"Great plus size selection and customer service. I would like more details on the fabric and reliable verification on color, brand, etc. (For example, saying it's Lucky Brand, but is actually a Costco item or saying it is new with tags and the tags are from Poshmark) before buying.",4
5037,"I have a hard time signing in because an error saying oops, servers cannot connect. I have tried multiple wifi networks and and my own carrier data. The app is not working in my favor",1
5038,Works pretty well but some glitches in terms of searching. It will say there are no results for my saved searches even thought that's not true if you go on the desktop site.,3
5039,I love it!!!!!!!!,5
5040,Excellent customer service! My Thredup account was compromised. My fiance contacted a chat representative to cancel our order. The rep was very helpful and cancelled our order. They cleared the incorrect information that the person used to compromise our account. We are thankful and grateful for the employee that helped us!,5
5041,Thred up does not sell gentlyused clothes they steal clothes and never pay you for them,1
5042,I love the ease of browsing. The identical displays help to compare the styles and lengths. Not easy to tell condition. Great app.,4
5043,Great concept but payouts are extremely low and you can't combine earned rewards.,4
5044,Good quality items with the benefit of helping the environment through recycling.,5
5045,"So far, so good 👍",5
5046,"Whoever is listing these items, is doing so incorrectly. I ordered 15 pairs of jeans and almost half were skinny and were listed as bootcut. The hassle of returning items and the cost to ship it back and getting no response from customer service for a solution to this issue will make sure I'll never shop from this company again.",1
5047,"I really have good memories, and some of those clothes I still wear. I have lost, maybe for good, 30 lbs.! The old app helped me see myself as being normal. I am ready to explore again. (My osteoporosius has reduced my height from 5'2"" to 4'7"", and still going down.)",4
5048,I love this app!! They give a whole new meaning to cleaning out your closet!!!,5
5049,App issues. I have tried to reinstall the app but the problem continues. When I open the app it will open after 5 minutes or not at all,3
5050,Sweet deals if you have the time to scroll!,5
5051,"I sent a package of new clothing in October 2021 and never received payment for them. At one time I was following the package on the app for updates. As of today, I don't see the history of where it was received by the company. Check out the online reviews before selling items through this company.",1
5052,They don't have a men's department/filter. No department or filter for sleepwear either. At least not that I could find. Just seems like it's lacking in a lot features that other clothing apps already have. Could not find a single thing I was searching for.,2
5053,I need to return shoes I just ordered. They do not fit.,1
5054,I've been extremely disappointed with ThredUp lately. My first gripe being the consistently inaccurate fabric content. I have skin sensitivities that are irritated by synthetic fabrics so I shop natural fibers only to have clothes delivered made with different content. Shipping them back is also expensive seeing as you have to pay a restocking fee so you end up losing money either way. My most recent issue is doubling the cost of rewards. Disappointed.,1
5055,Horrible.Dont shop on this app! Lots of people are not getting items. I ordered a clean out bag and shipped my clothes and never got $$ and that was in August. I sent them an email and now I'm blocked to send emails.,1
5056,If i ever get the chance to purchase something it will be GREAT!!!!!!,2
5057,I'm always complimented on my sense of style.,5
5058,"Ap is easy to use, have not received my order yet but excited to see all my great finds... at such a reasonable cost.",5
5059,I really enjoy the clothes on here,5
5060,"Great app, does crash occasionally.",4
5061,Love it!!!!!!,5
5062,I love this app,5
5063,"I have bought so much stuff from thred up i had almost 3000 points and now to see that they changed the point system I have 295 I will not be ordering anything else from this app after I receive.my last order im going to Uninstall it..I received faded clothes, dirty clothes,and some items not fitted to give away and couldn't return them highly disappointed",1
5064,"App works perfectly, new clothes are constantly rotating in, and customer service is fast and easy to work with. I am never disappointed. Stop buying new clothes and start closing the loop with upcycling!",5
5065,Love thredup,5
5066,"Garments quality is bad. Prices are very high, and poor maintenance. It's come with a lot of stains... I would not recommend thredUP, to my friends...",2
5067,Not 5 because the app glitches and is slow running.so is the website. Beyond that I love shopping with three up,4
5068,Good so far...only had an issue with a limited few sellers.,5
5069,"I really like the app, overall, but I do wish ThredUp in general gave item/style descriptions instead of just brand/size.",3
5070,I want to change size for a gift and I am having some difficulty.,5
5071,Wonderful place to find clothes! Good prices too! I wish they still had the box where you can immediately pick what you want(not ❤️ it and hope you get)and have it sent with free shipping back if the items don't work out. Highly recommend!,5
5072,"I love shopping on ThredUP! I've given gift cards to other women, and they couldn't wait to show me what they bought. The available filters work well for me, especially sleeve length. I would appreciate a filter for elastic or other type waist. Sometimes it's hard to tell the waist type from pictures. Thanks for your efforts to save our planet! 😀",5
5073,"Terrible customer service experience and that's enough for me. I love the platform and the deals are awesome, but I loathe poor customer service and that's the reason I give it 2 stars. The chat feature is clunky and not user friendly and the representative I had was not helpful at all with my concern I still don't know when it if I will get my order",2
5074,Great place to buy clothing at a reduced price and help the planet by buying pre owned clothes.,5
5075,Pretty good,4
5076,"Keep getting wrong items. Two orders ago,, I got someone else's order. This time I ordered 4 pairs of jeans that were described as boot cut or flare legs, and got 2 pairs of straight leg and 1 pair of skinny jeans. I tried to contact customer service to return them through the app and kept getting re-routed backto shopping. There is no other way to contact them. I love the idea of the app, but I'm done with Thread-up. I'll just go to a thrift store where I know I'll get what I want.",1
5077,Love this store,5
5078,"I've enjoyed using thred up because I appreciate there envirnomnetal approach and haven't minded the longer wait times for shipping. However, the communication from ThredUp for Closet Clean outs is bad. I've waited 2 months and still just processing, no other information available. At this point my points have expired and I don't think my items will be processed, it's a shame I could have brought them somewhere in person to receive credit and most likely will in the future.",3
5079,great help lo,5
5080,Great thrift store,5
5081,Items came fast and were all in order and nice,5
5082,Thredup is without a doubt the only place I shop for my clothes and or shoes the prices are really great and the clothing is exceptional without about a doubt HANDS UP to thread up.,5
5083,Gender biased no mens clothing...Lame!,1
5084,"Excellent way to get lightly used secondhand clothes. Pros: Huge selection at a fraction of the price. So easy. I've updated my work wardrobe and gotten an outfit for a friend's wedding and some cute date nights. Ships quickly and packaged well without unnecessary packing. Cons: Sizing. It helps to know what size you are in a particular brand. I just Google that brand's size chart and I've done pretty well overall. WOULD RECOMMEND ADDING A FEATURE TO ""REMEMBER"" WHAT SIZE FIT WELL IN EACH BRAND",5
5085,My last purchase included an item that was dirty. Smelly and had dried food stains.It was disgusting.,1
5086,Love this app,5
5087,I was very happy with my order this time. My merchandise was better in person. Everything was wrapped with care.,5
5088,Great fun site for sure!,5
5089,"Broken Google log in compatibility. Gives a 403 disallowed user agent error when trying to sign in using Google. Can't give much of a review if I can't log in, in my preferred manner.",1
5090,ThredUp is a great app to get rid of ur clothes that are in mint condition .. there are great with your payout and they sell your stuff. For ui sent 47 bags and got over 1100 hundred dallors ty ThredUp... get the app you will love it...,4
5091,Fantastic and reasonable,5
5092,They have the best selection of women's apparel at a great price. You can get about any name brand you prefer as well,5
5093,"IF it arrives on time, wonderful app.",5
5094,I've found lots of amazing clothes on thred up,5
5095,"Buying is great. Selling is another story. I've been locked out of requesting new cleanout bags with no notice. Even beforehand, getting the shipping label was a hassle. Out of curiosity, I created a test account which had the cleanout bag request open. I'll be selling elsewhere from now on.",2
5096,Awesome name brands low cost!,5
5097,Not any yet,1
5098,"This app will routinely crash, which is especially frustrating when I'm in the middle of browsing and then lose my place + have to completely reset my search filters and start over. The notification feature also doesn't work properly. If you click on a notification, for example for a listed price drop, it never takes you to the referenced listing, just the home screen. I also wish there were more filter and search options in general.",3
5099,Lost 50 lbs and my new wardrobe from thredup is the best I've ever had. Sold my big clothes there too. Site is super easy to use and the deals are amazing.,5
5100,My favorite place to shop besides Mercari 😍,5
5101,Having diffculties cashing out my payments from wardrobe clean out.,3
5102,"I really enjoy this app. I've purchased a bunch of stuff. Never a problem. Returns are easy and smooth. I tell everyone I can about it Update : I have one hitch with the app. It takes forever to load the different sections. Shop, saved, account from the bottom of the screen it also takes forever to start up. Other than that A-ok.",3
5103,Their search algorithm is terrible. Great deals though,3
5104,Awesome,5
5105,Great love it,5
5106,"Please add waist sizes to the skirts, like you have for pants. Also, give bust measurement for jackets and coats when they are zipped or buttoned. This will help when choosing these items. Everything else is good.",3
5107,awesome deals on fashion and other things,5
5108,"Decent idea if the filters would work. The filter didn't work for the baby clothes, I'm not looking through 49K girl clothes that isn't the correct size",4
5109,I love getting reward points and discount prices.,5
5110,"Items are too expensive for used. Also, they just rolled out new rewards program that, once again, screws over the customers, i.e. you now need twice the points to get $10 off, more points needed to waive return fees, etc. I'm done with this company 😞",1
5111,Love this,5
5112,"Great selection, a bit over priced.",5
5113,"I've spent quite a bit through this app (I've reached their top tier in fact) and yet I am wildly frustrated that the ""refer a friend"" code has failed to work anytime I've shared it. They've also recently changed their point rewards to needing double the points to achieve them. Shipping can not be changed even if you have frequent problems with a specific carrier. It's a fun way to shop, but there's lots of frustration.",3
5114,Love ThredUP,5
5115,Nice website,5
5116,Wonderful,5
5117,Love the clothes and how relatively easy it is to return when something doesn't fit. I only gave 4 stars because it's hard to tell how the clothes will fit not being in an actual model. Otherwise it's a great way to build an affordable stylish wardrobe.,4
5118,"Thred up is awesome! New updated comment: I have been with ThredUP for many years. It has only become so much better. In 2015 I would tell anyone (even strangers) about ThredUP and the wonderful way to repurpose your lightly used clothing and even the ones we still have tags on... The clothes I have purchased from Thredup are also top notch! Buy, sell, save the environment and 🤑 money by thrifting with the best on line company. Awesome 😎👍",5
5119,"IT TAKES LONGER NOW...PLAN AHEAD My last 3 orders placed since July 2021 have been seriously delayed in processing times and shipping. It used to process in approx 3 days now its upwards of 14, shipping takes longer too. I have also made a purchase and one item never arrived, no explanations just a credit for the amt of that item. What happened to it? The tiered / ranking structure described seems a bit unfair too. Is this a club now? I mean it's still 2nd hand. I hesitate to buy now",3
5120,They just changed the loyalty point system from motivational to absolute greedy trash. It used to be fun to shop ThredUp. They keep making changes for the worst.,1
5121,Awful app. Wouldn't let me open it after installing it so I still had to go thru Google. Had to enter sizes repeatedly and the wrong sizes still came up.,1
5122,"A few little things like I wish they'd say at the top of the search results how many items the search turned up, but otherwise pretty great.",4
5123,"Love this APP! It's got GREAT DEALS, AWESOME REWARDS, and SO MUCH inventory. You'll absolutely find something for you!",5
5124,Your search options are useless.,2
5125,So the app is a little hard to navigate but i have love 90% of the items ive gotten through it. Ive made three orders and its been really great,3
5126,"Everything is great, my only problem is figuring out if my purchase is returnable. Most things were but one wasn't.",4
5127,No mens,1
5128,Sent a return did not receive refund. Reached out to customer service and their message would not open. Rip off.,1
5129,"Absolutely love Thred Up, I have gotten so many amazing clothes for great prices. There is something for everyone on this app.",5
5130,"Decent experience overall, but the search function is wanting. I hate polyester so I search for ""100% cotton"" or ""100% linen"" etc. and it always outputs clothes that include other materials (or even 100% polyester :eyeroll:). The search filter lets you choose materials, however those materials are often only a % of the clothes' makeup, so you still have to sift through the results yourself.",3
5131,Dont use it?,1
5132,The only place I shop!,5
5133,Great customer service! Always fixes my issues very fast,5
5134,Love this app and the store behind it! Great items!,5
5135,Wonderful! no,5
5136,"I love the selection and pricing. It narrows the ""field"" enough so I am not overwhelmed and the selection is on point.",5
5137,Edit: I had one item left to sell. Brand new! Went to reclaim and was charged for it.. I don't think I should of have to pay to get my own items back! So I let it go money lost even though very little!!! Very disappointed. I sent 2 bags. First bag got an awesome payout. Second bag took 4 months to process and I sent over 15 items that were never worn or worn once. Only 8 items were posted and bad payout. Last time I'm using this. Rather give to goodwill then wait for pennies.,1
5138,Love the always changing selection,5
5139,"Great quality options, fast delivery, nice packaging, app is easy to use and filter choices.",5
5140,Love this app and the store. Fun to shop!,5
5141,"Hard to find stuff I want, this app is for moms. Don't use if you are under the age of 30.",1
5142,"Cute clothes, cheap shipping, great discounts! Love this idea!",5
5143,Nice to fin colors I was looking for,5
5144,So far good experience with deliveries being on time and sometimes even a day early. Ordered 5 times already and loving it. App is overall user friendly. There are times when refreshing app is needed due to changing search options but simple and minor fix.,5
5145,No guys clothes witch idk if that is the point of the app or if we are just excluded bc of something else so meh,3
5146,Not enough filters and no men's clothing.,2
5147,All items ordered have been as described. App is very user friendly and deliveries come packaged very well and with care.,5
5148,Wonderful thank you,5
5149,"return policy sucks!! I have to pay $9 to return it or I can only get store credit?? they said the rewards would help but that only covers the $2 restocking fee! this sucks, makes me not want to buy anything",2
5150,App is very easy to use and I love the simplicity of returns! Most items are true to size so my returns have been minimal. Love that I can send items to sell too!,5
5151,I deleted this app. I don't find it very user friendly and I do not understand charging those price for used clothing just bc they are name brand. I don't pay that much for name brand clothes at the thrift down the street from my house.,2
5152,I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU SELL HOUSE WARES AND JEWELRY:),3
5153,"Worst app ever it never opens up it just says loading continuously so I was only able to get in there the first time I used it but it was super slow and now I even tried updating it, ""NOTHING"" ‼️🤬 UNFORTUNATELY I have to uninstall for now😞 hope things get fixed so we can try again LOL‼️",1
5154,Usually I love this site but this last order I was sent the wrong size. It was advertised as a medium but I was given a small,3
5155,Love how u get rewards and free shipping and can bundle! Plus lots of awesome clothes to choose from!,5
5156,I just received my first order it was a pair of shoes I couldn't be happier perfect fit they look brand new.,5
5157,Cute clothes and in great condition. Lots of specials. Have loved everything I've ordered ❤,5
5158,No one available to provide support,1
5159,Really enjoy this app. Not as cheap as my go to Thrift shops but perfect when I'm looking for something specific. And I love the sustainability data with each purchase.,5
5160,"I need petite and tall sizes, and both are easily searchable on the app",5
5161,Can't get it to ever load just buffers,1
5162,"Quality of website has severely gone down hill. I just typed in womans flat shoes. It's showing pants, shirts and high heels.",3
5163,I've been placing otder with for 4 years now and my biggest problem with thredUp is that once your order is placed orders will take about 2 weeks to recieve and There is no way to contact anybody live.,3
5164,I was surprised at the quality of the clothes! Love this app!,5
5165,I love this app. With the prove and selections of their clothes you can't beat it. Selections are great. There is nothing better than this app. They are a company without any faults.,5
5166,"I ordered some swimsuits for a vacation that is upcoming. I found some really cute ones and I hope they are everything I wanted. This app is super easy to use and so far no problems. I have not received my package yet, but I expect it within a day or two. So far so good! Loved my Anne Cole swimsuit and it for perfectly!",5
5167,This is addictive,5
5168,Good,5
5169,"Easy sign up, easy ordering, and fast delivery. Love EVERYTHING I ordered and will order again",5
5170,so awesome!,5
5171,very good service and quality.,5
5172,Why can I not select one of my saved items without the app closing me out? I can't add my liked items to the cart because Im unable to select them without being shut out :( I thought perhaps the update would fix this but I'm still having the same issue.,3
5173,I like to shop.!!!!😁,5
5174,"Holy cow, not even a menu option to shop men's. I can't fathom how severe the myopathy that led to this decision. Taking my man money elsewhere.",1
5175,I've had nothing but good service from thred up.,5
5176,Glitchy af,1
5177,"For shopping this is great, but if you're selling the option to payout has been broken for some time. You have to go through a web browser to complete a payout transaction.",3
5178,Great sales and rewards for even bigger bargains.,5
5179,Great experience so far! I bought some really nice clothes for a great price and I have finally down sized almost 50 lbs of clothes by sending them in to Thredup! Highly recommended!,5
5180,Terrific,5
5181,I love love this site and how it saves clothes. And money. I wish there was a men's option. And it is sometimes hard to filter options it gets slow. But overall it's awesome,4
5182,Love Tred,5
5183,Great service and prices!,5
5184,"I bought a handbag. When I received it there's decorative rings on the shoulder strap that are actually bigger than what you see in the picture, the pictures are deceiving, I was told I could not return even when I stated I would take a credit. Poor return policy. My first time ordering and most likely my last",2
5185,Nothing works. Whole app is broken ;c wouldn't let me submit my order or talk to customer service. Plus everything is just glitching.,1
5186,Thrifting done right! Awesome user experience and amazing clothes!,5
5187,I'm hàving fun buying clothes at discount prices. I now have a new wardrobe. Ty Thredup,5
5188,The only thing I don't like is using the back button closes the app sometimes.,4
5189,Great way to get rid of older clothes an anawesome way to get new ones.,5
5190,"As a General Manager I don't like leaving poor reviews as I would have contacted them directly if there were any other way. I recently found Thread. Was thrilled, and planned on a wardrobe gutting. Was prepared to spend more and make this my go to store. I live in a rural area. As a new member Dec 2021, I'll be last for free shipping, last for event sales, and receive less off, no matter how much I spend 2022. Rewards are based on how much you spent 2021. New members Dec 2021 are screwed.",1
5191,"In the age of online shopping, online thrifting is clutch. So appreciate this store. And the app is very easy to use.",5
5192,love it,5
5193,"I have donated twice now. Each time I had at least 10 items or more that were sent in. Several of those items have been new with tags, never worn. Yet somehow they are never posted for sale. Which leads me to think those unworn, brand new items are being taken by the employees. I'm not trying to make bank by selling unwanted items, it's just suspicious and dishonest of ThredUP. They are also horrible with communication and impossible to contact.",1
5194,"Great app. Some glitches with categories for shoes. Would be nice to be able to sort saved items by price and category similar to the search features from the main page. Labeling waist sizes and presence of real pockets on skirts and dresses would be helpful.. Would also like to only see similar items that are only in my saved sizes when using that feature. Overall, very happy with the app. It's easy to buy way to much stuff. Love it.",4
5195,Freakin love this app. It makes shopping way too easy haha This is the best place to find cute designer stuff for dirt cheap. Love!,5
5196,Great money saving app. Never pay full price again,5
5197,Not many options .in the brands that I liked.,1
5198,I love thredup. It is my favorite site. I recommend this to everyone I know.,5
5199,The best shopping experience ever.,5
5200,"I find some good deals on purchases. Most are new items at a discounted price. The bad news is, if you plan on sending your clothed to them, it takes FOREVER to get your bag information from them. No customer service to speak to and when they sell your items it's literally pennies or a few dollars you get back.",3
5201,Beautiful clothes at a low price,5
5202,Love it!!!,5
5203,Easy and efficient,5
5204,"Just received my first ThredUp order! It's exactly what I ordered! The fit is great, got to me in a good amount of time, and not a bad price either! The app is easy to navigate as well!",5
5205,"i love shopping second-hand and thredup is still my go-to online, but they've made a lot of changes. the app manipulates all the sales, different users get different offers and cart times. every ""sale"" is a coupon code, so you can't get a sale offer and use your points at the same time. it's a shame because i think they've ended up putting increased profits over sustainability.",3
5206,ThredUP had an incredible sale this weekend. I spent the whole time shopping on this app. Great brands with out of this world prices!! Probably my new favorite app!!!,5
5207,Very happy with selections,5
5208,Delightful Shopping-Awesome Selling,5
5209,I really enjoy shopping at Thred Up. I recieve my packages in a timely matter..Everything is folded and packaged nicely as shown on the site. I am able to afford quality name-brand clothes at a fraction of the price! All I have to do is look closely at the sizing charts My favorite place to shop!,5
5210,Great deals. So much cheaper than retail with the same quality.,5
5211,"Overall, this is an easy to use app (and I love being able to find environmentally responsible clothing). I do wish there were a few more filter options (for example: zipper fly vs elastic waistbands on pants and skirts). I've had good experiences with the company too, on the one occasion I needed to contacted customer service they were very helpful.",5
5212,"I wish they wouldn't have made my last day for return to be on Christmas Eve, but under the circumstances they worked with me. I appreciate that. I love Threadup. I have gotten only good quality clothes from them, for half the price, unlike some of these other wholesale stores, where the clothes are so thin, you feel they may tear. Not here at Thredup. I have bought enough clothes from them, enough to make a judgment. They are a good store, and I would and have already highly recommended them.",5
5213,You are too expensive,2
5214,"I absolutely love this app. Never had a problem with shipping or returns. All of the clothes are in excellent condition, many brand new with tags still and at a complete bargain of a price. I highly recommend!!",5
5215,"Enjoy looking at everything on the app. Would like more ways to narrow searches, such as sleeve length on dresses.",4
5216,Best site to buy used and new clothes from brand name to unbranded. Their clothes are in excellent condition and they always arrive on time.,5
5217,I love all the cheap cute clothes that i buy off here!,5
5218,"Not only unhelpful customer service, but they also pretend to be ""unable"" to help, which is really just insulting.",1
5219,Good prices as described,5
5220,Changed my mind on the stars. Last yr was great got bundle boxes all the time then i didnt have that choice anymore i got on yesterday and seen the bundle i used it come to find out 4 items 150 something charged to card it was not a bundle and i didnt order but it went thru and some items are non returnable and i cant get any anwsers to where my money went and how to cancel because no one will answer you back its fraud when u didnt order and the card was used and i have those orders pending,1
5221,They don't have men's clothing!,1
5222,Great clothing. Reasonable prices. Always have a sale. Specials on shipping. Earn rewards. Highly recommend.,5
5223,Really easy to use. Makes shopping fun.,5
5224,Can not order because of my password. Not worth the trouble,1
5225,"Great customer service,great price for quality clothing in all different price tiers,shoes,scarves,and handbags. Wish still had items similar to one you looking at located at bottom of page,miss that feature.",5
5226,See the review by Sherrie E. from 12/23/21 - she articulated my experience EXACTLY!,4
5227,"Wonderful, you all are the best, thank you for my new coach bag, I will be using you again soon.",5
5228,Love the selection and the prices! Great sales several times a year and easy returns!!!,5
5229,Love it the his clothes line,5
5230,Great prices. Quality goods. New fave place to shop!,5
5231,"So far so good. Used to a leading thrift, M**cari, so it's a welcome change 🥳",5
5232,You find quality with a good price & discounts customer service good also,5
5233,"The clothes I've gotten are clean, in good condition and don't smell like a thrift store.",5
5234,Excellent option for buying 2nd hand clothes & accessories. Great service. App can be super slow & lock up on the open screen,4
5235,AWESOME!,5
5236,No men's category!,1
5237,Lots of great stuff at thrift store prices. Sales are great too... the only issue is their rewards system. If you redeem your rewards you cannot combine that with current sales and you automatically don't get the free shipping for orders over $79! What's the point of having a reward system that doesn't work for the customer!,3
5238,Takes so long to process...it's not the same anymore.,1
5239,Very easy to use. I have no problems with this app at all.,5
5240,Love Thread. The savings are unbelievable,5
5241,I have used this app more than once. The items I received were in great shape and my granddaughters loved everything.,5
5242,They gave me a dollar and a half for 300 dollars worth of brand new items that I was unable to return to the store. It's a ripoff.,1
5243,App needs work.... I accidentally clicked on something about a credit... didn't give me any kind of confirmation that I was taking a $30 credit on one of my bags that was going to be worth way more. 2 bags have also been misplaced by them (FedEx showed it as delivered) and they only credited $25 on those :/ very disappointed. App freezes or glitches sometimes. I just had to delete and reinstall.,3
5244,Literally nothing for men. Not even a category for men.,1
5245,"I really enjoy using this app but lately it hasn't been opening for me either. I hope that issue gets resolved soon!! I also hope they get caught back up, i sent my last bag in October i believe.",4
5246,"I sent a bag of nice brand names and they didn't even get picked, most of it didn't sell and when trying to cash out my balance it hasn't let me, just keeps taking me back to the selling page. The cashout for each item is so low it's almost not even worth it.",2
5247,I love shopping on thredup! Great way to thrift from home and the app works great! The search bar could be a bit more helpful but using the filters still works well.,5
5248,Still loving this app well over a year later!!,5
5249,"Photo quality of products are shoddy; doesn't always capture the true colors/quality. Sizing is inaccurate. Have gotten items that were smelly/starting to tear. I still like the app because it is easy to use & usually has fair pricing, but for the most part I will be buying only accessories on this site. There are more stipulations for returning items than would be ideal, & that combined w/ bad reviews I've read regarding making returns made me keep my ill fitting items for yard sale.",2
5250,The best,5
5251,Only for women and kids.,1
5252,"I remember hearing about thread up ages ago, tried it out, think I even bought a couple things, but I forgot all about it! I recently downloaded the ap and now that I'm an adult that has to buy her own things vs when I had used it in the past. Totally a great place!! Love the prices, there's literally every brand! So worth using!",5
5253,"Love the store, the app is buggy and the search function could be improved. Photos are low quality, details on garments are very minimal. Prices and selection are great. No menswear. I would recommend ThredUp to a friend.",3
5254,Love thredup but the app no longer opens and why can't we get a clean out bag.,3
5255,"I typically use my laptop, however, I have found using the app fairly easy to use. The whole process; from looking up items to ordering or returning an item, all has worked without any problems.",5
5256,Great app. Needs work on narrowing down searches. Searching for a particular jacket color leads to 100's of jackets in color not chosen.,5
5257,Beautiful and affordable,5
5258,"They do not measure accurately. They have great clothes at great prices, but its pointless ordering things like jeans and recieving them and them showing and inseam measurment as 32(which is a bit long, but I can alter to shorten)but once receiceved they flood and even the waist sizes are off. I cannot make jeans 5 inches longer, and ordering a 29 or 30"" waist when its more like a 24 is a big difference. But then you have to either pay to return or use points to waive fees. Wont let me type more",3
5259,I have a shopping addiction now.,5
5260,I Love browsing and shopping on ThredUp~The buying transaction is perfect~~The shipping wrap tells a customer how much they are appreciated~,5
5261,And this out I was trying to buy lingerie and trying to silent by itself a gay person I'm not I'm interested in women,4
5262,"Very happy with service, and web site. 2 suggestions: 1. wish there was a short tutorial for new users. 2. If a garment requires Dry Clean Only, it would be nice if it were stated in the description. Happy Holidays, love ThreadUp☃️.",5
5263,Love ThredUp so much and the app makes it so easy to shop!,5
5264,I personally don't like it,2
5265,Always great selection and great prices!!!,5
5266,"Excellent selection of carefully inspected clothing, shoes, and purses.",5
5267,"The items I've received have all been high quality and as described. The app,however, is a horrible pain to use. At least on android,anyway. It constantly freezes or prevents me from clicking on items for details. It makes the shopping experience a huge pain.",2
5268,"The app is great. My issue right now is how items are packaged when shipped. Two of my orders this week arrived in boxes wrapped in tissue paper, completely soaked through. Items need to be dried and end up smelling musty. Including some sort of liner would be a huge improvement.",4
5269,"I have enjoyed using Thredup. I've ordered about 4 timed so far. It has been a good experience and I've been able to update my wardrobe. They have a nice variety of sizes, even petite and plus sizes.",5
5270,"Love this app, very affordable and lots of selectjon",5
5271,They do not have a space for men. like come on now,1
5272,Easy to browse / navigate through the different sections. Have not had any bugs or freezes - everything loads quickly and is intuitive.,5
5273,Facebook login keeps popping up when I try to log in qith something other than Facebook.,1
5274,Amazing!! Favorite place to shop,5
5275,Allways fun,5
5276,"Love it , good stuff, fast delivery",5
5277,I love thredUP. I get to shop with ease for exactly what im looking for. My ordered arrived quickly. And did i mention the prices for the value is awesome.,5
5278,"As of late every time I open the app it's a hit or miss whether it will open or just freeze on the loading page. It doesn't make a difference if I close out of the app and retry. Some days it just will not work. But then again somedays it does. Other than this (HUGE) issue I really love this company. It's a great idea and I find myself spending hours just scrolling through the dresses, shirts, and purses. Although I did turn off the notifications. They got a tad annoying. 5 stars!",5
5279,I absolutely love ordering from here. Easy to browse when searching. I can find lots of deals on name brand clothing for my kids and not feel bad when they grow out of it You can't sort your favorited items. So if you're trying to spend on a budget it's a little bit more work. I hope they add this feature soon. I'd also like to see men's clothing added too. I have a large family to shop for and having men's clothing would make this app my one stop shop for clothing.,4
5280,"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had on second-hand clothing apps. I had to post this numerous times to their chat, to their email, to their support center and still no action on it I still keep getting emails and texts from this company so I'm posting this here: If you continue to send me texts and emails like I have asked you numerous times to take me off your list and deactivate my account then I will turn you in to the FCC or whoever the hell I got to go to to make you stop and then",1
5281,There are only two pictures of each item. The sorting application doesn't do a very good job. I gave up quickly because I didn't get a feel for what each item was really like. If these are individual sellers then the requirements on how to post their items seems to be forced on them by a platform that doesn't have a clear picture of what the online shopping experience should be. Online shopping requires MORE pictures and not less.,2
5282,Great app! I love the mission of ThredUp to a more sustainable future for fashion!,5
5283,Great deals! Good quality items.,5
5284,EXCELLENT ITEM AND AMAZING PRICES!,5
5285,"From the used bikini bottoms to the multiple heavily wrinkled items, there is a wealth of garbage. Pass",1
5286,Useful App,5
5287,My favorite place to by clothes!!! The app is sure easy to navigate. ❤️💯,5
5288,"I've been a big fan of thredup since 2017 does dwindled a lot over the last couple yrs. And they do have TONS of filters to narrow search-short/long sleeve, fabric, color, etc. The app used to offer suggestions, based on an item that you're like, maybe it's too expensive or unavailable and they'd give you a lot of options that look just like it. What a wonderful thing I don't know why it's gone!? They also don't give enough detail on fabric or measurements and we have to pay for returns!!??",2
5289,"I am unable to delete my account. Keeps saying ""an unexpected error has occurred"". If you guys can delete my account, I'll remove the bad review",1
5290,"I love ThredUp as a site and pretty much exclusively shop here, but the app could have more filters, specifically sleeve length on dresses, necklines on dresses, sweatpants vs joggers...it's hard to dig through thousands of listings without getting bored and giving up. Also the ""rent the runway"" shopping filter seems to break pretty frequently. They could also take pictures of black clothes in different lighting to get more detail. All minor issues relative to the benefit of having the app.",3
5291,Luv This,5
5292,Love it!,5
5293,Addicted!,5
5294,The app is easy to use easy to shop haven't got my clothes yet but once I do I'll give a better review,5
5295,"Pennies on the dollar, months to price your clothes, hard to use money that you earn. Garbage customer service. Donate to Goodwill.",1
5296,I had credit in my account and now it's gone It wasn't even there for 30 days so idk what happened but I'm a little bummed about it,5
5297,Love it,5
5298,I've been using this site/app since 2017. I get ALL of my kids clothes from here and we're all very satisfied.,5
5299,Great low cost clothing!,5
5300,This app only wants you to donate & buy. I'm still trying to cash out monies in my account for selling & when you choose that option all you get is the ThredUp logo!?! Really...,1
5301,"They advertise only clean, good shape clothes. I have gotten dirty, nubby, holes in pants and things I never ordered. It was fine a year ago but the quality is going down. I will not order anymore unless they reimburse me for a shirt I never ordered.",2
5302,Good quality items easy way to shop!!,5
5303,"I love the concept behind thredUP and their services. However, I find it difficult to find something I want. I think the addition of more filters could help (i.e. short sleeve, long sleeve, etc.). There is too much clothes to scroll through so I have yet to purchase anything because I spend so much time just scrolling. Hope this can be added because I would really love to use this more and purchase from here in the future.",3
5304,no men's clothing,1
5305,Easy and fun,5
5306,Everytime I buy something from here it's always a great experience!! And I've got a lot lol,5
5307,A variety of different styles,5
5308,Luv thredup I've bought several handbags. Very happy.,5
5309,Love It!!!!!!huh,5
5310,Absolutely love this store ..I have gotten so many great deals and soooooo many options. I get hooked for hours. Always great deals going on too. 100% recommend!!,5
5311,"Why are you even buying new clothes? These are half the price, sometimes still have tags, delivered to your door, favorite brands, gives you discounts. Stop fast fashion waste and save money!",5
5312,"Love, love, love!",5
5313,"I've gotten several items here. Very pleased with most. When I haven't wanted to keep an item, the return process has been very easy and convenient. The minimal restocking fees can be waived by using points accrued in previous purchases. Great place to get quality items at great prices. I've got a closet full of designer brands for a fraction of the cost!",5
5314,"Love this app!! Great clothes in good condition, at awesome prices!!",5
5315,"Thredup is the best restore. Quality clothing, great description of items with sizing to assist in your decision. Customer service is prompt and friendly. Been a shopper for over a year.",5
5316,"Quality products, fast,accurate delivery.",5
5317,Convenience and value !,5
5318,"Love this business!! Everything is so easy and if you want to return it, no problem!",5
5319,"I love Thredup! Easy to use inexpensive like new,new and used clothes. Awesome administrators a bunch of beautiful people. Such a diverse bunch and bunches of items. I can spend many hours looking, buying, just browsing never ending cool stuff. Thank you for expanding and making much needed jobs for our struggling economy. God bless you all and thank you for helping me with my stress, anxiety and depression. I'm so addicted to ThreadUP!!!",5
5320,Why not...Closet is not the place for clothes that can be shared... Again...Why Not¿¿¿???¿¿¿!!!,5
5321,"I can search for things for women, girls, and boys... But no men's section? Seriously?",1
5322,Love thredup I tell everyone about it!,5
5323,"I recently was looking at you handbags and noticed a decline in your service. First off all the bags were ugly and second off most any leather bag had a warning that its chemicals used could be harmful to infants and children. I my have had my kids, buti would never want to expose another person's child to something harmful as that. It's like walking around with COVID. Only your friends don't k no unless you tell them. See this bag I got on sale. Yes it could hurt any child coming in my path.🤢",1
5324,Can NOT isolate size options so your always seeing sizes that arent yours and won't fit. It's dress shopping HELL.,1
5325,"Save the environment and your money! Super easy to find pieces the right size, color, and style.",5
5326,Very fun and easy to use. Lots of different styles for incredible prices. Best thrift shopping I've done in a long while!,5
5327,Slacks green not black. No where close to fitting. Way too small.,2
5328,Great bargains,5
5329,"I'm disappointed and unsatisfied for the items they sell...I received ripped, stretched, holey, worn out, and if you can believe it but clothing even had blood stains on the back of them...the fact that they send clothes in this manner isn't something I would ever wear ntm, the blood on clothing is a health risk or hazard...I'd advise against using this company.",1
5330,"I love this app , very easy to shop , and customer service is amazing ,super easy to return stuff . Always have great coupons and discounts .",5
5331,Uninstalled. Do not know how it was installed. Trying to play a game and I guess when trying to dismiss these sickening & irritating ads it was installed. Quit sending emails. NOT INTERESTED.,1
5332,Love this app and this company. I look like an executive without having to spend my whole paycheck,5
5333,Great app! Easy and fun to shop and returns are super easy too if something doesn't fit! Great selection too!,5
5334,Love this app! It's totally addicting! Get deals on clothing. I buy for me and my kiddos. This is nose the main way I shop.,5
5335,I really like the good deals I got! Hope items are as nice in person.,5
5336,"It's not easy to cash out...press the cash out button and the screen flashes back to former screen. Update:. I am still using ThreadUp to repurpose clothing and shoes but si.ply use the credit from sales to acquire new items for my wardrobe. I have found some great ""new with tags"" items and have made room in my closet by selling on ThreadUp.",4
5337,Wouldn't have paid this if I'd seen how the bag actually looked...,1
5338,Works great,5
5339,"it's a total nightmare!! lost All my Anthropologie clothes to them , can't get anyone on a actual phone sent in 3 boxes have sold only 3 things for pennies, where is my clothes? I'd throw them out before considering with this what ever it is",1
5340,Love the app and how simple the purchasing process is. Very reliable and has great sales,5
5341,Nothing for men,2
5342,"Fun, rewarding, and nice clothes in good/great condition!",5
5343,Great way to add a few extra things to my closet!,5
5344,So awesome! Better than thrift store shopping in person!,5
5345,Love how easy it is to find your items and the stock changes daily. The reward system works really well with meaningful savings.,5
5346,I had nothing bad luck on my account I sent in bady clothes never was credited back an just made pennies never a good amount take mths to come t a amount t cash out,1
5347,This app is wonderful!! I am avid thrifter and love using this to find unique items. The app is super easy to use too.,5
5348,Did receive my product but it was in horrible shape very dirty,2
5349,Great! Thanks!!,5
5350,"As of late, the app won't open despite several uninstall/reinstall attempts. I'm so disappointed.",1
5351,Love it! 😀,5
5352,This is my go to daily. I can afford the style and it's easy to use. I have ordered from them twice now and everything was better than I had expected. All the expensive brand clothing is affordable and like new. U can't tell the difference. I recommend everyone to try this first U will love it,5
5353,"Love love love this app and I will always shop from it, I love buying 2nd hand and this app gives me just that plus more. Although, when I shop around and then close the app, if I try to open it again it never opens fully. It just stays on the green opening page. I have to close it again and after hours go by I can open it and it will allow me to shop again. And a men's section would be great, I would love to be able to buy things for the men in the family! Other then that it's a great app.",4
5354,"The thredUP app is easy to use and customer-friendly. I appreciate being able to search by criteria such as brand, item and color. Try a ""clean out"" kit to refresh your own closet, and donate the proceeds if you prefer. Shopping on thredUP is good for my wallet - and the planet!",5
5355,Amazing.. wish the description was a little more informative but overall I love to find unique clothes at a great price AND you'll be helping someone as well.,5
5356,Very satisfied. Friendly people at thredup just charge way too much for 2nd hand clothing.,4
5357,"I will be glad when they open back up,I am a seller on here,I need those plastic bags,lots of them !!!!!this is a wonderful store",5
5358,"I downloaded app and bought a few items twice. Great Quality, Selection, and Prices. The items were at such an affordable price that even if an item didn't fit like I hoped, I wouldn't waste postage on a return. Great app one of the best for clothing!!",5
5359,I love this app! Love thrifting online from home and being able to do returns. Love being able to filter by material type and pick only comfortable clothes. The only thing I wish I could add is being able to sort by long sleeves in the dress section. You can only do that in tops currently.,5
5360,I'm unable to cash out on the app. Keeps circling back to home page.,3
5361,Love this app,5
5362,Awesome 👍,5
5363,"THEY DELETED MY REVIEW. I gave them one star for jacking up the points needed to waive restocking fees. 122%!!! If I could give them a zero now, I would. If you have to hide criticism, then you definitely deserve it. And shame on Google for letting them delete it.",1
5364,Great!!!!,5
5365,I love this app. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because I don't want to have to scroll through thousands of items I've already seen. There should be some kind of archive button so you never have to see it again if you don't want to.,4
5366,Love this app!,5
5367,"Great selection, great value. I love this store!",5
5368,I love it!!!!,5
5369,"App doesn't work great, next to no customer service, and terrible shipping via FedEx (all orders have been delayed at least once if not multiple times).",2
5370,So addicting!,5
5371,"I received my order today and was delighted with my MK purse and men's MK wallet. The wallet was new and the purse was like new. Oh, and the price was good, as well. I will definitely continue to shop with them 😍😊",5
5372,Love this store and the app,5
5373,"I tried to contact customer service regarding 2 items received with my last order. Since no one in customer service joined my chat session, I decided to send an email. A couple of days later I received an email asking me to rate ""Daniel"" with his email response. I informed them that ""Daniel"" never emailed me. A few days later, I attempted once again to chat with someone in customer service but yet again, no one joined the chat. Customer service definitely needs to be addressed with ThredUP.",1
5374,"concept is fabulous, execution is exceptional. they could definitely payout more, and to have to donate what they dont buy or be charged an ASTRONOMICALLY ridiculous fee to have them send your own belongings back is a bit of a slap in the face. otherwise, I'm a fan of the app, in general.",4
5375,This site is so simple to find clothes and accessories that are a perfect fit for me. I love it!,5
5376,The clothes are over priced for what they are. They are selling Walmart clothes for more than Walmart sells them.,1
5377,"I love it, it's so easy to use.",5
5378,I love that no plastic is used and that I'm keeping clothes out of the landfill.,5
5379,I live in a rural area without a lot of shopping options. I am thrilled with ThredUp! Returns are easy and the sales are great!,5
5380,"Couldn't add anything to cart, recieved an error message everytime I tried to add something",1
5381,Love the app. Iv made 3 purchases and have had no issues.,5
5382,Mostly great. Not sure what measurements I should truly go by though..,4
5383,"Great, love shop at tredup",5
5384,Easy to use. Gives you time to checkout and app keeps track of items recently removed from your cart.,5
5385,I enjoy this app but would like it better if I saved my cost prefrrances.instead I have to reset everything and restart the search,5
5386,"I love ThredUP! My first order was a purse, and I was so happy with it. I've already placed a second order.",5
5387,Says it takes 3-6 days to consolidate an order to ship. But I'm on day 10 and it still has not shipped yet.,1
5388,Every order is on time and great quality.,5
5389,Since finding ThredUP I've bought very little retail. Great for petite women wearing small hard to find sizes. Quality is very good.,5
5390,They lie about shipping dates,1
5391,"I love everything about ThredUp! Awesome finds, great prices and their point incentives are great. The website is easy to navigate and their packaging is the cutest! ☆☆☆☆☆",5
5392,Since the pandemic curtailed my in store thrift shopping ThredUp and this easy to use app was a joyful discovery. My closet has never had so many fun pieces.,5
5393,They have plenty to choose from. There all like new. I love this app.,5
5394,"I have been waiting on a refund for two separate items I never received but paid for. I received an email stating I will get a refund but its been over a month. The refund process is horrible! A lack of contact options, they do not reply in a timely to emails and no phone number is listed for customer service. I have spent A LOT OF MONEY WITH THRED UP..but to not receive a refund on items they failed to ship is a violation of their refund policy.",1
5395,Does not have updated clothing,1
5396,I didn't actually use this app,1
5397,Thrift like a pro!,5
5398,Awesome,5
5399,For women only,1
5400,"Absolutely love this app! Everything I've ordered has been wonderful and customer service is excellent! ****Update**** have been ordering from Thred-up for over a year. Basically everything I wear now has come from this site. Constantly getting compliments and questions about where I got my outfit. Jeans, sweaters, coats, jackets, gym clothes, boots, shoes, dresses, formals, sandals, swimsuits - I have loved just about everything I have ordered. Only had to return maybe 3 articles of clothing.",5
5401,Great deals and wuality products.,5
5402,I love the clothes but the app is somewhat difficult to navigate,4
5403,"Love that I can actually at 44 yrs old find my sizes. I have terrible experiences at stores trying to find clothes to fit my 5'1, 100, size 3 feet. I can browse for hours looking for age appropriate clothing. Thank you thredUP.",4
5404,I have committed to buying only used clothes from now on and Thredup has been helping me look my best and reduce the use of virgin materials.,5
5405,"The product fit nicely looks great. It did take almost a month for me to get my order but I was extremely happy when it arrived and everything fit. Will shop with them more, just plan on waiting for it a while longer.",4
5406,Used to be my favorite but quality has gotten not so great....about 65 good and 35 bad but I don't want to pay restocking fees and shipping for less than quality....and the prices have increased considerably. I am going to go back to my local thift.,5
5407,Stuck its stuck on the green screen fix it!!!,1
5408,"Such fun and the finds are breathtaking. Love shopping on Thredup, plus recycling is good for everyone.",5
5409,Easy to use!,5
5410,Wonderful!,5
5411,I love it! So easy to shop. I can find so much and the favorites feature is great to shop and compare.,5
5412,Love shopping 2nd-hand and now I can do it at home,5
5413,I ordered two zip up hoodies and had my doughts ..but they arrived on time in very good condition .....I recommend this app to everyone that can't afford to buy expensive clothing brand new!!!!! Awesome app 👍😀,5
5414,Win Win,5
5415,"Great app / easy to use, even better service and value all the way down to the care of how they ship your items. Also, points earned add up to free shipping and other perks that make shopping through Threadup even more enjoyable. Highly reccomend!",5
5416,No mens clothes at all.,1
5417,"Baby clothes size filters don't work. When I put in 0-3 months, I'm seeing 12 month, etc.",2
5418,I love this app!,5
5419,"This app has seriously gone downhill, the photos are often Wrinkled, messed up, and a couple pics looked like the jacket had one arm missing, but claim ""excellent condition"". The size in the pic is rarely the size in details, and forget selling on here, 2 months to put my items for sale, and they sold my clothes for $20-$70, and paid 90 cents for some. They say it's because they do the work, but it's sloppy. I'm disgusted by their greed. MERCARI DOESN'T ROB YOU, SELL THERE!",1
5420,Will not recognize Amazon log-in credentials which is how my account is registered. Unable to sign in.,1
5421,What happened? The app has stopped opening. I have uninstalled it and then re-installed it with no success. I miss looking at it every day.,4
5422,"Love the search options, crashing a bit frustrating",4
5423,Love the selection and prices!😊,5
5424,Nearly everything is reasonable priced and I got my mom addicted. This is the only place she shops and I got a steal for a wedding I'm in.,4
5425,Works great 😊,5
5426,"Really wish theres was mens clothing, seeing alk the good deals",1
5427,Easy to use ! 😃,5
5428,Love it 😊,5
5429,"💟❤️OMG❤️💟 I can literally spend hours upon hours on this site! It is super fun to fill up your purchase cart & imagine all the awesome clothes in your closet at home. If I had a million dollars in my bank account today instantly, I'd spend probably 50% of my day glued to my cell phone screen getting sexy, fabulous, striking yet comfy wardrobe peices. I would love to give 10🌟s!!!",5
5430,Very excited to hear about this site. Then found out there's no mens section. Time for the delete button.,2
5431,Great quality and prices and so easy to shop the app.,5
5432,"I liked this company when they did subscription boxes, even though it took forever to receive them after ordering... but now they don't do that anymore. :( Also, I have sent in 3 bags of clothes to consign. They processed one last spring, but I am still waiting on the ones I sent in August and October... I wish I would have just consigned at a local boutique. 😔 #disappointed",2
5433,Love everything,5
5434,Yay Edit 12/1 can't print return label due to problem on app.... 2nd time this has happened... and no easy way to contact customer service thru mobile (help just takes you to FAQs pages) This needs to be fixed,4
5435,"High quality clothes at great prices. Plus, shopping at thredUP helps the environment...reuse, recycle! The web designer is brilliant! There is no other website that offers so many filters for such an easy personalized shopping experience. Love it!",5
5436,"I hate that this app automatically logs in when I open it. My ThredUp account isn't connected to my Google account, so it always logs in with the wrong information and I don't realize it until I've been scrolling for awhile. It's extremely frustrating.",2
5437,Easy to use.,5
5438,"LOVE, BUT.....Almost every oder I receive atleast one pair of pants or jeans have been sent in the wrong size than what I have ordered. I've also sent clothes in to sell for credit however none of them have been processed after 4 months of waiting. I do enjoy the selections of clothes and the price.",4
5439,"This is my second favorite store in the whole world. First love of course is the Salvation Army. I do miss the experience of trying on outfits and treasure hunting in person, but ThredUp saves driving to the thrift shop and the clothes smell sooo much better than the ones from the second-hand shop! My only complaint with the app itself is that there are not more sort options within each category. Sometimes I just really need to narrow down the 1,000s of items to quickly find what I need.",4
5440,Easy to use and find what you're looking for. The timer sometimes glitches on your items in the cart but it hasn't affected my check out experience thus far.,5
5441,Buy beware they will send the wrong item to you and have wrong descriptionson clothes. If there marked newish but you can tell they have been warn a while. Then they won't refund you money but will give a credit for more crappie mislabeled clothes and their is no customer service number to try to get your money back.,1
5442,"Great app!! So many wonderful finds at wonderful prices! I was disappointed you got rid of the ""see similar items"" option. The app closes abruptly at times which is frustrating",4
5443,Great app,5
5444,Love this site!,5
5445,I like the clothes and deals but the app doesn't filter the sizing requested at all. Results in too many options that aren't even the size you are looking for.,3
5446,Awesome way to thrift shop.,5
5447,"love my shopping experience online with you & thanks for seperating, lableling, catagoring, discounts & more on each item. I will keep coming back. Thank you & mahalo, Aloha!",5
5448,Love This Website!!,5
5449,Easy to use and amazing discounts on high-quality merchandise. One suggestion: Have sleeve length as a filter option on all items with sleeves!.,5
5450,Have to keep re-typing my search when it kicks me out,2
5451,"Would be nice to sort by price rang,e.g.: $5.00-$12.00",4
5452,Your prices are a bit high? I can buy new for the same price?,3
5453,"This has happened more than once., advertise wrong size. Then I have to pay for restocking fee? Just lost a valuable customer.....",2
5454,"Overall good, but some glitches. When you search for stuff, it doesn't remember what you searched for if you back up. If you look at an item up close and then go back it takes you back to the top of your search and you need to find again where you left off. Super annoying and wastes time.",4
5455,Awsome,5
5456,I love it i have shopped here for years. Its the only place i buy my clothes.,5
5457,"So far, so good 👍",5
5458,Easy to use and good prices.,5
5459,Love this app!,5
5460,Great deals and quality,5
5461,"LOVE this app. Wish the filter option had more features but aside from that, the app works seamlessly!",5
5462,Excellent.,4
5463,"It's a mixed bag for me! Love the clothes when they fit. Most of them are good quality. It's very time consuming because measurements are somewhat confusing. I've bought purses, shoes, jean's, shorts and tops. I'm learning to navigate the sight. Customer service has been very helpful for me. Sincerely I'll be a customer for life! Thank Ya'll @ ThredUp",5
5464,App won't open,1
5465,I didn't receive one of my items and it wasn't what was posted,2
5466,Love This App 💚,5
5467,Luv!,5
5468,"My daughter's skirt was described as ""new with tags. Originally 69.99"" I paid 31 dollars for it. The tag was on it....with a $13.00 clearance sticker. Never again!",1
5469,"Its a nice app and great service. I would like to filter by the taken measurements rather than brand size. As is you'll find a pair of pants that say 30 waist, but after clicking the item, measurements indicate 34/29 real size is.",4
5470,Things are always as featured. such hard work that goes into curating and packaging is outstanding! One thing I would really appreciate-particularly for all handbags would be a view of the inside.helps in figuring out whether the item would work.,5
5471,I'm obsessed with ThredUp! Best secondhand clothing store ever!,5
5472,Easy Peasy....this app and website are very easy to maneuver.,5
5473,Simple and makes shopping feel fun. Plus it's good for the environment? Yes please!,5
5474,Very Easy to find what your looking for and not looking for love the way you can navigate from product to product one click away from my next best gift to myself😉😁 or someone else 😊 thanks for making shopping so much easier for these day's. Things are just crazy anymore and staying home seems to be the way of shopping at least for safety if not for any other reason oh yeah and because I can just relax and forget all the hustle and bustle out there ok back to what I ❤🤑 💯shopping😘,5
5475,💕 Love thredUp Shopping.,5
5476,Really lovely clothing at affordable prices many more than expected with tags still on them and all the best name brands you know and love,5
5477,"I love it! Thred up is where I buy my clothes, also my son's khaki school pants. I just wash it before we use it.",5
5478,"OMG I just received a lovely packaged bundle unbelievable absolutely loved every item why would anybody else purchase new fashion when they could get such great buys and awesome merchandise the way they ship their packages great job wrapped neatly in tissue. Shoot, Spend double price at a store and how do they wrap your item in a PLASTIC BAG go figure beautiful thank you so much thread up love love this app I will definitely be telling all my friends keep up the great work Diane C San Francisco",5
5479,Love love love,5
5480,I really enjoy shopping on this app. It's like any thrift store experience where you have to dig throught a lot of clothes that aren't your style to find pieces you really love. I think some say the pricing is to high but there tends to be a lot of sales and you can find specific brands so it worth it.,5
5481,I Love threadUp!!!!! I have purchased many items from here and have been very happy with everything!,5
5482,Tons of choices at great prices and good quality.,5
5483,Looks like trash,1
5484,For the win,5
5485,Easy to use and great prices!,5
5486,Easy-to-use I always find what I'm looking for,5
5487,Easy to use . Notifies me of sales.,5
5488,"Great app, great deals!",5
5489,Awesome,5
5490,"I have had many wins with thredUP but also so many disappointments. Do not trust the measurements of pant inseams. Pay very close attention to photos of dark clothing as details often don't show up and are not included in the description. After several years of purchasing through them, I am close to leaving after several incorrect measurements, unclear photos and return hassles.",3
5491,Love the clothes and prices I get from them,5
5492,So good I don't even want to share it so I can have it all!,5
5493,"Mixed emotions. Some of the stuff is good but there is a lot of misrepresentations of material quality, sizes*, how the garment looks, fading ect. Some just strait up wrong product information. Shipping is messy(multiple carriers)and hard to track down but some things are decent quality and a good deal, just hope you're lucky enough to get a decent quality. Its Ross prices but for used clothing but at least its recycled? Some are more expensive that the store $tag still attached. Buyer beware.",2
5494,Pretty great excluding issues logging in. I'm really sad they aren't doing Goody Boxes anymore.,4
5495,"Canceled & deleted. At first I was hopeful and inspired. A online consignment store sounded like an interesting idea at first, thus I was intrigued. Then I come to find out it's for women's clothing only. I call discrimination:) on top it seems like they could benefit from changing their business model. For example, it would be great if they worked in collaboration with let's say Goodwill.",1
5496,Why does it take so long to get a bag to send in items?? I've been waiting for over a month for the bag to come in the mail. Shopping experience has always been great but selling experience has been terrible.,2
5497,"Love buying clothes from thredUP. I only wish searching options had a with pockets choice. Would be SUPER helpful when looking for active gear etc, sometimes it is hard to tell in pictures.",4
5498,Great clothes! On occasion the amount of time an item is in your cart glitches and also there are times where the photo will not enhance.,4
5499,Great selection and easy to navagate,5
5500,Love the app and the opportunity to recycle clothing that's on spot.,4
5501,Ive used this site more than once & have always been pleased with my purchases!,5
5502,I lovethreadup,5
5503,A lot of cute things for less.,4
5504,"I love this ap! Everything I've received has been amazing, fast shipping and amazing brands. True to size and a lot of items brand new with tags. I've recommended to all my coworkers and friends!",5
5505,I LOVE THREDUP,5
5506,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I would never recommend this service to anyone looking to resell or consign their goods. It is the equivalent of donating minus the tax deduction. They offer 8% of their selling price on a sliding scale for store credit purchases and even less than 40% of the 8% or so for cash payout. Thing is, none of this is mentioned initially upon sign up or with the cleanout bag. Also, lack communication and listing errors are all very present in the course of their business",1
5507,"Useless company and app. If I could rate this less than 1, I would.",1
5508,Good,5
5509,Love the prices. Always get my order on time. Love the quality of the clothes. Overall this is my main shopping place for clothes .,5
5510,The app is ok but I am not happy with thredup. I ordered an xxl jacket so it would be a little big as I wear an xl. I couldn't even close the jacket much less zip it up. Of course it would have cost more to return it than it's worth so I will not be using thredup again. That was my first and last time.,1
5511,"It takes a long time for them to finally go through your bundles you send them, but it is an effortless way to make a few extra bucks to buy a few items of clothes! They have a very good selection as well",5
5512,Too expensive,1
5513,"thredUP's BACK! I used to LOVE this site for interesting finds until it turned consignment only. Then it seemed like they accepted any old ratty garmet, plus the prices went sky high. One day I realized the clothes were things my GRANDMOTHER would buy, not the cool, edgy clothes that had brought me to the site. Over a year later, I recently checked it out again and found a lot of cool things - at MUCH better prices, (like the sellers had had a good talking to lol). I'm back too.",4
5514,I just started using thredup and so far i really like it. 👍🏻,4
5515,I'm a huge fan of tred up. I always buy from them. I'd like to give back and sell or donate my clothes but they won't accept clothes from Alaska which sucks. Hope that changes soon.,4
5516,Best thrift site!! Bougie on a budget,5
5517,"Threadup app for Android us super buggy. I've updated and profile doesn't load sometimes. It's slow, items don't load, can't see my own profile, etc ...",2
5518,Amazing app and store,5
5519,Very user friendly - cost effective and easy to coordinate and build your closet at a cost effective price.,5
5520,"Shirt delivered with half of the hem undone, returned and now not getting my refund.",1
5521,Love this app I would recommend Thredup to everyone,5
5522,I never got my bags... and fedex says there's no record of the tracking numbers,3
5523,This app is sexist. Where is the men's option,1
5524,"The app is fine, but ever since they got rid of their goody boxes thredup has been kinda pointless. I've sold my stuff on thredup but it takes forever for the clean out bags to be processed and you really don't make a ton of money selling your clothes.",3
5525,"I like the ThredUp app: When the app works. Most times I'll select the ThredUp app & it stays on the green ThredUp screen. Like it's stuck & never loads. Even when I have full 5G service or on well-connected wifi. I would probably have bought a few more times, if the app didn't get stuck so often.",3
5526,Love threadup. The app is super easy to use.,5
5527,Everything i ordered is exactly what i saw online. In great condition love this app. My items even came early love this app!!!!!!,5
5528,So far so good!,4
5529,"If you're interested in selling good clothes you're hoping to get out of your closets. Don't do it here. I have sent over 3 or 4 boxes of clothes, excellent condition items, good brands. And so far I've made $6. I didn't expect to get a ton of money but this is a joke when most of the clothes is in great condition. If you ask for the clothes back, you are charged and if they keep it, you don't really know what happens to it . Save yourself the disappointment and either donate or sell elsewhere.",1
5530,Always shop here. I never go to the department stores anymore. Love looking. Closed account for awhile now I can't get back in. WHAT A HASSLE. Forget it. Moving on! Problem fix. Wow that was fast. They got right on it after my frustrated review. Happy shopping again.,5
5531,"Waited to try site. When I did for $80 got a HUGE box oof name brand items ! Definitely worth your money. But, just like buying anything online buy the brands you know & the sizes that fit you correctly ! My size can change 5 times depending on the brand I buy, just remember that 1 point!",5
5532,Nice clothes,3
5533,I sent a big bag of clothes most new for profit and got nothing,1
5534,I love shopping on thredup. I have found jeans that you can't find in stores anymore. Prices are decent. I've had to return a few things but have had no trouble at all with the returning process or with refunding my money. Only problem I have had is sometimes the sizing is wrong. Other then that I love it ❤,5
5535,Love It,5
5536,"If they had a ONE sentence description of the clothes it would be better. Then I wouldn't be disappointed when something is not what's expected. Ordered what was described as a SWEATSHIRT with no material info, it was actually a long sleeve SHEER material clearly marked 100% polyester. Also could have mentioned the black pants were VELVET! Nice to Know! I could send back but a restocking fee and the hassle of resending makes it not worth it. I haven't loved anything after three $75+ orders",2
5537,"Easy to navigate, use filters & preferences, & even reach out to customer service when needed. Love my items, love not paying retail, love the service & dependability of thredUP!",5
5538,"I am a huge fan. The items are easy to sort through and even easier to sell stuff I don't need anymore. I only wish you could sort by ""percent off"".",4
5539,Love it!,5
5540,"I was kinda excited about this app but its TERRIBLE. There are no clothing for men on the app, just women and children only. A complete waste of my time and it takes an entire village to delete your account which I still haven't managed to do successfully. Immediately uninstalled.",1
5541,"The app lags a bit, but is otherwise easy to use",4
5542,"I loved shopping from here. Too bad the app is broken. You load it up all there is, is a green screen that says thread up thats it. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing. Just busted 😭",3
5543,"Receive all my orders on time , clothes are clean and as listed. Perfect if you don't have time to search several different thriftstores . Prices are alot higher than local shops.",4
5544,"I got my first shipment of clothes today, and I am pleasantly surprised. They came packaged and folded nicely. There was no sign of wear at all. Only one piece of clothing I got was ""new with tags,"" but they all seem new, and smell clean. I probably saved about $150. All the clothes were from Hollister or american eagle. I can shop without feeling guilty about contributing to unethical practices by these companies, or spending a ridiculous amount of money. Recommending this app to everyone.",5
5545,Great clothes for a great price,5
5546,Easy and love the prices! Alot of great sales!,5
5547,"Reduce reuse and recycle! And what a fun way to do it. I find so many pretty, stylish outfits at good prices on Thred Up only real problem is picking which ones from all the choices. I adore the polka dot boxes and so do my cats.",5
5548,Happy,5
5549,I haven't been using it long but the items I've received have been good quality so far.,4
5550,Love love it,5

5552,Great shopping experience. This app makes it easy to save searches and find things only in your sizes.,5
5553,"Great product, buggy app! Regularly crashes, and filtering only works on occasion.",3
5554,I have had positive experiences with thredUp. All items have been as described with no damage with the careful packing during shipping. I will continue shopping with thredUp.,5
5555,"All it took was one spin around the ThredUp app and I instantly became a loyal customer. ThredUp is my ""go to"" for my own personal shopping. Items are presented and shipped with the highest of quality and care, if I didn't know otherwise I would think they're fresh off the racks of stores. I only wish they offered men's clothing, my husband is jealous of all my new treasures! 😉",5
5556,"I love thredup and use it all the time, but the app has a problem opening sometimes. I have to restart my phone to get it open.",3

5558,Love this app They have any thing you want or need,5
5559,"I love this app, easy access to quality secondhand items is a fantastic alternative to thrift store shopping during Covid. The app can be a little slow or glitchy, but all over a great shopping experience and awesome value.",5
5560,2nd time I received kids 8-10 clothes instead of women's 8-10!,1
5561,"forces facebook sign in. well, tries to.",1
5562,This app makes buying and selling easy and shopping fun!,5
5563,I have enjoyed every piece of clothing so far.,5
5564,"I am kind of addicted to the thread UP app! It is well organized and gives tons of filters enabling fast, fun, effective shopping for exactly what you want. If you're not exactly sure what you want... No problem! You can scroll for days, and get ideas for outfits using the shop by outfit feature, or take a dive into designer favorites. There are so many ways to shop. Sometimes the app will spontaneously close, but when I log back in everything I saved it's right where I left it. Have fun!",4
5565,Love this app!,5
5566,🥰,3
5567,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL packaging on items and they looked brand new! Thank you ThredUP!,5

5572,Love it,5
5573,Good,4
5574,It's okay,3
5575,I'm concerned why it takes so long for a bag to be processed. No update to acknowledge that thay are behind. I have one bag claiming to be proceed by August 2021 here we are middle of November. There turnaround time has came to a stand still. Use to be you could order something and have it in week and a half or two weeks. Now when I forget I ordered something because it takes a month. I have been a member practically when thred up began. Time has not been kind the treadup.,2
5576,Great site for great selection,5
5577,Very user friendly and simple.,5
5578,"Obsessed with this store! Luv luv luv sustainability and the quality of the items are chic and in impeccable condition, but thus ap lags at opening up and will cut several times while I shop- it's unnerving, but not enough to keep me away from purchasing- their items make up for the lagging ap. And I'm not going to let it keep me from shopping!",3
5579,No men's clothes,1
5580,Received items very quickly! Really a great find! I love this app. I do have items that I didn't like once I got to see in person. But I think I'll gift them or return them if I can.,5
5581,It takes forever to ship from this place this is the last time I make the mistake of using this app,1
5582,"Am a new customer for life! So refreshing and to think I'm saving the planet by reusing, to boot. Love thredUP!",5
5583,I love the layout of the app and prices on the clothes and how they notify you if something you liked went on sale.,5
5584,Love these hidden gems!,5
5585,Excellent service!,5
5586,Too bad I have balls,1
5587,Fast and easy shopping,5
5588,Really awesome and they actually have things in my size so hard to find stuff around where I live that actually are my size.,5
5589,Always have a good experience with ThredUp. I'm very pleased with them.,5
5590,Even easier to use than the website. Love everything about it!,5
5591,Too many great items to choose just 10! Lol 👍🤩😘,5
5592,Easiest app,5
5593,The pictures are horrible quality and the search options are seriously lacking.,2
5594,"I always LOVE ❤️❤️ me a good deal on clothes. This is a pretty cool site, I'm just wondering how they are with deliveries... If you have had delivery with them can you comment. I'm anxious to place my order.!! 🤗",4
5595,Amazing! Fun Treasure Hunt,5
5596,I am addictive to ThreadUp!! I love their variety of clothes they have!!,5
5597,"I would've given it 5 stars, however the app will randomly shut down and the older saved items disappear and reappear. I loved this app at first but now, not so much. **as of 11/12/22** They have fixed the issues with the app abd it runs much better! I have ordered multiple times from here and LOVE it all!!!!",5
5598,"Love the selection, hate the customer service. The only way to request service is through a chat option. I've been trying to contact someone for 3 days to no avail.",1
5599,Love it,5
5600,"The selection is outstanding, and customer service is even better. Love this shopping expirence as a whole.",5
5601,"I love being able to thrift shop right from my phone. It's easy to find deals and make ""bundles"". The clothes arrived neatly neatly folded and packaged with care.",4
5602,Very convenient to shop..,5
5603,Love recycling clothing and getting a deal on things. It is disappointing to get a bag of very wrinkled clothing that smells like a musty basement. Great in theory but poor presentation and the app doesn't work most of the time.,2
5604,"Not five stars as some bugs on search (e.g. trouble changing color and updating search results, granted with pretty complicated filters). overall really robust app. Second-hand online is hard to do well and ThredUp is definitely on the right track. It's become my go-to for work, casual, and leisure clothes.",4
5605,Great,5
5606,No mens section,1
5607,Love love love this site!!!!! I always find the cutest things at the greatest prices,5
5608,1.99 restocking fee per item. Deal breaker,1
5609,Not my favorite place to shop I have ordered a few things and didn't show up. My friends have had great experiences and love the deals.,2
5610,Great prices,5
5611,"Searching for jeans, choosing a waist size. When result come up, the list show the correct size, but the description does not. Nor are the cuts correct. Calls straight legged and cigarette legs as bootcut. Definitely inaccurate.",4
5612,I have purchased from this site multiple times. Everything is as described (if not better) and the shipping is great. I absolutely adore this app.,5
5613,"Easy to use. I can spend way too much time shopping on the app. Very well organized, with easy to find categories.",5
5614,"Not a good site to sell, anything, pay is low, and everything I sent had tags on them , brand new. Site so whack. No HAPPY selling.",1
5615,Love it,5
5616,Amazing!,5
5617,in,4
5618,I love finding new outfits while doing something good for the environment. Every item I have purchased has always been in great condition. The prices can't be beat.,5
5619,"the worst app i have ever used, i am having to delete the app everytime i need to use it, i dont have easy access to change my address, either, i cant never use the search icon to look for an specific item, you are loosing a lot of sales. please update you application to a more easy user friendly app",1
5620,Love it! I have purchased many beautiful pieces of clothing at great prices - often new with tags. Highly recommend.,5
5621,Just viewing and pick a few jackets. Give a thought. Haven't experienced any purchase yet.,4
5622,App seems easy to use and so many fun things to buy!,3
5623,"I've gotten nice items from Thredup, and returns are easy",5
5624,"I always get really nice name brand clothing. Prices are okay...you do find some with great prices but some are a little too expensive for this being a second hand / thrift store kind of app. I feel like some prices could be brought down a little, I have only received 1 or 2 items that had damage (rips) but I shop on here more than I should forsure and I have gotten some really nice clothes from this app.",3
5625,This app was a lifesaver through two pregnancies and postpartum - not an ounce of guilt refreshing my wardrobe and affordable!! I can't imagine shopping for clothes any other way now,5
5626,Love this app!,5
5627,Sent a cleanout bag most if the stuff still had tags or was unworn.That was at least 4 months ago.I have asked about it and heard nothing other than they recieved it.Do not send them anything!,1
5628,"Every item from ThredUP that I have purchased , have all been exceptional. Quality is fabulous.",5
5629,I really like how fast the app is to interact with. Other thrifting sites have slower refresh page times. Also I like that thredUp includes measurements of clothing so I know which shirts will fit my chest or which shirts are to long for my tastes.,5
5630,Great and easy to use,5
5631,Great service,5
5632,"Love this app! I get to shop, save, and do my part in taking care of the earth by keeping my shopping/new clothes footprint smaller than ever! I am ADDICTED!!! ThredUP is my new favorite Retail Therapy!!!",5

5636,I always find something great at an even better price!!!!!,5
5637,Nothing for men,1
5638,Great buys! You will not be sorry!,5
5639,"The clothes I've received are great. The app is easy to navigate and the options to save your favorite brands is great. The only thing I have ran into is when I get ready to pay and there are discounts, credit or points i redeem. The amount doesn't add up. This has happened a few times. The last time this happened it was a 3 dollar difference. I hope this gets fixed.",3
5640,AWESOME app!! Many items are brand new with tags!!,5
5641,"When updates are pushed, I often cannot view items on my phone and have to use my computer instead.",3
5642,"Great thrifty shopping app! I've been using thredup off and on for a couple years now. I've donated clothes, sold clothes and bought clothes. All of my experiences with thredup have been great. Amazing selection and the app is easy to navigate. Plus I love that I'm saving money while recycling, makes shopping feel less guilty. My only wish is that they also bought and sold mens clothing. I think that would do really well here. Thanks Thredup!!",5
5643,Easy to navigate. Clothes showed to me only in my sizes so no need to wonder also only shows what's in stock . I really could go on and on but I won't instead just download it and I promise it won't disappoint.,5
5644,l like this game,5
5645,This makes it so easy to find the clothes I want second hand.,5
5646,Love the variety of things,5
5647,"I was looking for some men's clothes I could potentially buy, but there wasn't even a category to look at.",1
5648,No men's clothing.what a wasteful app.id give half a Star but can't. 👎👎👎👎👎,1
5649,No good words come to mind in reference to this app.,2
5650,I do love shopping I this app! Not having to worry about different vendors and different r turn policies is a plus. I also love the rewards feature! I'm giving a 4 because I think that search filters could be improved. But overall I love Thredup!,4
5651,"Heavily disappointed at the lack of any mens wear available. They have womens, boys and girls clothing. Thats it.",3
5652,Thieves! I advise everyone for better off donating your items to a charity and get and get some type of cosmic reward I sent eight big bags of clothing to this company I'd say 1/4 being designer clothing after about three months I was told that I actually had a negative balance I would have to pay a gross amount of money to get my items back that quote-unquote did not sell I without a doubt believe this site to be fraudulent they keep your clothes and sell them showing it wasn't sold,1
5653,Great app! Great quality of clothes at a cheaper price.,5
5654,Customer service is HORRIBLE!! They refuse to use a service that actually provides a way for people communicate with the company. I must assume this is so they do not have to refund any money for missing packages.,1
5655,Super easy to use,4
5656,Ihave heard about this website ecited to learn more about lt,5
5657,I love thredUP,5

5683,Shittiest app ever doesnt even have mens clothes,1
5684,You get ripped off,2
5685,Great app but needs a little more fine tuning on the filters features in the search engine. It would also be nice to be able to filter our categorize your items you have listed as favorites.,4
5686,I prefer the website,5
5687,Love Love Love💖,5
5688,Nice app,5
5689,I like being able to type in the size I am looking for and the app uploads shirts/dress shirts/jeans/dresses in that size and all I have to do is scroll through them and I click on the heart if I am debating on purchasing a particular item.,5
5690,It takes forever to load,2
5691,"Ready to shop and the app gives perks like advance notice of sales, which is all really nice 🙂 the pushing of the sales can be a bit much so I dismiss that ability for the app.",5
5692,"Good quality, fast shipping y great service.",5
5693,Like filter options,5
5694,"Ordered online , the clothes came packed in the cutest little bag with nice tissue around each item. I was super impressive with the quality! Thank you Thred it",5
5695,You have boys ......add a men's line and I'll give you a 5*,2
5696,"This app is awesome have been sending them clean out kits for a couple years and have made pretty decent payouts, they make selling and thrifting easy as possible. Thank thredup and thredup developers.",5

5698,Always great value and service. .,5
5699,First order was a great success! App a little glitchy at times.,4
5700,"Love Thred Up - Great site for work, dress up, casual, lounging and just fun clothes. Prices are absolutely fair, returns simple. Use your points to waive shipping, restocking fees or get $10 off your purchases. I have found customer service responsive and reasonable. App is easy to use. Set your sizes, gender preference and shop. Measure your body and select the sizes that fit you, not the size you think or pretend you are. I am 1000% happy with Thred up!",5
5701,"Absolutely the best clothing buying experience every, repeatedly. I used to go to a thrift shop in Raleigh called Uptown Cheapskate, and was so bummed when I moved. This is like having the whole store at your fingertips!!!",5
5702,"I recently purchased several clothing items and they are all exactly as described. They arrived quickly and they were wrapped very nicely, it was clear to me that they put effort and care into packaging and sending everything. I have not yet sold anything, so I cannot speak to that experience, but I cannot speak highly enough of my experience as a buyer! I also really appreciate that ThredUp is an environmentally conscious company. Highly recommend.",5
5703,Love it. Hugest salection ever of alot of things,5
5704,Love this app!!,5
5705,Plan on using.,3
5706,Easy to navigate and a great way of finding that new something.,5
5707,Great app easy to use,5
5708,"I used to love thredUP, but in the last year the quality control has gone down, shipping takes around a month, and prices seem to be a bit higher than when they started. I'll still buy here but it is not as fun.",3
5709,Great deals on all products. Love this site,5
5710,Looks very sexy lost out you can pick and choose,5

5714,No problems,5
5715,Very user friendly,5
5716,"I've been using this for several months now and love it. Found some of my favorite clothes here! They introduced a restocking fee, which I don't like. ""Free returns"" isn't true anynore. And the minimum purchase for free shipping increases.",5
5717,"If they would accurately measure they would get 5 stars. But I have bought 3 pair of pants in a row that were listed in my size with what should have been the correct waist measurement, that ended up being for a stick figure. The customer service department gives you the standard, I'm sorry, but nothing is ever really addressed. Buyer beware, and expect a LOT of returns due to lazy employees not actually measuring anything.",2
5718,Not what I was expecting.,2
5719,"Great prices,lots of great items to choose from. Fill up your your closets for a low price.",5
5720,Excellent app for purchasing gently used or new-but-unused clothing & shoes,5
5721,Thredup is a rip off. I would have preferred to send my high end clothing to a thift shop,1
5722,"I am very happy with my purchases, they offer even more savings on top of already cheaper clothing and accessories. Keep it up Thread up.",5
5723,"Overall good app, but once in a while is a little glitchy and has problems loading.",4
5724,Very helpful and caring customer service.,5
5725,A little annoyed with having to update the filter each time I want to search for an item. Takes me way to long and is very tedious. I really like thrift shopping and I don't want to stop over an annoyance that could be prevented.,3
5726,"Thought i loved Thred up until they took money out of my account without consent and then when I tried to contact customer support, I can't get through to it. They just keep sending me to different screens and when you do the $10 your friend thing, nobody gets any money! And no one on customer support responds. If i could put less than 1 star, i would!",1
5727,As for buying excellent app but to sell not very good. I was pretty upset to dind out I srnd brandnew clothes some even had tags stilll it was a total of 3 bags I sent in(the bags they sendto you to have you send items) anf at the end all I made was $18 total.,5
5728,I easy to find exactly what you are looking for at a great deal!,5
5729,Love this! Makes shopping 🛍 so easy!,5
5730,"Didn't get all of the items back that I had sent to be posted, then they couldn't find the 500 dollar dress so they gave me a credit. Then didn't post all of the items I had for sale on my account so I found one of the shirts I had on the feed but wasn't linked to my account as I was selling it but it said "" more items from this seller"". Very upset because I could've gotten that dress back as I signed up to have items returned. A brand new dress, 500 dollars with tags, gone.",1
5731,Doesn't have international shipping apparently international shipping is to Canada..... Get your platform ready so you guys can ship at least to Canada your neighbour,1
5732,No men's stuff,1
5733,Love my shopping on thredup,5
5734,"ThredUp has been so helpful as I build my professional wardrobe after switching careers. As a person of above average size, I appreciate that I can specify inseam length and get pants that are long enough. It's an additional bonus that the clothes are ""recycled"" and very affordable.",5
5735,"Simple app to use, with quality goods for sale.",5
5736,Absolutely love this app! Easy and straight forward to use and follows the flow of the website,5
5737,First time buyer! I Am So Happy I finally tried Thredup! Amazing! Every piece is Outstanding! Beautiful!,5
5738,Always what I expect! Shipping typically on time.,5
5739,Great,5
5740,I loved the things I ordered. 1 sweater I was disappointed with looked worn.,5
5741,"Best app for good quality new/gently used clothing for women and children. No more shopping around several charity shops. However, I do very much miss goody boxes. Those were the best to try out new styles.",5
5742,Great finds! And always excellent condition dresses I love the app love the points program.,5
5743,I really like their clothes and thrift shopping online is fun,5
5744,This is the best place to shop brand name second-hand clothing!!,5
5745,Love the options!,5
5746,You clothing is used and way over priced. Also very hard to navigate. Unsubscribe me!,1
5747,Love this company in terms of goods and services.,5
5748,Easy to purchase very nice products,5
5749,Great,5
5750,"Wouldnt know how shopping here is... womens, girls, and boys clothes. NO MENS! Thanks to the devopers for leaving out a healthy chunk of the population!",1
5751,Efficient,5
5752,"The only issue I've had is actually cashing out, but not sure that's the app",4
5753,Amazing!!,5
5754,Ok but hard to manage,2
5755,ThredUp has been pleasant to shop on. I usually do not like shopping online. The quality has been represented well and product usually comes in a timely manner.,4
5756,"Awesome app, easy to use, quality clothes!",5
5757,No customer service!!,1
5758,Love this app. The best way to shop!,5
5759,"Used to be average. Now it's unusable. The whole labeling/tagging makes the experience impossible. Example: dress said to be women's size 6 measurements state chest = 27.5"", of 100% silk (0% spandex, ie, no grown woman who's size 6 will measure 27"" across her chest). So, 0 purchases can be trusted, and returns cost money. Prices are inflated to the extent that shopping at Saks if on sale is comparable to this pricing with stains, flaws. No thanks.",1
5760,Love this app! I've been able to find great clothes at amazing prices. The bundle shipping option is awesome. Highly recommend!,5
5761,Love ThredUP,5
5762,Every single pair of pants I got were either short or longs and none of them had that on the description before I bought them! They take returns but of course they charge you for processing so you're still paying for nothing!,1
5763,"Not completely user friendly, but still a darn good way to buy quality clothes on a budget!",4
5764,Measurements are inconsistent and way off. resulting in returns.,1
5765,I love thred up it's brilliant ! Making luxury clothes affordable for everyone!,5
5766,"Wonderful experience. A little pricey on designer clothes, but they are designer clothes.",4
5767,"I paid $30.00 for booties and waited 3 weeks for them. When they finally arrived, thread up sent me 2 different booties! This is the 2nd time they have screwed my order up!! Never again will I spend my hard earned money at this dumpster 🤬🤬🤬",1
5768,Would like to find men's clothing too,4
5769,Pretty organized and easy to use. Love the products they have listed,5
5770,"Great app, great products and great service!",5
5771,Love this app!!,5
5772,Easy,5
5773,I've placed several orders with them and have had good experiences when there was a problem with one order. Customer care was wonderful.,5
5774,Just started with ThredUp but am satisfied with the quality so far.,5
5775,"Placed an order on 10/11/21. Still have not received it. It finally after 6 days in Sacramento, shows it left there, but no info as to where it went this time. No delivery date, no info at all. This is unacceptable.",2
5776,Super happy with all my purchases!,5
5777,"I was moving and missed the return window. I sent the clothes back, received a notification that they received the clothes but they stated since it is past the return window they can not refund me. So now they have the clothes and my money. I did reach out to support to ask for a refund so we will see if their customer service improves.",1
5778,Best online consignment store ever!!,5
5779,"Items not measured well often no measurements for hips or no measurements on attached slip. Shoes do not give widths ,purse handle broke 2 weeks after I got it. Very difficult to return items.",2
5780,"Overall, an easy browsing and shopping app!",4
5781,Easy to use!,5
5782,So much fun!!!,5
5783,Fantastic,5
5784,"Saved search doesn't work, clothing photos aren't great, selection is mostly dumpy. But the most annoying thing is I have to force close the app to use saved search because it truncates over half of my saved searches on the saved search page. I can only see the first four of twelve until I reset the app.",2
5785,"Push notifications stopped working after the most recent (10/19/21) update (no issues previously). They're all turned on in my settings, but nothing comes through so I have to check my searches manually. FIX THIS, as it's kind of the whole point of the app. 😠",1
5786,"This is a great experience, the app is so easy, and I am having so much fun looking at all that is available to purchase. Just sent in my 3rd order, this time ordering for my granddaughter too. What a wonderful way to shop !!! Try it! 😀",5
5787,3 orders placed and 3 orders returned. I spent more money on restocking fees than anything else. Total RIP-OFF!!,2
5788,The payout to the seller is just ridiculous. Highway robbery! Uninstalled.,1
5789,"I have bought a few great items, but they aren't as picky as they claim. I have gotten mis-sized items, stained items, torn items, and items that were just plain worn out. When sending them items they claim to only take around 40% of what you send because they are particular about quality. They aren't as particular as they claim to be. I have gotten some really nice things, but I've gotten more bad than good overall.",3
5790,Outstanding service! Love this store!,5
5791,Great app so many people just throw clothes in the garbage when others need a good deal This is better you get credit to us on things for yourself and someone else gets a better price on what they want or need I love it Plus help our planet Tina,5
5792,Very satisfied with the products and service.,5
5793,"I tried to edit do to fact developer left comment, first thing dear developer, it is not your fault, you make the app not run the store, as far as store goes, and I'm only saying this cause first time few yrs ago I had a great experience, this time I gave much more top notch items only sold two at ,60? ,Or 70 cents. For the both, ridiculous. I asked for the remainder back. It had been a year, they muffled the phone said they had donated them? I was pissed off, u need better idea on selling items",1
5794,Horrible experience with returning purchases and losing points. Sizes were way off.,1
5795,"Amazing deals, and also super easy to search, order, and return!",5
5796,"Quick arrival and beautiful, quality items are always received. Thank you, thredUP 😊",5
5797,Easy to use with cheap finds and awesome rewards while reducing your carbon footprint,5
5798,Absolutely addictive shopping!! I won't ever buy full price again. Quality of clothes and easy to use app with great rewards make this impossible to beat.,5
5799,"Seems nice enough, but come on. No men's section? Uninstalled.",2
5800,Buying is great. Easy and I've gotten some super deals that I get lots of compliments on. I did not give the 5th star because I am not happy with the split. Otherwise I've recommended the site many times.,4
5801,"My order is missing an item, I purchased a pair of felt pants that's not how they were described, the white shirt I bought has black marks all over the collar. I will not order from here again",1
5802,Favorite new app. Great clothes selection for $6 and up. New with tags is a win win.,5
5803,Won't even open. Tried to use web browser and can't sort by brand because none show up when I type,1
5804,Great app! Very easy to navigate.,5
5805,Love.,5
5806,Favorite site ive ever used!!!! LOVE EVETYTHING IT OFFERS!!!,5
5807,Used the app several times to purchase items. All of the sudden it has stopped working and I cannot open the site. I can not get a live person to help me.,2
5808,"Sadly there filter on size can be very incorrect, update provided evidence of sizing errors. Haven't seen any changes",1
5809,"BEWARE! The NONRETURNABLE items from Thread Up have holes, bleach marks, machine stretch marks, hanger stretch marks, pilling and missing embellishments. GARBAGE for $4-$6 nonrefundable junk.",1
5810,Love thredup! This is a great way to enjoy online shopping while eliminating wastefulness and promoting sustainability.,5
5811,Is only to buy items not to list or sale them. I'm in San Bernardino I'm in the livingroom October 19 2021 Tuesday 9:51am,1
5812,"Overpriced Thrift. I am a plus sized gal, spend many hours at local thrift/consignment shops. Knowing the quality of the brands being sold on THREDUP, I cannot believe these prices. I find these items at my local Goodwill, ARC and mom&pop shops for a fraction of the cost. LB, Torrid and Maurices ARE NOT high end/high quality merchandise. Also, alot of the items cost more than they would have, brand new, on clearance. This might work for some, but I feel scammed.",2
5813,"I sold an item, received ThredUp Visa. It clearly states on card that funds do not expire, yet they took my money for inactivity. It was only $5, but that isn't the point. Was going to post brand new MK purse, but no thank you",1
5814,good finds,5
5815,Customer service is difficulr to reach. Other than that Im happy,4
5816,Only for women,1
5817,"Great when it works. Half the time I just have the green start screen and it does absolutely nothing for hours besides that. Or it will completely kick me off the app and I lose everything I was just doing. I've tried looking for updates and reinstalling the app itself, nothing seems to fix it.",3
5818,Easy to place order and the variety is good But would love to see more options for plus size women 22-24 possibly.,5
5819,Please don't send me my second order.I just received my first order and I'm not satisfied about the quality of my order. Thank you. Divina,1
5820,Great prices and I love that they have a variety of name brand clothes,5
5821,Love what i see,5
5822,I've had the MOST trouble with the app itself. It won't open at all half the time and the links hardly work,1
5823,"Love the online store but the app is great, easy to use no problems 😊",5
5824,❤️❤️❤️,5
5825,I literally don't shop anywhere else now! (. - . ),5
5826,Browser experience is better for brand searching. Filter feature on this app doesn't work when you type in the brand you're looking for.,2
5827,"Love my user exoerience so far. Products are great, service also great.",5
5828,Love Thredup! And the app makes shopping so easy.,5
5829,Love thredup! Great app.,5
5830,Got a new wardrobe while lounging with coffee for less than half the price and 100% less aggravation and hassle driving to a bunch of different places and dealing with crowds!👍😊,5
5831,"I can spend all day on this app! If you're looking to be more sustainable or fashion conscious, look no further than thredUP. It truly is an online thrift store, but you don't have to comb through the racks to find goodies (though, that's fun too sometimes). I've been able to build a capsule wardrobe (30+ items) for fewer than $300 with this app! I tell all my friends about it, and people always ask me where I got X or where I bought Y. ThredUP is my best-kept secret, but the secret is out! -A",5
5832,They have awesome clothes for a great price!!!!,5
5833,Can't log into an existing account. The start page in the app only gives the option to sign up for a new account.,1
5834,"I agree with the sizing issue. I've purchased quite a few jeans going by actual waist measurements and am disappointed that some are still too big, too small, or too short when I order the correct inseam as well. I know if I purchase 6 pair of jeans, I usually am only able to wear 2 if I'm lucky. No issues with the app itself though.",3
5835,Great 👍,5
5836,Beautiful clothes and at great prices.Fast delivery.,5
5837,Beware that the outfits are second hand and looks too old. Better go to nearby goodwill to get outfits in a cheaper price,1
5838,Love thier clothes almost brand new all the time,4
5839,"App seems great, super easy to find your size & what your looking for",3
5840,"It could use a few enhancements, but overall a good app. Ex: search box needs improvements if you want to modify the spelling of your search, you have to retype it. Also acts up when you switch between women, Boys, handbags, etc and type in a search. If the items in your cart time out, it puts it below so you can see, but it only shows about 10ish items. It'd be great if it could show more. It'd be nice to be able to remove specific items from showing if you decide you dont like them.",4
5841,Great price 👍,5
5842,My order says 1X Plus I recieved an Extra Large instead & now this item can't be returned. So you all have my $24 and that's it. It's not my fault the wrong size was pulled. I will not order from ThredUp again.,2
5843,Would not recommend using this company. If you send your items to them to be sold they charge you to return them & they are making $10 while you make $0.27.,1
5844,I love theft stores and online is even easier thank u!,5
5845,"The photos of the clothes are not very good. Also, somebody needs to buy them an iron.",3
5846,Very nice clothes. Great prices.,5
5847,"I have had good experiences,only thing size's varies too small or too big I noticed, otherwise good clothes if new,not used,only one shirt I got had so many holes in it because it was used.",5
5848,Very satisfied with everything I've ordered.,5
5849,I love looking at all the different variety of clothing that you guys offer,5
5850,"I am very pleased with my experience. I do think searching could be improved a bit by sorting within categories. Example; dresses sorted into casual, formal, cocktail etc.",4
5851,Easy to navigate & amazing variety @ great prices 😊,5
5852,I ordered from here three times and everything I got was perfect,5
5853,Won't let me sign in and keeps trying to open a Facebook account that I don't have 🤷‍♀️,1
5854,"Missing the ""you may also like"" which was pretty useful. Hope it returns! Makes shopping fun! I love Thredup anyway, but v impressed with the app in general. It has a few quirks but is very powerful and user friendly.",3
5855,I used this site very often. Just received pocketbook not returnable but shoulder strap clip is broken. Not as advertised and no customer svce to speak to. I'm very disappointed as trust in ordering is gone.,1
5856,So glad I found you! What an amazing service you provide! I talk about thredUP daily. It feels so good to hold my chin up again in new to me clothes! I get so much satisfaction scoring affordable deals. Thank you for all you do!,5
5857,"When returning items or doing a bag where company needs to apply credits or deem an amount from semt items, i have twice had to reach out myself in order to initiate action on their part and for the process to be completed. App doesn't retain, remember your spot from notification on email back into the app. Again, months later, I am hoping to chat with support and a series of canned answers are displayed without me being able to actually communicate with someone from support.",1
5858,"Easy to use, I especially like all the sort features to find looks easily.",5
5859,I am extremely disappointed on payouts. There was no guide for payout and very difficult to navigate customer service,3
5860,Love this app. Orders are shipped in reasonable time. All around good app and plenty clothes purses etc to choose from. No complaints here only wish they would start selling men clothing.,5
5861,"There is no men section, I was very disappointed :(",1
5862,Beautiful clothes at a price I can afford!!,5
5863,Good price great 2nd hand clothes,5
5864,"Wonderful selection! I have had a great experience with thred-up. The only thing is it takes forever for the orders to be delivered . I guess maybe not there fault just the mail, but it does take forever!",4
5865,They are amazing love shoping on line great items.love them,5
5866,best clothing store on Earth,5
5867,The clothes cost too much and are often the wrong size or the defects are understated. It's not an economical way to buy nice used clothes. Going to a thrift store is far more effective. You get the same clothes cheaper and you know what you're getting when you buy it.,1
5868,"You can find lots of great items here. I feel their quality control is an issue. The past four orders I've purchased from them, three of my orders had stains, overstretched material and missing rhinestones. It's so frustrating when you try to reach out to customer service no one is available. I know they do their best however when is their best not good enough?",3
5869,The app is perfect except for one thing. When I go to print a label it won't down load for me to print. That goes for any label with this app. Does it happen to you too?,4
5870,"Great clothes to buy. Love this website! Don't expect a lot of $ when you sell, but enough to buy some replacement items.",5
5871,This app is great. I have found so many wonderful items using this app and the easy return policy has been so helpful when items didn't workout as planned.,5
5872,The purses are too expensive and also the blue jeans,4
5873,Not responsive at all. Go somewhere else,1
5874,Can't upload,1
5875,"I don't recommend Thred Up. I mailed them a bag of clothes to sell 6 months ago and they state my bag has been received but no updates since then. I know processing times are slower now but that is a LONG time. Also, when I try to contact them by chat with customer service, it wasn't a chat. All I got for response was I don't have a pending order. Frustrated!",2
5876,"I love purchasing items from thred up, very good quality.",5
5877,Great app!,5
5878,App isn't working doesn't even open up,1
5879,Great I like the app,5
5880,Not at all like the old website. Doesn't even function the same. Not worth having imo.,1
5881,Functioned great no size 13 Jr's,5
5882,"Terrific! As someone who loves to thrift but rarely comes out with loot, I love this app to death. You can tailor down to just what your looking for and you get a huge bang for your buck. Best part though no stuffy changing rooms 😁",5
5883,Thrifting is better for so many reasons!,5
5884,"Overall I really like the app, it's very similar to the website. The only downfall would be more ways to narrow down your search, but I understand that would require a lot more work up front and probably higher prices.",5
5885,No mens section,2
5886,Really great clothes for bargain prices.,5
5887,"They ripped me off!! 3 Items, 1- $12.80 2- $14.40, 3- $12.80 = $40.78 (subtotal). They charged me (subtotal) $50.97 - $10.19 discount + $5.99 shipping + $3.25 tax... Out the door = $50.97!! MY TOTAL AFTER DISCOUNT, TAX & SHIPPING SHOULD'VE BEEN $39.03!! THEY ENDED UP DOING THE SAME THING WITH MY 1ST ORDER, TOO! WHICH ODDLY ENOUGH WAS THE EXACT SAME TOTAL AS 2ND ORDER & OVER CHARGED, AS WELL!! SO, THEY'VE RIPPED ME OFF FOR OVER $20!!!",1
5888,"Great deals but app could use some work. It would be nice to be able to ""exclude"" parts of your search. I.e. ""any fabric EXCEPT rayon"" as I hate how easily wrinkled rayon or viscose get. Instead, I have to click through each dress to check the material... still pretty good app though",4
5889,Customer Service is outstanding!! Love it!!,5
5890,Love all the deals I've found and so far everything fit like a glove. Thank you ThredUP,5
5891,"This app is wonderful! I recently bought a bunch of clothes on sale adding up to around 170 bucks, and about 300 bucks without the sale... if all of that was new I would've spent almost 2,000 dollars! So far, I am VERY pleased 👏",5
5892,"Being a hairstylist I don't like to spend alot on my clothes, thanks to thredup I can save money and have very nice clothes without breaking the bank. Been shopping with them since 2017 and will continue to do so. I call it my online Goodwill but better 😍 Thank you !!",5
5893,Love the prices and selection,5
5894,Love this app. Great buys.,5
5895,Have made several purchases and I am very pleased.,5
5896,"Love this app! So many cheap, cute clothes! Most look like new or are new with tags! I also love how you are able to save your searches.",5
5897,"if your like me, super tall and too skinny, you've struck gold! finally, a place to find jeans without going bankrupt! thanks thredup!!",5
5898,I googled top rated designer underwear app and this app came up but no option for underwear and typed in the search bar and no matches came up,3
5899,"I really like thredup, it has the best fashion finds. To be able to find my size and at affordable prices!",5
5900,Love it cloths are nice and prices are great,5
5901,"Love in every way. I no longer shop in person, coming in clutch during covid",5
5902,This is my new favorite place to shop for clothes!,5
5903,"App crashes. Never saves searches, or sizes, so long to load . cannot misspell anything ever or loose it all. Tells me load a newer better version app and reset password. Still unable to get in.sent email to support. Ha! It takes 5 days to respond.. Its stupid",1
5904,Can't open the app on my Samsung S20 FE! Made an order on my old phone and now I can't open the app on this new one!,1
5905,I like the pants but I need brown l Pants !!!!!!?,5
5906,"Always find great bargains and a lot of times the item is new with tags, never worn.",5
5907,"Good Variety, brands and Quality.",5
5908,There is no one to contact for questions. My return that I had to pay... bc to have refunded back onto your card and not store credit was never refunded back to me. There is NO ONE to contact for my issue and that is a big red flag. I will never order from here again if I don't get my refund soon.,1
5909,I love everything about this app from getting point for purchases to being able to sell clothes and getting credit for that and saving money on the hottest styles.,5
5910,Amazing quick easy Everytime never disappointed,5
5911,"Well I made my first purchase and got the discount just waiting on the merchandise....I got my purchase relatively fast all smelt good ..could tell items were indeed taken care of ..now I do most of my shopping here..only thing is i wish they had more variety in categories,and when u filter things and i think there should b better rewards like for the ones that spend alot more than ur average person...I would like something better than 10$ off but i def luv this site🥰",5
5912,Great app for thrifting. Fair pricing. The interface for selling is easy to use. Wish it was easier to find a single waist size in inches (which is listed on the pants/jeans anyways) instead of just size number. since women's sizing is so dependant on brand I'm a size 4 in one brand but a size 7 in another and having the option to set my waist size or filter by inches would be great.,3
5913,I love my items Perfect like new,5
5914,It's really easy and fun to shop this way!,4
5915,Thred Up is a joke don't waste your time or money buying anything from this site!! It doesn't even deserve my 1 star..,1
5916,"Love this app and have made quite a few purchases (99% of which I've been thrilled with)! My only gripe is that I've seen a fair number of miscategorized items, such as pants being labeled as shoes, etc. And sometimes size details are omitted when they shouldn't be. I was shopping for a skirt and they listed the lengths but not the waist width. Pants have the waist size listed, why wouldn't skirts? Unless it's a brand I'm very familiar with, S/M/L is meaningless.",4
5917,Great experience.,4
5918,"They literally took my clothes and haven't given me my money. When I asked for them to track my bag, they said they couldn't find anything under my name. They literally robbed me y'all. I want my money :[ just a bunch if scammers with this app",1
5919,Makes shopping secondhand easy.,5
5920,"After getting totally scammed on practically new clothing I sent in and got almost nothing for, I decided to give it another try and shop...it's actually embarrassing how hideously they post the clothing now, worse than ever, like they don't even care - everything I looked at was wrinkled and terrible looking. I'm sure they make enough money off of people sending in nice stuff and not paying them anything for it that they can afford a clothes steamer to at least attempt to show them nicely.",2
5921,"I absolutely loved this site. You find name brand clothes for cheap. The fact that you took away the ""similar items"" feature sucks. I just read your not doing goody boxes after 10/15 and that really sucks. That was a great way to get a group of clothes quickly and for cheap. Bad decision",2
5922,Customer service is great! I had a problem with my order and they fixed it immediately. This app is a great shopping experience.,5
5923,Better than before.,5
5924,"The application itself is sadly lacking, and a thoroughly bad experience using it, especially on the 'sell' side. Clickable links are largely non-functional.",1
5925,"App update is so glitchy. Anytime I want to back out of an item it kicks me off the app. Also, a favorite feature of suggesting ""like"" items is now gone. Boo!",1
5926,"I have shopped here since 2019 and I am still choosing ThredUP over any other store, I save so much and stay happy with my wardrobe. It is not my favorite for selling, but yes for items that I am not looking to gain much cash on, items that are in good condition but dont fit me well etc.",5
5927,Very easy,5
5928,Got a fabulous in goody box.,5
5929,So far so good!,5
5930,Love in every way,5
5931,Fast,5
5932,Love shopping on it,5
5933,Was shopping L and one pair of pants said one size ordered paid.The pants were a size o short. Won't mess around returning but you'll never get me again,1
5934,Who doesn't love getting good deals on great stuff?! This app has it all an for great deals!!! Love thredup,5
5935,"Awesome selection of items ranging from designer & name-brands items, to very attractive non-branded items. There are no options for men's clothing, but hopefully that's something to be featured in the future. One suggestion is to improve when push notifications are received on specific items, so that tapping the notification opens up to that specific item.",5
5936,Good content. Name brands at very reasonable pricing. Nicely packaged. Enjou being able to bundle. Also gain from sending my clothes to be sold on thredup.,5
5937,Nice design but lacks a mens section,3
5938,Filters used to work much better. Now they don't always work as expected.,3
5939,"The app is overall ok and more convenient than browsing the site on a phone. However, the filters in searches barely work. For example, I was looking for a particular brand of flats (brand also makes clothing). I searched under flats and tried to filter to that brand, but still got all brands. So I tried to search by brand and filter to the category of shoes and I still got all the clothes. I don't have time to scroll through 3000 items. That's supposed to be the point of the filter. Please fix.",3
5940,"Was pretty good starting out. The longer it's around, the worse it is. They now ""consolidate"" items at one location before shipping from there, which means WAY longer before you get your stuff. VERY few measurements given. Purchases don't match the measurements provided. That's a big deal when buying secondhand clothes that size could be impacted by laundering, alterations, etc. Girls' skirts should be sortable by length. So so many potential improvements, but it gets worse instead.",2
5941,An online thrift store...just not for Men? Misandry at it's finest...,1
5942,Very good,4
5943,"Could be better. They detected my address but wanted ""secondary address information"". Since I'm in a hotel I typed my room number in 15 different ways and nothing worked. Like damn it just mail me the damn rompers!",4
5944,I liked the app. Somehow I got logged out and can't get logged back in. There isnt a way to get logged back in. And no number to get help.,1
5945,Arrived sooner than expected and everything was in really good condition. Very happy with price and selection as well.,4
5946,Love love love this app. All the clothes I've bought have been in really good shape. Takes the hassle out of thrifting.,5
5947,Good selection and decent prices.,4
5948,I love how they have styled me. All of their clothing is great. I am really enjoying my experience with thredUP.,5
5949,"I'm enjoying this app. However, I am having to exchange items often. Mostly when measurements are minimal. But I just bought a brand new leather M.C. jacket for $270. It's a steal!",4
5950,I used to LOVE ThredUp but they have become garbage since Walmart bought them. No customer support. No ethics. They will send you clothing that is actual unbearable garbage that is filled with holes even though it was listed as new with tags. They also sell luxury items but then send you knock offs that fall apart.,1
5951,"I would give zero stars if that were a option. I sent in my Closet Clean Out kit months ago. Still nothing posted from what I sent in. I have contacted Customer Support twice with no response back. I did this to make a little extra cash. How can I do that if you don't even post my items. I am angry. I could have posted my items on a different reselling site and made some extra $$ that I really could use right now. I had Pink, Michael Kors, VS, and other name brands in there.",1
5952,Good app,5
5953,"I love threadup and the app. I have gotten my favorite clothes from them, and sold a bunch of stuff too! The search filters are awesome and the app is easy to use.",5
5954,Love it! Some cheap name brand clothing that is practically brand new.,5
5955,"Fantastic app. The My Sizes feature is bugged and stopped saving in the app though, and it prompts you to enter your sizes again each time you open a new category of item. Just recently happened so hopefully it's a quick fix",4
5956,"My sizes are currently not being saved, clicking on a brand name to see items from that brand isn't working either. But the biggest gripe I have about ThredUp is there is that it doesn't have any way of suggesting things you would actually LIKE, so you have to scroll through so many items to find the ones that might work for your style. Incorporating something like a visual search for similar items or ""people who liked this also liked"" would be fairly simple technologies to implement/license.",3
5957,Great,5
5958,"Love the clothes and the concept, but the app hasn't opened up in over 2 months. Meanwhile, i receive notifications 20+ times a day for items the fit my criteria that i cant see or buy.",2
5959,Love the app! Love the clothes!,5
5960,I love using ThredUp it always me to change up my work clothes wardrobe with out spending a lot of my hard earned money! Thank You TredUp!,5
5961,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS APP",5
5962,"The biggest issue with the app is that you set up a search but accidently hit the heart icon at the bottom or use the back arrow while viewing your shopping results, and then they are gone. You return to shopping and need to restart your search. If you saved the search then that helps, but you still have to scroll back to where you were. It's frustrating because it takes time to set up the search and scroll through items, and it can be difficult to return to where you were.",4
5963,"Great source of good used clothing! So far I am very satisfied with variety, quality, prices and shipping.",5
5964,Could use several simple/minor updates that would make it much better,3
5965,"Love/Hate relationship with this app. I do like that they have made the app pretty easy to find what you're looking for if you utilize the filters. Usually, the clothes arrive as described, but I have found that with denim, the rise is nearly always measured wrong--which makes a really big difference in fit! Very often, styles labeled as 10 or 11"" have actually been 8"". A few times over the last year, an entirely wrong item has been sent. Last Goody Box has been a huge headache.",3
5966,Love everything I've recieved!!!,5
5967,"I heard so much about threadUP so I finally decided to give it a try...and I absolutely love it! I found a lot of clothes of my favorite brands and so much cheaper. The App is very user friendly, fast shipping, items arrive quick and in great condition.",5
5968,Love it and it's easy. You get exactly what ypu ordered.,5
5969,Love ThredUp! Easy to search and buy!,5
5970,"I like the clothes I receive.The clothes always come nicely packaged and very clean. I love Thread up and shopping on their sight. Finding what you want is very simple, even fun on their website, because they make it very easy to find the right size, length, width and color that you are looking for. Great prices for what you get, and I would and will recommend thread up to anyone. 😊😃👍",5
5971,Highly recommend! Always a postive buying experience!,5
5972,A very good one.,5
5973,Pushy,1
5974,Love it,5
5975,"Too high,!!!! Didn't have any cowboy boots,wranglers,T-shirts",1
5976,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this app!!! The clothes I have bought ate all in great shape (right in line with their descriptions)!!! I HIGHLY recommend!!,5
5977,"Love thred up, 90% all of my clothes come from them!!!",5
5978,I had a great experience on this app,5
5979,Nice clothes. Very good experience,5
5980,Expensive,1
5981,Items were as described and even better live! What deals! You can dress like a thousand bucks without having to spend that.,5
5982,I could by these clothes for a fraction of the price an there used badly don't use,1
5983,Let me get this straight...You have no men's clothes but you have boys? I am out.,1
5984,Do not shop on this app place is an absolute nightmare clothing items most clothing items I ordered were not the correct size everything was super faded with the white background makes black clothes look black when instead there super faded. Clothes has hidden abnormaties and the return stocking fee is ridiculous if you spend 50$ they take 11 dollars out of it might as well try to resell it yourself rather then returning it this place is a rip off no wonder poeple sell there clothes on here,1
5985,Great deals!!,5
5986,"I love this app so far. Haven't used it too long so hope everything runs as good as it has. Sometimes there is a special sale where you get ""free shipping"" on any amount . You just have to keep checking in to see what's going on!",5
5987,Great stuff that is affordable. I love it! 💘,5
5988,"Love their website and overall practice but the app was terrible, in my experience. The layout was great, searches loaded with minimal problems but clicking on a garmet to further inspect the size never loaded. App was always up to date. Guess I'll just stick with their website. UPDATE 9/28: App has given me no problems so I can happily browse and shop :)",5
5989,"I Love this place! I just got the deal of a lifetime, and it could happen anywhere else! I got 12 awsome items ,(10 dresses, and 2 sweaters) for $108!!!! Im in heaven! Its like thrift store shopping, but everything is either all the way new, or looks like its never been worn. They are very particular about accepting quality items, so there is never any doubt as to if the picture is a true representation of what you are getting. Out of my whole box, only one item looks like it was ever worn! Yay",5
5990,It doesn't have men clothes,1
5991,"Was excited to use it. But the only categories are for women, girls and boys. No mens clothes :(",1
5992,More for less. Love the Goody Boxes & the new Shop this Look experience. Awesome!,5
5993,Only negative is the return process takes a long time.,5
5994,The only place I buy my clothes now.,5
5995,Wish it could show suggestions based on likes or similar items. More detailed sizing or measurements in more places on items.,3
5996,Love!! Better descriptions and pics would be great!,5
5997,Easy and fun!,5
5998,Fun and easy to use.,5
5999,Love the sales and the ease of finding clothes in my perfect size! The goody box was fabulous because I could try on things as I went and found things I wouldn't normally gravitate towards 💕,5
6000,"Extremely vexing to try and remove your account, constant pop-ups for crazy deals to keep you around. The app is made for specifically woman.",1
6001,"I could not find any Men's clothing in the Men's Department. What? There is not a Men's Department? Then how do you find men's clothing and accessories? Not sure. Let me find the, ""contact us"" section. What? There is not a ""contact us page?"" Soooo how do we notify the website about the predicament? Take the customer satisfaction survey and wait for a response.",1
6002,"Good buying experience , I love everything I've bought+ I love the prices and the quality of everything and getting free bags in the mail to donate my unwanted clothing? Heck yeah",5
6003,Love iy,5
6004,"This is the perfect place to buy my grandson clothes at a great price as we all know how fast they grow out of them. I absolutely love the way everything is shipped and packaged right to my son's front door! I don't have to leave the house. Have to say, I've even found myself a few beautiful items. Thank you thredUP.",5
6005,"You can't emlarge photos in the app which is a bit of a bummer. Therefore, I prefer to use the web site.",3
6006,There's no mens option.,2
6007,Is a great service to use when you want to just get your clothes pile under control for zero cost to you. ThredUP pays shipping for the return of the bag with your items in it. Its a win win.,5
6008,"Im really liking the experience of this app, it feels like I'm going through a thrift store and you never know what treasures your going to find but I have found that the app will crash and when I'm searching for something it's not fun to use. I have found a lot more cloths I love over other clothing apps for half the price or even ½/½ of the original price! I would like to see more close up pictures of the items your interested in.",4
6009,Normally my experience has been very good and it still is most of the time but ever since covid hit things have been slow especially clean out kitsch. Which I depend on to cloth my growing boy!,4
6010,All purchases have been exactly as viewed and fit well.,5
6011,One of the best shopping apps out there!,5
6012,I couldn't even get in,1
6013,Great!,5
6014,I can dress nicer than what the family budget allows with this app. Great clothing for kids too!,5
6015,Like the improvements,5
6016,No mens items.,1
6017,Love that I can shop from different designers and prices. I had to return a few items and the process has been very easy.,5
6018,Easy to use and great prices,5
6019,Awesome,5
6020,There is so much to choose from!!! Love the selections!,5
6021,Terrible. Can't even log in,1
6022,Great,5
6023,Dumb. You have to sign up before you can even browse.,1
6024,"App crashes, zero customer support",1
6025,"I love Thred up! They have all the latest brands for low prices, quality merchandise, and delivery is fast. I would recommend this online store to anyone!",5
6026,"No men's, very disappointing",1
6027,"Easy shipped quickly,quick response from support team good experience",5
6028,Super easy way to shop for myself and the family!,5
6029,It's great,5
6030,"Love this app!!!! I can choose the brand, style and size!! Not to mention saving money!!!!",1
6031,"Love this app, I'm having so much fun with clothes and not having to leave my house.",5
6032,Orders take so long to arrive,4
6033,Good alil expensive but good,4
6034,"Great prices, great finds and love second hand... it has more personality and life to each piece.",4
6035,Fun shopping experience!,5
6036,good quality resale clothing for great prices,5
6037,"I love this app. I shop thrifty stores all the time, but having one in an app is the best yet.",5
6038,Best second hand clothing app ever! Fast shipping and great perks for being member! AND no junk spam emails unlike Poshmark🙄,5
6039,Ridiculous you might as well go by brand new,1
6040,Super easy to navigate and filter.,5
6041,"Very happy with the variety of clothing, sizing and pricing. Pleased with the packaging and shipping.",5
6042,"Completely stopped working. I updated, uninstalled reinstalled, restarted. Won't work.",1
6043,Selection is ok but the app is not. It's always crashing. The pictures and discriptions are junk and need improving so bad but the worst part is the shipping speed. It unexceptable for it to take 2 weeks when you can order from over seas and get it before something shipped in US. There are better options available then this,2
6044,Love this app!!,5
6045,Intuitive and well laid out app. Love threadUP.,5
6046,"Fun and true to size. Close ups could use more detail, but if that keeps costs down...don't change a thing!",5
6047,"Great website, amazing products, PRICES OUT OF THIS WORLD! I love my threadUP!",5
6048,"Amazing! First, I love that I can buy second hand so easily. The variety is spectacular and I've found so many great pieces. There's frequent sales and deals and I love how there's a point program. I've already recommended ThredUp to friends and family and I can't wait to shift most of my clothes sales to second hand.",5
6049,Great !,5
6050,Love love love it,5
6051,I love the filter options & love giving old clothes new life.,5
6052,Wish there was a way to search by measurements instead of labeled sizing as well. Or more filter options.,3
6053,Did not receive a return label. They're telling me to reprint it and it shows it reprint but I can't find it. I'm not getting any help from them and there's no phone number to call. And I am not paying for everything that was in that goody Box. Customer service is awful!!,1
6054,"Fun, lots to choose from, shipping & packaging are good and so far all my finds have been in great condition.",5
6055,A bunch of thieves im here looking for my kit that o sent off in august and no reply,1
6056,"Fairly easy app but not all web version options are available on the app. Such as tracking your items that are being processed. I've been a TU fan for about 3 yrs and have had good experience. On average I keep about 40% of the items I order for one reason or the other. My only negative feedback is the length of time to process items I'm trying to sell. Used to take a few weeks, pandemic caused a few extra weeks and now...not so sure. It's going on 5 months since my selling items arrived.",4
6057,They don't ship to Alaska,1
6058,Not for men no,2
6059,Clothing quality wasn't that great,2
6060,Loving the rase of use for consignment and prices for purchasing.,5
6061,"Love the app when it works. Half of the time when I go to open the mobile app, it doesn't go beyond the opening screen. It's been three days since I've been able to use the app due to this issue. I wish I could rate it higher as I love Thredup, but some bugs have got to be fixed.",2
6062,All of the clothes look like their from the early 2000s,1
6063,Cool app. Decent priced clothes I just hope they fit when I get em,5
6064,Love this app.,5
6065,"It's a great site. Every once in a while the app will close on its own or freeze, otherwise it's the main way I shop for clothing",4
6066,I have gotten good clothing from here. If you're selling you don't earn that much though so that is downfall but buying is great.,4
6067,Easy peasy fun-filled shopping! I love how the items come wrapped in tissue paper in the pretty boxes. I did have an order that FedEx lost and customer service refunded my money. I recently sent a bag of items in for consignment and hope to have just as great of an experience with that as I do with purchasing. Thanks Thred Up for making shopping fun!,4
6068,Everything about this company is right!,5
6069,Overall am enjoyable experience thus far. Thank you 💗,5
6070,"I like to browse hoping to find that perfect item. I haven't received my first purchase yet, so I will have more of an opinion.",5
6071,All that I have purchased has been true to the description. Love the bundles and deals.,5
6072,Pretty good. Would be perfect if the App would allow sorting and searching within my favorites.,3
6073,I LOVE thredup! It feels great to do better by the planet and score amazing deals on designer brands!,5
6074,Love this app so much always amazing deals on such amazing products every time I order off this site I always get my stuff in such great condition and shipping is pretty fast as well and I live in Alaska!!!,5
6075,"Terrible filtering and sorting ability. Doesn't sale all your ""favorites"" items. Constantly shuts down and closes mid use. This app and the site need major upgrades to make shopping enjoyable and not frustrating.",2
6076,Love love love.. Items arrived nice and clean in a cute gift paper wrap and box.,5
6077,I've been using it for years and it's been great. Good quality clothes. Only thing I don't like it gives me sizes too big for me along with my size even after doing the filter of just my size.,4
6078,"I love Thredup! I take advantage of being able to choose from so many options. I shop mostly in Premium brands; otherwise most of those items would be out of reach for me. The idea of recycling clothing that still has lots of use still left in it appeals to me so much more than buying new, synthetic clothing whose manufacturing process pollutes our environment. Thanks, Thredup, for a sustainable alternative.",5
6079,Super awesome deals which I need as a mother of four,5
6080,"I love the items I received and that we are helping the environment. Two things keep me from rating higher. Returns take too long to post, and when an item becomes available you have to search for it rather than it being easy to locate. I lost several pieces due to this issue.",4
6081,Been buying my clothes from thredUP for years. Returns easy and the app is strsight forward and EASY. Halpy Birthdsy thredUP!,5
6082,Great products and service. So happy with the purchases I've made and how much I've saved!,5
6083,"I would rather buy second hand than support fast fashion, and this site makes it easy! I only wish they also had a men's section.",5
6084,I love being able to shop multiple brands without having to drive all over kingdom come. The quality of the clothes is as described. And I've loved everything I've purchased (which is lots)!,5
6085,Only women's and children's clothes. Not sure why.... especially in 2021.,1
6086,"I spend WAY too much money but love it otherwise. Easy to navigate and filter down to just what you're looking for. I'd give it 5 stats if I could sort or group my saved items. Right now you can sort what you are looking through, and create saved searches to group but once you '♥️' an item they all go into a single list. Its still really user friendly and I can thrift shop AND stay home. Perfect.",4
6087,"It's great when it works, but half the time it won't even load past the opening screen. Constantly crashes, which is frustrating. Lately it has stopped recognizing my account while I'm shopping, so I have to log out and log back in to see my favorited items. What is going on?!?",2
6088,"This app does crash on me sometimes, several times in a row. Especially when I'm doing late night shopping. :)",4
6089,"Love clothes prices and idea behind it. I have kept my kids and myself dressed in name brand truly without breaking the bank...I gave it a low rating because of FedEx. They take a very long time to deliver every single time. I don't know how much other people buy to use as comparison, but I have bought close to a thousand dollars worth of clothes over the last year and I consider myself a valuable customer. I hope this problem really is taken into consideration.",3
6090,"Awesome app, easy to use, great products, unbeatable prices and always excellent service. This is my go to places for clothes, shoes and purses!",5
6091,"Freezes up, search function is not intuitive, latest update seems to have dropped the find similar items function, This next part is not an app issue. It's a thred up issue: I have ordered 2 items that were mislabled. Ex: nwt item descibed as long sleeve t shirt. Item that arrived is clearly a pajama top, with a sleepwear hangtag and a label inside saying sleepwear. Buyer beware.",3
6092,I absolutly love thred up.they have nice things for a good price.plus everytime you buy you earn points to get money off too!,5
6093,"I always get compliments on the stuff I buy from ThredUp and I recommend it all the time! I love how there is a range of prices available so you can always find something within your price range. I appreciate how easy it is to return items as well, however, it does take awhile for the returns to be processed. It's understandable, considering how many items they have, but it is something to keep in mind!",5
6094,"Fast delivery, good price, great clothes",4
6095,"I used to go thrift shopping all over Atlanta and loved it. During Quarantine, I discovered - ThredUP and was so Excited! As I watched my Bravo TV (don't judge me! 😁) I would favorite things I wanted/needed. Over the next days, I would ""think"" about what favorited, I would look at my closet to see what I was missing, and in a couple days I would re-visit my favorites to buy or put back. THEN, I got emails if the items I favorited were on sale!?! Crazy great. I recommend this app!! 👌",5
6096,I especially like their purses. You get some crazyyy deals and pay low low prices. I have bought about four from them. Liked them all.,3
6097,Easy to use to search and buy from,5
6098,If your looking for great cloths at a great price shipped to your doorstep this app is for you,4
6099,Not much for my size double n triple zero r double and triple smalls,4
6100,Love their promo codes on top of sales!!,5
6101,Everything I have bought has been exactly as advertised. It was new to me and I loved it! Thank you.,5
6102,Found exactly what I was looking for at a good price with quality material.,5
6103,Easy to browse and order.,5
6104,"I have not had any problems with this App but with Affirm and I still have not heard back about the Money they took out of my Checking Account, Can't get ahold of them???????",5
6105,It's not the app that's bad it's the customer service. You can't call anyone to describe your order problem. Item described was not as listed. If it's a non returnable item you can't talk to anyone which I feel is wrong if the item listed is not in good condition as described.,1
6106,Convenient to use the app.,5
6107,A great site for designer for less,5
6108,"Although this app is not perfect. I have gotten some brand new clothes, with tags on, up to 90% off.",5
6109,Processing time takes toooo long and the app hardly works I've been trying to go on the app for the past 2 weeks and it doesn't even open.,3
6110,"Easy user interface. It's great, I only give 4 stars because rarely it'll crash or freeze for no reason.",4
6111,Overall the app is great and a fun way to browse a wide selection of second hand clothing. I do wish that there was a bit more specificity when it comes to certain searches. For instance if you look for something in green every shade of green is shown from lime to olive to forest green. It would be nice to further filter colors by light vs dark.,4
6112,"La talla no es correcta, todo lo que compre no me quedo, es perdida de dinero y tiempo, no lo recomiendo. Las fotos engañan.",2
6113,"Love this company very reliable and great inventory even find new items at a great value! Also, don't miss out on their coupons! Enjoy!",5
6114,They're not specific on delivery times had I known it was going to take this long for me to receive my package I would not have ordered from them,3
6115,Great second hand clothing site that is environmentally friendly. Using these clothes again instead of encouraging the making of new ones.,5
6116,"-Great prices and products are neatly packaged. -The descriptions should be more detailed on what the items have as features (# of pockets, zipper type, etc) -Shipping is a little bit of a nightmare... 1 of my orders came when expected, but the other 2 have been delayed 3 times so far which is disappointing.",3
6117,"I got my first box, and more than half of the stuff in there I loved, but I didn't have enough money to keep any of it. So I took pictures of the items that I loved.",5
6118,Great selection,5
6119,THIEFS STOLE MY MONEY! THEY SAID I HAD UNTIL TODAY TO RETURN MY GOODYBOX AND THEY CHARGED IT YESTERDAY! CHAT KEEPS LOOPING AND WON'T LET ME TALK TO ANYONE!!!!!!!,1
6120,Overall good sometimes I have issues when trying to filter for more than one area.,4
6121,Very delighted with my initial three purchases!,4
6122,I like it let see if I stay with it,3
6123,Best place to buy Awesome clothes and accessories for loves ones.,5
6124,Is thredUP only clothes???,1
6125,Only frustration I've had so far is with my saved searches. Sometimes the page will glitch and only let me scroll through the first half of my saved searches. Doesn't stop me from shopping though lol,4
6126,I love this app! You can get some real bargains from their sale department and also some high-end brand names just by searching,5
6127,"After multiple purchases, I only had one problem. I received a jacket that smelled like my grandmother's hand and body lotion. The odor was so strong I could smell it as I was cutting the packaging open. I am going to try to get it out but if it is truly from an oil based lotion, I have my doubts. Everything else was great. I got all of my granddaughters school clothes through ThredUp, and a few for myself. I check it every week for new items. Thank you ThredUp.",4
6128,Best online thrift store ever... They always have the best prices on so many things. I recommend it to everyone. Thank you so much...,5
6129,Easy to use!,5
6130,I love this way of shopping!,5
6131,I've placed 3 orders through thredup and have yet to be disappointed. Always great deal and its cool because if you favorite an item you get notifications when that items price drops! I cant wait to place some more orders. I dont see myself shopping anywhere else from here on out!!,5
6132,App won't even open. I reinstalled it but had the same issue. Love thredUP but I can't do anything with the app.,1
6133,I made absolutely nothing off the sale of my items.,1
6134,This app does not work at all since the new update.,1
6135,It's a little frustrating to save stuff and it sells before you can buy it. Layaway plan would be amazing,5
6136,One thing that would be helpful is if you would put waist sizes with the skirt details.,5
6137,"In my opinion, the worst resale app out there. The amount of time that it takes to receive the purchased item is past ridiculous. If it were coming from Japan, I could understand it but it's being shipped from the US. I just sold jeans on Poshmark the 9th of September to someone in California, package was left on their doorstep today. I placed an order with Thredup on 9/4 and still haven't gotten it also, no updating from FedEx on where my package is. Deleting my account ASAP.",1
6138,Like all my stuff but wash before wearing things that come from china. Something makes me itch and I think it is the plastic.,5
6139,"I've used the app for over 3 years. It's pretty organized, and I have managed to find some nice things. But it has always frozen on searches after only a handful of go's. It gets stuck when trying to change search filters, or when just being used for too long. New devices and uninstall/reinstall has never fixed it. But my biggest heart ache? There is no filter for pockets. I really really wish I could filter skirts and dresses for pockets.",3
6140,"They got rid of the ""See similar"" option after one of your favorites has sold and that's how I found most of the items I bought.",3
6141,Easy peasy!,5
6142,Not great at selling..but love to look,4
6143,Great way to shop. I get nice things at great prices. Shipping is pretty fast. Lots of brand choices.,5
6144,Was mad when my returns cost me 245.00 cancel all my orders cancel my credit card if you don't I will,4
6145,"Overall good. Like that it shows pictures when you are looking for an order. Loses a star for my inability to see bid items. I used to be able to see them on computer, now I don't see them at all.",4
6146,I really love ThredUp. They have a lofty goal of saving the planet and providing a service that allows the average person to own new and gently used designer clothes at more than competitive prices. It's like Christmas everyday. Most of my purchases still have original tags on them. Returns are simple and easy. ThredUp is a top notch company and I tell everyone that compliments my clothes about it. My only complaint is I am running out of closet space. But I love my new wardrobe.,5
6147,Love the service but the app needs work. I'm an android user and the app never works properly for me. Def needs some upgraded software!,3
6148,I 😘💕💕💕 thredup!,5
6149,Always love shopping here. Great prices easy app to use.,5
6150,I've been waiting 4 months for Poshmark to process the items I mailed to them. Way too long. Hopefully they'll pay me by X-mas,1
6151,"The app is constantly freezing and crashing, despite me clearing the cache and doing force stops. I've also noticed that the shop for similar items option has disappeared which is a bummer. It's a nice feature (I've noticed it's gone on the website also, not just the app).",3
6152,Easy to use. Items are as described. Love shopping here.,5
6153,"Needs some tweaking, for sure. But overall, it foes the job. I just feel that the user interface needs some polishing.",3
6154,Affordable way to find gently used clothes! Eco friendly and easy to use app 👍,5
6155,Love it!,5
6156,The app works great. Shipping is horrible and customer service is only available through Twitter which is stupid.,2
6157,Was charged over $10 at the post office EVEN WITH A LABEL THAT THEY GAVE ME TO PRINT OUT!!,1
6158,New to the app but pleased so far!,5
6159,They're very expensive for being used and you should be able to cancel orders.,2
6160,"Would like to give treadup five stars as, I really like shopping there, However I had donated some clothes to sell never hearing back from the company and sometimes my credit card number was scammed there.",2
6161,Reasonably priced. Excellent selection. Great quality. Best consignment app I've found.,5
6162,Good place to find great things you can't find anywhere else!,5
6163,"I love shopping here because of the wonderful selections you choose from, the terrific sales, and the fact that I can dress in high end fashions on a thrifting budget. Thredup has become my new addiction.",5
6164,Nice App,5
6165,I didn't like it,2
6166,great,5
6167,"Great bargains and earth friendly fashion. Some items are brand new. I've cleaned out my closet and sent things to Thread up,, too.",5
6168,Easy to use,5
6169,"If I was just rating the app and buying process it would be 4 stars, but as a seller what they don't tell you is that the seriously mark up the clothing you send, accept less than 50% of more than acceptable clothing and pay you mere pennies for it. For example, they are selling a pair of my brand new, never worn Just Fab boots for 35.99 and all I'm getting is $5 out of it. Not to mention it was 5 months to process the bag in the first place. Will not be selling again. Love the concept though.",2
6170,"Great customer service, Great products and fast delivery.",5
6171,Why isn't there a way to rate transaction? Bought a purse and color looks nothing like what I bought. No returns excepted so will be keeping it but very disappointed.,3
6172,Love it,5
6173,I purchased a shoulder bag and you couldn't tell in the pictures that it was already peeling. I was very disappointed.,2
6174,Everything was going great until I had two returns at the same time well actually not even the same time two weeks apart that arrived on the same day. Thus causing them to try to overcharge my card without applying the credit for the other two returns. Then when I tried to get them adjusted before I corrected my payment method they told me that was not possible. Why would I overcharge my account and then have to fight for a credit from them. Then when I said I wanted to cancel they no,1
6175,App is great but needs more categories.,4
6176,Some nice stuff some really awful. I ordered once and wanted to return a top and thought it was a $1.99 restocking fee. Oh no there's an $8.99 processing fee to get the money back.,3
6177,"Shipping is horrible! Order something and it take over a month and the process constantly changes the date. I don't think I'll be using this anymore! To much of a hassle. Even with other order apps compared with shipping, this app takes the longest to ship 1 item!",1
6178,Love this app!,5
6179,First time I have shopped haven't got my merchandise yet,5
6180,I enjoy thredUP! I have some really great items that I can afford. One of my faves- Cole Haaaaaaahn! 🥰,5
6181,Pretty good app but I miss the suggestions they used to give you of similar items. It helped find a lot of brands I love and never knew existed,3
6182,Terrible I would never use them again and they gave me penny's eat pennies for the things that they made a lot of money off of and I never got the rest of my clothing back in which they re sold. Don't do it,1
6183,"Easy to navigate, awesome deals, supporting a good cause!",5
6184,"Cannot login with existing account on S21 Ultra. There is no visible option to login, only to sign up. I tried my login twice, was given an error message. I made a web purchase about 2 weeks ago and it was delivered to the wrong address, according to FedEx. That order had shoes that were for a friend's wedding, along with a rare Cole Hann bag and what was supposed to be my new work bag. I'm so unhappy with this experience.",4
6185,"Great deals on clothes and the prices are reasonable. However the sizing is confusing. I am a 25 waist in womens pants and Jean's. The item I like will state the proper waist size when in the results viewing, but when i click on it and scroll down the waist usually states a much larger number. This makes it fearful for me to make a decision with confidence.",3
6186,"Love their products, but this app randomly stops working. Will only show the Thredup opening page, then doesn't let me go any further. I have to force stop and reopen, but now that isn't working. Reinstalled and still doing the same thing. Can't get in to track my order or shop. Have to use my computer",1
6187,"Super easy to use,...wish they were more accurate in the categories, such as Boho being only Boho Business ONLY Business attire, it would make it easier to shop The categoriesYou want..... but over all its a fun app.",5
6188,No men's clothing. Why?,1
6189,I buy all of my clothes here! Unless I want something specific and new... but I shop like new and with tags so I feel like all of these clothes are new anyways. I have a guess dress with tags still on in in mint condition in my closet rn I can't wait to wear! Also I worked in retail and those new clothes are usually unwashed and super worn by everyone who uses fitting rooms so other people have worn your clothes unless you have it shipped and take it out of the bag yourself.,5
6190,I had a really good time shopping on this app.,4
6191,Good to shop. TERRIBLE to sell. Takes months for them to process a box. No customer support. And I have over 100$ I cant access or talk to anyone about. Thief app!,1
6192,"I find more clothes thru thread up then I can find in ""new"" clothes stores and the prices vary and more of a variety!!",5
6193,You don't any payout they will sell your stuff for high amount and only give you a few dollars it takes literally forever just to get your stuff processed and once they put it up for sell if it doesn't sell within like 30 or 60 days you don't get any payout of your stuff at all they are just making money off our stuff and your lucky to make any money off it at all I never would have done this if I had known I sent in some name brand top dollar jeans that I probably won't get a single dollar for,1
6194,Love the quality selections.,5
6195,"Buying experience was good. Definitely wish there were more photos of items and better photos of dark items. Biggest issue is with measurements, they aren't consistent and give almost no info for anything besides pants. Waist numbers are important for skirts too! The app: When I have been browsing for a few min it will often stop opening items, still allowing me to favorite, and I can open them from saved items. Second really irritating flaw, if my screen flips app resets to the home screen.",4
6196,"Love this app, sent the link to all my friends! What a great way to buy clothes, i started using it at the start of the pandemic, but will continue to use it long after!",5
6197,I Love that I can try things on at home with my own clothes next to them to see how I can mix and match.,5
6198,I've sold and bought from Thred UP and it was an enjoyable and easy experience.,5
6199,"The clothing is in very good shape, i'm always pleased!!",5
6200,"ThredUp gets 5 stars, but the app crashes frequently and I would give it a 3.",3
6201,Great app! Really fun to use and the gameify aspect of points gained per purchase really got me. I HATE that they use FedEx for delivery. Takes forever to deliver and doesn't keep you updated on delivery but that's FedEx not Thredup.,3
6202,Love this app.,5
6203,"I really wanted to love this app/idea as I buy nearly everything from re-selling apps, but I've been dissapointed. Not being able to search by types of style (like 60s or cottagecore) makes it very difficult to use. I understand all that is subjective, but I can't even search a basic term like ""circle skirt"" and get circle skirts. Also the return process takes like a month before you get credit back, and shipping also takes a lifetime. You're better off with any other reselling app.",1
6204,"I LOVE Thred Up! Good quality clothes, great prices! So in love with Thred Up 💕",5
6205,Order was incomplete no refund. option for contact is ridiculous and no one ever replied I paid almost 100.00 for multiple items and only received two times one in very poor condition when I selected the new/with tags option,1
6206,"If it weren't for the shipping.... this would be 5 stars. I use thred up all the time, I have bought and sold, and bought quite a bit more. There are some great deals to be had, and the same issues you would have with any resale shop (measurements and quality not being as described). Generally thredup does a great job of minimizing these issues. My only complaint is the shipping. I understand it takes awhile to ship, but once fedex has the package, it can take WEEKS to be delivered.",4
6207,Love this app great way to buy second hand clothes. This app takes thirty whole new level. I consider n continue to shop n sell my clothes here! This is only place I know that can get me a whole wardrobe 4 the low. Highly recommend shopping here all us fashionistas who shop on a budget! I don't like how this app doesn't really load very well. IT department need seriously fix this bug! It will get the full effect of shopping experience I deserve 2 hve! Please fix this. I will rate this app at 5.,5
6208,Largest seller of used clothing I've found--good for my budget and the environment. Plus great fun to hunt for amazing bargains and finds. Only wish more detailed descriptions were provided; this might lessen the necessity for returns.,4
6209,"Awesome deals and so fun, love the app so far",5
6210,I really love Thred up. Make sure to get the app first. Set up an account and password. Give your sizes and it gets saved and your searches will just show the sizes/preferences you selected. You can shop by brand if you like as well. Good quality clothing and accessories. Your favorites that you heart are saved and you can get notifications when they drop in price. There is an amazing quantity of clothing to search from.....oh and it is better for the environment to purchase second hand.,5
6211,love shopping on here it saves me alot money plus my items ate shipped quick and never damaged . I love the boxes and wrapping paper !!!,5
6212,I've ordered three time and have not been disappointed yet!!,5
6213,Love the deals and quality of the goods! Got a fabulous dress for my friends wedding for a steal!!,5
6214,There is no clothing for men in this store.,1
6215,"Great way to shop, excellent selection and great filters.",5
6216,"I love this thrift shopping from home. However, when I use the app I'm not always able to see the searches I want to see.",4
6217,No experience yet. First try.,4
6218,Item are good quality and many ordered have been new. Just wish there were more filter options and the options are huge.,5
6219,"absolutely no clothing for men, no way to filter your searches for male clothes",1
6220,Love this company!!! Their app is seamless and very easy to use and navigate. But I've removed two stars because I sent two large bags of GOOD clothes to sell and got literally pennies back for each. I'm not talking $20 back. I'm talking less than a dollar and the second back a couple of dollars. Ridiculous. Especially for the amount of money I spent over the years on this company.,3
6221,My favorite new place to shop!,5
6222,"App is awful, company is great. I've had to reinstall it 4 times in the past 2 days just to be able to sign back in.",1
6223,"Do not sell anything with them. All the stuff that they don't accept goes in a big container and they go through it and they use it for goody boxes. So they get paid for it somewhat. I sent in brand new boots, never worn and they rejected them for being scuffed.",1
6224,I love that they have a variety of styles and sizes.,5
6225,Great shopping experience.,5
6226,"This is a joke 5-15% payout for cheap items you sell? Lol, no way, that is a complete scam.",1
6227,ThredUP is the MOST fun in recycling~ keep your clothes and closet on the move.,5
6228,I wish there was a way to cancel a kit without waiting for the support team to resond back by the time they resond the kit gets to the destination,1
6229,"Spotty at best. Often just a white screen, not even loading",2
6230,"I used to love this app. Now they updated it for some reason and it doesn't work. I can't log in, the app is full of glitches and honestly its a hassle to do anything in it. Please make this app work again.",1
6231,Awesome,5
6232,App doesn't load at all on Android. Its been three days.,1
6233,"Measurements are wildly off in clothes descriptions. I got a dress with a 40"" chest and a top with a 31"" chest and they both fit me (37"" chest) the same. I've returned items before for inaccurate measurements and the items are relisted with the same inaccuracies for the next buyer. And they charge a return fee.",3
6234,Its easy to use. They notify you about all your save searches and favorites.,5
6235,Amazing awesome items and prices!! I'm addicted to this site!!,5
6236,"I love that once I place my order, it doesn't take long, I receive my order. And the clothes are really nice, ( the clothes I've order!)",4
6237,"Everything is great--in my opinion--except for two things: processing time and photos. When you send things in to sell, it can take up to 6 months for your items to be processed. And when you're shopping, the items available only have 2 photos for you to look at, those showing the front and back of the items. PLEASE take more photos, thredUP!",3
6238,Love this site! Easy shopping and tons of perks,5
6239,I have never had a problem with any order.,5
6240,This app is only for women and children smh sexist app,1
6241,Easy to navigate,5
6242,"Won't let me sign up, and there is no communication from this company. They suck",1
6243,This app makes buying 2nd hand fun and easy!,5
6244,NO MENS CLOTHES ? zero options for any mens clothing.,1
6245,I dont get ads in app. And i always forget to go back by hitting the hone bar even though i use this app daily for my resale business.,5
6246,I would give a negative if I could it's been well over a month now and I still haven't received my order. Supposed to be delivered today but I can't seem to track where they are. Not to mention that they pretty much held my bunde until I spent $75 I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SITE EVER AGAIN,1
6247,"The clothes I've received are great and the app works fairly well. My past few orders have then forever to be shipped and received. If you're ordering for an event, allow at least 3 weeks for delivery. It's really hard to get in touch with a person in customer service.",3
6248,"This app makes shopping secondhand so easy, I've ordered great clothes and they've always arrived exactly as they are described. The deals and discounts are amazing, I recommended this to several people already.",5
6249,High quality clothes for lower prices...yes please and the app is easy to use and navigate,5
6250,"To me is perfect in every way,Thank you.",5
6251,Thredup makes it very easy to shop. Lots of apps don't give the option of looking for items by color or pattern which definitely helps narrow down when you're looking for something. They also offer a bundle feature where when you make a purchase you pay the one time shipping fee of $5.99 you then have a week to purchase up to $79 worth of items & then we'll be refunded your shipping deposit. The return processes is quite easy & if you have a problem they're customer service staff is very helpful,5
6252,Love the app.....all except for their shipping time. It takes them at least a week to 10 days to ship your items.,4
6253,Beautiful,4
6254,Great app. I really enjoy using it though the notification are annoying and pop up often.,5
6255,"Fast delivery, huge selection great discounts on quality brands",5
6256,"Love the site, app won't even open over the last week.",3
6257,"Beautiful selection, saving serious cash!!",5
6258,Perfect,5
6259,Credit card payment through app consistently fails.,3
6260,This was a 5 star until this last update. App won't even load now. Love thred up but seriously! You get many purchases out of me if I can only do it on my laptop.,1
6261,"We love this app, specially my teenage daughter. Great quality products, easy to use and fast delivery. I recommended 100%",5
6262,Addictive,5
6263,"I haven't had any problems with the app, however, I purchased a purse for $69, marked as ""good"" condition and it had spoiled milk and or vomit inside of it. I would post pics if I could. Highly disappointed.",2
6264,Won't ship order. Won't let me login or talk to a agent! Very poor service. Don't adivce this app. Gwynne Craig,1
6265,"Easy to search and filter, good prices on quality used clothes. I wish they had men's clothes as well, but it has gotten myself and my daughter an upgraded wardrobe for a fraction of the cost.",5
6266,"Nothing but ugly, unfashionable clothes. Out of the thousands of tops I scrolled through, I found only 7 that I might purchase.",2
6267,Love shopping with thredUp,5
6268,"Could not use this app because I couldn't log into my account! I used my same email and password I use on the website, but it refused to recognize me. I tried resetting my password, but it still would not let me in. This was so frustrating, as I have an account, and I couldn't even browse on the app, without logging in. They really need to sort out this glitch. I was really disappointed with this service.",1
6269,Good app for buying used clothing (big points) however the app could be improved with better search filters (can't filter to long sleeve dress??) Returning items is easy too. Photos could be better quality so you can zoom on items or see different views of the item.,4
6270,Just donate your clothes because that is what you are doing if you send clothes to ThredUp. Good deal for them but not for sellers! Poshmark is better.,1
6271,"I do like the idea behind Thred Up. The only issue I have with it is, shipping costing around 15 dollars. When it isn't even for express mail or anything like that.",4
6272,Love this app. I alaays enjoyed thrift stores. Easy to use and quick on shipping.,5
6273,"Honest review. The clothes that did arrive were as advertised. They came very late and one item was missing. I was ordering for a trip, the clothes came after the date I left and I was offered no compensation. Return price is $9 so I wouldn't even break even if I returned. Buy at your own risk, customer service is non-exsistent.",2
6274,Ads...blah blah blah!! Too many ads they strat to just run together smh..othee than that the app is awesome!,4
6275,Obsessed,5
6276,"Really easy to filter by size, color, price, etc. Love this app!",5
6277,Horrible,1
6278,I absolutely love this app!! The only think that's missing is lingerie as long as it's new with tags!!,5
6279,"While I really like Thredup itself, the app is just annoying to use. There is only one huge flaw for me, and that's the fact that it keeps resetting itself to the home screen when I'm in the middle of browsing. If my screen switches orientation while I'm browsing, it resets to the home screen. If I shut my screen off, it resets. If I get out of the app to do something else and come back, even if it's less than a minute later, it usually resets. Why does it do that? 🤷‍♀️",2
6280,Awesome,5
6281,Unable to get in touch with anyone. Two orders outstanding for two weeks. No information. No answer. May be my last order. Overall rating no stars,1
6282,"Love shopping here but a week later and still ""consolidating my order"". A bit frustrating so don't expect to receive your items quickly. Otherwise I've always been happy with the items.",3
6283,"Ordering thru the app is easy without any problems with the checkout. Shipping I understand there's delays due to probably transfers from store to store. My usual size L/12 but due to size discrepancy and after couple of returns, just to try I ordered 4 skirts size 14 , just received my order and I am satisfied they all fit perfect. Fabric shows no sign of wear. I suggest to everyone ordering clothing from this website to be use for an event ,order 3 we to I mo in advance.",5
6284,Great company and mission! Feels good to recycle and fun shopping experience.,5
6285,"Some features in the app are a bit wonky. I'll try to go back to my active search from my cart and the app will close and I have to start all over. But I love ThredUP and have been shopping with them for years, it's pretty much the only way I buy clothes now.",4
6286,"This is a great idea but, the 14-20 days waiting to receive items purchased is absolutely ridiculous...especially if the items are already stationed in the same location. I would love to order more merchandise and more often but, it won't happen until they can be shipped out at a quicker pace.",3
6287,No men's clothing. They don't even give you an option for it. They only sell women and children clothing.,1
6288,I So like the collectives of shopping /thredup you wont leave this site without purchasing you maybe hours lookn so much good new old bohemian etc... like I'm stuck '13items less than 200$new stuff old good etc...... this is my 2nd order. I dont think Im ever going shopping out side my house .this is a cool situation I mean they have every thing!happy shopping if you should have APROBLEM They fix it with no problems real shopping YESSSSS 🤗,5
6289,What a joke,1
6290,my pant size is not available,1
6291,Love ThredUP! Highly recommend the goody boxes. They do a great job picking items out based on my style.,5
6292,"5 star company, 3 star app. Anytime I go to check out, I put in my card info, and then the app crashes or I get sent back to my cart, so I had to place my order using the website. Only way I would've been able to get it placed. App has a lot of bugs that need to be fixed.",3
6293,"It's not bad, just wish they add more images on the brands.",5
6294,"I've tried getting it twice now and it definitely is not for me. The clothes on there are very much either suburban middle aged mom clothes or clothes that a 13 year old would wear. If that fits you, then maybe this is for you. But I have a goth/emo/punk kinda vibe sometimes, the rocker look sometimes, and dad vibes other times; and I didn't find 1 single thing I even remotely liked lol",1
6295,Very poor pants i order mis unleading they are not bell bottoms pants i order not back in the 70s like it said my rate is very very low i will not order anything from them again,1
6296,"If I was rating ThredUp the company, it would be 5 stars. The app needs a lot of work. Since the last update it won't even open. Just sits on the loading screen forever. Even when the app is working, it crashes a lot and I can never get to the details page after clicking the thumbnail for an item. When browsing on the app I just favorite things to actually look at later on the website.",3
6297,"DO NOT SELL ON HERE. They only paid me $.75 for an item they sold for $30. Have returned more than Ive kept, their return policy sucks: requires you to pay shipping if you want a refund to your original form of payment, outdated, as well as a $2 charge per item to return. Their bundle system is a great idea, however beware if you choose not to bundle because they will consolidate your order anyway and hold an item that is at a facility 3 hours away from you to wait on an item from GA. Flawed.",1
6298,"Great shopping app, love all the filters available as there are a LOT of options to sort through in every category.",5
6299,It keeps freezing if I accidentally exit the app. It will just stay frozen in the front screen. Every. Time.,2
6300,"Women, girls, and boys only. No men's clothing. Why not?",1
6301,would be good for families. They carry no mens clothing.,3
6302,No men's section. Not worth the download. Not now...or ever.,1
6303,I love the fact that your company helps others who really need it. Caring across the world 🌎 ❤,5
6304,"I am in love with Thredup! They have detailed and accurate descriptions of their items, the prices are right and shipping is fast. Plus they give customers rewards good for free shipping, handbag discounts and free restocking fees for items you return. Can't get any better!",5
6305,"This is the worst place to buy used clothes. They take forever to ship and don't provide you with tracking info. Plus there's no one to contact, zero customer support!!! Terrible!!!!",1
6306,Great app interface and awesome clothes!,5
6307,"The app freezes a lot, very super slow but so is the website. Lots of spinning, sometimes pages spin indefinitely. But Thredup itself is really awesome and I love it.",5
6308,"i've gotten some great items!! So fun to look for items. Sizing is not consistent, so read the description to help understand!",5
6309,Wonderful app and service!!!!!,5
6310,Clothing is not photographed well. No men's clothes.,3
6311,"Prices on some items could be less, but over all I have had a good experience. Wish they had men's clothing on here.",4
6312,"More measurements would be better, otherwise good.",4
6313,"The whole thing is a scam, I thought I could sell clothes to get money but nope, you barely get anything like .50 it's a rip off. I should have just went to platos closet",1
6314,I just received my first order and I am not impressed! These say the right size but apparently they have been shrunk because they are atleast 2 sizes to small. And i compared them against other shirts of same size and the difference is obvious. Waste of money.,1
6315,I like tbe app its easy to use i buy alot and for the most part am satisfied with my purchases...the only thing i dont like is the only good discount is when u first sign up no matter how much you spend,4
6316,"Was ok at first but you can get a real person, you can't change your info and they have no phone number to call and the website they say to go to to send a email says there isn't an email with that info. So I give them a 100% no stars",1
6317,"App does not act like the site. It doesn't save any search information. Dissatisfied with the site and company as a whole anyway. Made a return and wasn't partially credited for shipping like it states I would be on the site. App and full website are worlds apart. This is apparent because you can't even see rescue boxes on App, only on site.",3
6318,"My wife decided to have ThredUp help her sell some of her best clothing items. She shipped the items and after 2 months, they messaged her telling her they lost her clothing shipment full of name brand designer clothes. The box contained 20-30 high end clothing items which they asked for a full list of clothing she shipped. When she provided it they decided to give her $10 per an item. If this is how they handle these scenarios then this is not a company I would recommend doing business with.",1
6319,Lags,1
6320,Quality merchandise at a very affordable price,5
6321,"Overall I love how affordable everything is, even the well known expensive brands. I also love ThredUp's message, being eco-friendly and reducing the carbon footprint caused by fast fashion. I would honestly just like it more if the clothing pieces were represented by people modeling them instead of mannequins modeling them so that I could more realistically have an idea of what the sizing looks like.",4
6322,"Wide range of tastes, in my opinion. I'm pleased with my experience.",5
6323,"This company is a total fraud! Missing high dollar items, poor communication and impossible to cash out. AVOID this company at all costs. And the app is horrendous! Crashes constantly.",1
6324,Easy to navigate and good items,5
6325,"Love love love LOVE this app! It does crash ALOT but for the most part its amazing.. I do think pricing cld be alot better due to one.. some of the items they post & the kind of condition it's in is NO WHERE near they're asking price & two. it's a thrift store, with used clothing some are new also but used shldnt not be priced at tht & pay VERY close attention to Jean rise, ALL of them. Some say mid or low rise while they're in fact highrise or highest rise. Customer service is great as well.",3
6326,Not for men,1
6327,Overall it's great,5
6328,"Love this app. My favorite part is that you can sort results by color options (can apply several at once) which makes finding a piece to match something else so easy. You can also filter by quality. Searching through ""new with tags"" is fun.",5
6329,"I was hooked from the first purchase I made. Clothes are high quality, clean, pressed, etc. Some people are funny about wearing used clothing. I feel sorry for them because they are missing out.",5
6330,Great prices name brand clothing.,5
6331,This is the best site ever. Wonderful products.,5
6332,"My first and last time ! Bought a jacket, it is too big. Returns are hard to navigate, still do not know how to obtain a shipping label as I do not have a printer !",4
6333,Would be much better if it would take my payment for the goodie box. No matter what I use it says it can't take the payment method. Not even for my chase account. Fix ur app and I'll give u a higher rating. That error message makes me want to delete the app altogether. Irritating,2
6334,Super easy to use,5
6335,I was happy with everything that I purchased. I got 28 name brand items for under 300 dollars 🥰,4
6336,The app is nice but it's easier to use the site.,4
6337,Ripped off,1
6338,"The clothes often are not the size or measurements they advertise as. Also, the pictures are awful and very difficult to know how an item might flow or fit. Filling the order to ship takes over a week then you have to wait for it to ship on top of that. Lastly, they say you can return items but once you realize it will cost you almost the price you paid for it, it's just isn't worth it. The only reason why I gave it three stars it's because it is nice to find name brand clothes at better prices.",3
6339,I love this company but the app is super glitchy. Buttons don't work. Cumbersome to navigate. Please fix the bugs!,3
6340,Love this app!,5
6341,Awesome affordable Gently Used Clothing and Shoes,5
6342,"First bad experience, I returned 2 items in their own packaging with their printed label from a UPS store. 2 months later they said that when they opened the package, it was empty. Really, a UPS driver physically handed you an empty bag? Then you accepted an empty bag? Sounds unlikely. Second, I ordered 2 pairs of pants on August 20th. It's 7 days later and it's just now getting to a Fed Ex store with no shipping date estimatation. There's better shopping options for consignment. Etsy, Mercari.",1
6343,Found this by accident. So glad I did. I have found great deals.,5
6344,Love this app. I get the clothes I want at great prices.,5
6345,My favorite app for shopping. Layout of website is great easy to use. I'm in the process of weeding out my clothes to sell them as well with ThredUp. Fun app with amazing finds. The sale prices are incredible. Absolutely love shopping with them,5
6346,Not a good experience!,1
6347,I found some really great pieces on this site. So far I've been pleased with my purchases and also the items I've sold.,5
6348,"Easy to use, plus it's always fun to find a unique item at a sale price. I have found so many good quality secondhand items! It definitely makes me feel less wasteful.hope you enjoy it too!",5
6349,I used a clean out bag. Sent a full bag of clothing in April. I'm still waiting for it to be processed. I would have sold them on poshmark. ThreadUP is too SLOW ...... ****Update funny after posting a bad review my bag was mysteriously taken care of and all my items were finally reviewed and posted. Let's see how long it takes to get paid after purchases are made.,1
6350,Fun shopping experience,5
6351,I have order 3 times now. The quality is great. Some items have not fit and were non returnable. The measure to are not very reliable on the website. Even with that I will continue to update my wardrobe threw this app.,4
6352,"Not trustworthy I bought a pair of shoes that said like new but they were ""well love"" and a little damaged so deleting the app not going to use it again",2
6353,Good but needs better brands,4
6354,Am a resale person would like to shop for bundles and rescue boxes,2
6355,"User friendly app, great store, wonderful customer service!",5
6356,It takes 48 years to ship the item. Horrible customer service. I'm not gonna buy from thredup anymore!!!!,1
6357,It was easy to navigate and purchase my items. I love the rewards for free shipping or $10 off. Clean out kids are so easy to order for selling clothes.,5
6358,Great app,5
6359,Nothing for men,1
6360,Aswesome love this site,5
6361,Wont Take my address. What a Mickey Mouse Brunch whoever rund this IS Not All all smart or even able Set Things Up right. What a fricking Joke!,1
6362,"easy to use, incredible selection, great prices, easy to return",5
6363,Customer service is awesome now I had gotten one person not helpful at first but everyone else has been great.,5
6364,I love Thred Up. I just received my first order. I am very happy.,5
6365,Easy to use and filter items. I like that I can save items and be notified when they are out of someone's cart.,5
6366,"Why is there no mens? Are men not allowed to thrift? Because I'm a man, and I go to the thrift store very frequently. I would like to know why the only adult sizes are women's. If you're a guy, or a girl for that matter, I'd recommend the superior thrifting app Depop. They also have more users.",1
6367,The app works great and it's totally addicting! I love fashion but work too hard for my money to spend money on brand new designer labels. ThredUp makes hunting for amazing deals super fun and I have set up a saved search for each season. Got some incredible designer clothing for a fraction of the price and completely upgraded my work wardrobe.,5
6368,It takes forever to open. Every time before opening I delete and install again and then open😑😑😑. The reason I'm doing it because I purchased something and I want to track it so yeah please fix it.,2
6369,I love this app..,5
6370,Love the app,5
6371,"For the most part, I love the app. It's super easy to search and to look through your favorites. A couple of issues though... it's impossible to track a return status so you have to use the actual website for that. And it groups your purchases a bit differently as well. I do wish there was a way to sort saved items into categories. It would be very helpful. But overall, I definitely recommend it.",4
6372,won't let me even view the app until i log in or sign up but it won't let me do either. as soon as i attempt to sign up it says welcome back yet ive never even created an account before,3
6373,Awesome shopping!,5
6374,So easy and convenient to use.,5
6375,"This is such a great idea for shopping 2nd hand. Almost all products don't even look used. They also do a try before you buy type deal which is called a goody box. It's pretty awesome cause they pick it for you after u answer the questions on your personal preference. Also there is an option to pay like using credit. I love the clothes I've found so far and I just can't stop shopping. The points and rewards are pretty good too. Like $10 off next order, 15%off hand bags and stuff.",5
6376,No answer from customer support..terrible service,1
6377,Love this app! Quick and easy to use. A friend told me about this app and have no regrets! I shop here for most all my shoes.,5
6378,I love it!,5
6379,This app sucks! I have turned in a bag of clothes in June have been waiting since on the bag to be processed. They give me a date said date arrives I get excited that maybe just maybe I will get to sell some of the stuff I turned in. Nope I go on and look at it and they pushed out the date another month. Very poor customer service in my opinion.,1
6380,This is trash. Both the company and the app. The company wants to charge you for everything and take forever to refund you if you have a refund. Items are not what they seem. Please don't sell through them either. You'll get pennies for your stuff and if there's something they don't want to sell you have to pay them to send it to you..... Now the App. It doesn't let you track packages directly. Doesn't even have a link to track..... This is just trash.,1
6381,"Great for buying, sucks for selling. At most you will get a couple of dollars selling your items. On top of that what you're selling can expire, meaning they don't appear in search results and whatever. Stupid system.",1
6382,"Feels like a treasure hunt. I hate clothes shopping but I love ThredUp. Great clothes, detailed descriptions, easy sells, and easy returns!",5
6383,"For being used clothing it is very pricey. Some of the items you can buy new in the store cheaper. I'm not the kind of person that has to have a name on my clothes to make me feel secure, so I find it hard to purchase things from here. But those of you that need a name, this is where you will find your used clothing.",3
6384,A Secondhand Shopoholic's Dream! I enjoy this app so much for myself and son. The prices and quality has been nice and it's easy to find what you are looking for without paying full price. I'm enjoy saving brands that I shop most and there so many clothes on here. I've tried the good box option and had. Avoid experience with it so far. Tha k you ThredUp for making Secondhand Shopping easy and fun without leaving my house❤️,5
6385,I love thrifting from anywhere at any time!! I've absolutely loved everything I've received from them!,5
6386,I have have find great items in this website. It is always a please t experience to shop here.,5
6387,"Great,new/gently used clothing,at super great prices..including the big name brands,why pay $$$$,when you can pay $$...some items w tags!",5
6388,Could you please list the waist width on skirts?,5
6389,"I love shopping here but this app hasn't worked well for awhile. Last month or so it wouldn't load an item after I clicked on it. Now with this update items will load so I can see them and add to my cart but at checkout, after entering my CC info the system just loops back to my cart. Why bother to have an app at all if I'm forced to my laptop to shop?!",1
6390,Love this app. Been shopping here since 2017!!!!,5
6391,Great selection of new and gently used items. The filters are helpful if your looking for something specific.,5
6392,"I've made several purchases from thredup. i figured out my measurements from how they measure and I've had no problems with dresses fitting me. They used to have a goodybox option to choose 10 items of your choice without a stylist's input. I wish Thredup would bring back that option!!! Also i wish items could be sorted by chest size, waist size, etc",5
6393,Perfect so far Always good experience,5
6394,Excellent,5
6395,I love to shop here I love the dicounts,5
6396,Love shopping with thredUP! The app is so easy to use!,5
6397,Love the selection of the inventory! Great when you are looking for something specific!!!,5
6398,"Love this app. I like to have a small wardrobe but change it fairly often, and I like it to be unique. This app is perfect for those goals, PLUS I feel good about my sustainable purchases. I buy quality clothes on here super cheap, wear em, then sell em back to thredup a year or so later for points and then I do it again!!!! Love this app. Get it.",5
6399,"Great clothing for cheap! Well worth it, was not disappointed.",5
6400,I am so sick of losing my cart because my app crashes! Love browsing but the deals are not consistent. My sister gets 50% off with a code & I only get 35%. The app is always crashing. Needs bugs fixed for sure. Sick of losing my cart bc it won't open the app. Also browsing certain sizes needs a fix. I am a size 12 pant but 16 dress. I hate that there isnt a way to filter better because I want to browse all categories at once.,3
6401,Love this app. Just wish they're was a way to save your bust size when searching for clothes. Other than that . It's a great app,4
6402,Takes too long to be shipped!!! I've already waited over a week and it still reads processing!!! Not om,3
6403,"Easy... Easy.... To Easy to spend all my money. But I do have to say, When I do have an allowance to shop, no to often, I will shop my local Thriftys b4 shopping T.U. due to pricing. I can only afford T.U. with discout codes & rewards.",5
6404,"Overall, a great shopping experience.",5
6405,No Men's section?,1
6406,I love ThredUP!,5
6407,"Mostly great. Searches could be better: difficult to separate active pants vs. casual pants, for example. Suggestions of if-you-like-this then you-will-like-this, but the items are not in your size is not helpful. For items like swimwear and activewear tank tops, it is difficult to tell if there is padding or a built in sports bra, etc.",5
6408,Easy quality thrift shopping,5
6409,Easy-to-use,5
6410,Great way to shop name brand clothes at thrift store prices at home,5
6411,"Love this site, and the app makes it so easy to find what I'm looking for.",5
6412,"Easy to use. Can easily filter for your size, brands, colors, ect. The only time I have issues is when I am trying to find a particular style of handbag. For some reason that filter won't work for me. Any other item I want filtered works.",4
6413,Fabulous!,5
6414,I was very happy with this app but sadly they no longer list or provide any measurements for clothes. I cannot depend that a size large will actually fit me. Therefore I will not be able to promote or purchase from this app again until this Problem is fixed. I'm very disappointed,3
6415,Seriously the best option to get clothing. Brand names for so much less!,5
6416,I love shopping with them,5
6417,"So happy to have found thredUP! Plan to buy a good portion of my clothes here, especially so I can feel better about my imprint on our environment, but also love that I can find my favorite brands that are still in great shape all on one site! At MUCH better prices!",5
6418,It's hard to get an accurate feel of what the item is that you're selling with only two little pictures,4
6419,Thread up has a great feature were you can lock your size and fav brands to do your search. Love it.,5
6420,"I seriously love this app, high-end & good quality items for reasonable prices. Hundreds of thousands of items to choose from. Who could say no to that!?",5
6421,"So many options, so little time!",5
6422,"ThredUp is a great place to shop. The items are nice, gently used or brand new. The prices are sometimes steep, and the descriptions are not that good. Purses - we need to know if straps are include or not. European shoe sizes - learn them. I've purchased two pair of shoes and both were not even close to my size.",5
6423,"The app can be slow when they are having a sale and many users are on it. I love it anyway, it's very easy to use and there are so many filters!",4
6424,no men's clothing 😔,1
6425,Awesome way to shop! And sell,5
6426,LOVE THE PRODUCT LOVE THE PRICES. Only wish I would have found it sooner!!!,5
6427,"Love this site. Lots of ""quickie"" sales!",4
6428,There is less information in the app and I lose my place sometimes. Overall the app is fine I just wish I could have kept certain functionalities. Life is busy,4
6429,"I love the item on thread up, can't wait to shop for Fall",4
6430,No menswear. Delete,1
6431,Easy to use and find your fave brands!,5
6432,If you want what you ordered in this lifetime don't order from thread up I ordered several things for my daughter to start school with we are struggling financially my husband got laid off due to COVID-19 and just went back to work after a year we can't just run to the mall and buy whatever we want for 2 teenage girls I will never use this app again Poshmark is just ast good and I get what I ordered in a week,1
6433,Great prices and selection and awesome customer service,5
6434,"App is decent, occasionally will just boot you out and can be finicky. Otherwise it's fine. Make sure you check the product descriptions before buying, not everything is actually your size. Had a hem length listed as the waist size, would've been 6 inches too small",4
6435,"Received my jacket, which I love. But my other two items were received much later. But everything was perfect! Over the pandemic I grew into 2 pairs of jeans..oh well. Love thredUP!",5
6436,"Love this app! I tell all my friends who are looking for their favorite brands for a fraction of the cost that there is no where else to shop other than ThredUP. I have made multiple purchases, and the description and quality of the clothes, the timelessness of the shipping, and the conscience thought towards sustainability make me repeat customer. The app is easy to use, and I personally love the heart feature because I can ""window shop"" my favorite brands and make my purchases when I'm ready.",5
6437,"Efficent, quick responce very prompt",4
6438,I do almost all my shopping on ThredUp.,5
6439,"Thred up rocks! If you use points accumulated for free shipping or $10 off, i would recommend being 100 % certain of your order. If you change your mind and back out, you don't get the points back. Otherwise, i enjoy the site and its app.",4
6440,The app is not working I wrote to customer service they said they were going to help me and they did they told me to wait 3 days to reset the app which I did and it's still not working the items for sale are awesome they very nice especially the plus size ones but I cannot use the app whatsoever when it's it going to be fixed it talks about having two emails which I don't I use my Google and that doesn't work please fix the app thank you,1
6441,No mens clothing,1
6442,Usually great! Sometimes the filters are a bit buggy though.,4
6443,Love this app!,5
6444,"It worked great when it worked. Now I absolutely cannot log in with my Amazon account. All of my credits and purchase history are connected to Amazon so I don't want to have 2 log-ins. But, I can't play Bingo without using the app, so there are all these deals I cannot access because the login won't work. This app is useless to me if unable to log in with Amazon. And I'm certain my passwords are correct. Something isn't connecting right with the app to non-gmail log-ins options. Very frustrating",1
6445,thredUP offers a variety of secondhand clothing items and handbags at prices you can't beat. They often run sales and my orders always arrive in a timely manner.,5
6446,"Please something for men / teenage guys, thank you",1
6447,Great deals! Fast shippong!,5
6448,Great!,5
6449,Love this app!,5
6450,Better than Thrifting!,5
6451,"I've enjoyed using the app. Fast way to see clothing. The website does offer more details. Also, so far returns I have made have been straight forward. Love that since making returns can deter me from shopping online.",5
6452,"When shopping, if open for more than say a a half hour, app locks up and I have to close and reopen it. Otherwise it seems to work fine.",3
6453,"Love THRED UP! ESPECIALLY LOVE THE RESCUE BOXES, just wish I could buy the jewelry sometime!",5
6454,Very nice app and thredup has always been my favorite place to shop,5
6455,"Sign in page asks for your email and password without letting you make an account, the takes you to a page with an add to download the app? I didn't even make it to the shopping part...",1
6456,So much fun,5
6457,I can't say enough how much I love ThredUp!,5
6458,It takes so long for them to ship out items. It's been 4 days since I placed my order. Tomorrow is day 5 and it still says processing. And then they say it can take up to 11 more days to recieve the items.. Will not be ordering from them again after this.,1
6459,"Clear description of condition of clothing and the app operates smoothly. Love that it makes shopping more sustainable, too. Only wish it were possible to zoom in. Maybe it's user error?",4
6460,"Doesn't have all functions of website. Not showing me Bingo codes for discounts! Hidden behind the ""shop ....."" Banner.",3
6461,"I love the fact that you can search for different items by color, price, etc. It makes it a lot easier to locate an item if you're looking for something specific! You can earn points pretty quickly for free shipping and other perks, which makes it nice. The returns are very easy, although I haven't returned very much over the years I've been ordering. It's like Christmas morning waiting at my mailbox to get my thredUP packages, love it! 🤣❤",5
6462,I posted a 4 star review but I just had to return an entire bundle of pants because they were ALL labeled wildly incorrectly. It is false advertising to completely LIE about a products size and material when the label is attached and clearly says otherwise. Very disappointed and furious that I have to use points or money to fix thredups mistake.,2
6463,"I thoroughly enjoy this site and praise GOD for allowing thred up and others who deliver without physically going to a store. I'm not lazy, with MS my mobility has become impaired for the moment.",5
6464,"I love this app! Particularly the filters, ease of ordering, and clear communication.",5
6465,Items are shipped quickly.,5
6466,"The App is great. One thing I wd like to see is if the waist on pants, skirts, and shorts are elasticized or fitted.",4
6467,"Takes forever to get your order. I purchased my order on Tuesday of last week. They did not ship it out until the following Monday (almost a week later). They sent via FedEx to arrivecby Thursday - not bad, except that it made it to Idaho and is now in limbo. I have a wedding Sat and thought that 8 business days prior would be ample time to get my package. I understand the shipping delays are not their fault, but theres no buffer time for a delay bc it took so long for them to send.",1
6468,Love everything in this store its amazing,5
6469,HORRIBLE!,1
6470,"I love thredup because it is online shopping while also getting the thrill of treasure hunting like at a thrift store! I love that I can set my sizes to search within and narrow down what I'm looking for by brand, color, condition, and more! I recommend thedup to so many people!",5
6471,"Huge scores! My first purchase would have been over $1000 ( 3 designer pairs of jeans and 3 designer pairs of boots)...after low prices, sales and additional discount I purchased all 6 items for $93! To make it even better, if I don't love an item or it doesn't fit right, I can easily return them. Will definitely be back for more awesome deals! 😲🏷️👖➕👢🛍️👏😍",5
6472,Easy and relaxed shopping.,5
6473,The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it has a rare tendency to stall or quit.,4
6474,"I love thredUP. It is incredibly easy, reliable, and the clothes are excellent quality. I've ordered several times, and I'm always pleased at how much I save AND doing something good for the planet. Lifelong customer.",5
6475,This app is so glitchy!,2
6476,I really really like this app 😻😸,5
6477,Good app! Useful!,5
6478,Been very happy with everything I've gotten,5
6479,Lm qom look Ki-moon om,1
6480,Just received my first package and I have zero complaints! It feels good to shop second hand because you're getting GREAT deals and you're putting items to use that would otherwise be waste. Will definitely purchase here again!,5
6481,I have no issues with the app at all. Company is great. Not just elite brands so dont let that (in the)advert turn you off to trying them out. They have quick service in getting you your purchases no untimely waiting even with covid. When you open your package its like getting a gift; its so nicely done. Love this company. I would love it if they expanded to mens wear as well.,5
6482,Placed my order on the 7th of August. Money deducted from my account on the 8th. Order still has not shipped and it's the19th. No tracking info available. Can't get in touch with anyone to find out about my order.,1
6483,"App won't open . I've purchased quite a few things on the old app. And I love it,but the new app seems to be having trouble",3
6484,"I'm a little addicted to ThreadUp and this app makes it all quick and easy to shop, return items, and track your orders.",5
6485,"You guys need some more instyle and trending inventory honestly, but overall a really great app and semi-easy to use...😄",4
6486,"I have to say. I love thread up. But whoever took over their new app or whatever they have done. Terrible. It's very difficult to navigate. Can't put in certain things such as if you're looking for jeans high-waisted. They've taken away so many features. I don't find it fun to browse and shop anymore. Deleted to edit. I don't know how you're going to troubleshoot me around when the options aren't there. I don't know if it's different on Google's and compared to apple, it might not be your fault.",3
6487,Literally doesn't work on mobile,1
6488,"Incredible navigation and shopping, however I don't think their measurements are always accurate, and some ""signs of wear"" might mean there is a tear or rip in the clothing. The photos are a little hard to determine certain details about the clothing, especially if it's a black piece, but still much more appealing then an at home photoshoot. All in all 4/5 very good and fun to use. Update: app now refuses to load the clothing page, so I'm unable to see the details. And checkout doesn't have PP",3
6489,Love it,5
6490,Freezes a lot,3
6491,Customer Service is not good. Hard to find a way to contact customer service and if you do find a way out takes days to respond. They rely to heavy on faq.,2
6492,They have a wonderful selection,5
6493,Always find something I want to wear.,5
6494,"Free ship to donate is my 1st favorite about this site. 2nd send items and put for sell then get to poppin tags on your new threads for your kid, hubby, & you. I love this and the support and service they provide.",5
6495,The pittance I got for my items wasn't worth the trouble of ironing them and mailing. Items on sale are highly priced. This place is making a lot of money off our clothes. Would rather contribute to charity.,1
6496,"I absolutely love the idea of an online thrift store. Great brands at amazing prices and in excellent shape. Tons of options with rags still attached. I'm only shown my sizes so it narrows the search and makes shopping that much easier. Whatever I don't love, I can return. I can also clean my closet out for credit or cash. Ive been able to basically switch out my entire wardrobe for 100's to 1000's less. I'm lowering my carbon footprint, saving water and loving my experience.",5
6497,Great UI. You can almost find anything using keywords.,5
6498,Always great. Love threadUP!,5
6499,"This ap is not good for my emotional spending moments haha. Love the bundle shipping option, and that I can save favorites to come back to later. It allows me to think on things without impulse buying because I might lose it. Overall it is easy to use, and super helpful. Every now and then it doesn't do what I ask it to (select any option and it goes to what it wants or previous screen), but a quick restart usually resolves that.",4
6500,Love an app that helps me make money,5
6501,Love it easy to use,5
6502,"Having issues since the most recent update. Once I select an item in order to view it more closely, I get a greyed out images if the item and a ""loading"" wheel, but it never completely loads. I have no way to add any items to my cart, or to even view more than just a thumbnail view of items.",2
6503,I came upon ThredUP after trying out a couple clothing subscription services. I didn't like not knowing what the clothes looked like prior to receiving them and the prices were way out of my budget. This option is more affordable and let's me do the shopping. The app is very easy to use and navigate.,5
6504,I Absolutley LOVE THIS APP! IT IS FOR SURE ONE OF MY FAVS!! GREAT JOB!! THANK YOU!,5
6505,"Love the app, but product detail pages load indefinitely, meaning I can't evaluate clothing in order to buy.",3
6506,Love the prices and the interface!!,5
6507,For me not worth it.,1
6508,App does not open most of the time...just constantly loads or says there is no connection...pretty bad...have installed and reinstalled numerous times and still doesn't work,2
6509,"I can only get the app to launch about 30% of the time. I thought it was my phone, but I have the same issue on my new phone!",1
6510,"Outstanding variety, price points for all pockets, quality, items arrive nicely laundered, easy returns.... 99.99% pleasure to shop!!",5
6511,"My experience with thredUP in general was awsome, But I recommend using the thredUP website. It's easier to navigate, and the product pictures are not blurry. I also have one request: It would be great that, if posible, washing instructions could be on the product information (because I accidentally got an item that was dry clean only). Edit: I realized that if you use this app ON YOUR PHONE....it would be fine. Since I'm on my laptop I prefer the website.",4
6512,Great deals,5
6513,"Waste of time. Online i had 0 problems! But since i downloadef the app... I keep getting kicked from it, when i un-heart a favorite item it doesnt go away & it doesnt take me to the page i'm tryingto view!! It's very frustrating!!!",1
6514,Forced updates are too frequent,2
6515,Love the convenience of online shopping! So many different name brands to choose from and great prices! Love this site I highly recommend it!,5
6516,"Awesome app, very easy to use! Have made multiple purchases through the app without any issues. I prefer the app over the browser experience! All that said; it takes forever to get stuff shipped. If you're looking to buy something in a hurry, don't use Thredup. I've done multiple orders, and the minimum amount of time, between placing the order and receiving my items, has been 2 weeks, up to 3 to get them delivered, with items being held up at FedEx hubs for whatever reason, for days. Beware!",4
6517,"It's okay but interface sucks and it's hardtop shop or narrow things down. For example if you try to click on the search bar to correct a misspelled word, it erases the entire search bar rather than letting you edit. You can't filter for maxi dresses,waist definition, etc. Also they classify cardigans as ""kimonos"" which they're not. Kimonos are Japanese dresses and it's racist/out of touch to call regular ugly cardigans kimonos",3
6518,Customer service is friendly & eager to help. The app is so easy to use and I LOVE the items!! Get to shopping GURLS,4
6519,"Everything that I've order has met my expectations!! I have a blast looking at everything. I just wish I could actually speak to a real person when there's a problem, but outside of that I LOVE THREDUP!!!!",5
6520,"ThreadUp has been an amazing way to shop sustainably while exploring styles! I love how the default search shows only my sizes, and the sales are great :)",5
6521,Love shopping with Thredup and that most things are returnable if they don't fit right!,5
6522,I love this app😍,5
6523,"One of my favorite places to shop. Some of the deals are amazing, brand name clothes generally half price or less. Plus selling is so convenient and easy, a great way to clean out the closet.",5
6524,"I upgraded to a pixel 4, and cannot get the app to open. I have restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled and I keep getting ""Oops, sorry we're having problems loading the app try again later""",1
6525,Great,5
6526,wonderful,5
6527,"Always a great deal, and excellent very well preserved pre owned clothing!",5
6528,I appreciate your app it's super awesome I like your website and buying clothes off there. I get some really good prices however I am struggling with seeing the clothing items because during an update you removed the click to zoom feature. So maybe you could help me out with that. Love your clothing.,4
6529,"App AND website are so not user friendly its so annoying to use. Literally was on the website for a few seconds, same with the app, undownloading it now.",1
6530,The company is great but the app doesn't work well. You can't see all of the buying options with the app- like the box of favorites. You can only see it on the PC.,2
6531,"I really like your services. You are an easy to use service that makes everyone happy, the buyer and the seller, which is a very unique feature. I haven't heard of another service that allows you to order a shipping bag for FREE, allows you to stuff the bag to the max and provides a service for the bag to be picked up or you drop it off at the PO, for FREE FREE FREE, that's fantastic!",5
6532,"Shipping experience has consistently been awful with Fedex. For over a week there was no information on my purchase, leading me to question if I just lost money on nothing. Since then, there have been multiple delays on the package expanding nearly another week. I do love ThredUp and what they stand for, but I don't know if I'll be using them again because of all this uncertainty. It's been over 2 weeks now since I placed my order. Please don't continue to use Fedex!",3
6533,Beautiful Clothes,5
6534,"Love browsing and shopping, but the app is always very glitchy for me. Constantly having to close and re-open the app to get it to function properly, and very long wait time for the app to reopen again. Really hope the app experience can be improved.",3

6536,I love thredup.,5
6537,Awesome finds! Incredibly low prices and shipping is affordable. I highly recommend.,5
6538,Everything is perfect when doing business with thred up. Absolutely perfect.,5
6539,Love it 😀,5
6540,Awesome!,5
6541,Just love this place,5
6542,I really am happy with this app,5
6543,"Love the site, great app. Some minor bugs with tracking or navigating, but otherwise fine!",4
6544,"I've used thredup for a few years and consistently have had a good experience. You can get super good deals and the clothes are pretty high quality considering its thrift. sometimes the sizing is a little off, but it IS consignment so that's to be expected - reading the description helps. Highly recommend. Also the app is not as buggy as many other shopping apps are.",5
6545,Love it!,5
6546,I love this app!,5
6547,Love Thredup...I am addicted...on this site every day,5
6548,I have only made one purchase but everything came exactly as described. Love getting new to me pieces while helping decrease waste! ❤ I check the app daily!,5
6549,"I've ordered a few times now.. I like and keep about 75%. So losing time and money (restocking fee) shipping back. Unfortunately-items are not well described. I need to know the fabric.I see ""material: unknown"" Last complaint. Thred up orders are slow to process and slow to arrive. AND Its fun when they do! Cute packaging. So far I order on my computer. Now ill try the app.",4
6550,"Buying: You can save searches for your favorite brands, or specific items from those brands. Frequent discounts on certain clothing categories & you earn ""points"" when you shop or donate to use later. A little pricier than other thrifting apps & no haggling.. which I almost prefer! Selling: Less $ back but w/o the headache of doing it all yourself so to me it's worth it + no shipping costs! Just print the label & drop off @ usps Edit: -1 * bc you can view all saved searches in app, only desktop",4
6551,"I have had your app on my phone for a couple years. Unfortunately I never looked at your your clothes that are gentle used. I have been watching adds on You Tube, I have liked what I had seen. I'm ready to try a few of your items, to see what quality your gently used clothing. I'll give you a feedback when I get the items I'm purchasing. I really like that you have children clothes as well as men's. I normally shop on Ebay for my teenage Grandsons. He wears all sport name brand's.",5
6552,Found some pretty things,5
6553,Love the discount,5
6554,The search function can be wonky at times.,4
6555,Do you not sell men's clothes? What? Huh?,1
6556,"Editing my 5 star. Thredup does NOT value customers time at all and will cancel an order w/out any notification. They won't save the items I spent hours looking for & were perfect items only for them to cancel w/out correspondence. The reason come to find out after more wasted hours on chat- I had another past email which was tied to a business account still used by my ex. Chat feature is a joke so are the reps Celisa, Jose, and Sara. Thredup doesn't value your time and no respect for follow up",1
6557,Waiting on an order that I placed several weeks ago!!! Would love to get it soon!,5
6558,So far I like it!,5
6559,"False advertising clothing as the wrong cut and rise. Ordered over 10 pants that were labeled bootcut and came in skinny leg. Ordered items on 7/29 didn't receive until 8/12, paid $24 I'm re-stocking fee and 2 of the wrong items were non returnable. You can't get your money refunded to your payment method without having to pay your own return shipping either. This was such a terrible experience. Now I'm stuck with a store credit because I didn't want to lose anymore money having to pay shipping",1
6560,After reading all the disappointments in buying and selling clothes i think ill pass.,1
6561,"I love ❤ ❤ 😍 Thredup, you can find whatever you need for your wardrobe or start a new one. I highly highly recommend 👌",5
6562,"I hate shopping, but this is so much fun!",5
6563,Didn't see a men's section,1
6564,Good. Need more description for the clothes. Like how old.,4
6565,Always satisfied,5
6566,Always have a deal!,5
6567,Great product,5
6568,Like the app but shipping takes forever,3
6569,I was loving thred up until it stopped letting me view the item in detail. It just sits there and wont let me look at details of the item like side or back. Just lets me view front.,3
6570,"Overall a great app. The only improvement I would like to see is for them to make it easier to search for specific items, e.g. curvy skinny jeans.",4
6571,Easy to use! Can easily edit searches and filter down to specifics! So many sizes and styles available! No ads!,5
6572,"ThredUP sucks. Sorry, but jeans was the first thing I wanted to look for and while looking for a pair. I'd see a nice looking pair that the picture and size says 31, but when you click the picture to get a better look at those jeans. It says they're a totally different size. It is this way with or without the filter(s). Hope you can fix this. A suggestion I have is, if you could make an option where you choose to see nothing smaller than a certain size. That'd help.",1
6573,Returns are now taking over a month to be processed,1
6574,My girls loved their clothes. You guys rock! If their is a problem with your order they fix it. I liked that. I will shop with Thredup again. 😊👍,5
6575,"Love thredUP! I have shopped a competitor as well and hands down thredUP will have 100% of my business. Super fast shipping, amazing brands, and so much variety what's not to love.",5
6576,Great deals and very easy to use. A must have app for fashionistas on a budget!!!!,5
6577,Good. Order arrived quickly.,4
6578,"Had the app, said I needed an update. When I went to update it wouldn't let me. So I deleted the app hoping it would let me re download the new version. Now I cannot install the app, it's like the install button is broken but works on the rest of the apps in my app store.",1
6579,"Love this app. Fast shipping, great products and easy returns if stuff doesn't fit!",5
6580,Still waiting to finish red tape cant ship till don,4
6581,I bought some clothes from them and someone from the company used my gift credit card to the limit. When I contacted them they told me to call my credit card company. I got very lucky not to used my real credit card but be careful with that! I will never use the website again.it was criminal what happened to me.,1
6582,"This app. is consistent in functioning. It works well with saved searches and notifications. ordering, tracking and returns are a breeze.",5
6583,"Great choices and loads if options. Quality is good. I've even purchased clothes that are like new, and the price tag is still on it. Many recognizeable brand names. Low prices.",5
6584,"The app in general, is easy to use but I think the searching system is not very good. Ex: if I search for a fabric, the app usually shows me items that the Brand name is the fabric I searched for etc. I have the same issues as some of the other people that reviewed. I have to check the website if it's a better experience.",4
6585,Good,5
6586,"I Am So Pleased With This Store, I Love Everything About It, The Cloths, The Prices, The Support Team, Keep Up The Good Work a",5
6587,It is impossible to get ahold of anyone at this site. Goodluck placing an order.,1
6588,"Love the style, but not the prices. Seems like they should be lower. But that's just me..",4
6589,"I absolutely love this store, BUT, there's alot of discrepancy. For example, kids clothing. A lot of girls clothes are mixed in with boys.. Some clothing may say excellent condition, but clearly there's a few that have minor wear and tear.. But, other then that ThredUp is amazing.",4
6590,This app is wonderful,5
6591,"Super easy, GIANT selection--whatever you're looking for. I think it's brilliant!",5
6592,I'm having so much fun finding new stuff It's amazing 😃,5
6593,Best thing! I love using this service,5
6594,I like the app for the most part. My saved sizes didn't follow my searches. I can't find a way to contact anyone to track my packages even though the FAQ says I can under my orders.,2
6595,Awesome and love the savings,5
6596,Loved the app before the update. Now you can open individual articles or add them to the cart. That means no shopping.,2
6597,"Update: Thanks to Goldman Sachs for having my back. This was about 75% in my favor, so completely fair enough. I updated two stars because it is resolved by my bank. Placed my first order over $80 and this should be an embarrassment to the CEO as it never arrived. 3 items in two separate boxes so they said. A complete lack of solid purchase information in the app. Will never use this company again. Solid ""F""",3
6598,Can't log in using Amazon,1
6599,Nice looking at the diversity of clothing!,5
6600,"If I ever had any issues customer service has been ON IT. Love it. Love their products and I love the option to pick your own items or have a mystery box sent to you. Much more affordable than other curated box services like Stitch Fix, Nadine West, or Dia and Co. I also like that everything is thrifted so I know I'm not contributing to the harmful effects of fast fashion and giving previously loved items a second chance. Appreciate the sensible $10 styling fee so I'm not risking a lot on a box.",5
6601,"Cannot tell when item will ship, has shipped or anything about deliver.",1
6602,Good deals,3
6603,"I love this app! But finding the right sizes can be frustrating. There are a few things I really wish they would change. 1. I wish they would put the waist measurements on skirts. 2. I wish they could let you filter for clothes by measurements instead of sizes only. Lots of Jr sized items are waaay to small 3. I wish I could filter OUT specific brands, especially ones that I know will always be to small for me. Looking @ you Forever 21 >_>",3
6604,The clothes I received were in very good condition. I am very pleased with the diffrent option of brands and styles to pick from. It's a win win.,5
6605,sent a bag in MAY. it is AUGUST and it still hasn't been processed!!,1
6606,"I love all the clothes and SHOES , I have never enjoyed shopping as much as I do on here. 😁",5
6607,All the clothes and shoes I've ever bought has been very nice. The only down fall I've experienced is that sometimes the sizes are a little off.,4
6608,My favorite way to shop online!,5
6609,Takes a long time to sale items to them.,3
6610,Love this app! Works great!,5
6611,"This used to be one of my favorite apps before it updated. Now I can hardly ever get it to open. I've Uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it hasn't helped. Please fix this glitche!",3
6612,"I honestly love thred up. I've ordered from the site several times and each time my items arrived in great shape for great prices. The longest shipping I've ever had was only 2 weeks, so shipping times are pretty great too. I've never sold anything using the seller feature so I can't comment on that aspect, but as a buyer you really do find some great deals. A lot of items are new with tags, and I've never received a stained or bad condition item. If you're on the fence, I recommend thred up.",5
6613,"I LOVE the thredUP service. When I am on my computer I have no problems. The selection, categories and the fact rjt it automatically filters by my sizes is fantastic. This APP is the worst. It crashes constantly. When it does work, it is as slow as Christmas. If I set my phone down mid-browse it has reverted back to the homepage by the time I pick up my.phone again. Sometimes I can't get the thumbnail to take me to the details page. Super frustrating!",2
6614,A great option for buying clothes. I especially appreciate all measurements listed. It takes out most of the guess work and save me tons of time. It's hard for me to find time to go look for clothes that fit. The app makes it very convenient,5
6615,👍,4
6616,I love it and tell everyone,5
6617,This app requires update everyday you open it. At least every week I need to update the app before using it otherwise it won't allow you to access the app. Very annoying these tons of updates,1
6618,Love everything about ThredUp!!,5
6619,Filter does not work. Updated the app today and was trying to find a child's 2t item. The results show all children sizes.,3
6620,App is fairly easy to navigate and the prices are amazing.,4
6621,Cool app i love it twish tgere was a way to search for specifics features pn cothing,5
6622,"Love this store its the only store i buy from. They Got such great deals like 50%,75% or even 90% off of name brands like j brand, miss sixty, michael kors, coach ,mark Jacobs, ugg, forever 21,top shop, bebe it, guess, juice couture .... I have fell in such love with thredup I in only shop here and I always recommend thredup to others before anything else, shopping experience is so much fun. Ps thredup please never close your doors I'm your biggest fan and a loyal customer",5
6623,Fantastic!,5
6624,A W E S O M E !,5
6625,Perfect Shopping App Interface,5
6626,So far it's been okay even though I haven't received any orders,5
6627,"They tell you you have a few days use a promo code, so you get excited and slowly add things to your cart, only to find out that surprise! You're not eligible for the promo code anymore, despite still falling within the time window they mentioned. I'm guessing whoever implemented their A/B testing system must not have implemented it properly? Maybe there was an inconsistency between the website and the app? Anyway, while I understand that bugs happen in code, it still feels deceitful.",1
6628,Overpriced,1
6629,Love ❤ it,5
6630,"I would give a 4 star but,women girls an boys!!! If it would allow you to buy all types of clothing even mens would be a 4 our 5 star.fast easy check out. Easy to use.",2
6631,I like this app it's easy to use and you have so many options.,5
6632,Love it!,5
6633,Your get what's described in the picture information,5
6634,Great site,5
6635,"I've decided this store will be the love of the rest of my life! Just received my first order, OMG these shoes are better in person, just blown away. Literally my hubby is starting my new walk in closet with shoes shevles , now. Excuse the overly excited shopping high! You guys are the best, even better cause I can afford to shop a little more. I was suffering from empty nest since my last baby went off to college.....CURED..... Retail therapy I can afford...",5
6636,This app is definitely not for me I don't wear high-end clothes,1
6637,They have so much to choose from.,5
6638,"I wish they would describe if a grament was a knit or woven, the descriptions leave a lot to be desired. Links to brand size charts would be helpful, as there is a huge difference between a large from Forever 21 and, say, Macy's brands. Finally, it is almost impossible to limit selections to just petite sizes, makes shopping tedious. All that said, I've had a good experience overall with my buys. One was so tiny, I gave it to a friend for her teen daughter. (Brand size differs)",4
6639,Updates won't let me open the app,1
6640,Love this Shopping Aap!!,4
6641,Eady to use. No bugs.,5
6642,I love this app i shop for my mom and i ...love it,5
6643,Site is way over priced and the one item I bought was so stained,1
6644,Great love them at thred up,5
6645,Great app!,5
6646,So far I love the interface and it's been a really nice app.,5
6647,Too damn long for delivery. Almost 30 days. Package was less then 6 miles away and now 7 more days. Smh. Never again.,1
6648,"I wish I could select multiple categories of clothing to search through, but otherwise great.",4
6649,"Easy to navigate, easy to shop.",5
6650,I love being able to shop for terrific secondhand clothes even when I can't get to shops.,5
6651,Edit: What in the world is going on!? Still not able to login with the app through my Amazon account. I created a new account by logging in with my email on the app. I placed a large order 6 business days ago and haven't received a single update on tracking. I can't even get help through customer service because it keeps telling me to login in (I already am) and leads me to a dead path. FIX IT.,1
6652,Not hard to figure out,4
6653,Always good stuff,5
6654,Sizes are not always correct.,3
6655,I find great deals! I've been able to build an amazing business wardrobe with quality name brands on a very limited budget.,5
6656,The app is great. Easy to use! And kept me thrifty even thru covid!,5
6657,I Love Thred Up im usually pleased with the majority of the things i Buy Thanks Thred Up,5
6658,Too much to go into detail but payout are extremely low considering the profit and price they charge for some of these used items &customer service is not the best. An order can process in an hour other times it will take days. order made accidental immediately after they act as if they're already working on it from multiple warehouses and there's no possible way for it to be canceled. Also I'm sure I've gotten clothes mites from their items as the quality chk isnt always quality. be careful!!!,2
6659,Excellent!!!!!,5
6660,Love the app! I find treasure gems for a much cheaper price.,5
6661,I haven't been able to send anything in for most of this year. It is August 2021. Sellers get literally pennies on the dollar for many items. And we have to pay ThredUP if we want items returned to us. Over all a disappointing experience.,2
6662,Love this app for shopping and selling,5
6663,All I can say is fabulous.,5
6664,Best !!!,5
6665,Awesome!!,5
6666,"I enjoy shopping thredUP, but for resales, designer and premium items are a tad pricey to be pre-owned. Even if the item is in pristine condition, it's still pre-owned and using words like rare and vintage, especially with designer clothes, doesn't give them the same quality as being brand new. That said it's an ok app, but more reality based pricing is needed. Selling on the app sucks. Periodt. They're making more money off you than many will make off them. BBB is full of complaints why.",3
6667,Buyers should be reminded that clothing may have shrunk a bit by previous owner eashign and drying item. Wearing a medium at Jcrew brand new fits perfect...wearing a medium purchased here could ver well fit like a small depending on material and previous owner laundering the item. Remind clients of this. I returned soooo many items for this reason,3
6668,"The website is better. It's been a year since I've tried to use their app and there's been no changes. A lot of search features are missing, combined with Thred Up's poor keyword search that already exists and it's a tedious, time consuming, frustrating and useless experience. Easily the worst app I've used and drains all the fun out of shopping. Example: go back to your list after viewing an item and your search has to start over. No way to search for a button down shirt. Loaded with peeves.",2
6669,Why no men's clothes,1
6670,"Love the shopping, the app needs better searching. For example, you can't type in keywords like ""high waisted skirt"" or ""button up shirt"" you have to go to the clothing style category, (ie women >shirts) then you can select a brand, or a cut style, or color, etc. from the filters... Makes for a lot of scrolling through results to find what you're looking for. The 'view similar items' feature is nice but doesn't always give great results. Otherwise, I love it, and do most of my shopping here.",4
6671,Great it is so wonderful and anazing.everything is so kool,5
6672,"I only go on the app to check on my balance. To many issues with items purchased arriving not as described. Plus, the discount codes are often not applied correctly. However, with enough persistence and time spent resolution is usually met.",3
6673,Shipping is a bit expensive and prices are a bit much on some items but some others are reasonably priced,4
6674,"It could be more interactive. For instance: show more things like this, style with things like this, ECT",3
6675,"My experience with Thread Up has been terrible! Your measurements of the jeans I purchased were totally off. Each pair was supposed to have a 10"" rise. I guess your staff do not know what a rise is. Each pair is 8.5 to 9"". Although the inseam is correct, the rise is way off. You totally misrepresented what you sold to me. I definitely will not recommend your site, and definitely will be sure to tell all my Facebook friends what a complete rip off Thread Up is. I want a full refund.",1
6676,Wonderful,5
6677,I have had so much fun shopping Tredup! They describe their products accurately and I have just loved what I have gotten!,5
6678,Returning is costly but other than that I love it,4
6679,This website is terrible. Browsing is terrible won't let you look for items you clicked on. 😒,1
6680,"It's extremely hard to look for the simplest thing, it takes ages to find what you want.. But other than that it's a decent app",3
6681,Was told to update and can't,4
6682,Great!,5
6683,The clothes that I have bought always fit and the prices are a real bargain.,5
6684,"I like this app and use it quite a bit! But the filtering function is a mess. If you want to apply multiple filters, the app doesn't handle the query well. It irritates me every time I try!",3
6685,I found a cute Denim dress to buy.,5
6686,Exciting!,5
6687,I ordered a dress that was identified as tags still on. I paid like $26 for the dress and it was delivered today. When I opened the package and looked at the tag it was a tag from a thrift store that had the size 16 and underneath that was a price of $4. I am so disgusted with this company and will never ever shop with them again. My review on Google will reflect my displeasure.,1
6688,My order was shipped out July15th and I still have not received it nor do I have a delivery date scheduled. Also there is no way to contact anyone about it. Ive no clue if I will even get it at this point.,1
6689,nice app to have,5
6690,Have only chosen one piece that upon arrival was not as described.,5
6691,I'm obsessed with ThreadUP,4
6692,"I really did like it, but now it won't even open.",2
6693,"Easy to use and I have been able to find some items. However, processing times have gotten much worse.",4
6694,I like the app. The pictures are very clear and sharp. I would like to see a style button in the shoe section. It is not very convenient to browse thousands of pairs.,4
6695,Doesn't allow much granular specs for shopping,3
6696,Love shopping here; it's just glitchy as hell.,4
6697,"It's a great app for buying and selling clothes. I've found lots of great pieces and have sold with ease through them as well. But it has SO many bugs that make the shopping experience less enjoyable. For example: I just got an alert that the app needs to update so I go to the app store... no update anywhere to be found and now the app won't work. Another, literally every single time I log in on my desktop, I have to change my password. It always says it's wrong no matter what. SO ANNOYING!",4
6698,Love shopping here !!!!,5
6699,"Very disappointed with the items I received, returned them and have a credit on my account no where near what I spent because of the restocking fees. The condition of the items were not described accurately. I wish I had never purchased anything from this site. But again I have a credit and still have to spend money to get free shipping to make the experience worth the while. I am very regretful for putting myself in this predicament.",1
6700,Unfortunately if you don't receive your product you can't reach anyone direct. It will take days for them to get back with you through email. For reliability I give them a 2-star. I ordered an item it says it deleted through UPS and then the order disappears to (I think) USPS. Very confusing not sure where my package is at this point. I ordered on the 27th it is now the 5th and again not sure where my package is. Very poor customer service. Not sure I will buy from them again.,3
6701,Fun app,5
6702,Great app!,5
6703,I keep getting a message that the app needs to be updated but when I visit the app store - there is no update available. I tried to uninstall and reinstall - still no luck,1
6704,"Good experience, just a little slow due to the pandemic.",5
6705,"Best place to find ""another one"" of your old favorite items! Wonderful for browsing brands, or shopping for something specific. Easy to use.",5
6706,I love that I can still thrift from the comfort of my own bed!,5
6707,"Update: App doesn't work, says to update to the latest version but there is no update in the app store. I even uninstalled and reinstalled. Sometimes when I'm searching, if I tap on an item and then try and go back to the previous page, I have to scroll through everything again. Other than that the app is great!",1
6708,"The search tool isn't very good (ex 'mini skirts' took me to blouses and long skirts), but the size guide is spot on. I've bought 11 items the first time (7 bottoms, 4 tops) and every single one of them fit perfectly. Actually, truly, perfectly. Super recommend the app.",5
6709,Can't open it,1
6710,"The user interface is nice, when it works. But nearly every time I try to use this app, it just spins and spins, never loading / displaying anything.",5
6711,"I love the selection of clothing, I didn't give it a five because sometimes I'm confused on the sizing. Also sometimes there isn't fabric or material description. The prices are good and plenty of discounts .",4
6712,Very good prices on quality clothing.,5
6713,"You can shop and sell, and cash out on the app. They are very quick about getting back to you. Fashion for women and children. I have not shopped, but I do consign with them. Learning about that.",5
6714,Great clothes for Work!!!!!!!.,5
6715,"I love that you can filter by size, cut, and occasions. I wish there was a uniform sizing method since all the brands are different in that regard. The app does crash on me fairly frequently though.",5
6716,Difficult to find some non clothing items. Needs some twicking!,5
6717,"Advice: expect to keep whatever you buy & pay close attention to detail. Whatever we didn't end up liking, we send back in a free cleanout kit for credit on something else to avoid fees. Having already bought 3 girls all new name brand clothing for the year plus for myself, I've learned to utilize discounts, sales, always zoom in on pics, & expect shipping times to vary. Love the bundle feature. The heart list needs work, though. Want to have different wishlists!!! Overall: Im addicted.",4
6718,It's updated. Now it won't let me on. If I log in something pops up stating it's outdated. I've deleted the app. I reinstalled I restarted my phone. Sorta sucks.,1
6719,"Update: measurements are back. Adjustments to several things nickel and dime you a bit. Prices are now a bit high, but instead they have sales virtually every weekend so you just end up waiting it out.",5
6720,"There is some issue with the app. When I try to open it, it says it needs to be updated. After updating it, it still throws out that error. Not sure why its doing that",3
6721,Send in hundreds of dollars in brand new clothes and receive pennies on the dollar. Find a local consignment shop.,2
6722,Haven't bought anything yet but will. The app is easy and I like how you can click on the designer,4
6723,I have been shopping with them for the past 4 years and have never been disappointed. 💗,5
6724,App is easy to use,5
6725,I find alot of nice clothes and shoes,5
6726,😱,1
6727,They updated the app and wouldn't let me use the app until I updated.... I updated and now I cant use the app because the app doesn't think it's been updated... I just wanna see where my order is and I'm about to throw my phone,3
6728,"LOVE this app!! Works perfectly for me and allows me to keep a clean track of purchases, sales and account credits. I appreciate the push notifications for those items I'm looking for and overall it's been an awesome experience. Returns are easy and accruing points for things like free shipping or to waive restocking fees is simply AWESOME! I'm a customer for life!!",5
6729,Good clothes for cheaper prices,5
6730,I am unable to open app. It is saying I need to update it so I did and yet it is still telling me to update,3
6731,"Just disappointed with my latest shopping experience. Ordered 3 skirts and a pair of gym shorts and selected to have them ship in as few packages as possible. My issue with the app is that my order status has been processing for a couple weeks now. It is very hard to contact customer service and when I did to get an update, I was told it would ship sometime the next week. Its just very vague and I would love better updates about order status and easier access to customer service.",3
6732,Update is not working.,3
6733,I love this app. And it's still evolving to better serve it's customer's. I love this and I would recommend it to anyone,5
6734,"I love ThredUp; it's now my go-to option for ""new"" clothes, but the app could be better. It's hard to access return labels and selling items through the app, often opening a separate browser for these features and forcing you to log in again. I don't use this app to sell many items due to the miniscule percentage sellers get of the profits, but I do like using it to buy items.",4
6735,Takes foreverrrr to get your package its been 2 weeks now and I still haven't got my order but I absolutely love the clothes and the prices are reasonable. I recommend to anyone who doesn't mind waiting.,5
6736,Excellent no issues thank you,5
6737,Love it,5
6738,Always great service. No hassle if something needs to be returned,5
6739,Love using ThredUP... The app could use work though... constantly end up unable to return to where I was in looking at items. Outlet and regular items mixed in normal searches and filters for searches work... almost. Need item specific size settings.,4
6740,"Your app sucks, I don't need to have a reason nor a explanation it's self explanatory. I don't have good memory so why should we search the shops they're in? When I first got this app I thought you were able to type in the piece of clothing itself and show different options but nooo! It's not like that. Maybe if you'd fixed that I'd give a better rating, either way you're app, it's horrible!",1
6741,I love this company!,5
6742,Unable to contact customer service via app features. App often stops working.,3
6743,You used to be able to chat with costumer support. However now there's no way of doing that. It's all an endless loop that doesn't get you to anyone. Really sucks.🤬,1
6744,"Not enough info about the items and the page is on infinite ""loading"". It's near impossible to chat with someone or any customer service and there is no phone number to be found. Delivery time for my order is now at least 14 days, and no expedite is available. I used the faster option of shipping separately from the different locations, yet the estimate 1 to 2 days to process my order stretched to 9 days before it shipped, in one box.",1
6745,Tomorrow will make it 2 weeks of waiting to receive my order. Plus no date of delivery indicated.,1
6746,Thank you to Kathryn at Do it on a Dime YouTube channel for sharing how great ThredUp is! Thank you!,5
6747,About half of the items I usually order fit or look good. The rest are always unwearable . They only provide two pictures of each garnet and only measure length and chest for all tops and dresses. It's impossible to tell what kind of fabric you're going to end up with. I wish they gave more detail on the items. If you're ok with liking about half of what you buy or you're just not picky at all and will wear whatever you'll probably love this app.,3
6748,"Love the app itself, its filter options make shopping easier than ever! You can filter by style, sizes, brand, color, price, condition, material and more! Each item is explained well with exact measurements. Everything was so easy and fun, until it came to shipping. I made sure to only select items from my local warehouse, about 1hr 20 mins south, yet it took 8 days of shipping time somehow. Honestly worth the wait though! Clothes were in great condition, for a fair price and so comfortable!!",5
6749,"Every time I click on an article of clothing the screen shows that it is loading indefinitely. In the end, I can't see it, add it to my cart, or add it to my favorites.",1
6750,Love the app. Much easier to thrift shop and they have a huge amount of items in the brands I love. Plus new items daily sometimes hourly. Highly recommend if you love thrifting!,5
6751,"No mens, just boys, girls, women?",1
6752,Louv it,5
6753,No mens clothes.,1
6754,I liked receiving the different clothes in the mail. My first box had awesome items in it. I can't wait to get my next box,5
6755,"I had a good experience initially. Had a couple orders take awhile but never had to get ahold of customer service. Now that I have tried to get ahold of customer service well long story short, you can't! Email? They send you an automated message to use their chat feature on their website or app. Chat? It's just a search feature for faq. Call? It's only for a screen reader for their website there's no actual call line. I went through all this because they took my money and it hasn't even shipped!",2
6756,So far so good! Thank you for your service!,5
6757,They have way more than you would ever expect. Love this place.,5
6758,"Oof.. I really liked this app first buy around. Clothes fit well. However, if you are any application that changes price to higher after putting in cart and offering promo code, then in my eyes that is nearly 1 star business practices. I will not be coming back here. As a consumer it's important to me that I know what I am paying for and it was clear until that changed on my favorite item as another strategy to get me to agree to pay more anyway.",1
6759,I use the website all the time and the app is set up well. I always use the orders page on the app rather than the website because it shows the prices of items purchased more conveniently.,5
6760,"I purchased 60 dollars worth of stuff from them, and flash forward 2 weeks later I don't even have a tracking number!! And nothing has shipped and I'm told it will be 2 more weeks. I'm never buying another thing from them again AFTER/IF I receive my current order right now.",1
6761,"You find good items, but if you need to return them expect to lose money. If you don't want to lose to much money, I recommend doing store credit and depending on the items they still charge you per items for returns. If you want your money back, I recommend to go with their return label (which they charge) to save you the cost of paying your own shipping label (which is more expensive).",3
6762,"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, BEST THING EVER TO HELP ME WITH MY OVERWHELMING ANXIETY, I can just open the app and the calming colors and nice clothes distract me from the upsetting situation and I can relax... Just have to watch my wallet, lol and 35 items all under $4 can still have an impact on the bottom line. And I am running low on drawer space, and I don't want to have to buy a new dresser, lol. Then the wallet will take a big hit 🎯!!! I do tell everyone who will listen, to check out the app",5
6763,"Easy to navigate. Glitches or freezes sometimes but not excessively. If you use ThredUp often, I recommend this app.",4
6764,"Like the idea, but hate that I have to pay a restocking fee per item plus shipping if something that I ordered doesn't fit...",3
6765,"Great clothes, great prices",5
6766,Ordered like 40 new clothes with $200 pretty nice,5
6767,Nice clothes that fits me,5
6768,I love all my stuff I get some mit not fit but that is my own thinking thank you thredup,5
6769,"If you start selling mens clothes, I'll reinstall the app.",1
6770,"Despite entering exactly what I wanted (dress) I was shown jumpsuits, rompers and tops. Wanted to shop, but not wading through hundreds of unwanted items.",1
6771,Love it here!,4
6772,"Ummm no. The app can be improved and should definitely have better search options, just like in the website. I get it, you're understaffed with the pandemic and packing for shipping will take longer, but if that's really what is happening, EXPEDITE SHIPPING!! I am already paying for shipping and having to wait three weeks for items to arrive is ridiculous.",2
6773,Fun! Great selection! Best thriftshop online!,5
6774,"Horrible experience Wish I would have paid more attention to all the 1 star reviews. The only reason they get one star is bc I don't have the option to give ZERO. What I paid for and was supposed to get was a Whet Blu jacket new with tags. What I got ? A worn jacket ( mind you in ""like new"" condition) with, you guessed, NO TAGS. ( wonder why). Looking to return it- i found I have to pay $8.99 for them to sent me a return label. AND a restocking fee ?! STAY AWAY",1
6775,"I've been very pleased with Thredup after using it for a couple of years! It would be helpful to have more pictures of the products, especially more angles of the shoes, so you have a better idea of any flaws on the products that you're purchasing. The site is easy to navigate, but it would be helpful to have a reminder in the checkout to use my rewards and also that they can't be combined with other offers. It would be helpful if ""outlet"" items were marked so I can tell in my favorite list",4
6776,Love this app and the idea it supports!,5
6777,Love this app. And this store,5
6778,I love browsing and shopping at ThredUp. I've been pleased with every item I've purchased as every item looks brand new and you really can't beat the price whether it's name brand or not. My questions have always been answered promptly with pleasant personality and attitude. I enjoy the savings as I honestly feel I received a great product for the price and especially look forward to the promos. Also the app lets me track the status of my orders. I shop ThredUp more than Department stores.,5
6779,Your shipping is very slow. And 5 days after purchase I can not even check shipping status,1
6780,"I agree that you don't earn very much as a seller through thredup. However, I LOVE shopping with thredup. It's inexpensive, there's always a coupon, it's more environmentally friendly than buying new clothes, and most items can be returned if you don't like the way they fit. I just contacted their customer service to help me with my order(I put the wrong address) and they were very prompt and supremely helpful.",5
6781,Great app for thrifting !!,5
6782,Love it!,5
6783,Very good I love thread up,5
6784,Great stuff,5
6785,I have always had a pleasant experience on this app. It is easy-to-use,5
6786,Great new-like clothes at a great price with great shipping. Everything you need when shopping online. Love it and will continue to use this app for all my clothing needs,5
6787,Sold Me A KNOCKOFF! Paid for authentic brand. Got cheap imitation. Very upset.,1
6788,"Much better than the browser version. Great for cheap clothes, all though some things can be a little overpriced (in my opinion,) but that is a rare occurrence. It can also be hard to see piece if they are darker colored or black. I ordered a skirt I thought was black and it came as dark green.",5
6789,Everything had arrived in great condition. Sales and prices are often and fair. Been using this app for years and I will not be stopping soon.,5
6790,"Great app. User friendly, interfaces with Google Pay for seamless payments.",5
6791,Awesome company and app,5
6792,"Pretty high prices for used clothing store! And not enough detail when viewing a certain items like skirts, you can't tell if they're just elastic full-on or if there's a zipper in a button excetera and they don't mention in the description either. I wouldn't waste my time.",1
6793,"Crashes all the time, its annoying! 🙄",1
6794,Can't look at any item details. It tries to load but never does,2
6795,"This app is horrible if you are trying to sell your clothes. They take 90% or more commission on every item you sell. If your item does not sell and you do not click ""Reclaim your item"" fast enough then it's gone and you make no money nor can you get it returned to you. This app/website is a total scam. Do not sell your clothes on this app if you want to make any money at all. I understand it's a ""thrift"" store but this site is straight up robbery.",1
6796,Great way to shop!,5
6797,Excellent!!,5
6798,"I like the clothes and accessories offered to buy at such reasonable prices. However, the reason I'm only giving two stars is because I ordered quite a few items over a 3-4 day period so it was all going to be shipped in a bundle. That's fine. What's bad is some of my stuff showes that it's being shipped while other items still say status pending. Their customer service is non existing so good luck trying to get assistance in trying to find out anything about your order's.",2
6799,App crashes every second time opening it up!!,1
6800,Love it!,5
6801,I enjoy shopping... everything I've bought has been as described... I usually shop for shoes and handbags which they have great prices and the condition even gently used is still nice... I recommend to friends and family give it a try ..see something you like and if it's over a certain amount... you can use affirm you can get it on easy pays it's no credit check ....happy shopping ladies !!!😊,5
6802,I love it,5
6803,"Purchased on a few occasions. Some of the clothing arrived in worse condition than described. Gave it another try and was surprised by extremely slow shipping (it was just a few days previously). I was told my order ""should"" arrive by a date two weeks out with little concern shown or effort made regarding a tracking number which has not updated for days. I gave it a good try but I will have to shop elsewhere for my event and will not purchase from here again.",1
6804,I love threadUP!,5
6805,Great except there are times it doesn't let you type in the search box weirdly.,4
6806,"I used to love getting stuff from here but lately I have gotten the wrong size it takes twice as long and I swear the prices just keep going up, like the kids clothes it cost more for a pair of shorts then it dose for a pair of jeans for an adult.. I used to tell everyone to order from here but not so much anymore 😌😔😞",2
6807,Love this app!,5
6808,I have been shopping with Thred up for over a year now. I have complete new wardrobe of quality cloths for all seasons. ☺,5
6809,"I can't get this app to work most of the time. Tried uninstalling and installing, that only works some of the time.",1
6810,Great app.,4
6811,"I have been buying on thredUP from the day I first shopped. The returns and item's bought were easy to track. Recently thredUP changed format. Totally unable to navigate. Time I spend shopping now spent being frustrated with format. Too bad I really enjoyed the product, but not so much now.",1
6812,"I'm enjoying the easy use app! The only thing that frustrates me is when I order some clothing, I asked for large and I get a youth large. Shoes when I order 8 1/2 they are missed sized.",4
6813,Nice to just choose your sizes and brands. And it shows you just that.,5
6814,Great shopping experience. Absolutely amazing customer service!,5
6815,I have loved everything I've purchased so far. Shipping isn't too bad and items are exactly as described.,5
6816,The only negative thing I have to say about this app is to use a different color backround on the app. Especially if you are looking for anything white on there. You can't even see anything white on the app,4
6817,"Easy to use, great buys",5
6818,"I've been a customer of ThredUP for about 2 yrs. I love the choices & the 10 points for every dollar I spend. I wish you would bring back the 24-hour timers. But, overall a good experience.",5
6819,Wonderful,5
6820,Fun.,3
6821,"Hi end, low $$$ you keep me looking great!!!!",5
6822,So nice to be able to clean out my closet and buy different clothing with credit!,5
6823,I love the thredup app! I wish I could categorize what I've saved tho. A list for me and a separate like list for my kids would be great!,3
6824,I love it..only thing.....men's clothing too???,4
6825,"I am really satisfied with ThredUp, I found so many items that I was looking for a long time. They are some unique and have a reasonable prices. I am continuing use it.",4
6826,Descriptions of garments not always optimal and photography/styling of garments sometimes awful. Buttoned up askew etc. Would like measurements of scarves and waist measurement of skirts.,4
6827,I've placed 2 orders through thredUP and it's a wonderful company. The app is incredibly easy to use. I cant say enough good things about the company or the app.,5
6828,"Spins and spins. Can't open the detail ciews on the items. Have definitely not made purchase bc I can't read the details, see the back view, or zoom. Busted and needs fixed — I would classify as a blocker bc it is preventing business operations.",2
6829,Clothes were as described. Clean. Couldn't even tell they were used. Many new items also. Love it!,5
6830,I have added many quality pieces to my wardrobe for a very low price. I'm quite pleased.,5
6831,"This App is awesome, I can't wait to explore more offers",5
6832,"Love the site, hate the app. I can never get the my saved searches to load once I select an item. That means I can never add it to my cart. I stopped buying as much from the shop because it's just too hard to navigate the app without getting some kind of hold up.",2
6833,Fun app to shop. Lots of choices at reasonable prices.,5
6834,Great app all of the clothes are very nice,5
6835,Love thred up,5
6836,I do wish they would take better pictures and more details about items,4
6837,Sometimes app won't refreah/reload it just continously tries to load,4
6838,Insanely addicting,5
6839,Love,5
6840,Easy to use. Fun to peruse. When looking for tops; I check specifically for my bust size. Returning any items has been simple to do.,4
6841,I returned something that didn't fit. I only got a partial refund as they charge a restocking fee. (So you're punished for cooking not fitting) In order to get a refund that was anything close to what I paid it had to be store credit. I went to but something today only to find my credit had just disappeared. Now I have have neither the clothing I purchased nor the credit I was refunded. Obviously I will not be purchasing from Thread Up again.,1
6842,They don't carry men's clothes at all.,1
6843,Love shopping on thredUP!,5
6844,"There are good deals on clothes but the delivery time is slow. I got part of an order within a week and other part still hasn't shipped(11 days later). Also, the customer service is terrible. Update: finally received the rest of my order minus one shirt. Still have to wait 3 more days for that. Would contact customer service, but the representative didn't want to help last time, so why bother.",1
6845,"I will no longer be sending or buying anything with ThredUp. I sent in a bag over 3 months ago which I now believe they have just stolen. It shows it was received 4/14 and the processing date was slowly pushed back a couple of weeks at a time and now it shows nothing. I have contacted customer service multiple times who refuses to help and just gives generic answers to my questions. They state processing time is ""UP to 10 weeks"" meaning 10 weeks or less but it is now WELL past that time.",1
6846,I like how cheap the clothes are,5
6847,Love it. Easy to access! Kids clothing are great too. The quality is great!,5
6848,Great app,5
6849,"I find the app easy to navigate. Thred Up is a great place to find whatever I'm looking for. Kids clothes, a cocktail dress or a sweatshirt, they have it all.",5
6850,"The app is convenient and actually retains your personal sizing, even if you don't use it for a while. I love ThredUp, their mission, and the fact that they make it so easy for us to join in and resell our own pre-loved clothes too ✨💚✨",5
6851,Several amazing gets over the years 😝,5
6852,Day 1 of browsing thredUP I found the exact pair of Allbirds I wanted for $30 instead of $115. This is awesome!,5
6853,"Absolutely love their selection!! Need more detailed searches still cuz I filter now & STILL end up w/ tens of thousands of results LOL. Need to do WAY better w/ goody boxes. I was super excited at first but 2 times I did it, I DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING they sent. 1st time box was broken into & all but 2 items stolen. Thank God they didn't make me pay for those.. but when I tried to send the 2 back, they nvr got em.. which now I owe for those. I will NOT at for something I don't have. Sorry.",4
6854,Amazing deals on brand name items!,5
6855,You don't provide clothes for men? I want to save money on the clothes. I found you through an interview you did with Gary V. Will you provide clothes for men?,1
6856,The app is very touchy.,3
6857,great app,5
6858,"They have great sales, it's very organized and set up into categories, thousands of pieces. You have the option of with a tag, Like new, gently used, or you can see that has been worn out. Though, I am 5'4, 169lbs, size 12or13, I have a muffin top. Only looking for high rise jeans, high rise or medium high rise shorts and length on the legs at least mid-thigh. ThredUP only has low rise, medium rise with booty shorts. Not for me. I want to delete the account. They are making it very difficult.",2
6859,Love this app. Easy to sell and buy from.,5
6860,Fun shopping and saving money,5
6861,Awesome,5
6862,"I'm done. I had previously rated when I first tried and was unable to find it to delete it. The clothes rarely fit. The sizes are incorrect. The second to the last order I made I had to cancel because it took 3 weeks to say they were getting around to shipping and still nothing. The last order, which will be the last, nothing fits. The sizing is so off I will be giving yet more clothes purchased from ThredUp away. Do not even give them a try, you will be sorry.",1
6863,Easy to use GREAT ITEMS,5
6864,Been a customer for years and really love this app 😊,5
6865,This was my first experience and it was a positive one😁,5
6866,Quick delivery..,5
6867,So easy even an old lady can use it,5
6868,"I love THREDUP! First, I ordered 5 summer Dresses, all were in extremely good condition, a couple still had tags! Next I ordered 5 Jumpsuits and then 2 Pair of Wedge Heels. About 40% of my clothes are noted Name Brands! Now I have a brand new wardrobe for summer and it all cost me under $200!",5
6869,My friend actually turned me to this (website first) and am still wearing clothes from it today. Once I get more and play around with the app more I can adjust my rating,3
6870,The app is reliable. It takes awhile to ship. Waiting for 2 weeks for shipment that is coming from my own state.,2
6871,I love this app. I love y this company. I love what they're doing with everything how they make everything all right. They have a great set of staff. It else it wouldn't all just come together. I know this thru experience. So with all being said over and over I just want to say thank you thredUP. You and your team are doing a wonderful wonderful job.,5
6872,Love thos app and store,5
6873,I have returned items have not had a refund I would like to order more not until I have a refund was very hard to make a return,2
6874,"Got two boxes just fine, there were maggots in the third. Deleting this app.",1
6875,They want too much for their cloths.,2
6876,Favorite thrifty app!!!,5
6877,This app does not always work well. I knocks you out to go back in.,3
6878,numbers are not correct on my bill,2
6879,I love everything I've ordered through Thredup. The only suggestion I would make is to start selling men's clothes as well. It's almost perfect for the whole family.,4
6880,"The app is super convenient, but shipping takes FOREVER to get to Alaska. You might say that's due to living in Alaska, but other places deliver items within 3 to 5 days. Thredup takes a lot longer, so I don't recommend buying things you need right away.",4
6881,"I'm converted. I shop exclusively at ThredUp. I haven't bought ""new"" clothes in over a year. The app has a bug, (if I tap on a notification it takes me to the homepage rather than the item) but all in all it's easy to find what I'm looking for.",5
6882,"Love it! Love the filters and sort. Nothing has ever disappointed me. And I love how they're packaged, like little gifts! Swanky!",5
6883,Glitches out when adjusting filters but otherwise a good app,4
6884,Addicted. 💖,5
6885,Completely addicted but looking fabulously fashionable!,5
6886,Great,5
6887,So far I'm loving it. I've been looking for a specific Cabi Online top forever. It sold out quickly several seasons ago. I was very ry excited to find it one here and thrilled I got the only one posted. I originally loaded this app to sell items and ended up shopping. Free shipping over $49 and I'm all in.,5
6888,"I went to purchase a pair of jeans, and it gave me the ""exe.thredUp has stopped working"" with the force stop. And get this, it stops working AFTER I put in and tried to not save my card info. Stop trying to scam people, and if they steal my identity or anything, they're asking for trouble... of the legal type LOL. But don't trust this app, I didn't listen to the bad reviews and wanted to try it for myself, but I should have listened.",1
6889,Im open it now..,1
6890,I being shopping beautiful clothes in very good prices,5
6891,"I've used this app for years, always loved it",5
6892,"This app fights you every step of the way when searching for anything. You can select a category you want to look in, then click the search bar to type and it has changed your category back to the default. Searching for ""earrings"" under jewelry comes up with no results. Searching for different brands in jewelry comes up with no results. There is nothing intuitive or helpful in the design. It just wants to fight you on every search. Don't waste your time.",1
6893,Good,5
6894,So easy to switch filters great variety of brands and styles and the condition is excellent. I will be back again and again. Oh and YOUR PRICES ARE RIDICULOUSLY LOW compared to the consignment stores in the area and the other online resale sites I've checked out,5
6895,"Good but could improve! My only complait is that recently I can't track my orders and they say processing up until it arrives, so if that could be improved I'd change my review to 5 stars!",4
6896,I like the idea of this app make sure you do the style test with your measurements,4
6897,I love this site I get most of my clothes and shoes from here,5
6898,"I don't trust this application, apart from the application not working, I returned an item, they returned the money in store credit. but in a few days the money disappeared.",1
6899,"So far this experience has been fun to document. I have sent them seven bags. They've recently only gotten through two of the bags I sent back in march. And out of 100+ baby items they've decided only 14 are sellable. And not even the NWT items that were sent either, which is confusing. So I wouldn't recommend sending anything to them",1
6900,Love,5
6901,Great way to track the clothes you like and buy when discounted,5
6902,I've only purchased handbags from them. Need to post more pictures of items like wallets. I would like to see the inside before I buy it to make sure it's going to hold all of my things. A really good selection of brands.,4
6903,Love the app wish it had mens clothes though,5
6904,No option for men.,1
6905,I love the deals and I can't wait to shop more,5
6906,Easy and fun,5
6907,I love Thred up. Orders are always timely and exactly as described. Returns are no hassle and very easy. Prices are great!,5
6908,The app keeps crashing and has a constant loading symbol when I click on an item. Also paying with PayPal doesn't show up,2
6909,Enjoyable app,5
6910,I love casually browsing on the thredup app & the layout/organization of the app is perfect. This app is really easy to navigate & I've never had issues of it crashing/glitching/etc,5
6911,Useless not user friendly,1
6912,Love to shop here,5
6913,Awful. Says takes a few days to put orders together it's been over a month and half since I ordered still nothing. Scam?? I'm starting to think.,1
6914,"Hit and miss. The app is glitchy, needs force stopping or uninstall/install about once a month. Compared to Poshmark, thredUP has a much smaller inventory. Shipping can take weeks. The app itself isn't very intuitive. Recommended items are not related to my likes, and some common brands do not auto-populate when searching, and are sometimes not recognized at all. Or, maybe, they just don't have anything in my size. All in all, worth browsing. My favorite feature was the closet clean out.",3
6915,Great way to shop,5
6916,"This app is amazing ,I've never ever found outfits like you have provided that fit so we'll Thank you for the experience. I hope you will continue to send more goody boxes !!! Love you guys / gals",5
6917,"Edited: I have repeatedly received damaged products from the AZ location that were marked as ""new with tags"" or ""like new"" and certainly were not. I highly recommend avoiding anything coming from AZ. I'm an executive director and have health issues that cause my weight to fluctuate dramatically. thredUP is an amazing resource for high quality, inexpensive business (and casual) clothing - helping me to create professional looks in all sizes.",3
6918,The pictures and descriptions definitely doesnt represent what showed up in the box,1
6919,Careful thredUP is pleasantly addictive,5
6920,All the clothes that I have ordered exceeded expectations! 😍,5
6921,Very enjoyable,5
6922,"I love this app!! Very easy to navigate thru, the pics of the items are very clear, and you get what you pay for!",5
6923,Its Awesome!,5
6924,I love thredUP. They are what they claim. Always satisfied with my orders. I won't shop with any other store. Thanks thredUP!,5
6925,It can't even find wat I search for 🤦,1
6926,Love! Pure Happiness with my purchase!,5
6927,Really great app for shopping!,5
6928,Clothes are exactly as they are shown. Very happy with every item.,5
6929,I love this its cheap easy and has so many options,5
6930,Love being able to buy name brand clothing for a fraction if the price. I am a mother of 4 teens so I am always on the back burner.,5
6931,Not user freindly,1
6932,Great deals. Amazing clothes. Wonderful experience. Highly recommend.,5
6933,Slow loading,3
6934,"I love this app. Ive purchase shoes, bags, dresses and sweaters and it has always been accurately described. The prices arent bad either.",5
6935,I love it!! My honey hole of spending money and getting quality clothes❤,5
6936,"Update as of 7/14/21: Love the service and shop from them pretty often. The app will periodically have glitches of varying levels of annoyance, but I just stick to the web version until they fix it, which is generally only a few days.",4
6937,It's great. I recommend it to everyone and anyone that loves to shop at great prices.,5
6938,Why no men's clothes? Unfair business model. It would be so easy to add a men's category,1
6939,"My experience using the app has been more or less positive, though I do have to force it to stop pretty often when it stops responding. I like the ability to save searches and pieces, returns are easy, and they run sales regularly. If only they didn't use FedEx - my packages are always late! They seem to just sit in the dropoff location and often can't be tracked for days. It's very frustrating and is at odds with the experience the app provides.",3
6940,Doesn't have options for men... but hey they subtly tell you it's not for men so it makes it ok🙄👌,1
6941,Everything I was looking for 😃.,5
6942,"There is no number to call if things go wrong, they will cancel an order with no explanation and it is very difficult to straighten out any issue. Love the deals on the clothes, but not worth the aggrivation. There are other thrift sites.",1
6943,Looking forward to seeing,5
6944,How do you know if one of your items have sold or not been sold.,3
6945,Great items and very organized site. Just wish shipping was faster but it's much better than it was yrs ago. Using Affirm is an excellent way to pay because your items r not saved for long. With Affirm you can buy what you want and no payment until next month is great. I have payed off balance the next month or simply payed for three months.,4
6946,App is extremely glitchy. Crashes constantly.,1
6947,Didn't receive my full order they offer no real customer support I wouldn't order from this app again 😤,1
6948,I love this app but one thing I don't enjoy is the pop up messages for recently added items. Kmj,4
6949,Absolutely love ThredUp,5
6950,"It's been a horrible shopping experience with Thredup. Their app and website are horrible for customer service. Once you finally find the convoluted way to get to support, they seem kind but can't help you and at one point I was waiting for over 30 min for the person to respond to me. Apparently they had technical difficulty. They can't give me the status of my order and it's been a week when they say 1-2 business days for processing. They don't know when it will ship. Horrible business model.",1
6951,Not a lot of ads and the interface is easily navigated. I also like that they will notify you if you want something that is in someone else's cart but they are not incredibly annoying with notifications in general.,5
6952,Very very pleased with Three Up,5
6953,Easy place to order clothing! Very nice selection of clothing (Lots of name brands).,5
6954,The app keeps getting to the Green thread up page but then it just stays on that page and doesn't take me to the site where I can shop.,1
6955,"I really enjoy using this app. I've experienced minor glitches, but for the most part the app works great. The only real issue I have is receiving items not as described. I've received used items that were described as new and items with incorrect measurements or style descriptions. Other than that, Thredup is a fun way to save our wallet and our planet.",5
6956,"This app was working great for the longest time but as of the past week, the images won't open and I can't look at any items in detail. Update 7/11/21: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now it's working perfectly",4
6957,Love it but... I wish there was a way to share your favorites list with people.,4
6958,Website could move quicker. Last order chose to put 3 items in my order which si.ply listed as fav. Bill was VERY high.love the shopping. I'm learning more.,4
6959,"Love this app. Very pleased with my purchases, no problems at all.",5
6960,ADDICTED!,5
6961,Great options and easy to return if things do not fit. I love the added environmentally friendly bonus of bundling and wearing second hand clothing.,5
6962,Recommend only for masochists with money to throw away,1
6963,It takes a bit to figure out categories but works nicely. And what a great idea!,4
6964,First time ordering from ThredUp. The clothes were in perfect condition and at a good price. Love how the app automatically continues to show me selections on my size range.,5
6965,I love this app gives great info on products only thing I had problem with is when I tried sending info for credit pay they couldn't receive my info. Tried several times.,5
6966,Love thredup!!,5
6967,Ordered pants but when it arrived the waistband elastic was worn out/stretched. I paid $15 from my store account and an additional $5 for this? Plus it was pretty well worn out. I made a complaint but haven't heard back. I went to Goodwill to find something similar and found a great quality pair for $2!,1
6968,Excellent experience... customer service.... packaging... quality clothing and accessories,5
6969,Nice 3/4 inch mauve dress jacket will wear with a cami because it is a course fabric.,5
6970,Great App. I was thrilled to find several items on my shopping list with tags!!,5
6971,"At first...I found it a little difficult to follow what I was doing.....and then BINGO, No issues at all!! Im chunky and I LOVE that the dresses are not""old ladyish moo moos"" Their pretty, fun, up to date and some hug your curves!!!! Awesomeness!! Plenty to choose from!! I have orderd 100's of different items and NEVER sent one back....NEVER! I have recieved 1 item, that was not up to my standards....but I donated it to my church. As for selling my items.....WOW.. sold most within a week or two",5
6972,"Customer service works, I went from 1 to 3 stars... we will see how it goes in the future",3
6973,haven't been interrupted yet by one!,5
6974,Convenient & uncomplicated,5
6975,Lots of great clothes with many wears in them for lots less $$,5
6976,It is a decent app but if you order from here maybe do so for the following season S-L-O-W!! Ordered 6/24...still waiting..every day it is pushed back to the day after..still hoping,3
6977,My main wish is they would add more than one list for us to have our favorite items on. If you have a lot of stuff favorited it takes forever to scroll through your stuff and makes things harder to find. If we could have another list or two for favorite items to organize it a little better that would be great!,3
6978,Personally I like thrifting in person. Just because I can see what I'm getting before I buy it. I didn't really like the set up of the app either. I'm sure this will be a great alternative for others though.,4
6979,Never shows up,1
6980,I loved all the cloths I got from here,5
6981,"I have loved the 'near new' or new clothing I've received. The prices are great, and the quality of them. I have become abit too addictive 😁. I had several items I returned. They let me choose between 3 options. The app saves your likes, an option to save your searches, an option to be reminded how long they are holding an item in your cart. They offer severa ways to pay, some now some later, or wait a week incase you want to add more, bundle. I highly recommend this site and app.",5
6982,"The website itself is great, but the mobile app has some issues. -The title page freezes, and I can't get into the app -sometimes the app crashes when I'm purchasing a product -tried doing auto payment on a dress and the app crashed",2
6983,Awesome,5
6984,Thrifty and fashionable! Great finds for a fraction of retail or poshmark. Love!,5
6985,Easy to use! Love it,5
6986,The app works ok but oh my lord it takes so long to receive anything ordered from Thredup. Alot of times I find myself just ordering the same stuff on sale from trusted sellers on Ebay & bypassing this app altogether. My packages arrive so much faster as opposed to the lengthy Fed-Ex route Thredup most commonly uses. EDIT: giving just 2 stars now. I'm on day 18 waiting for my package. Screenshots to prove it took 8 days to even process my package for shipping; not 1-2 as stated in their response,2
6987,This app gave me no choice for setting up price for selling. Highly NOT recommended.,1
6988,"Love this app, All the different styles of clothing and I find a lot of good bargains on name brand items. Give them an A+",5
6989,Love the service. A very helpful way to get what you need of very good quality and also save at the same time.,5
6990,Love their name brand items in every area of fashion!!,5
6991,Love it!,4
6992,"I have been loving ThredUp but all of a sudden, anything I cllick on just keeps spinning, so the images wont come up...and the tool bar and the bottom blocks the ability to buy. Any suggestions? I cant use it right now and cant buy anything",4
6993,Great app! I've found many beautiful clothes that have never or rarely been worn. Lots of designer items too 👍,5
6994,"Great spot to find deals, alot of the items are new with tags, designer items are fantastically priced.",5
6995,"I really love clothes, perhaps a bit too much. I almost gave this app 4 stars; I occasionally have difficulty controlling myself because the prices are so low, but that's on me. Everything on this site is so well priced and the quality is great = 5 stars. If you haven't checked it out yet you really, really should----amazing clothes for a lot less (sometimes crazy cheap) and helping the environment in a big way.",5
6996,Love it!,5
6997,I've been contacting thred up for the longest to let them know about a order I never got but no reply back. This is very very frustrating!!!,1
6998,Amazing app and website,5
6999,Great,5
7000,I love shopping with thredUP and the app makes that easy to do.,4
7001,I love this app.,5
7002,"Good,helpful",3
7003,Love it,5
7004,"Really love the app, but the shipping is terrible! I ordered a few items to try on prior to an event several weeks ago and have yet to receive my package, which only shows ""no scheduled delivery at this time"" when I check the tracking, so they won't arrive before I need them. Wish they used UPS instead of FedEx. I also wish they featured more images of the items from other angles, close ups of any flaws, styled with other items, etc. But my primary annoyance is the shipping.",2
7005,"Easy to browse specific styles, sizes, colors, and more. Pleasantly surprised.",5
7006,I've gotten some very nice really cute tops from thredup. I'm a little addicted to shopping there now it's so fun!,5
7007,Clothes are ugly selling long sleeves for summer time did not see one summer time casual dress that was light and cool pretty,2
7008,Rip off sent nice clothing and made a dollar or two. Threadup is taking your profit from your clothes Go somewhere eles to sell your items,1
7009,Nothing for men,1
7010,Great selection. Great quality.,5
7011,"I LOVE thread up, honestly it's the only place i buy clothes from anymore for me and my kids I just wish they had men's clothes for my hubby.",5
7012,Easy to use and well organized,5
7013,So fun!,5
7014,Great deals,5
7015,"Like shopping on this app.its great, great prices",5
7016,I love it!!,5
7017,I've been using this app for quite some time now I absolutely love it. The clothes are in excellent condition some are actually new the prices are great!,5
7018,I have been enjoying this app EXCEPT when I click on it and the app just sits on the loading screen for minutes and never loads... Gets frustrating.,4
7019,"Wonderful! I love this app, especially because there's not alot of clothing options where I live.",5
7020,"Loving my ThredUp experience. I recommend the App, and especially the Closet Clean out feature.",5
7021,Item conditions rarely as described,1
7022,Good exprtienceProduct guality excellènt deliveries prompt,5
7023,"Need to be able to put size in (18/1x/ plus tall, shoe size) You can only hit 1 or the other. Need more plus sizes. Got great deals on shoes & tops & several dresses. Linda T",5
7024,I ADORE THREDUP!! Definitely my favorite place to shop!!,5
7025,It really wasn't styled I think thing were kind of over priced for a thrift store even if it's online it was ok but most things look dinged and really old I haven't really done like thrift store but this isn't good quality and is false advertises,2
7026,"What you order is exactly what you get,,,,and I absolutely love it!",5
7027,It doesn't always filter my options,3
7028,👍,5
7029,Their sizing is so confusing I had to ask customer service to help me understand their size listing and their mess of a sizing chart. And I was so unconfident that I decided I don't want to buy anything from this app 💦,1
7030,I forgot to use my 55% code on first order. Can I use it on second order?,4
7031,Good,4
7032,High five to you,5
7033,"I can't rate this app highly enough!! It's all the fun of thrift shopping with all the convenience of online shopping PLUS selling clothes you never wear is as simple as receiving a bag, filling it up, and putting it in the mail. I love this service so much and I actually look forward to going through my wardrobe now!!",5
7034,Enjoy being able to search and filter and having my size preferences saved.,5
7035,"Like going to goodwill, shabby, wrinkled clothes. Nothing decent in my size.",1
7036,Really slow and filters don't work well.,2
7037,"I love the products on here, but the android app is a little buggy.",3
7038,"It is frustrating to get a push notification about a price drop, click on it, and be directed not to the item but to the homepage of the app. Otherwise, good functionality, though nothing that much better than the mobile site.",3
7039,"So addicting and easy to use! I absolutely love this app and company! Easy returns, quick shipments and love the point system!",5
7040,"To all that can appreciate fashionable.. trendy, vintage, and designer clothing apparel for the whole family.. then this is the online shopping experience for u ThreadUP.",5
7041,Great App love tradimg in my clothes when I purge my closet! Love this company..,5
7042,"Update: I'm livid. I sent in over $300 in EXCELLENT quality popular brand name shoes from my collection only for them to list 3 and not pay me for the rest. I knew I'd get a pittance from them, but I sent over 20 pairs of shoes in. And guess what some EXACT (unique) shoes happened to get listed that I won't see a penny of because they ""didn't qualify for being sold""? Once I get my last bag processed, I'm 100% done with selling on ThredUp. This is a SCAM. Awesome app! Easy to use. Fast response time (no lag). Well thought out.",1
7043,I've had an amazing time on this app 😍 LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!!,5
7044,Thredup is the best online thrift store and my best shopping experience ever. I have bought over 50 dresses and every one of them had been awesome. I love the experience I have had and highly recommend Thredup to anyone that loves clothes and hates to spend a lot of money on clothes.,5
7045,I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the delays in delivery. I love the clothes. I love the prices. I love the app. But delivery needs improvement.,4
7046,Easy to use and they have great clothes!! I love ThredUp,5
7047,"Fun to browse from the comfort of home.... plenty of choices, even for the pickiest of shoppers",5
7048,"The idea is nice but the costs are crazy. Not really for the clothes, even though it'd probably be better just to go in store and look at clearance or sale items, but the returns! It costs like 8.99 to return the items and a 1.99 restocking fee for EACH ITEM. Thats dreadful, its honestly not worth it. Also trying to start a return without qn account (or even with one honestly) is really bad.There are some nice clothes, but i dont suggest",1
7049,Ethical company & good for our planet,5
7050,Just placed my first order but I have loved the experience so far!! Hope you continue to get awesome discount codes. Placing the order was super easy and hope the clothes are just as described. Will update once order is received.,5
7051,The new notifications suck! I get notified only once a day when my saved searches pop up. Definitely spending less because I forget to check back.,3
7052,I just updated the app and now any item I click on to load to view the item itself (front and back) or to see item details it says loading and never loads AT ALL. It keeps saying loading and circling and does nothing and then sometimes bounces me out. It always worked fine. SO frustrating!!!!!,1
7053,"I placed an order on June 23, 2021 that has still not shipped. I've been a thredup customer for years and NEVER has it taken this long to ship my order. I can't find a way to talk to someone about my order. It shouldn't be this difficult to contact customer service. I'm NOT a happy customer right now.",1
7054,Wonderful app. Just wish they included the care instructions in the description. I'm not a fan of dry cleaning and it's always a tossup if I'll be able to wash something.,3
7055,"Easy to use, but glitchy.",3
7056,"Love this app! Easy to use, great finds, great prices, easy filters.",5
7057,I have had nothing but good experiences with Thred up. I did get one dress that had a tear at the bottom that I was disappointed about but the dress was so cheap it cost more to return it to them. I'm hoping to find someone to cut the bottom off and hem it to make it just a shorter dress. Other then that I have gotten TONS of beautiful dresses and sweaters for very cheap in wonderful condition. I will deffinatley recommend to everyone I know. You can literally find anything on here. Love it.,5
7058,"Why not measure the waist of items as well, are we just supposed to guess?",4
7059,"The worst! I got a Kalvin klein $50 pocketbook (final sale/could not return), it looked good on the website. In reality when I got it it was so destroyed and durty inside and outside. I cold not use it at all. That was my first purchase from tredUp and I do believe it is the last.",1
7060,"I placed an order, and it took over a week to package up!! And now 10 days after placing order, it says it has no clue when it will be here!!!",1
7061,So easy to shop.om thred up,5
7062,"I was looking for a way to ethically buy and discard (either by selling, donating, or recycling) clothing and found ThredUP. I love this organization. Their clean out bags make it so easy to clean out my wardrobe and I love the fact that they work with textile recycling companies so I know whatever they can't sell won't end up in a landfill. If you want to make a lot of money on your sells, ThredUP may not be for you, but that has never been my number 1 priority. I highly recommend this company!",5
7063,Everything that i have purchased has been really nice & in new/ like new condition. Prices could be a little cheaper for second hand products.,5
7064,Love how proffesional this app is and i have bought a few things and am waiting to sell some things to! Perfect way to help our planet and wallet :),5
7065,No men's clothes??? Delete,1
7066,Love ThredUp! It's awesome. The only reason for 4 stars is that the app is pretty buggy and crashes often.,4
7067,"Its ok. They dont wash their items and you can end up with pests. I washed them eerytime and this time i woke up with bites... their customer service is amazing, but for the price cleanliness is should be a part of their system...",3
7068,"Never received my package. Which said that it was delivered on the app. Called FedEx, they said Thredup are the only ones that can file the claim. Thredup said that I have to wait 7 days until they can help me.",1
7069,"Designer clothes at bargain prices. Love it. But when I say I'm a size 20/2XX, don't show me size 16s.",5
7070,"No men's options, no thank you",1
7071,Not the app app works great. I've run into problems with accurate description of what I'm buying. I just found out a pair of jeans that I bought that weren't on sale were a size O not a large as described. Obviously I cannot wear them but I gave them to my teenager daughter. Just be careful when buying sizes like small or large on here they aren't cataloging the sizes correctly and you have to pay a restocking fee if you are able to return them. To me it wasn't worth the headache.,3
7072,Love buying stuff from here. I've never gotten anything i dont like or that hasnt been exactly as described. Good products had good prices,5
7073,Very good and fun way to shop,5
7074,Best online thrift store ever!!,5
7075,"Really enjoyed this app, until this last time which was one of my smaller purchase but none the less, a package never arrived fed ex was no help and your website in event of not getting my order delivered, tells me to wait 14 days I was on pH with fed ex and all there excuses said today it was delivered thank God we have surveillance cameras my package was never delivered. So looks like I'm out 28 bucks of merch from your site and I should wait. Guess you guys got the money. BS!. Last time ever.",1
7076,"6/26/21 Update: Need to have someone who knows how to read labels on clothing. A 32 chest is not an xtr lrg, etc. There are just so many items to choose from that its hard to choose so I'm glad that you can click the heart as a favorite. Only drawback on that one is someone else can come along and take it, lol. Other than this little snafu, I love this website! I can get shoes, most of the time, in my size!! I have small feet so it's hard to find shoes in my size.. Anyway, LOVE THIS SITE!!!",5
7077,"I'm giving a 4 out of 5 because the products are great and they do a good job of only sending the best quality. My only complaint is every brand has different sizing fits and when you read the thredUP measurements, they are not always accurate to the size of the garment. For instance: in most brands I am a size 4. I saw a dress I liked from a brand I've never tried. The measurements were 34 bust but it was a size 6. I ordered it and it was very baggy on me as if I ordered a size too large. FYI",4
7078,It's a great website but the application takes forever to load and for some reason if you want to see something bigger it gives you back view first,3
7079,Love it!,5
7080,Orders received as desribed,5
7081,"Great quality items, wonderful sorting features",5
7082,"I've been using this app for years and I usually love everything! My most recent order though was a beautiful dress and it was advertised as ""like new"" condition. Well the dress was delivered today and it looks great and fits perfect but the zipper on the side is completely broken. I love the dress and don't want to return it but this should never have been listed as ""like new"" condition. I'm definitely disappointed with this order especially since I can't wear the dress until I fix the zipper",4
7083,"When I select a photo to view a close-up, the app closes.",2
7084,I like the price & to a lot more summer things.,5
7085,So easy! Great quality products. EASY returns if you need to. Really happy with the experience overall!,5
7086,"Just received two items of clothing labeled as ""like new."" The shirt had an obvious hole and the jeans an obvious stain. I'm being charged $1.99 per item to return them on top of having to print my own label and purchase my own package to return them. This is the 4th or 5th time I've recieved ""like new"" items that were not like new. Others have had pit stains, tears, buttons on the verge of falling off, etc. It's disappointing because the concept of thredup up is amazing. But it's not reliable.",1
7087,It wasn't when I thought it was thank you,1
7088,I love thredup. I've always found great buys and the clean out bags are the best. Very happy I found this site.,5
7089,"Happy with filters, clothes, and prices!",4
7090,👍,5
7091,Awesome 😎,5
7092,I find awesome deals on name brand and designer apparel new with tags still on! Awesome!,5
7093,"High prices for ""thrift"" items plus there's only women's clothing available, unless your a little boy....",1
7094,Love this app!!,5
7095,Great finds at lower prices!,5
7096,"The app doesn't help much. I have tried to save searches thru the app and when I try to apply those searches to shop, I always get the response ""We didn't find anything matching your search"". .....",1
7097,"App is easy to navigate, returns are super simple. I enjoy shopping for clothes again becasue of it!",5
7098,Excellent!,5
7099,Love shopping on this app! The choices are endless and the prices are great. Easily navigated and very organized.,5
7100,Besides disliking the restocking fee. Fed ex delivered my package to the wrong address. Which I kno isn't Thredups fault. But they gave me my money back for the missing package! Thank You! God Bless!,4
7101,Love this app.,5
7102,Received my first Goodie box. Everything smells heavily of cigarettes. Gross!,1
7103,I'm very pleased,5
7104,"Didn't even know I had this; along with a few other apps; installed! No longer in need to sell clothes, due to facts. And I need room. Thanks",3
7105,"Love thredUP, but the app needs work. I've gotten so many cute clothes, I have already recommended it to others. The app handles the endless scrolling feature better than the website, but sometimes it will get hung up and never load. I usually see this when changing search filters or looking at sold items on my favorites list. The app also lacks the ""add $x to receive free shipping"" notice in your shipping cart.",4
7106,I love Thredup!! They sell good quality clothes and shoes at reasonable prices.,4
7107,I love the points reward,5
7108,Got really excited when I found out about this as we always shop at thrift stores and then just got really disappointed when going to shop for work clothes for my husband and find out that you are sexist? Why are there no men's clothes? None.,3
7109,Great app! Just wish you could look up more specific items. You have to be very general or else nothing comes up.,4
7110,Awesome,5
7111,The shipment takes at least 3 weeks. I returned everything because nothing they sent was cute. The app doesn't give contact information and does not have accurate account information. I hope the return doesn't take another 3-4 weeks.,1
7112,"Wish you could use codes and points at check out, its either one or the other no way to combine. Sizes/Measurements are off. Some items have had snags, small holes and the handbag strap was coming apart when received.",3
7113,"I've been using Threadup since 2016, it's been 6 years since I first started shopping with them a selling to them...Per item that I've sold I usually get between $.50-$13 & that's on anything from Faded Glory to Kate Spade & Coach...but then when you start looking at what they price the items for its crazy! Not to mention the prices have definitely gone up over the years, I understand they have employees to pay, but $8 plus $6 shipping for a kids used old navy tank top is too much",2
7114,Good app. Wish they would add the ability to add an item to cart right next to the favorite button from the list display. Would make it easier to use.,4
7115,Nothing for men,1
7116,Overall a great experience.,5
7117,"Too expensive for second handed items. The idea is brilliant, however the prices are very much the same as you will find in a sale or clearance rack, but for used items I received multiple items and they are in good shape, a little worn out nonetheless (of course, many of which the previous owner worn it who know how many times) I much rather go to the store and pick up brand new items for the same (or less) price. I absolutely love the idea behind it, but for that price is just not worth it.",2
7118,"Love shopping the outlet store. Such a great deal on beautiful, unique clothing",5
7119,"Nice clothing, good sales and I've never had any shipping issues.",5
7120,This app works really smoothly 99% of the time...and I love the company. Great shopping experience.,5
7121,Great site with tons of beautiful merchandise and super fast shipping. Wish I found it sooner.,5
7122,Expensive i cant afford them. I didnt recieve anything 4 that price the lowest i was sent was $25. Nothing was &.99...,1
7123,"LOVE thredUP! I love thredUP. I find shopping through thredUP relaxing and fun. There are wonderful finds available and it is a great way to ""window shop"" for a few minutes everyday to see if something on my wish list has become available.",5
7124,Love it!,5
7125,Love and addicted to this app they send your order fast and love the stickers the hold the wrapping paper on the clothes and bags!!! Love the presentation!! Only thing I wish they did was show more detail on the items! other than that I order over hundreds of dollars and get more name brand stuff for my child with out breaking the bank. For a single mom who is struggling with money this app is here and let's me get the things I need for myself and my child at a very reasonable price!thank yall!,5
7126,I like using thread up. It is easy to purchase and return.,5
7127,"App works great, could use a few more search functions such as pant inseam and final sale! Love shopping at thread up!",4
7128,Awesome,5
7129,"Very enjoyable way to shop. Wish searching by ""location"" was an option. Once I find something I really like, I like to bundle from the same warehouse.",4
7130,So much fun!,5
7131,Search filter still shows what you've excluded. Please fix❤,3
7132,Got a lot of good deals from here,5
7133,Horrible! What I got was nothing like the photos! Plus the sizes were soooo off! This is why women like to try jeans on! I ordered two pair of bell bottoms similar sizes. Neither were even flared! One was huge and one skin tight. In addition it stated that each pair retailed for 70 Plus dollars. No way they look super cheap! Will never order from here again!,1
7134,Great experience,5
7135,"I have yet to be disappointed!! I've ordered a dozen separate pieces and kept and worn every one, with compliments for each!",5
7136,Great values,5
7137,"Absolutely adore this app! Have gotten some amazing deals and shop often! Great rewards and outstanding,crisp and clear photos.",5
7138,The more you use this.. the better it becomes with rewards.,5
7139,"The app is great, the search doesn't seem to cover what I want. Sometimes it searches brands that say ""linen"" instead of showing all the linen dresses, for example. And I wish they'd have men's clothes!",4
7140,Loooove my puuurse,5
7141,Just looking around,4
7142,"Wish you could filter by bust inches. It would save me a lot of time sorting through what I like. Other than that, I love this site.",4
7143,The first time I ordered over 200.00.i couldn't wear one item.all but 3 items were children s sizes and they smelled.i donated every piece.dont want to try again.,1
7144,"I can't shop or sell on here because I have men's clothing that I'm trying to get rid of, and I can't fit in boy's clothing, and I'm not willing to start wearing women's clothing. I would think an app that specializes in clothing that has a boy's section would also have a men's section, but I was sadly mistaken.",1
7145,"So addicted to this app. Very well priced items, HUGE variety, plus returns are so easy. They even take my old or no longer used clothes. Thanks Thred Up!!",5
7146,"Well worth the little bit of money you spend, try it you will love the thredup experience! All clothes received have been in great shape and fit me, so happy. It's thrift store shopping without leaving your house!",5
7147,Super user friendly and fun to puruse.,5
7148,"The Android app takes way too long to open. Sometimes I will open it and it will freeze on the teal page with your logo for 3 or 4 minutes, before I give up and stop trying.",2
7149,This app is amazing. There is a wide variety of good quality clothes and accessories at extremely affordable prices. Loved it. I am addicted to thrifting now.,5
7150,Needs better pictures,3
7151,"Wish they had better category break downs, it's a little bit of a shopping hot mess sometimes trying to find what you want.",4
7152,"Super easy to use, and able to easily switch between juniors and women's sizes, so shopping for items for my nieces is a breeze!",5
7153,This company us amazing i can get great quality items for a thrifty price in the safety of my own home,5
7154,Awesome clothes great prices on like new items! My got to for everything.,5
7155,"You can use filters to narrow your searches to show only the sizes that you want. Photos of items help you to see what the clothes look like on a mannequin, front and back. I have had very good luck so far in having the clothes I selected fit me very well.",5
7156,You can't buy men's clothing.,1
7157,GREAT 6,4
7158,"Shoe sizes are wrong. I wear a 9.5 and the search algorithm filters out the correct sizes in EU shoes. I would wear a 42-43 in EU and it only shows 39.5s which is incorrect. I can't select my sizes, i have to scroll through all options. When you send in a bag of clothes, they do a good job of sifting through options. It takes months butv you do get some $$.",2
7159,Can't open the app many times.,3
7160,Love love this app I get a package every week it seem like.. adorable prices and there quality is grate as well,5
7161,They need to display the clothes a lot better. Get good display mannequins in different sizes or use your employees as models. Get a student in a college photography class to take the photos. At least get a steamer and get out the wrinkles. Terrible pictures.,3
7162,App is doesn't give you all the options as regular site does . Also have had problems with every order I have ordered with thred up . They don't disclose flaws or damage and expect you to pay to return and a processing fee . Will never order again from them.,1
7163,"Great place to find used clothes online! My favorite feature is probably that I can bundle my orders over 7 days! This helps me get the most for my money by allowing me to take advantage of multiple sales and coupons, and it helps with sustainability by shipping all of my orders at once!",5
7164,Easy online purchase. Items cone as described. Great price,5
7165,"Really love love love thread up. The site can lag a teeny bit when checking out things personal to your account (favorites, orders, rewards, ect). Overall it is really intuitive and the filters are so amazing and specific!",4
7166,Don't waste your time or money. They are quick to charge your card but wait 5 days or more to ship. When I asked about the order they gave me a shipped date that was 4 days before I even placed it and wont respond. Its overpriced goodwill clothes that you can get for half the price elsewhere. 0 stars,1
7167,"I've had a GREAT and fun experience with ThredUP! Packages are delivered very quickly and are beautifully wrapped with fun papers. If there is a delay in shipping, they let you know right away. Everything arrived in great condition.",5
7168,Fairly expensive for used clothing.. Not great selection either,1
7169,Love this app..clothes are so cute,5
7170,Love this!,4
7171,Love this app!,5
7172,It's a fine app but the clothes are so ugly and bland.,3
7173,"I have almost $100 in credit but the app won't let me make a purchase. When I try to check out, the page loads and then nothing happens. I contacted customer service and no one responded. They are keeping my money without letting me spend it. I am leaving this review in hopes that someone responds. I will update accordingly if I receive adequate customer service. Thank you.",1
7174,Awesome shopping and products,5
7175,Not for me,2
7176,Great quality products!,5
7177,"I would give this app zero stars if possible the company is a complete rip off. They give you pennies for your good clothes, new clothes even. And then I this last time around I sent a ton more clothes that were in awesome condition and the company thred up says I only sent 9? What a sham. I will never do business with them after this. I'm done with this malarkey. There has to be a better website that doesn't rake people already struggling over the coals.....what a sad thing to do.",1
7178,You might as well just buy new clothes with the prices they are charging.,1
7179,Left the box in the gate and the dogs got the box and tore up 4 items in the box! Not suppose to leave in the gate! So please don't send no more boxes to me!,1
7180,Absolutely love the sale and clearance. I always find super cute clothes in good condition for an amazing price!!,5
7181,There are no clothes for men,1
7182,Love everything about this app!!,5
7183,The cart doesn't last very long...when I go back to the app...I have to start all over again...need to add things with a list...and some items are too pricey...for resale...received 1st order...example...coat didn't have the belt...and items were very wrinkled...returns have to be paid by customers!,2
7184,Such a great variety of brands and prices! I love that I can get designer clothing and accessories for super cheap! Sometimes with tags!,5
7185,DO NOT SEND IN A CLEANOUT BAG FOR THEM TO SELL. THEY ARE SELLING MY ITEMS FOR $7-$12 A PIECE AND IM ONLY GETTING LIKE .15 CENT FOR A SHIRT THEY SOLD FOR $7. AND WHAT THEY DONT SELL OF YOUR OWN ITEMS YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM BACK....RIP OFFS!!!,1
7186,Love this app.,5
7187,Fun and addicting knowing that I get to shop and not have to buy new,5
7188,"Love the service, and the app itself is pretty well designed and easy to use. Only complaint is that I live in black pants, but all the pictures of black pants are hard to see- very dark/ high contrast, can't tell if there are pockets or what the closure looks like. Would love it if pants listed whether there were pockets.",3
7189,"For you hard core thrift shoppers - this app is so addicting! Keep in mind there are different features in the app that you don't get on the website (having the option to ""shop similar styles"" on items that are already sold or in others carts - a feature I LOVE) as well as aspects on the website that are not available on the app (different sorting categories for favorited items, ability to track returns, & a more detailed page for 'my sales' are all available on the website but not the app)",5
7190,Processing time is crazy long. Payout percents are really low.,3
7191,Easy and quick to use.,5
7192,It's kind of glitchy and slow but overall not terrible. I've had some issues with entering payment info and the favorites list always takes forever to load. Sometimes you have to fully close the app and restart it.,3
7193,Some items a bit pricey for being used ..its ok..,3
7194,Huge varity for you to choose from. I love it 💝,5
7195,"I love this app and their type business being sustainable and environment friendly. Their customer service reps are really good. My problem with it is, it gives me a hard time to print a shipping label when I try to send them my Boss' used clothes. It kept asking me to login my username and password and then it would say ""ooops sorry something went wrong, please try again later"" I eventually got in touch with customer service both times and they sent me a copy of the shipping labelsthrough chat",4
7196,Easy to use,5
7197,"Great, easy to use.",5
7198,Good quality clothes,5
7199,i dont bot reccomend buying from this company its the biggest joke and waste money.they descibe all there items and are all wrong.the returns dont bother trying to retun any item u pay so kuch for a return pkus the restocking fee on top of it and will have no money back.there sizes are completely wring in discription about womens to juniors to everything there offf on a lot and should not be selling clothes when theu no nothing about them.THIS IS THE WORSE CLOTHING COMPANY.stop false info plz,1
7200,Don't like this one,2
7201,"This app is cursed. No, really. It is genuinely the worst app I have ever used. Sketchy homebrew apps designed to steal data function more consistently. If not for the fact that the browser version is arguably worse and the occasional excellent sale, I would yeet this straight off my phone into the sun. Intermittently: links refuse to open, filters won't refresh when you select a new criteria, search input function ceases to work, filter methods randomly change, app crashes repeatedly, etc.",1
7202,"May need a few tweaks as far as the ""search"" function but really I've had no real issues shopping or receiving clothes. They come in a cute box or in a regular shipping bag with clothes wrapped in thredup tissue.",5
7203,Great product prices and selections. Definitely buy from them again and great place to sell your used stuff.,5
7204,"In filter options despite picking a size option, all sizes still show up in search. It's frustrating and makes me not want to use the app at all.",2
7205,Nice dresses for a fair price!,5
7206,Exellent,5
7207,"Hard to wait for arrivals. But, shipments do arrive quickly. Since initial purchases,. I have found they must be extremely overworked. The sizing information is seldom accurate and lately the orders have been slowly prepared for shipment. My impression has altered some since our original acquaintance. I will still be a customer; but, a bit more apprehensive. Thanks.",5
7208,"I love the points systems, sales and returns is all so smooth... But I'll give this app 5 stars when we have menswear up in here 👏",4
7209,Got new clothes with tags. Both had holes. 😏,1
7210,thredup is the best!,5
7211,Awesome place to buy used women's clothing. Wish they had a men's section because I keep bragging about it to all my friends. Good for the environment and good for people who like a good bargain. Plus you can sell them your old clothes assuming they're in good condition.,5
7212,Goosd,5
7213,Easy to use site with so many clothing options.,5
7214,I highly enjoy this app,5
7215,Soooo expensive and half the items I ordered were damaged even though they were described as good condition. I didn't bother returning because they make you pay to ship back items THEY lied about. Also you have to pay a restocking fee... like who the ef does that?? You're better off going to goodwill or using depop. Pretty sure half their good reviews are fake because there is no way they deserve more than 2 stars.,1
7216,"I give 2 stars because I have actually found several items that actually fit me unlike most stores online or in person. (If we were talking clothing only, I'd go as far to give 4 stars, most everything is how described.) You get get ripped off completely if you have a return and the customer service is the absolute worst to deal with. The app isn't very user-friendly, it glitches a lot. The old website setup was the best for shopping on your mobile.",2
7217,I like what l saw!,5
7218,Great stuff❤️,5
7219,So easy to use! So fun to shop and get amazing items for great prices!,5
7220,"Tried to check out to see if there was anything good, but it wanted me to sign up first, no thanks.",1
7221,Absolutely GREAT!! Thanks Thred up!! I will be ordering again very soon!!,5
7222,"My first box I kept about 35% of the clothing. My second box, I returned everything. I put a note in the box since there is NO way to get a hold of them. I wrote to cancel my subscription because the stuff they send me is not my style, it was unattractive and expensive. I got a third box and it's even worse. The cloths on the app are not the cloths they send.",1
7223,Got on here and they made it easy for a single dad to buy both his daughter's clothes.i love it and my daughter's do to.,5
7224,Love you guys! Easy to shop and find beautiful things in just my style!,5
7225,Let me in!!! I used to be really happy with thredUP & their app but since the newest update I can't get into it!! Prior to that update I had trouble viewing all of my Saved Searches and when I inquired about why I had to go through 2 or 3 different screens to find ALL my saved stuff all I got was a vague answer. I used to be head over heels in love with thredUP but I'm just like..ehh,3
7226,"I like the large selection and variety to choose from. Most of what we purchased was as described. I purchased a shirt listed as like new only to find two snags. Also, a like new pair of pants had the draw string missing. Prices seem a bit high considering amount the seller receives. I still prefer local consignment or used clothing stores.",3
7227,I absolutely love shopping with thredUP. NOW MY FAVORITE WAY TO SHOP.,5
7228,Love this app!!,5
7229,They seem to have the sizez I need!,5
7230,The return process takes way too long to receive a refund,2
7231,"Must installed this app, getting ready to un-install. Tried purchasing something for 2 days and kept getting 'Oops something went wrong' CS tells me to un-install and do this and that...ummm, No. I am not having any issues worth any other app. Besides if the error is on my part or their's then send a message as yo what the problem is. Also, decided to look at the reviews and, ummmm, no again. I'll pass rather than have to deal with any issues. Other selling sites I've dealt with are better. DONE",1
7232,Can't get any help for returns... Wrong size shoes sent... 3 other items not right too.. Took a long time to receive everything i ordered and now i cant get help with returns...,1
7233,Wonderful in everyway!,5
7234,"I got really great deals on my first order, and the clothes are mostly in really good condition. A pair of sweat I order has a lot of wear and weird fuzz material build up around the crotch area which wasn't pictured or mentioned, and there was a bunch of pet hair on a few of the items.",4
7235,shopping made easy safe and fun!,5
7236,I just browse.,4
7237,Great prices and wide selection but my first purchase had a large flaw/damage to it and returns are not free so I just net the loss. Sucks.,2
7238,"Love the options available! The organization and ability to search specifically has made my shopping experience ideally awesome. However, the issue I'm experiencing is that the app will close itself every, well, it was 2 minutes this time. Will change to 5⭐ if this is fixed.",4
7239,I like it,5
7240,Fabulous so far!!,5
7241,Confusing app.,1
7242,"Great clothes, easy to use",5
7243,I have not received anything that would like to keep and would like to stop receiving boxes. They make it hard to get out of subscription.,3
7244,Normally good but when attempt to get a goodie was charged for clothing I already ordered. I never received so called box. Am recommending anyone who asks me dont bother downloading it.,1
7245,"Great app, long processing time.",3
7246,I love this app.,5
7247,Great clothes,5
7248,Love th u s app. Affordable and quality.,5
7249,"I love using thredUP to purchase clothing that I simply can't afford retail. The clothing I've received is fabulous, and the so makes it easy to track the things I want, or that I'm keeping an eye on.",5
7250,"I receive Emails for special deals, like 75% off my favorite brands. I click on the Email to receive the deal and I am taken to the shop page and not offered the 75% off. This happens everytime no matter what deals I am offered. Why do you keep sending me the Emails for special prices and then not have them available to be taken advantage of on the shop page. Its like now you see it and now you don't. I feel like the whole Email special prices are just a scam to get you to shop anyway.",3
7251,Love your company. I will need some smaller sizes. The medium was too big. I didn't like the dresses. Great prices. I would love to make more purchases.,4
7252,Great way to buy beautiful clothes at good prices.,5
7253,"Could use some better filters, but it's pretty good.",3
7254,My 1st order and I was skeptical . I orered 8 or tops from 7.95-12.95 and I was ⚡SHOCKED⚡. Every one of those tops were BEAUTIFUL and High Quality .(Also order came FAST) I am so hapoy I could burst.THANK YOU. I just recueved last oart if my order yesterday and Im already back on THREDUP looking for more!!,5
7255,"Easy, lots of items, in good condition and price is very reasonable, will be shopping again soon",5
7256,This app takes the labor out of thrifting,5
7257,Amazing clothing in great condition at great prices! Highly recommend. I have gotten tons of blazers and skirts for work at +70% less than retail value.,5
7258,"I will never sell anything with this app again. It's great if you want to receive $2 for quality items worth $20. Horrible experience. Even if your listing is what they suggested, you'll end up making way less from the 12% discounts they give people. They're making money & you're getting nothing.",1
7259,Where's menswear? I don't understand,1
7260,I love thredup been with them for a couple of years. I've sold and bought great treasures. ... lobe love love this Web site. ... and i will continue to use it and recommend to friends families and even strangers 👍👍👍👍👍,5
7261,I love to shop it Awesome catergizing E VERYTHING,5
7262,3 out of the 6 items I ordered had a hole and riped seems. I would agree that things are over priced. These items that have damage should have been reduced. I should not have to sew something I just paid $25. Keep in mind this ap does let you return. There is a shipping fee and shelving fee. Or get credit like any other thrift store you buy used clothes. I am happy with four out of six items. Feeling it is still not worth the hassle as return process takes weeks. I may return if you drop prices!,3
7263,"After many purchases from ThredUp, I'm officially done with them. My first purchase from them should've kept me from ever purchasing from them again. The first shirt I ever ordered was missing a button and I looked back at the description for the shirt and that was not mentioned. Their return policy is garbage because they want you to pay to ship it back. The last and final purchase was for a pair of shorts that ""had minor signs of wear"" They were STAINED and DIRTY!!",1
7264,"I've experienced having to return multiple items due to inaccurate descriptions of quality & size. It's starting to feel like a scam to make $ on restocking and method of refund fees. Disappointing, I don't mind consignment items and see value in them. See standard refund fees for every item ordered below: ""$8.99 charge for refund to original form of pymt"" & ""$1.99 restocking fee""",1
7265,I have purchased so many cute items. I wouldn't even know where to look for half this stuff. Thank you Thred Up!,5
7266,"Good app; however, when you apply filters to search, it also includes items outside the desired search. That part is very frustrating. Am happy with items received, though.",4
7267,"MIA customer service, can't even ask why an item was described as ""excellent, you'll think it's new!"" but came significantly damaged. They haven't answered my emails, the most expensive item still hasn't shipped and I'm trying to ask about just canceling based on the other item. Because the most expensive one was also ""final sale,"" meaning I may receive more trash I can't return. Though I question if you can even truly return things not marked final sale based on the inability to speak with CS.",1
7268,"When I go online to this website, I can usually find a lot of nice stuff at discounted prices.",5
7269,"Love ThredUP. I'm kinda obsessed actually. Of course, they have issues like every app/store, but their customer service is great!",5
7270,"I enjoy the thredUP experience. It is fun looking at all the clothes. When you order, the items you choose are shown in pictures so you are reminded. The clothing arrived in a timely manner with no problems at all!",5
7271,This company is amazing. The clothes are quality and emptying your closet is super easy. The app sometimes stalls and I wish we could choose more than 1 category of clothing at a time when searching,4
7272,love this site...its above ALL others!!,5
7273,Disappointed! Ordered a Size 9 believing it was what it said and received a 9 month pair of overalls.,5
7274,Awesome quality clothes for a great price! App is easy to use.,5
7275,"Easy to use, great varaity good prices",5
7276,Good way to lose money.,1
7277,Nice,5
7278,I have really enjoyed shopping on thredup. The quality is very good and true to there descriptions of the clothes.,5
7279,LOVE THREDUP! GREAT QUALITY CLOTHING... ALWAYS CHECK HERE BEFORE I LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE,5
7280,I love this app and love shopping with ThredUp. Items are in great condition and the prices are very reasonable.,5
7281,There's some gems on here but you have to know brand names like anywhere. I would not pay full retail price for off brand second hand clothing thats a crime. But good app overall.,3
7282,"Great buying experience. Easy to navigate, with speedy checkout. Only recommendations would be to add additional search filter criteria , i.e. pockets, hood, etc. Also, additional photo views would be helpful to show more detail, such as side view of clothing to highlight profile fit, as well as the interior of bags and wallers.",4
7283,Too damn expensive,1
7284,"I have purchased many items from Thread. Only about 2 items (out of dozens) were not as described (described as good condition and i received them in fair to poor condition). However, those items were inexpensive and you can return stuff.",5
7285,Great app,5
7286,"Placed a $200 order a month ago, haven't received anything yet. Reached out to customer service multiple times but they were rude and didn't help. They will spam you all day long through the app, your email - btw good luck trying to unsub once they have your info - the link to do so doesn't even work, but they ghost you once they have your money. Good concept for a business too bad whoever runs this company is 💩",1
7287,They charged $140 for a dress listed as having minor wear. When I received it the dress had a huge gauge taken out of the left shoulder. Unbelievable. When I looked back at the listing photo the area with the hole was slightly visible. They knowingly listed something that is unwearable. This app is a scam. Do yourself a favor and don't download.,1
7288,"I LOVE this! It's like finding exactly what you want at the thrift store and you don't even have to hunt really hard for it. The thrill of the thrift-hunt is still there, just with more options! I love it!",5
7289,Good spot for bargains,5
7290,Love shopping here,5
7291,"Sometimes searching for something specific is frustrating with tiny glitches that can be a time suck (hitting the back button makes you have to put in your search parameters again), but for the most part the app is easy to maneuver and the photos are nice and clear and you can zoom in nice and tight. All in all, well done!",4
7292,"This app does not open with the daily new items on top, I constantly have to scroll through through to find the new items that I constantly get notifications about. I like having the notifications because it suppose to let me know when the new items hit, that's how I have it set up, but that is not how I get them, and that makes visit the site less and less.",3
7293,They don't give you a notice of when they're taking money out so just all the sudden you get slammed for your goody box,2
7294,"Love this app, love the company.",5
7295,Great app! I enjoy it very much! Have only had a couple items that were less than satisfactory but no big deal! Thank you,5
7296,"I like it! The items I've received have been of good quality. Some of the styles for sale are a little out-of-fashion, but you can find plenty of beautiful timeless pieces. Selling hasn't earned me much, but I'm glad to have the items out of my house.",4
7297,Great options!,5
7298,Prices were too high. I deleted it because of this.,5
7299,Love this app!,5
7300,The app is great for on the go shopping. But i still prefer the real website. I feel you can do more online then allowed by the app. Plus the app is very glitchy. Half the time it doesn't work properly.,3
7301,Easy to use way better than imagined. Thanks thredUP!,5
7302,I love it.,5
7303,Very happy with this app. Their items always arrive as described and their measurements are accurate.,5
7304,Exceptional,5
7305,Merchandise is as described. I have purchased many items and have not been disappointed.,5
7306,Filters could be better but overall easy shopping experience,4
7307,"My new addiction!! Seriously tho, it's nothing for me to add add add add to my closet from here! It used to be full of black and white, now it's bursting with colors!!!",5
7308,The app is easy and I can shop from anywhere!,5
7309,Clothes are great. Wish you could see the inside of purses and wallets.,4
7310,App is easy to navigate and particularly love that the search function saves my sizes!,5
7311,Nice,5
7312,Making it easy to shop green from home.,5
7313,"Love ThreadUp! One feedback item...when suggesting similar items, they should match the size filtering. I'm constantly shown really great stuff in size 0, and I'm a 14. That sucks!",5
7314,"Great app, wish it was organized more when you filter out the options you want.",4
7315,I love this app,5
7316,Love this app and the store is wonderful. Great selections for plus sized ladies. My go to shopping for basics in all my favorite brands at half off or more! If you are on a budget this is where you need to shop.,5
7317,"It's good if you don't have to return anything. If you have to return something that wasn't received as described, then you don't receive the full amount you paid for. I returned 2 items, I paid $43, the credit to my account was $18. I tried emailing the customer service, it was a joke. I closed my account and took off the app. Buyer beware!!!",1
7318,"I love the site; it makes shopping secondhand so much easier and more convenient. The app is pretty good but can get stuck on certain pages, and doesn't include all the features of the web version.",4
7319,Great selection,4
7320,"Great selection, decent prices, user friendly.",4
7321,"Wonderful experience, great clothes for a small price. You have got to try thredup.",5
7322,I appreciate the variety and the accurate measurements and descriptions.,5
7323,"I say ZERO stars! My first goody box was all maternity clothes and I didn't indicate at all in my profile that I was pregnant. I returned the box within the time frame. thredUP still charged me over $220. I've reached out through email and costumer support. I can't call because they have no number to talk to a human being! Terrible app, terrible costumer service!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS APP OR COMPANY!!!",1
7324,"I enjoy buying second hand, but descriptions need to improve. I ordered a pair of jeans described as high waisted. They were low rise upon arrival and non-returnable. I should be able to return an item that was described falsely.",3
7325,"Easy to use and so many items. Plus, you'll be helping the environment by buying used.",5
7326,"Great app. The only peeve I have is when you filter by price or anything else, it doesn't really filter.",4
7327,"I like the clothes they have, great prices, great way to live more sustainably....But contacting them is RIDICULOUS TRASH!!!!!! Customer support takes way to long to get back to you, I'm so upset!!!!",5
7328,Awesome!,4
7329,I like the search options. The ability to search for specific needs and specific items makes thrifting more accessible for people who want to look for exactly what they want. I have found high quality clothing at reasonable price points. The only issue I have is their shipping time frame. If you pick their standard shipping options you may get you order within a week to a month of when you originally placed your order. The estimated arrival date is hardly ever right.,3
7330,Not my style of thrift shopping.. weird looking stuff and then the few somewhat cute items are over priced. Plato's closet is the way to go.,2
7331,Easy to use. Great deals,5
7332,Waiting for my polkadot package!!! This is a great clothes app with great info on the items 😌🙂 Enjoying shopping again!!!!,5
7333,Love every item i get from here!,5
7334,Awesome products and ßuper easy to use!!,5
7335,"I love ThredUp and it's mission! Save so much money on clothes without compromising appearance and style. I've found so many unique items for an insanely low price! Love the amount of information given on each item. The app can be a little janky if it's open for too long or if you jump between open apps, otherwise it works well. As for searching though I wish there more filter options for the shoe categories. Otherwise no complaints!",4
7336,"So many styles, good pricing, and amazing shipping service. I plan to sell with ThredUp.",5
7337,Nice app,5
7338,Great dea!.. no joke.,5
7339,"Very user-friendly app. Absolutely can't beat the deals on the clothes either, better than PoshMark or Fashionova",5
7340,Good for the planet and your wallet!,5
7341,Love this app so far,5
7342,"Unique concept but I don't see the difference in pricing from Walmart, Target etc.. its just not worth it too me. Im not impressed, I'd rather take my chances at Salvation Army.",3
7343,I love that I can shop from home Their selection is amazing,5
7344,I love it! So far so good 👍🏽,5
7345,Lots of goodies,5
7346,"The app is ok. But not sure the clothes are worth as much as they are sold for. Regardless of the ""like new"" status, the shirt priced at 33 dollars and change came with deoderant stains on the arm pits. Dont want to deal with restocking fees and trying to get a post office on lunch break before they close, so I will see if they come out but definitely think people would my more, if prices were cheaper. Just because Loft is on the tag doesn't mean it appreciates value.",3
7347,"Usually good stuff. But not happy to get ""like new"" items with stains and tears on them",3
7348,I love this app,5
7349,So far it's been very easy to shop.,5
7350,My favorite way to shop!,5
7351,Your shipping sucks; horribly slow is an understatement. I would like my items just as fast as I gave you the money for my order. Should really work on this.,3
7352,This is a great site. Some of the search descriptions and results are not the beat but the prices are great,4
7353,"I like getting clothes second hand, but items are almost always a little overpriced. I always have to wait for sales. I know they say it's because sellers can adjust their own prices but even items I send in start off overpriced honestly. Also if your searching for something specific, good luck. The search abilities suck. They also sometimes mislabel items and there is no way to report it. They might have a sale on skirts but the skirt I want if mislabeled as a blouse. It could be better.",4
7354,They desperately need to turn down the exposure on their white items. You can't even tell what it is that you're looking at.,3
7355,There return orocess makes it easy to return items and refund your money with store credit.,5
7356,I like cheap clothes and I cannot lie.,5
7357,Good quality clothes,5
7358,I love the wide selection of free people and lucky brand.,5
7359,No men's clothing,1
7360,Great items,5
7361,I am not very happy you guys what four of my items that were in my thing that I sent you guys for y'all to sell for me and send them back to me runt and said that y'all were going to pay for them and like I send them that way y'all gave me 10.99 for four articles of clothing that y'all were supposed to pay me a hundred some dollars store for selling them and the few articles of clothing a job did keep I'm getting half of what I was supposed to get ..,1
7362,"I only shop ThredUp now for all my clothes! It's so easy, so quick, and the variety is amazing!",5
7363,"I love this online store! Yes it may be a bit more expensive than thrift stores, but it is worth it. No flipping through h undreds of dirty clothes to find the right one. No lines to wait in. No annoying people to deal with!",5
7364,"Very user friendly lay out, usefull search options and a saved items list. All your orders, returns and selling items details are easy to find. Extra discounts pop up every now and then.",5
7365,I cannot reach anyone regarding a missing package.,1
7366,"I absolutely lovethredup, they have high quality standards and the filter option helps you narrow in on what you're looking for!",5
7367,"I've placed 4 orders 1 was spot on. Item worn out, piling, turned seams, colors washed out or blotchy. I've asked questions on their site and No one gets back to me! This will be my last order.",2
7368,Love it,5
7369,I am non bianary and really wanted something to help me dress more massculine since im soon to start transitioning. But i am size 11 in jeans and it only went up to 34 inches when im 38 to 39 inches. Fat phobic. Also it assumed my gender and i couldnt find a way to change it. F u,1
7370,"Horrible app. Everytime I save something, someone immediately snatches it from my cart.",2
7371,"Very difficult to search for specific styles without having to sift through non relevant items. An example would be searching for Boho Maxi Dress or Sun Dress or let's say, wedge or platform shoes. My opinion, Poshmark is better!",1
7372,"I love shopping through this app. Just be careful because they will list a name brand item and when you get it, its not authentic. I just ordered a pair of Polo sneakers and they are a horrible knock off but listed it as Polo. Same goes for the Calvin Kline boots I ordered, they listed it as the name brand but when I got them again they were a knockoff. You think they would put it in the description of authenticity but I guess that' how they get you.",3
7373,"So far I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality & variety of the merchandise available. The delivery time is surprisingly quick & although I have yet to have to return anything, their restocking process & charge appear to be reasonable & straightforward.",5
7374,Love this app i got 10 outfits and 5 pairs of really nice stilettos all for 130 you can't beat that and halfof them still had tags on them,5
7375,"Bought Victorias secret sport leggings with crotch was terrible. Gave them a second chance, bought another pair of vs sport leggings.. SAME THING..CROTCH PILLING AND STAINS. TERRIBLE.. 3 PAIR.",1
7376,I just love ThredUP.,5
7377,"The best shopping app I've ever used. Consistent, easy, high quality",5
7378,"Be careful, it's addictive.",5
7379,Good not great. You can't do detailed or specific searches. Very time consuming searching through so many things because you can't narrow down your search. Also not easy to find tracking on returns. I have found some good stuff but it doesn't wow me. App needs a little more work to make shopping easier,3
7380,"When you first open this platform you expect to be able to look at mens or women's apparel but your only choices here are women, boys, and girls, this app both missleading and sexist, excluding mens apparel when we make up half the population! Get a clue threadup deleting your app right away I don't believe in discrimination in any way shape or form!",1
7381,Nothing for Men. Great if you have a GF that likes recycled clothing.,4
7382,"I'm able to find same exact items new for similar price! Shipping is slow and quality control is poor. Items marked as ""like new"" may be missing buttons or have swear pills on them. I even found used tissues in pockets of pants. I wouldn't mind the quality control issues if items weren't over priced. Edit: I do like the filters, and am able to filter results by price. I don't mind paying a higher price for premium items. I don't however appreciate paying new prices for used items.",1
7383,*** Been about a month now and no refund issued so actually this feels a LOT like a SCAM to me. Not worth the risk of things not fitting. I carefully measured myself and clothes of mine that fit perfectly and then ordered clothes in those measurements and not a single item fits. And for returns not only are you charged $1.99 per item but you have to pay for a shipping label or take store credit and print your own label.,1
7384,Don't like the clothing,1
7385,Had nice things but prices too high for me,3
7386,"Overall,this site has a lot of new and gently used items to choose from along w/ a ton of name brands for less! Who needs the mall when you have thread up?! The Lux section is one of my favs!.. I love the coupons/promotions they do throughout the year. My favorite thrifting site hands down.",4
7387,For one way way to expensive and then a dress I ordered had a big pink stain on the front of it it's like why would somebody even send that out that wasn't in the description and then I can't figure out how to return it there isn't an option for that dress like they new or something and ya right I shouldn't have to pay a restocking fee for a damaged item that was not suppose to be damaged extremely unsatisfied,1
7388,"I have a few suggestions: 1) The scarves. My gosh the scarves! They are like ants that have invaded my picnic! They really need their own category, like shoes. Completely separate! So much time is spent scrolling past scarves 2) swimwear. For us women with a fuller bust, to have the D/DD option for sizes 3) the point system. I love the idea and I think I can speak for everybody else that one of the biggest desires would be free shipping. There has to be an easier way to earn that",3
7389,"Super buggy. Will not load, even with an uninstall and reinstall, still won't load.",2
7390,Terrible.,1
7391,Nice items good prices thanks km,5
7392,👍,5
7393,Love love love,5
7394,thread up is great,5
7395,Used to be great. I could send bags of clothes in and what they didn't sell they donated. I didn't get rich but it was a great way to declutter. They have been on hold from taking clothes forintgs now with no information on when they will take items again. Sucks!,1
7396,Lots of options at a great price,5
7397,Great app. Tons of clothes for a very reasonable price.,5
7398,Everything I tap to open says zero items!,1
7399,It's a awesome store w is the great prices. I loved in S.C. and am sure I well love it here in Michigan too.,5
7400,I made my first order and im excited,5
7401,"I don't think 🤔 is not fear recive damage , couple peaces I need Trout in the track 😹 can.",4
7402,Shipment was extremely fast and it's exactly what I ordered,5
7403,Have gotten so many kids clothing from here. I was only disappointed once. When I was sent boys pants instead of girls pants. Other than that I am good. My daughter absolutely loves the fancy dress I got her. $12.99 it was originally $45. Super savings. Yes the clothing has a smell to it. But it's stored in a warehouse so it doesn't bother me. The dress is beautiful. And my daughter spends at least an hour every time she wears it twirling around. She says it makes her feel like princess. 😀,5
7404,"Unimpressed. Overpriced, very sad won't do it again",1
7405,It's great and It's so awesome to reuse instead of just waste clothing 💚💙💛,5
7406,"Cute and affordable clothing with quick shipping. If they had a men's section, it would be 5 stars, but I do like that they have a boys' and a girls' section for the little ones",4
7407,I really enjoy this app a great way to find affordable clothing,5
7408,Don't send your clothes in. You might as well donate them. You won't get but pennies for them.,1
7409,Love this app!! Have ordered multiple times and has yet to disappoint! Also helped me find new designers I hadn't even realized I liked until I saw their merchandise on THREDUP! Keep up the good work THREDUP TEAM! Your killin it!,5
7410,"Loved everything i ordered , great condition, everything fit.",5
7411,It's constantly glitching and crashing. The shipping price is very high as well.,3
7412,"They make over 90% on a lot of items, they make you pay to have you things shipped back to you if you reclaim them, they dont let you use your free shipping code you earned from purchasing from them on your reclaimed clothes, you can only use one code per order so if you have $10 you earned and they are running a 20-50% off sale you can only get one or the other, you have to either pay or donate the clothes they dont accept which makes me wonder if they aren't keeping some and selling judging by",1
7413,Always get the right things I order fabulous condition of clothes love the bundle always have what I need,5
7414,"This is all of the best parts of thrift store shopping, like keeping clothes out of landfills, and the best parts of online shopping, anytime day or night, and being able to search easily for your specific needs. I love it!",5
7415,"While technically functional for placing an order, this app lacks some functionality of the website (certain filter options, etc) and does not save where you were when you close the app. I uninstalled it and use the website instead.",1
7416,Very few options. And most when it comes to knowing inseams on jeans..im 5'10..its super impt .Its just a quick measurement.,2
7417,Shipping is fast and everything packaged really nicely. Site is easy to navigate and can be filtered to fit your tastes and size. The only real issue for me is that I could spend hours and hundreds of dollars on this app!,4
7418,How do you I start to order,4
7419,Great clothes!,5
7420,I love this app!,5
7421,"I love Thredup, but the app is frustrating. When I get an email about an item I've liked and I try to open it in the app it gets stuck loading and then the app is useless even after I restart the phone! It just loads and loads and loads...",3
7422,The stuff I've gotten has always come as discribed and on time. I love thrifting and this makes it so easy!,5
7423,"Easy to shop! Love saving my favorite searches/brands. Delivery is prompt and wrapped nicely! Quality clothing at affordable prices, the outlet is a gem!",5
7424,LOVE this site! Only thing I would suggest is possible a way to manually plug in your measurements like maybe a body outline that the user could enter each measurement as they're located on the outline. Giving the user more specific search parameters,4
7425,"This is SUCH a cool app! IF you enjoy shopping at home and like the fact that when shopping at a thrift store, you can choose from SO many types and styles of clothing, then you will DEFINITELY LOVE thredUP. Website is set up nicely. Being able to shop and throw items in your cart and get back to the same area you were viewing, is HUGE. If you're thinkin about checking the app out, you should, It is definitely worth it.... especially now, if you are not one that is wanting to roam around stores.",5
7426,Thredup itself is awesome. Love the concept and eco friendly nature of purchasing secondhand clothes. The app needs a lot of work. Links from email never open correctly in the app and the UI is very non-user friendly.,3
7427,"I just actually installed this app, so I don't know what it is all about just yet, besides clothes and shoes 👟 for woman 👠 and kids so I am excited to see what it's all about one day I will be possibly making a purchase of some clothes or shoes 👟 if there is any need for it. 5/19/21",5
7428,Easy-to-use and search,3
7429,"Started out great and then quality is bad, I order Women's size 18 pants and get children's clothes, the quality of several of the shirts I received was worse than yard sell products and when you try to reach the chat feature it is always down and emails never returned",5
7430,"Thredup seemed cool at first, but with all the fees for times I've had to return something that was extra long or a different color than it looked in the picture or just an odd shape, the money I've spent has dwindled down and I've basically paid thredup $50 to try on clothes.",3
7431,Good quality. Fast. Good prices and easy returns,5
7432,This company is using scam. A discusting way to take advantage an lie to people.,1
7433,Very nice clean fast,5
7434,"If you're into unique/boutique styles I'd suggest this app. The prices are very reasonable. And besides, if you develop a habit you can always sell them back 😆. The Luxe category is a must,full of designer apparel! I wish they had watches...",4
7435,Great selections for less cost and easy way to shop.,5
7436,Don't expect too much! Also you need to expect to wait a long time to recieve your items you order!! I was not impressed.,2
7437,Wish I could see all my saved searches but generally works great.,4
7438,"The best online shopping I've ever experienced. Easy returns,easy ordering and environmentally earth saving. Oh the prices,clothing and shoes are unbeatable!Join and see for yourself!",5
7439,The update is terrible. Hardly ever opens. Needs fixed.,1
7440,"90% of the entire ""Current Elliott"" denim stock is mislabeled. Almost every pair of jeans is described as having measurements so absurdly incorrect that it borders on the ridiculous. It's sad, really. The platform was a welcome change from its competitors, but as faux pas go this one is too large to snap back from. In response to thredups reply: Denying it won't make it go away and it strips away any confidence that you're invested in your buyers experience. Look at your inventory!",1
7441,"I love your app , I see so many clothes I want but I have get rid of a bunch of my clothes first. The prices are very good.The app was very easy to use. Very easy...",5
7442,"App is easy to navigate, but they have some nerve using the word 'thrift.'",3
7443,"Great app, clothes well priced",5
7444,"Great deals, some cute finds, sometimes hard to find my size. Overall, I love Thredup!",4
7445,So do they not have items for men i mean I know it says for women and children but wouldn't they make more money if they openedup to selling towards men?,1
7446,I love thredup! I find so many great deals on here and returns are so easy.,5
7447,I love the store online. So far I haven't been able to use the app. It keeps crashing.,2
7448,Great app to find name brand clothes at a great price.,5
7449,Such great deals! Got a whole work wardrobe from them!,5
7450,I have found some great deals at threadup. The quality I find is always very good. And the sizes are true to size so always read the chart they provide for you.,4
7451,Absolutely LOVE this app. Easy return policy if not satisfied with your purchase. Wonderful selection and prices!,5
7452,"The clothing arrives promptly and so far is 100% as described. Be sure you carefully measure because recently purchased a top that was way too short. The pic of the item on a dummy can be deceiving. Handbags are especially hard to guage and my first one purchased was also too small. Don't ""eyeball"" it... measure!!",4
7453,They say you can use affirm for smaller monthly payments but then di not offer you the option when your checking out and just grabs your payment without even getting your credit card number. It says you used pay pal when i never even touched that option. Very sneaky,1
7454,Love the styles love some of the prices but most of all i love to pick and save my fabs.,5
7455,Hands down favorite app to buy clothes on. If you know how to search you can find incredible pieces at thrift store price or better... I've especially loved using the app during COVID where I'm not as comfortable going into thrift stores anymore :),5
7456,It's been great,4
7457,Why don't you just let me create a username and password why do you assume that everybody has already been on this site I haven't this is too much trouble I'm not calling support I'm just done installing you,2
7458,Not interested in something that repeatedly shows up after I close it out.,1
7459,Absolutely fab choices. Love thredUP!,5
7460,It was Great,5
7461,"I found a skirt for $12.99 with a beautiful pattern, and the app was super convenient. However, shipping was $6, so I wound up paying $20 including tax. When it arrived, the skirt smelled and needed to be washed. Also, there was about 3 inches of stitching missing at the waist. Both problems are fixable, but I wish I had known about them. I should have stuck with my local thrift stores.",3
7462,Excellent,5
7463,Once app .,5
7464,Love it!!!,5
7465,great so farwell 9y,5
7466,Awesome! Can't wait to get my clothes and shop for my children in the future! Second hand is the way to go 💪,5
7467,I have had 3 incorrect orders. Either the items are not as described or I get the wrong items. They tell me no storing fee because it's their fault...then change the fee and shipping. I requested a refund but they give me a credit to their site. There is no real person to speak with. This site is a SCAM. Buyers beware,1
7468,See,5
7469,Nothing for age differences. These are for 15 to 30 year old. Nothing as lead to believe for everyone.,1
7470,This app has nothing for kids,1
7471,I was really excited to get a jacket in till I actually got it and it had crusted up old food stuck all over the sleeve. You go through all your products and only keep a certain percentage of top notch items? That's a joke.,1
7472,When I tried to order it took several tryst and I had to talk to customer service,3
7473,"Slow! Was my original reaction, however they really redeemed themselves. I am changing review to 5 stars :) i got almost 20 bucks for all the clothes i sent in so far, and with the coupon code and points racked up i was able to purchase two cute brand name shirts for 3 bucks, shipping included. Not bad! I'm actually pretty stoked and plan to continue ordering clean out kits and redeeming for stuff i want! All my ""someday when I'm skinnier"" clothes and my ""just in case i gain weight"" ones? Bye!",5
7474,Their practice has changed. I feel as though it is abusive. The fact that I have to pay you to get my items back is unfair to me. Even though I paid for return in shipping already .,1
7475,"Especially love getting a free, prepaid-shipping-label bag to send in my clothes! Only wish they had a men's category. Updated to drop a star. I've used thredUP for several years, but I've had several disappointing experiences in the past year. The app is amazing, and the customer service is great. But I've received several ""like new, excellent condition"" items with stains or holes. It's usually reimbursed without too much fuss, but it's getting old. Your 12 point inspection is failing.",3
7476,Great find while helping the environment!!,4
7477,"I love Thredup and was using the website for a while. I just recently started using the app. It's very user-friendly, and chatting with customer service has always been very easy and they're extremely helpful. I would highly recommend.",5
7478,"I've had one order delivered so far and an overwhelming experience. The app is easy to navigate and start using, and all the clothing arrived fast and is just as described... I have some new winter outfits I just love! Several months later... STILL love!",5
7479,"At first I liked to buy and send in my items for credit until I sent in some brand name boots and they never showed up in my account or for sale or anything, they really disappeared....",3
7480,I just love this app. They have a huge variety of clothes at great prices. I also like how they have the actual measurements of every piece of clothes.,5
7481,"Easy to use, great stuff, I'm hooked!!",4
7482,Clothes come clean with out smell,4
7483,"So-so. The website was always giving me trouble, so I finally moved to the app and it crashes so much that it makes the website issues more bearable. Other than that, I can't really complain. Still love ThredUP, but I think they need to hire better tech support and coders for their app and website.",3
7484,Found lots of cool items. Some not so much. Either way they are very easy to work with.,5
7485,"Great deals on new and used clothing,shoes,coats,and purses. Have bought many great items from here. Mainly purses hard to find purses and best prices.",5
7486,Awesome,5
7487,Nothing to complain about...!!,5
7488,Love the selection and quality,5
7489,"There could be better photos of the clothes. I'd like to see close up photos of fabrics or details. The clothes measurements are usually accurate. I've had no issue returning clothes within the given timeframe, if clothes don't fit. I usually search for clothes with tags or excellent condition and they turn out fine.",4
7490,"I love it. Better than doing flea markets and lugging bins back and forth, setting up, or standing out in crazy whether. Easiest way to make cash off old clothes and recycle responsibly. Not to mention i can use my balance for new clothes. Refreshing my closet is so affordable.",5
7491,Great variety to choose f,4
7492,Kennedy nen,5
7493,I love love this app.,5
7494,Clothes fit to size. Something for every budget,5

7498,It's simple and has good options. I love it,5
7499,Costumer support doesn't answer,1
7500,I wish I would have found this website earlier I love it ! 😀 I never realized how much of my closet was filled but not being used.,5
7501,App is really easy to use. You can easily sort for what you want.,5
7502,A ton of options,5
7503,Love the prices snd great clothing,5
7504,"great items available. customer service is great, app functions well. the only change I would make is improvement of the search function to better fit categories searched for.",4
7505,Best way to shop ever and I can choose my colors and styles first.,5
7506,Easy to use,5
7507,Love this app!,5
7508,The clothing is well worth the price and to the size that you order. My package arrived in a timely manner.,5
7509,I've only bought items and I like it so far!,5
7510,Honestly can't beat it!,5
7511,Love this idea. Even works well ladies!!!!!! ❤️,5
7512,"Don't shop if you're goal was to save more and spend less. The shipping charge, with how long it takes and the lack of update on tracking orders is ridiculous. I spent less at regular retail and got more. Another scam. 😒 im sure they have great deals and coupons but you're already used items. Just sell it for the price it's worth and give updates on order tracking.",1
7513,"Good,but a few things are not as described",4
7514,First order was okay. Second order it crashed everytime I tried to checkout with a ctedit card more than 10 times but was fine for paypal or affirm. Cart will expire b4 I wake up. Wasted 3 hrs hunting and not being able to purchsse. Deleting from phone!,1
7515,Take way to long to refund money or give you credit. You have to wait a month. Thanks for the feed back but know I have to send somthing else back. I wanted a few other things that were bought by other customers because I waited over a month for a refund. Maybe when it's scanned by the post office give refund or credit. Out of my hands once it's at the postoffice.,1
7516,love love it,5
7517,I struggled to find a clothing store to match my style and here I have every style and cheaper and for good cause. Winner.,5
7518,Fun to shop,5
7519,Great selection in every size I am looking for especially since the covic my weight has been going up lol its nice to have choices with this great app 🤗😃👌💯,5
7520,"Very cool, great app, slow shipping, but good finds",5
7521,"Great selection, free shipping options. Can bundle and ship. Amazing",5
7522,Great!,4
7523,"Just got started, say more when I see how it goes.",5
7524,Easy to use!,5
7525,ThredUp has improved a lot in the last couple years. Much more enjoyable to shop now!,5
7526,I had a complaint and ThredUP quickly resolved it. But Thredup still takes way too long to process returns and register app credits. I just received credit for an April return today and only after protesting.,4
7527,awesome,4
7528,Overall my experience has been the best. Just didn't get my last order. I will shop again here. Just hope I get my next order,3
7529,I wish they had more coupons so I can buy in bulk more often cause im seriously OBSESSED with this site. I look through their clothes all the time. Wish they had a store or two or even to visit the wearhouse to physically see the products. Also wish they say jeans can be super high rise/high waist.,5
7530,This is a really cool way to enhance your wardrobe and feel like you are doing something good for the environment. Only downside is it can take a while to actually get the items you order ..,4
7531,Great and easy to use app for my favorite thrift store! I love thrift shopping in the store but this is a safer option duri g the pandemic - and I may be a convert for life.,5
7532,I love that everything I purchased is basically new with tags and each item was discounted. I bought 8 items and it was less than $100 dollars. Plus the things I bought were name brands. I am very happy with my purchases like I have said and I will continue ordering.,5
7533,"I am always looking for a great deal, I find it here. THANKS",4
7534,"Love the experience and merch...have had trouble getting kicked off the site and having to go back and start over.This does happen often.With this type if business, they are the best out there.",4
7535,"Im unable to order from the app. It simply closes when i tryto check out. I tried getting on the site from the browser instead of ordering from the app and it won't accept my password. When i try to change my password it times out three moment i click the link. Needles to say im giving them the lowest rating. I've closed the app, updated, restarted my phone- nothing allows me to order clothing. I literaly am trying everything to give them my money.",1
7536,Saved money on great iteams,5
7537,"It's been months and I have not seen any profits for my merchandise, not even a cash pay out.",1
7538,This app is the best! Unlike when I buy things in person I get things I actually want and need and unlike shopping on other online sites I get it for a great price! Ten out of ten recommend!,5
7539,Easy to shop. Easy to finds exactly what I am looking for.,5
7540,"Great app, it works pretty well, it makes it easy to shop!",5
7541,This app has everything i need,5
7542,Not disappointed. Thats why I shop there a lot.Its now 2021 and i still feel the same about Thred Up,5
7543,Very buggy. Impossible to sign in using Amazon and even Google sign in doesn't always work.,2
7544,EVERYTHING IS IN AMAZING CONDITION AND IT ARRIVES LIKE THEY SAY I'M VERY PLEASED,5
7545,This is by far my very favorite clothing subscription I love drifting in general but since covid it's been hard to get out to the shops and you can't tie anything on due to the dressing rooms being closed so this works perfect being able to try them at home and then send back what you don't want very pleased with this service!!!!,5
7546,Every time I try to enter my payment information the app crashes,1
7547,"Easy to navigate, good pictures of front and back of all items, though a little hard to see some pictures of black items. I like the suggestions for me.",5
7548,Horrible! I spent $200.00 on items that were fake merchandize. They tell you its 100% real and find out its fake. Leather wallets should not crack or split but mine did. Then customer service called me a lier. Stay away from these cheats! I found everything I bought on clearance rack at Kohl's. Lesson learned!,1
7549,"Why offer a birthday code, show the reduced price of an item before I put it in the cart if I did use the coupon, then when I apply coupon code, says it doesn't apply to the items I've chosen?. I get it doesn't combine offers and can change last min according to the terms. However, to show me the birthday code discount prior to adding to cart and then saying it doesn't apply to the item, is false hopes for consumer and poor business. Done with your overpriced used clothes.",1
7550,There is a large selection and the prices are good,5
7551,"Pleasantly surprised by the quality and condition of the clothes marked ""new and like new."" I was not disappointed with any of my items. When you set up your account, the easy to navigate app shows only those items in your size so you don't have to wonder if it's available in your size. Highly recommend.",5
7552,Ugly,1
7553,"I enjoy shopping using ThredUP, however the app frequently gives me no results until I clear out my sizes. Then I am able reenter them and get the results I want. It is annoying but I can work around it.",4
7554,"ThredUP is the best app to shop eco-friendly. I particularly enjoy the customization in sizes, where all your browsing items are for your only size. This makes it easier to shop.",5
7555,"Sent in a box with a very expensive purse inside. No longer doing totes, so I thought I could get something that I carry now. Anyway, my designer tote (Hermes) has disappeared! They didn't accept it? They donated it?! No! It went home with whomever opened the box! What a rip off! Don't sale to these people!!!",1
7556,Great! Best way to save money while upgrading your wardrobe.,5
7557,"Getting worse every purchase!! Things are clearly not what they say they are. Worn clothing when they said are new with tags, wrong cut when the label says what it is, holding my sale items for MONTHS! They can't seem to find my return for their mistakes.. just a ness",1
7558,I have got beautiful items from this they have a wide variety brand names some still have tags I highly recommend this app,5
7559,Enjoy shopping and using Lil money,5
7560,Love this App!!,5
7561,"You search for ""maternity"" and they show you nothing but scarves. You filter ""under $5"" and they show you $8+, with some under 5 scattered in. Fix your search",1
7562,Fun,5
7563,Horrible app to use,1
7564,Cool,5
7565,I order 3 tops . And I totally love them. Thank you so much. I will order more things. And I told all my friends. And I know they will order stuff too. Thanks again,5
7566,"Mostly love it! But the measurements are sometimes off, and they really need to add hip measurements in their clothes. Sometimes the chest area fits but because I have wide hips some tops get too tight. I keep returning things I wouldn't have ordered in the first place if they were measured properly. But I guess they don't care cos they make you pay a restocking fee per clothing. That part is dumb too.",4
7567,Not prices for this type of app.,1
7568,Best way to shop quality consignment. Not sure why I hadn't been doing it this way earlier...,5
7569,"I've had a great time browsing thru the wonderful clothes they offer. It constantly changes and you don't feel your looking at the same thing. I've ordered clothing and shoes which I love. Everything I've ordered looked new, even though several were gently used in the description. I've just put another order in and it is nice to be able to get items that I would not be able to find locally.",5
7570,"Is okay. Issue is that notifications are not clickable in app. So I wont know which Merona pants has dropped in price or which Zara dress to snag, for example. Some search results also do not allow filtering. So I cannot filter through the list results from ""look for something similar"" , for example.",3
7571,Love this. My only suggestion would be to add filters to the Favorites tab. Please and thank you.,5
7572,"So l ordered seven summertime type outfits from Young, Broke and Fabulous and Free People. I haven't received everything,but what I have has been pretty amazing. And seven rompers/dresses from the above brands for less than $65. Need I say more?",5
7573,Just very HAPPY with it and the receipe,5
7574,👍,5
7575,"I really don't like this App because their customer service sucks. The first time I bought two garments from them, they were peeling and had stain, then the second time I bought another item, they sent me a wrong item and still wanted me to pay for the shipping to return it and also pay for restocking... bad bad bad!",1
7576,Lame,3
7577,Tried this company out. Very disappointed. Item that I received was not as described. Will not order from them again.,1
7578,You had me at used swim suits...nope !,2
7579,Handbags that I bought are not real name brands. It says made in China on the tags. Shouldn't advertise as name brand. My first time buying and last time.,1
7580,I'm loving it can't wait to see my first purchase,5
7581,Wonderful,5
7582,I am obsessed with ThredUp!,5
7583,I find everything I'm looking for and save tons of money,5
7584,I just love ThredUp!,5
7585,Well I can't really say anything yet because I haven't received my order yet. Will rate later.,4
7586,It doesnt open most of the time. Only opens once in a while. Never ever is opened on my first try.,1
7587,"Great app, user friendly!",5
7588,Great,5
7589,This is truly one of my favorite apps out there. Not only do I buy but I also sell and it is so easy! Please give thredUP a try because if you are like me and have a HUGE INVENTORY of clothes and it's time to move on this is PERFECT for you! Also I just came out Transgender and thredUP has helped stocked my closet with some of the cutest clothes! ps... returns are ridiculously easy as well! LOVE 💕💕💕💕💕 thredUP,5
7590,Obsessed. Can not wait for my curated box!!,5
7591,Easy to use. Very stable app for my phone.,4
7592,I only just made my first purchase but so far everything is great!,5
7593,"Love this app!! I can find styles here that I cannot find other sites. The shipping is fast. I think sustainability is important for the world, and this site allows me to be part of the solution.",5
7594,Love this store. It has great stuff for good prices,5
7595,"Hit & miss at best. This is a rating based on the service and reliability overall. -The returns process is not as easy as its presented -Description of the condition of clothing items are not always accurate; items I've received have had stains, marks, and even holes yet they were described as ""... in excellent condition. You might mistake it for brand new"" -Shipping can be delayed... 7-10 business days is normal, but it can be longer -Product photos are limited to two views, front and back",3
7596,"I love the variety of clothes, accessories, and other items are a variety of prices. I got workout clothes on one order and a designer jumpsuit on another.",5
7597,👍,5
7598,"I was a satisfied thredUP customer for a year or so. I made 2 or 3 purchases of many items and had a credit in my account of about $120. Then the credit disappeared and I have sent at least 4 messages to Customer Service regarding this matter and they have NEVER replied. I'd give less than 1 star if it was an option. This company has stolen my money and has refused for a couple years to address this. Better Business Bureau, here I come.",1
7599,Thred up uses shady business practices to dupe customers into not making it easy to use their granted discounts and also making it hard to cancel goody box.,1
7600,"Great brands, great prices, quick delivery....can't stop shopping!",5
7601,Love it,5
7602,Great clothes for great prices.,5
7603,Very fun and I save money!,5
7604,"Love this!! I bought a goody box and individual items all in great condition. I love how easy it is to search and browse, and save your favorites. When something is sold or unavailable, they show similar items instead. So much to choose from 👍 2021 Edit: would love the addition of an automatic My Sizes filter when the SHOP SIMILAR option is chosen!",5
7605,There are no items for 2x to 5x sizes for women. Not everyone is xlarge and under. I was really disappointed.,1
7606,Very good selection. Kind of hard to find your right size but I did eventually.,4
7607,Love,5
7608,Perfect Service! Very Addicting and always find what I am looking for.,5
7609,"I can't speak for selling experience, but this is an awesome place to shop. I've found so many great deals on here(lots of top designer brands for 40-80% off).",5
7610,"The experience was great, although I don't think they should sell clothes with stains or holes in them for as much as they do. If the stains don't come out I think they should be under 7.00, that's how I feel. But happy with my orders and thread up it's a great way to shop.",4
7611,Over the past year and a half I've been shopping with thread up and I'm obsessed. It's a great way to get to see different styles clothing as well as your own and take your time choosing. Great selection of name brands primarily name brands which is nice higher end to your everyday. I do recommend reading dimensions in the column below in the description of your item is looking at to buy dimensions to change after laundering and sometimes are a bit smaller. I absolutely love Thread up shopping.,5
7612,"So many options to choose from!! The lists go on and on. I like going to resale stores and thrift shops anyways, so this app is perfect and you never have to leave the house. Only problem is you can't fully inspect wear on the items. The pictures make the clothes look so good that when I received the items, some of them had enough wear on them for me to not want them. But the best part is they are cheep anyways and if you really want to send them back, you can.",4
7613,"LOVE this site!! The app offers the best way to search ThredUp's enormous inventory. There is not enough information about fit or style. UPDATE: Still love shopping 2nd hand, but I'm losing patience with useless descriptions. Measurements are not accurate, so don't bother. Descriptions are random, e.g., I tried ordering straight leg jeans twice. Both times when I got the jeans they literally had ""skinny"" or ""skinny leg"" printed right inside the waistband. It's a grab bag.",1
7614,Sometimes gets glitchty with the applied filters not updating but otherwise smooth running app.,4
7615,Wonderful!,5
7616,Love it,5
7617,Great shopping with you.,5
7618,Great prices for great clothes. Took off a star for photos. Only 2 mediocre pics and you cannot zoom in.,4
7619,PERFECTION!!!!,5
7620,The only reason I lije it is they have brand new items in the stores with the orginal receipt,5
7621,"I love that you earn reward points, I wish they would make it so you could extend your cart time.",5
7622,"Takes forever to find clothes that will fit and that I like (but I like it when I do). Seems like I spend hours scrolling through clothes that won't fit (one brand's XL has a 50"" bust and another one's is 28"") or the same ugly to I've scrolled past six times this search session alone. Wish I could sort by measurements, since they're measuring the clothes anyway (except waist on pants??), and wish I could say that I'm not interested in a garment & stop seeing it.",3
7623,Never received my order and no one responded when I informed thredUP.,1
7624,It takes forever to load when you first get in the app. I cant even shop with out waiting forever!!!,1
7625,Please be aware of this company. They're goodie box is really deceptive. I am being charged for the full amount when I returned it two days after receiving it. They said they never received the box which I delivered it directly to UPS. This is a really deceptive practice I would not do business with this company.,1
7626,Love it! Awesome clothes. Prices are alright. Overall its cool. I'm a fanatic with this app.,5
7627,Real easy to use and great prices!,5
7628,Nice to find clothes in my size..,5
7629,Like the fact that I am doing my part to help save the earth by buying used from thredUp while saving money.,5
7630,A ton of clothes for very little,5
7631,I'll never buy retail again!,5
7632,"I orderd from them 1 time 1pair hightop wedge tennis, 1pr Roman wedge sandles both were ordered 8 & half, shipment was late, tennis shoes were 9 & half, Roman sandals were around 5 or 6, if you cant trust the people who are sending you garments and shoes without worring whether youre going to have to send it all back whats the point?? They send advertisements to me, I can get the same service locally now, covid has changed things, a lot of things in very many ways.",1
7633,I searched for bags and purses and it literally kept knocking me off the app so I closed all my tabs including the app and literally it still wouldn't work 1 star,1
7634,Love the stuff on this app and good prices,5
7635,Every order has been prompt and perfect I absolutely love this app,5
7636,Fun and enjoyable way to shop with lots of options IN MY SIZE.,5
7637,Well my first orders are coming in. I received a coral dress that is not what I ordered not worth shipping back. I also asked for a kit to sell some items. We will see how goes. So far here we are!,3
7638,Great prices and a good variety of brands!,5
7639,Can't find what I need 😐 and the cloths are so dam expensive 😭 don't recommend.,1
7640,Great way to be eco conscious... love it! Great clothes with easy returns!,5
7641,Dont use,1
7642,"I ordered in the plus size and got slack for an anorexic, closing this like now",1
7643,Easiest consignment shopping ever.,5
7644,Absolutely love thread up♡,5
7645,They only have women and children clothes...,1
7646,I love this app. This site is amazing!,5
7647,What's this app,1
7648,Woo-hoo!,5
7649,Can't find what I ask for,3
7650,I have been using this app forever!! I absolutely love ThredUp!!! They have such good deals The only complaint I have is the Search engine within the app should be easier to use. Other than that I recommend this to everyone!!,5
7651,I change my mind about tred up. They are a lier and are deceitful . I sent them over a year ago a big bag of clothes to sell. I stillhavent heard from them despite the many time of trying to get a hold of them many times with no reponce from them. I know they hff ave some of my clothes on the web that are for sale. DONT TRUST THIS APP. I WILL NEVER SEND THEM ANYMORE OF MY CHOTHES DUE TO THEM RIPPING ME OFF. I WILL TELL THE WORLD WITH THEY HAVE DONE TO ME!!!,2
7652,So far l can't complain!,5
7653,App is clean and easy-to-use with lots of granular notification options to jump on your favorites. It's really fun to scroll through and buy. Occasionally the app freezes a bit but mostly it's very responsive.,4
7654,"When I got the clothes I purchased they had stains on them, even though they were advertused as ""brand new"". Will not be ordering from here again.",1
7655,Love it very nice clothes.,5
7656,Great clothes and prices,5
7657,So far I love this app!,5
7658,The clean out bag process is flawed and needs improvement. The only way your items are sorted right away is if you select an expedite option and it is not clear in email which option is selected.,3
7659,Lots to choose from... sometimes it can be overwhelming. I hope the descriptions are accurate so I don't need to return items & pay restocking fees.,4
7660,Returns are a nightmare! Then even when the description or measurements are incorrect they still charge you a processing fee. Unacceptable!,1
7661,Awesome,5
7662,I click in it and it wont even let me shop: it would probably be good if I could even look to see what they had!!!,1
7663,Not as good as posh,3
7664,Too many fees.,3
7665,Meh,3
7666,I love this APp,5
7667,Easy and convenient! Prices are reasonable and returns are easy!,5
7668,"I absolutely love this site, so easy to use and it arrives in less than 2wks!",5
7669,"The app works fine but ordering from ThredUp has become an increasingly frustrating and not-worthwhile experience. Items not ordered from my ""home warehouse"" are taking over three weeks to arrive because ThredUp uses the cheapest FedEx shipping option. And don't even attempt to contact customer service - the reps are rude and unhelpful. I have been a customer for many years but the ""deals"" (which aren't even that great any more) aren't worth the hassle. I'm switching over to Depop.",1
7670,Fun and addictive site! Great quality items.,5
7671,Dumbest return policy I've ever seen. 3 sets of fees which leaves me receiving no return at all. I'll never use it again,1
7672,I love that I can reserve my items and favorite them so I can see when something is sold. I haven't received the order yet but excited to see my first order.,5
7673,"Amazing Finds, Great Deals!",5
7674,"Love this company and what their message is about! I think there are a lot of great finds here and I'm happy with how the process works. As far as the app is concerned it gets difficult finding things that might fit. It would be a LOT more helpful to search by measurements instead of S,M,L,XL or at least having that choice. I believe that would make shopping a lot easier. ***I appreciate the response and much improved app update. Excited to shop again!",4
7675,So excited to see my polka dot box arrive!,4
7676,"This app would be a lot better is using the filters actually worked... I tried looking up backpacks, satchels, and crossbody bags and got coin purses... also wish we could search by fabric types like sheer or velvet.",4
7677,Love this app. I have placed quite a few orders now and everything has been in perfect condition.,5
7678,Great shopping experience and I love thrifting here. Recent issues like trouble opening and bombing out hopefully just need bug fixes.,4
7679,Really enjoying the variety of search options to narrow down what I'm looking for. Nice when I'm notified when there is a sale and when my items have shipped.,5
7680,VERY GOOD AND I LOVE AND NEED THE SHOES AND CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH.,5
7681,Very easy to navegate website. Have a variety of everything at affordable prices. Just love it!!,5
7682,"I'm happy with the mk tote and shirt ,true to the look of picture",5
7683,Amazing! just give it a goodie box try... you will understand,5
7684,No mens section only boys,1
7685,Not the greatest place to buy clothes. People can get away with selling ripped items and items that are supposedly new look worn. There needs to be higher standards for selling. The pictures are not good nor are the descriptions.,2
7686,Super awesome find! It's great when you're tight on money but need some clothes for work or school.,5
7687,unwanted emails,1
7688,"Seriously love this app. Too much. I was weary..especially when I opted in for the goody box...all but 3 items didn't fit, and I'm hard to find clothes for at 5'2 105 , 23/24 waist. I'm addicted. Help!",5
7689,"The only thing I wish for is the ability to shop using key words. Like, I filtered to swim suits, but I just wanted to look through bikini bottoms to match a top I found. I had to scroll through things I wasn't interested in. But everything else, I love!",4
7690,Merchandise is easily visible and easy to call up. Great order tracking and account info readily available.,4
7691,"Easy to use, fair prices, good shipping!",5
7692,Love all the options,5
7693,"I would give this company & app a 5 star, but the downside is the wait on shipping. Some items may come fast where others you forget you even ordered by the time it arrives. But the prices, description, & the diversity of items is awesome!! I love finding new clothing at a great price. Allows individuals to try new styles & not break the bank.",4
7694,I shop weekly for everything i need. Have for a long yime and never had a problem. Love this place!,5
7695,Clothes are way too expensive.,1
7696,Hate paying full price. Quality items for a fraction of the price. App works great,5
7697,"I have had hours of pleasurable shopping here! From simple basics in jewel colors, prices under $5, to fab designer's at deeply cut prices! The site flows perfectly (imagine that!) Easy payment options! I'm addicted!",5
7698,Great app. I just wish the click able emails took you to that particular item instead of the home of the app.,5
7699,Exceptional products. I have made MANY purchases.,5
7700,Excellent !,5
7701,Good clothes for reasonable prices and rare items that you csnt find nowhere else,5
7702,"I love shopping at ThreadUp. It is just as easy as shopping anywhere else (actually the return process is easier than many other web stores), there are lots of clothes in excellent condition and Quality. I love it and shop most of my clothes here. Only small complaint is that I often have to restart the app as it freezes. Otherwise I can only recommend ThreadUp",4
7703,Love how easy they make it to find what you need for your closet while thrifting and being good to mama earth,5
7704,Good stuff!,5
7705,Eventful,5
7706,Not for me....🤦🏾‍♀️,2
7707,Yesm,3
7708,"I might have given a 5 star review, but I saw the 29 waist, which works. But I did not see the length. I received 27"" length. I wear 33 in. I will be cutting them into shorts, because they are so short, yet fit my waist.",4
7709,Bought clothes and boots on Thredup it was worth it!,5
7710,I love this site. Their clothes are super cute and has so many options to choose from. I don't shop anywhere else.,5
7711,"I love ThredUp but this app needs some work. I love when it notifies me that something is now x amount cheaper but then I click on the push notification and it takes me to the app home screen and not to the item that was reduced in price! Also when tracking items through my email when the order opens it takes me to the home page instead of the tracking information or order information. Basically, you can only enter the app via the home page and that kinda sucks.",3
7712,"Great way to thrift, buying and selling. It's so organized and easy to use. Filter by size, brand, color, etc... Love this app!",5
7713,"I was raised on thrifting, so this is awesome! Sometimes the filters fail suddenly while scrolling.",4
7714,"The company and the concept are great but the app needs work. It often doesn't load correctly and the search function doesn't work well unless you want to search a specific brand, you can't search specific items of clothing like 'purple t-shirt' and get any accurate results.",4
7715,I love buying clothes from here. They are always in great shape. Plus if I have ever had any problems they take care of it pretty quickly.,5
7716,"Seriously, my most favorite store to order from!!!!! Absolutely no problems with my orders and I love coming home and seeing a polka dot box delivered to my door!!!!!! Would rate higher if I could!!!!",5
7717,FAA5a deer deer esxexc,4
7718,"Highly addicting!! Too easy to navigate!! Love it!! Found many high end fashions i would have never owned because of high end pricing! Ive gotten all of my fitness clothes (with many compliments) from thredup. Some lulu lemon and many others! Also a dress that stole the floor, for my sons wedding recently. Did mention, i love this site! Too easy for me to navigate!",5
7719,If you love helping the planet and fashion you are going to love this app! I get all my thrifty goodies here!!,5
7720,Several options.. seems like nice clothes.,5
7721,"I sent 2 BIG SACKS of clothes, shoes, jewelry, flip flops. JOHNNY WAS, BRIGHTON,MICHAEL KORS, ALL NAME BEAND ITEMS. NEVER received 1 dime or anything back. You cant talk to anyone on the phone!!! So I just gave them around $3,000.00 worth of merchandise & never a penny! I am furious with this company! DO NOT SEND ANYTHING TO THEM BECAUSE CHANCES R YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF LIKE I WAS! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I CANT BELIEVE THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS. IF YOU KNOW WHO I CAN REPORT THEM TO PLEASE POST!",1
7722,Don't use this app if you're a guy,1
7723,Great deals! Cute clothes! Awesome staff!,5
7724,Waiting on my first order. Great prices!,5
7725,Great experience,5
7726,Obsessed with ordering off of here! Every time I get a new package I'm already waiting for my next order !,5
7727,Love this app!,5
7728,Very easy to shop and I love the prices,5
7729,I've enjoyed my experience on thredup but it has a few issues. It's difficult to order clothes from all different brands because sizing is very inconsistent. I wish measurements on items were more thorough and available on every item. The return window is very short so I have a few pieces that are entirely the wrong size even though everything is listed as a medium.,3
7730,Love the app and the store,5
7731,They are very truthful about the condition of the clothing and the delivery is fast and accurate.,5
7732,A plus sized women's dresses please,5
7733,"Love the company! I typically order a goody box, works very well for me. The app is a little slow",4
7734,Love the prices .the shipping is high.but got slot of nice,4
7735,"Fabulous Idea. Zillions to choose from. Saving the planet. Packaged with care. Custom Service responds swiftly and sincerely. Product clean and in great like new condition. The app sometimes doesn't load or if you turn your phone sideways and back to vertical it kicks you out of your search, but minor problems that are totally worth this new way to shop and save and by save I mean lots of money and the planet more importantly.",4
7736,it great,4
7737,Cool.,5
7738,Its great shopping from home,5
7739,Love it,5
7740,Love this app!,5
7741,Very happy with purchases! Clothes came exactly as description stated.,5
7742,Love everything i see,5
7743,I love it! I keep ordering more stuff!,5
7744,I just installed the app just to give a 1 star rating... I saw that it said only for woman and kids... Maybe add a men section when making a app idiots,1
7745,Loving it so far. No issues. Just sweet deals.,5
7746,Best clothes for the best price.,5
7747,Great clothes,5
7748,Found too many things to be good for my wallet!,5
7749,I have enjoyed this app.,5
7750,"Navigating the app is great. Only complaints is no option to sort favorites and the push notifications are meaningless (does not direct to the item mentioned, only to the app front page).",4
7751,Sooo easy to use - clothing is displayed really nicely - so I ordered! makes me want to come back,5
7752,"Customer service is great, company policy's suck. I returned several items nearly a month ago and I still don't have my refund. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time and money, and I have no idea if I'll see my refund anytime soon. I'll stick to Plato's Closet and Goodwill.",2
7753,Haven't had any experience since installing the new update info.,5
7754,App is great! Easy to use and straight forward. Just received my first order and I couldn't be happier!,5
7755,"Great prices, great experiences!",5
7756,I downloaded this app it wouldn't load. I Uninstalled and tried it again. No luck.,1
7757,Buying is great selling is TERRIBLE! I sent out a bag in November and they finally processed in February. The items I sold made about $176 dollars of that I made $5 and some change! According to them I had the potential to make $17 (oh hell no) then there's a fee of 10.99 charged before you even make money so my take home is a little over 5 dollars. I would make more selling all of my items for a dollar at a garage sale smh.,1
7758,"So far a good experience. Have been using for a few years by selling my clothes for store credit and buying from the app. Lots of really nice gently used, and sometimes new, items in a range of sizes! Sometimes tracking doesn't keep up and processing of clean-out bags takes a while. App overall works really well.",4
7759,Fantastic...I love the app and I love how 98% of items I bought fit!!!! The prices are reasonable. Bring on more sales!!!,5
7760,Great experience,5
7761,Great,3
7762,I ordered a several shorts that were described as high rise. They were not high rise. Just wondering how you are measuring that because it's not quite accurate.,2
7763,Yall dont have men waer sad sad sad,1
7764,I love it. I've purchased several different items and have been satisfied with each one.,5
7765,Fast shipping...accurate descriptions...great prices :),5
7766,My favorite shopping app! So convenient to purchase from home and they are really good about returns. I also like that I can send in my clothes to make money or to donate!,5
7767,Not getting my credits,3
7768,"This place great!! Great clothes, great prices!!",5
7769,"I don't know if anyone else noticed this but they got rid of some of the filters (style, sleeve length, etc) and that was one of my favorite things about this app. That I could search specifically for long sleeve, v-neck shirts or for dresses for a wedding guest or something. Wish they'd bring that functionality back.",3
7770,Nice stuff,5
7771,It was easygoing.,5
7772,I absolutely love this app!! I have been doing majority of my shopping on here.,5
7773,"Extensive selection, easy to check status of orders, easy to save searches, easy to return items if they don't fit as expected. All items that I have received have been in great condition and just as pictured! Awesome app & awesome store!",5
7774,I love the cute clothes and the amazing prices!,5
7775,Great search options once criteria identified.,5
7776,Very satisfied Thanks,5
7777,Love the selection! App is easy to navigate.,5
7778,ThredUp is great. My experience shopping with them has nothing but enjoyable. The prices are very affordable. They have everything your looking for hard to find to everyday items. I'm have been highly impressed. Thank You ThredUp,5
7779,Great,5

7783,"Shopping by internet. I love it ! Clothes and etc are very good handbags are lovely, shoes clothes , try it now !",5
7784,Everything was in great shape!,5
7785,"Great way to acquire interesting clothes without the price tag, and help the planet. App works well. Have to go to desktop to get additional clothing fibers and condition.",5
7786,"Easy shopping, low prices!",5
7787,"Best clothes, best prices!",5
7788,I love the uniqueness of clothes,4
7789,In the last YEAR I've ONLY purchased from thredUP ♡ nuff said,5
7790,Thred up is great!!! I love it!!! 🙃,5
7791,"The best app the only way i ever want to shop now Highly efficient and benefits both environment and community My new *not ""guilty"" but almost ""dignified"" pleasure* & habitual habit thats great for the habitat.",5
7792,"I love thredUP, I will never buy new again. Everything I've purchased is like brand new. I've told everyone I know. You have changed the way I shop, thank you.",5
7793,"Great condition purses/clothes as described so far. Had an issue with a return, used the customer service chat and they resolved it for me and gave me my money back.",5
7794,Lots of clothes but nothing was my style.,2
7795,"I love to thrift, and I originally got this just to see how it was, as I saw a lot of ads in Instagram, but I ended up loving it. I just made my 3rd purchase. There are some amazing finds, but like any thrifting you may have to search for a while. I'd like to note, that sadly they don't carry men's clothes, which hopefully will change one day, as I love getting my fiance Hawaiian shirts, and I do find the best at thrift stores",5
7796,The sizes are listed inaccurately so now I have to deal with returns and I'm out the price of shipping and the restocking fee. What a pain in the butt..,1
7797,Love it,5
7798,Love this app great prices always!!,5
7799,Easy to use. Great deals for growing kids!,5
7800,Easy to use for purchases and returns. Feeds my needs for a new wardrobe without going broke.,5
7801,"I have been a customer for several years now and while I do not purchase frequently, I do browse regularly and make occasional purchases when I find what I'm looking for. I am not a fan of the change to the search functions. I prefer to search by type of clothing and style (i.e. Tops, tshirts). I live in a state that is hot year round. I don't want to look at thousands of long sleeve shirts to find what I'm looking for. I also find many of your items to be overpriced for used items and even new.",1
7802,"Name Brands, Discount Price. All my favorite brands like American Eagle, Victorias Secret, Vans, Gucci, Charlotte Russe etc. I dont even want to post this review because I selfishly want all the deals to myself! ;)",5
7803,Awesome,5
7804,Love shopping on this app. It's my go to place to find clothing peices that are unique to my personal style. Very easy to navigate.,5
7805,Love this app and love buying good quality second hand. Easy to use and great quality of product. Will definitely keep using it.,5
7806,Love this for upcycling clothes I'm not wearing plus getting great deals on new things!,5
7807,"The most fun, affordable site. Found the great things I couldn't find on the bigger,older sites. Easy to use. Love it!",5
7808,I bought 9 pairs in a 2 week period. I love this app. Recommended to everyone. Wish they had mens stuff.,5
7809,Bundling is pointless as the items actually are shipped separately. Waited almost 2 months for an item that when marked delivered was delivered back to thredup supposedly due to ineligible label. Then they had the audacity to tell me they couldn't say if would take a month or more for redelivery.,2
7810,Haven't yet,5
7811,Ok for my first time.,4
7812,Tried 4 times to log in and buy Hunter boots. Nothing happened. Their loss,1
7813,"Great variety, lots of plus size clothing at a reasonable price. Their promotion for new customers is outstanding, hoping they offer rewarding promotional offers to existing/returning customers. The promotion is what hooked me, waiting to see if in the future I am intrigued by discounts and promotions in the same way. I am a wife and mom of 3 boys so I don't often splurge on myself however the promotion they offered was too good to pass up. I'll be keeping my eyes open for future savings..",4
7814,Great Offerings On This Site. Love it!,5
7815,I order from them all the time and I usually get my orders in about a week. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is how long returns take to process. It takes 2-3 weeks so if you're waiting for a return to post to purchase a favorite item you might miss out.,4
7816,Very high place to shop,1
7817,"Love the app! Easy shopping, great selection and reaaonable prices! Highly recommend!",5
7818,"The clothes look good, the descriptions of the clothes same pretty accurate. Im very happy with my experience!",5
7819,I love the website and the choices are always awesome and colors too.,5
7820,"I love Thred Up, So many choices. I ordered 3 pairs of leggings and they were like brand new. Now I ordered 7 summer dresses..",5
7821,"I love this app and store. It is probably one of my five most used apps. It is easy to search, favorite items, purchase and do returns. Highly recommended!!",5
7822,"I really enjoy shopping @ThredUP. My only problem is too many pop ups, constant updates",5
7823,Thifting at its finest!,5
7824,More people should know about these deals but what's up with not having men's clothing,5
7825,Love all the name brand items I get for the prices. Not to mention the points you earn that take money off your orders 😁,5
7826,"I ""L💖VE L💖VE L💖VE "" thredUP (C💝MPANY)❗ STILL feeling GREAT about MY shopping CHOICES & EXPERIENCES w/THRED·UP & SAVINGS GAL🤑RE❗",5
7827,"I have issues with the app freezing or crashing when clicking a link from email item notifications. Other than that, I sometimes encounter another minor issue related to saved searches... The freezing issue is most frustrating. Started happening a few months ago... **edited to add**> > > Just hope that this issue can be addressed adequately in a forthcoming update, as it appears to still be ongoing...",3
7828,I'm addicted to thredUP. They sell really nice new and used items.,5
7829,Easy to use,5
7830,Love the quality if the clothes.,5
7831,Very user friendly,5
7832,"I will change my rating to 5 stars if situation goes well, my GoodyBox return has been stuck in Ellenwood, Georgia, (smartbox/FedEx.) Looks like they may have damaged /stolen my items, not sure. But I am allowed over 100$ of insurance, through claim, but can not get ahold of ANYONE at Thredup..(I've emailed 4 times, the proper email)- now I'm afraid they will charge me , I have a pending Goodybox review through my very large bbb company also, so- hopefully it will be figured out.",3
7833,Love selling my clothes thru them and I really love buying from them!!!!,5
7834,Absolutely addicting. A huge variety of styles and looks for any aesthetic. Have already broken my wallet way too much lol,5
7835,I like this concept. Some of the prices I felt were a little high but I did notice a few good deals and some items were priced fair.,4
7836,"The best place to shop for clothes. Hands down my favorite! In just the past 2 months I've bought (from the comfort of home) 41 great pieces for... Get this... Less than $150! Gap, banana republic, SO, papaya, H&M, Anne Taylor, etc. I had one mishap with mislabled jeans having the wrong list size on a final sale, hopped on chat literally had a shipping label to print for free return and refund within a minute. Seriously the best.",5
7837,Well Satisfied,5
7838,Best online shopping app,5
7839,So if you cant sell my clothes I have to pay 11 dollars in order to get my own clothes back?! And if you do sell my clothing I only get $3 from it even though you sold it for $20. Better to sell it yourself then on this app.,1
7840,🥰,5
7841,My most fav place to shop!!!,5
7842,I am very aggravated right now! when I find a dress I like and it is not the sizE I have put in my choices to veiw!!,2
7843,"Easy app, great quality items. Very pleased so far!",5
7844,Always on points Always positive experience.,5
7845,Its a great site i love it...!!!,5
7846,No medium petite?,5
7847,"Out of all the clothes I purchased, only 2 pieces fit! The one pair of pants that dod fit came missing a button....very unhappy with the purchases. I will probably not use this ap again nor will I refer it to a friend",1
7848,"Loooooooove ThreadUp! Love thrifting, love shopping at home, love all the brands. Love it!",5
7849,Love the clothes!,5
7850,Until they fix their server problem I do not recommend this app. It seems that they have too many people going to the site and not enough servers to support it. I love this retailer so much but the app constantly crashes or seems to take forever to load a page. It's extremely frustrating. It's much simpler to look at their site on a computer. There is a lot of room for improvement.,2
7851,Love it,4
7852,"PROS: *Thrift store shopping from home *Filter allows for sorting by price, color, brand, condition, etc. *Great sales, reward points, ref'l credits *Most descriptions are accurate *Easy returns *HUGE inventory *Good c/s CONS: *One order is shipped in MANY different boxes from various locations... big carbon footprint *Know your measurements and order accordingly! *No item description, only facts *Only 2 pics per item (usually) *Jackets not measured around chest, belts not measured for length",4
7853,"I love thredup. I buy from them often. That being said, I gave them 3 stars because their warehouse people suck at measurements. 95% of them are way off and being a busty lass makes chest measurments crucial. It'd be a 5 if not for that. I just saw a dress with a bust of 107"" and a length of 20"". I'm pretty sure both of those numbers are wrong, even if switched.",3
7854,Nice clothes and cheap,4
7855,"My second time ordering and it won't be my last , excellent service and great selection of clothes",5
7856,I love the prices on the clothing here. It's fun to shop on this site. No more travel from store to store its all here on one site. All styles and personalities can find things to buy on thredup. Much of the items I buy end up having the original tags attached and its always super fast shipping. Sizes are also fairly accurate to measurements. Overall happy with thredup.,5
7857,Stupid and sexist,1
7858,Absolutely love this app! I'm pretty picky when it comes to my clothes and this app has so many options!♡♡♡,5
7859,Discounts REDICULOUS!,1
7860,Never found anything I wanted.,1
7861,Found alot of great items. Great prices. Hope they all fit.,5
7862,Forget it,5
7863,A great way to have cloths you could not afford other wise.,5
7864,"So much for having a variety. It's honestly all just the same thing. There is only one style and it's ""basic"". I have like 13 aesthetics and idek if y'all even hit one of those surprisingly..",1
7865,I get from them all the time and i send to them as well great service great clothing,5
7866,Absolutely great clothing store. Love all the second hand outfits. So glad my daughter told me about this app.,5
7867,Ordered a few things a week or two ago haven't received them yet can't say whether I like it or not I'd really like to start selling some clothes not sure how to start,3
7868,I love buying used clothing. Best products with little or no visual wear signs. I have purchased many items. Returns r easy too.,4
7869,Made my first order 2 weeks ago and had everything within a week!!! Nice clothes for a good price!,5
7870,Love thred up great app ive loved every piece ive bought what a fabulous idea ...an online thrift store ...genius!!!,5
7871,Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the app was just a little glitchy but all in all I have found one of my favorite places to buy clothes now.,4
7872,"Fast service, purchase was great!",5
7873,"Very convienent and very precise when searching for something specific. They have everything you can imagine, even the stuff thats hard to find!! I recommend this app!",5
7874,"When searching a particular item, to our only get those results. You don't get a lot of mixed in items that you didn't want to see . It's a beautiful thing. If I like an item, I know I can click on it and a different price not size will pop up. It is what it says it is.",5
7875,Could not find anything I liked.,1
7876,"The app is decent, but could use some improvements. I'd love the option to set a minimum length for tops. As a taller woman, it's hard to find tops of an acceptable length, and very few items are specifically categorized as tall sized.",3
7877,Great quality and service. Efficient and affordable.,5
7878,Good quality clothes that saves you money get your money worth,5
7879,Love it so much! I've gotten so many wonderful things.,5
7880,Great way to reinvent my closet!,5
7881,"Best app I've used to find good quality , Thrifted clothing . For a good price that is",5
7882,Great way to buy good products cheap and great customer service with needed return. Better than walmart!,5
7883,slow return process. the money takes forever to show up as store credit. not worth it. you lose out and basically waste your money. smh,1
7884,Phenomenal app! One of the best apps ever. Easy to use and so functional. By far one of the best apps I have ever used. Love that I can save items that catch my heart. Love that I can click on a designer and go directly to their items. Love that I can search by color or pattern. Love this app!!!,5
7885,Great clothing always as described,5
7886,Easy to shop and save your favorites. Check out is easy. But most of all great deals!,5
7887,"I've made multiple orders, they have all been amazing, shipped right on time. Great app/idea",5
7888,I did not like this app because it looked so poor,1
7889,"Not ""thrift store priced"" as advertised. In fact, it's basically like going to the regular brand store while a little sale is happening. 🤷‍♀️",1
7890,Downloaded this app cause I saw it on a commercial and thought it was cool. I personally love thrifting so I was happy to try it out but there's no Men's section. Yes I know it says woman and kids but there's a lot of men out there who could benefit from from this app. Just sayin. Update. I changed from 1 star to 3 because you guys replied with some great information. Can't wait to see what your app has to offer in the future! Thank you!,3
7891,Love it! Like shopping in someone else's closet!,5
7892,No men's shoes items.,2
7893,Great shopping,5
7894,"I absolutely love this app and store, I love to shop at secondhand stores anyway, I always find great clothes at cheaper prices with Thred up. Its by far the best online clothing store I have come across yet. And guess what if the clothes are not what you want, as long as its not a final price item you can send it back for a small fee and get your money back. 5 stars from me. ROLL TIDE",5
7895,"An easy shopping experience, with great filters and easy navigation. I'm only docking a star because the mobile app does not have all the flair of their desktop website (notably, the recommended items are only available in browser).",4
7896,Excellent,5
7897,"App has greatly improved in the last few years, love the ability to search by material and accents on pieces, and also love the RTR partnership and rewards program for letting me try more pieces!",5
7898,Been a great shopping experience so far I've liked everything I've bought and shipping does not take that long at all,5
7899,It's too easy and fun to shop this site. I love the build a bag option.,5
7900,"I'm have had a great relationship with three up, no returns or any reason to be dissatisfied. Love all my clothes I have received. Thank you Threadup!",5
7901,"Im editing my review after doing business with this company from the selling perspective because it sure feels like I was underpaid for the items that were sent in, not to mention the fact that the ""potential payout"" has changed 3 times since they received my ""clean-out kit""(this is what they call the label that is emailed to you to send in the items that you wish to have them list for sale on their app). Almost all of the 30 pieces of clothing that I sent in were accepted. Total payout; $54!omg",3
7902,"Don't order from Thredup. I placed an order via Walmart and was sent a tracking number my order doesn't even show up. No tracking available. There is no customer service. Period. No email , no phone number if you have an issue your on your own. Awful!",1
7903,I love this app it's dangerous I will say that. Because its so good 👍,5
7904,"Too expensive, terrible customer support. Can only message and email. No way to talk to anyone. I canceled my subscription and they still sent me a box and charged me. Customer support through message did not care. They canceled on my behalf of the next box but are still charging me for it...",1
7905,Love thred-up for buying and selling!!!,5
7906,Good stuff for good prices!,5
7907,"Fantastic!! The app is awesome, my packages arrived very quickly, everything was beautifully folded and wrapped in polka-dot tissue! All of the items I purchased were exactly as pictured and described! Highly recommend!",5
7908,Makes shopping for what I'm looking for so easy!,4
7909,Never received one of the three items ordered,1

7911,"Big variety, easy to use, nice shipping. Have used multiple times and will continue to.",5
7912,Excellent,5
7913,Good deals and easy to use,4
7914,"Prior Pandemic they were alright, now? I can not continue to send expensive clothing in and Thredup constantly saying it was donated or if they do list, me getting paid $2 for designer clothing! Seems ever since they merged with Wal-Mart and the Pandemic it is aweful. The only thing good about ThredUp is the time it takes for them to ship an item you purchass!",1
7915,"QUALITY and QUANTITY makes the best experience all the way around! Find YOUR size in all shapes and sizes. You won't be disappointed! Brand new, like new, and slightly used clothing for astounding prices! I will never shop anywhere else ever again for pants! Say goodbye to the real struggle of hitting every store possible and still going home with nothing you needed! Its all right here💜🤌",5
7916,Okay very good clothes on here. Not gonna lie. If you wanna find suits or clothing for plus size women especially then this is a good app to use. And you might get addicted so watch out for your cards.,4
7917,Great for finding secondhand items in excellent condition,5
7918,"Love,love,love this clothing",5
7919,I love the detailed descriptions.,5
7920,I've made multiple purchases and have been pleased with every shipment! I LOVE the outlet option for stocking up on baby essentials.,5
7921,Finally ordered. Was thrilled. Packaging was top notch (tissue paper wrapping my items was awesome). Couldn't ask for better except maybe better descriptions. Have always liked resale because I know the items can holdup to laundering. Free shipping was a plus. Will definitely continue to use. May consider selling too.,5
7922,Love it!!!,5
7923,"I love the app and the company. The one thing that keeps it from being five stars is that when I'm searching for my kids, I constantly have to choose a gender before looking at the items. Both of my kids enjoy designs across the spectrum. I find it frustrating to be forced to navigate based on gender. I would like to be able to look at sneakers without having to pick a gender, etc.",3
7924,Such a great app for shopping green through second hand clothing. Everything I've purchased here has been in excellent condition and is such an easy experience,5
7925,Need some new clothes,4
7926,"Always a pleasure doing business with ThredUP! Never disappointed. From delivery to returns, its always easy peezy. I will continue to be a solid customer with ThredUP.",5
7927,Love ThredUp! So easy and fun to use.,5
7928,"Love it! Sold some of my clothes, shoes, and bag for $100+ and I always find a good deal. Especially for work clothes! 🤍",5
7929,I usually only buy and things and so far things came quickly and were what I expected.,5
7930,"Haven't ordered anything quite yet, but there are so many items I want to buy for my daughter and myself!! I can't say that I've ever seen such amazing prices on high end name brand clothes! Wow 😁",4
7931,"Great for thrifting. The app is a little buggy, but it gets the job done. I'd love to see either men's clothing, or ungendered categories. Right now the three genders are Women, Boys, Girls.",4
7932,Items description was off. Both pants were way shorter than pictures or expected. Sizes not exactly right. Even the photo of the purse I purchased showed it bigger when worn by a manequin. Will probably not purchase from here again.,3
7933,I'm so happy I found the ThredUp website. Always good quality clothing.,5
7934,"I love ThredUp and have made several purchases through the app. My only gripe is I wish there was more separation between womens and junior sizes. I can filter by size, but a women's large is not the same as a junior's large so I've received a few items that weren't returnable and didn't fit me. Overall happy but considering going back to more traditional methods of buying clothes because it's a concern every order that I'm being sent junior sizes. Please consider more size filtering options.",4
7935,"Love this app! As an eco-conscious consumer, lover of a good deal and cute clothes, this app has been amazing during the pandemic. I can still shop for clothes, but I don't have to go to all of the stores. I have refreshed my closet and saved money by using ThredUp instead of a retail company .",4
7936,"This is my first experience with Thred Up and I am beyond thrilled!! The prices are reasonable and I only have to put in my size once,from there all I have to do is search what I'm looking for and click check out..Makes shopping for the plus size girl ALOT easier!! ALSO they're more eco friendly considering they recycle clothes to help reduce the carbon footprint which is a PLUS!! 5 STARS from me!!",5
7937,Pricing is terrible,1
7938,I just got my final (of 4) boxes and I LOVE your app!! Thrift store to the world is how I described to friends and family! Thank you for a wonderful experience!,5
7939,"Little tricky to filter, so many choices. But great pricing!",4
7940,"Easy to use. Never had an issue with the app. I like that you can return things with just a small restocking fee (usually $1.99) unlike some sites which charge a 30% fee and you have to pay your own shipping. I like that you can filter by the condition of the clothes. My only issue is that sometimes clothes listed as ""like new"" are a little more worn than I would like.",5
7941,Pretty easy to use. Preferable to the website.,5
7942,I absolutely love this app it makes it easier to get to the site.,5
7943,"Excellent App! One of the best I've ever used; it's easy to use, clear, smooth, and fun. Bravo to the devs!",5
7944,Easy and fun to use!,5
7945,"My first use, 2 items that I bought both were defective. Items descriptions state excellent condition but holes in seams and unraveled and broken ties. Quality control is absolutely terrible.",2
7946,Great app!! Seriously the best!!,5
7947,Replacing my entire wardrobe with TredUP. Love love love it! Thank you TredUP,5
7948,Tracking is a huge pain & very frustrating. I chose to simply them with fewer boxes - it is using both UPS & FedEx coming from 2 different states. Shipping here is glacially slow. I love thrifting & good deals but I don't think it should take a week before you even ship it out. It's been 10 days & there's still not even an estimated arrival date for my items. I don't like that at all. Cheap thrifts should be convenient and hassle-free! This app is neither.,3
7949,Love the app and thread up. App is easy to use and they have really great clothes,5
7950,I have had no problems ever when ordering. Items arrived in a timely fashion and every item purchased was excellent quality.,5
7951,"Love this app, the only place I shop for apparel and accessories. So easy to use,they store your sizes and preferences, you choose your price range. I have not paid over $10 for pants or tops since using this app. Every item purchased has been in excellent condition. Even got 2 pairs of name brand leather boots for $40 never been worn. If you have kids the only place to shop. Great double discounts and codes, quick delivery, my favorite app have told everyone about it and they all love it.",5
7952,"It's a decent app to shop on. It doesn't have a men/boys section, they took the measurements off of skirts/ shorts, and when you sell on here, you get pennies. If I had known they would pocket almost 90% of the profit, I would have just sold locally. Say you're selling something on here for $11.99. You will only be making $1.08. They pocket the rest. I also had a large bag with about 50 items all with size tags and in good shape. They posted only 17 of those items. Where'd the rest go?",2
7953,"Hit or Miss. i have ordered several times. I dont feel like the descriptions are acurate. Yesterday I got what looked like a nice gold tone bangle...it was 3 thin ones. I paid 4.99 for a 50 cent garage sale item. some pants were sized wrong, a sweater had sparkles and a dress was safety pinned. Animal hair, petite items instead of plus size. Let's see the labels!! Also, I will no longer shop w companies that use FedEx, they are the worst!!!",2
7954,Unbranded small purses for more than 10 bucks is ridiculous for it being thrifty. A lot of overpriced thrifty items. No thanks. 👎,1
7955,Wonderful!!!,5
7956,"Wonderful App! I saw ads for this app a couple of times while watching videos online, and thought nothing of it. That was until I was trying to find a way to shop for women's plus size clothing online that actually fits me. They have a beautiful selection of reasonably priced clothes and also make returns easy, which is a must if you're shopping online. Thank you so much ThredUp, you have found a long term customer in me. 😀",5
7957,Great deals,5
7958,"It is so difficult to search for items, and its kinda overpriced.",2
7959,I love Thredup! It's a great app and you can find amazing deals on new or gently used items. Highly recommend,5
7960,Great clothes at great prices. Customer service is amazing.,5
7961,Love it! So easy to browse and shop. Clothing descriptions are as described. Measurements have been accurate. I have been able to update my wardrobe without leaving my house! Highly recommended 👌,5
7962,This app is my favorite. They deliver fast and always great clothes.,5
7963,I love the clothes they pick and I love the clothes that they have on this app,5
7964,"The search filters make it easy to find what you're looking for. There's something for all price ranges. It's dissapointing when something you've ""saved"" gets bought by somebody else. I recommend not browsing until you are ready to buy. There is only one of everything so they only allow items in your cart for twelve hours at a time. The ""You May Also Like"" feature reccomends you items similar to the one you click, but in all sizes instead of applying your size filters. It's not helpful.",4
7965,Crashes sometimes but pretty good,4
7966,Love the prices beautiful sexy clothes,5
7967,Easy to use.,5
7968,I get all my jeans on here!! They are so affordable!! My kids love it too!,5
7969,great,5
7970,"I have ordered from ThredUP and am pleased with the quality and delivery they are very organized,and now I've sent off my first bag to be sold.I know of plenty of thrift shops this is different you are doing more to help keep the earth clean from so many clothes thrown away and ENDING Up at the dump grounds.Really I have bought like new brand name clothes purses and shoes,etc.compliments plenty.I tell them about Thred Up Sharon Harrison",5
7971,Absolutely love this app there's no better way to shop,5
7972,Excellent,5
7973,"It's super hands on, you have to dig sometimes. But you do too when you're thrifting in real life, I've gotten some cute clothes off of here for sure.",4
7974,The clothes are not accurate as far as measurements go. I rated them a 2 because of bad customer service and got a response right away and it was fixed. So I'm rating a 4 now. Its just a shame it took me giving a poor review to get their attention.,4
7975,Phenomenal.,5
7976,I love the selection and the prices are great for the first time you buy and the products recieved were goid but many of the items stating new with tags are from tj max and even walmart so i could get for around the same price easier there. I spent around 400 on 2 orders and would gladly have shopped hete againbut to return items is 1.99 per item then 8.99 shipping unless you get store credit then you dont pay the 8.99. I returned items on march 21st and still the items are not there or credit,2
7977,Just got my 1st order & couldn't be happier! I now own my 1st coach purse & I got it for $60!! Everything is exactly as advertised & I will be ordering again soon!!,5
7978,Everything i ordered fit great..,5
7979,My favorite thrift site to shop for my girls and I! Quality clothes for a great price!,5
7980,"4 starts because I love the large selection. But I really didn't like after I paid for my order, I didn't get it for weeks. Checked the app and found a hidden spot to click for it to send my ""bundle"" Really?! I ordered it in advance with a outfit for easter and it didn't arrive on time. I also hate how there are no men's clothing. I'd love a men's section or app for men because there is no similar app out there for men to shop for cheap good looking clothes. HINT HINT Thredup!",4
7981,It's decently user friendly. I do wish when viewing the clothes that the sides of garments could be seen too.,4
7982,My orders come fast . Love to shop for myself or my kids this is best online app I ever had.,5
7983,"I LOVE this app, I don't like other apps that have a consultant pick things out for you and they're usually too pricey. I've bought MANY things from thredup and have only returned 1 item and that was my own error not theirs. I recommend this app to my family all time!",5
7984,"I love ThredUp app! No problems; easy to use. Great deals all the time! UPDATE: This is the best app for ""experienced"" clothing. The quality of the clothes is great; descriptions include measurements which make it easier to order the right size.",5
7985,Shipping is like pony express,3
7986,I absolutely love this app. As a single mom it has stuff in my price range and nice quality.,5
7987,I'm giving this a 2 star due to the fact it doesn't include men's wear. I was really hoping to get some nice clothing for my man. Other than that it's great to find awesome clothing for women and children.,2
7988,"Absolutely love this site and the clothes I find at bargain prices. Being a single mom to 3 teenagers and a Teacher's Assistant I find the cutest clothes for work, home and nights out with friends.",5
7989,I have had nothing but great experiences from this App!,5
7990,Great,5
7991,Fast delivery and everything is just as described. Customer service is extremely helpful and friendly. I'll definitely keep buying things from them.,5
7992,Great selection and value!,5
7993,Just downloaded so far I love it. I wish I was able to use the app on my Kindle Fire but it doesn't seem to work on tablets. I was able to look up the web site so I could shop on a bigger screen. Hopefully you'll fix that. I made my first order 😊 I'll let you know how that turns out. I like that I was able to use affirm to make three payments on a more expensive item.,4
7994,Great selection of clothes!,4
7995,There was a lot to choose from and the prices were good.,4
7996,"Love the app, love the site, LOVE that I look like I spent $200 on an outfit that costs $25. I don't even shop for clothes anywhere else!",5
7997,The app never works.,2
7998,I have bought 7 items from this site.,4
7999,I am LOVING this app!!,5
8000,Can't get the push notifications to stop. I slide the notifications option to off but they keep sliding back on to on. Very annoying. Will uninstall app,1
8001,Love ThreadUP and the app! Makes life soooo much easier! I have found some real GEMS here!!,4
8002,Luv! Luv! Shopping for all My Favorite Guess brand clothing!!!💜,5
8003,Overall good app - but it's not always easy to filter easily to find exactly what you want.,4
8004,Very expensive for thrift store app I will never buy anything thing from here I will go to goodwill,1
8005,My new favorite app.,5
8006,I love Thredup great app :),5
8007,Enjoy buying & selling!,5
8008,Shipments are being lost. It is not easy to contact Customer Service. Not easy to request refunds for shipments not received.,1
8009,The price they pay out is 😢😭😭😭 sad.,1
8010,It is hard to find what you are exactly looking for you do the sizes price and stuff that you want to stay in and you can't get it it gives you way and beyond what price you're looking to stay in and you can't get it to straighten out even with using the filters at part of your app. That is one place you really need to improve your app it's too hard to find what you're looking for you might say it's literally impossible I have to go through to much things to find what I'm looking for .,3
8011,Fun and easy! Upcycling at it's best!,5
8012,"Seems like every time you update, us Android/Pixel users have problems for weeks, months. Recent update means the app just swirls and swirls to load the page and never goes :(",2
8013,"I got hooked on goody boxes! After ordering a few of the hand selected goody boxes and receiving great styles I normally would have overlooked, I was hooked on updating my wardrobe through ThredUp!",5
8014,"Scam! Over priced, winter clothing for summer, items with holes, not age appropriate",1
8015,"Thredup is the best online thrift store. No bidding and no independent sellers, absolutely hassle free. It can be a pain to pay for returns, but when you build credit you'll never have to pay for a return, just use your points! Points offer free shipping too! And to donate, it's always free shipping as long as you keep it under 30lb! I love this app!!",5
8016,Horrible don't get get it they don't hlavle thing for kids and I can go on and on,2
8017,"Cool idea, but the platform is so frustrating. I wanted to shop by item but was forced to enter sizes, then it didn't show me the sizes I had selected. Pressing the back button negates everything you've fileted and often takes me back to the beginning of the page.",3
8018,I love shopping on ThredUp. The clothes are well described and I can easily return whatever doesn't fit. This is one of my favorite ways to go thrift shopping. Y'all keep doing what you're doing! I appreciate it!,5
8019,"Ok so update, the last agent i spoke to, was very helpful, & tho i went thru a few hoops before i got her, in rhe end she made it alright. My 5 items ordered were all shipped to old address. I was able to retreive 4. She refunded for the coach prse not received. Yaaay! Won me back over! Gotta get back to 4-5 stars again tho.",3
8020,So much fun browsing and imagining new outfits...and then finding them in a price range that's affordable. Great way to start upscaling the wardrobe without breaking the bank. Nice shipping and easy returns.,5
8021,Great,5
8022,I love this app and have saved SOO much money! I've also referred it to a few friends and they now use and love it.,4
8023,Great value. Good for environment. Quick shipping,5
8024,"I was disappointed that there was no men's clothing, but other then that I like the favor button and that the app saves your sizes.",4
8025,"Look I don't want to be in no way disrespectful you do have fabulous deal's I unfortunately have been given a unrefundable gift I bought for a friend who passed away and I am ordering her a gift for her birthday and I'm out of the money from my order for now, after some thought I would like to apologize to thread up for my first review I was going through grief and must say I apologize for wanting a refund so allow me to be honest, I think THRED UP IS AMAZING!!!",5
8026,Only womens clothing? That sucks. Aren't there enough women-only clothing stores already? EDIT: They responded to my comment. Respeeeeect 👌👌👌 Still sucks that they're woman only though. That's why I gave them a neutral 3/5.,3
8027,"Update: I'm sorry for not doing this sooner but after uninstalling and a reinstall the app works perfectly. Thanks! The app on a Samsung Galaxy S9 opens up with the logo, that's it. I can't do anythinging else. I would love to use but I guess I'm back to the website.",5
8028,"You are my main source for clothes and shoes.I let everyone know just how great you are for prices and quality of kinda worn before stuff..As of 2021.I have been tricked into buying women clothes that have a 5X size listed.Wherever these 5X sizes are not in keeping withe the 2,3,4,or 5X range.I am a big woman and I get clothes from three up all the time but have no way to return these item's because you don't think I should be able to return unless I have a printer.I think you should give return",5
8029,"EXCELLENT!!! I enjoy thrift shopping better than new shopping, because I feel that I am finding a treasure. A treasure that was used and appreciated, that is why it still is so beautiful and able to continue being used to it's full extent. Part of the search is the journey and vis-a-versa. Sometimes a small fix is necessary but that makes it such a huge prize to brag about! ***",5
8030,Love the updates and how easy it is to apply my sizes and the filters I want!,5
8031,I've been finding alot of used cute clothing. And it's starting to become a obsession 😂😂😂😂,5
8032,Ordered jeans..they never arrived.,1
8033,Great deals on great clothing. There's a return policy if something just doesn't work. Customer service is there to answer questions when you need it. If you really like something grab it before it's gone!,5
8034,I love it,5
8035,Good,4
8036,"Loved all my clothes love that they have the measurements so I can be sure it will fit before I buy it, and that everything looks brand new when it arrives, I will be a long term customer as long as they keep this up, even shipping was fast",5
8037,Excellent,5
8038,I love this app but bought something recently that was not returnable and not as described. I can't seem to find a way to contact anyone.,2
8039,"I purchased a pair of Frye Boots!! These boots are easily $300.00, maybe more! The ones I received are excellent quality and I am in LOVE!! I have wanted a pair for years but couldn't afford them...I purchased them for $79!!! Insane!!! Thank You to the Seller...you are generous, and thredUP!! You made my day!!",5
8040,"This is fun and due to present circumstances it is a pleasure to be at home and be able to shop in the safety and comfort of my home!! Great idea, I am also passionate about repurposing all things, thank you for your quick response to my order, I will be making further purchases. Sincerely, Kimberly Jean",5
8041,Is great,5
8042,"I made a purchase for pair of Nikes site said 110 reg. price got em for about 40 dollars. When they arrived.. shoelace looked cheap they had ""Nike"" logo wrapped at edges.. hmm Nike has really gone down in quality.... long story short I bought knockoffs!! The inside drawings were done with pen!! Its a really cheap shoe. My window to return has passed. I feel betrayed the company should be paying close attention to the items they receive is no one monitoring? Now I'm nervous about purchasing items",2
8043,Great pieces at amazing prices! User- friendly ap.,5
8044,"Good idea but the app is very annoying. Everytime I back out even to check a message it beings me back to the home screen. Thredup also changes the conditions and rates of sellers without notification. I stopped selling with them. Any times I've bought have hair and dirt of them and are unzipped with a piece of tissue around it. I wish more care was placed in storing and packing items and with sellers who are supporting the company. Fast shipping, good rewards, good customer support.",3
8045,"I love thread up because I am able to get sides that I wear at cheap prices, thank you.",5
8046,Very user friendly.,5
8047,Awesome clothes at great prices!!!,5
8048,Great market place to find affordable quality clothing!,5
8049,Great Clothing App,5
8050,"shoes go up to a 12, pants go up to a 34 in the waist. Lol, are you kidding me? Hard uninstall.",1
8051,Great app. Easy for me to shop. I love it.,5
8052,I got perfect sandals affordably. Thank you thredup <3 Easy app. Wonderful experience.,5
8053,The best way to shop all clothing is cared for just as if I was in the store!,5
8054,Ok,4
8055,Wonderfully money saving on the brands my grand daughter wants to wear! Styles for me also.,5
8056,"I have been happy with everything. This is perfect if you're losing weight and want clothes that fit and look good without spending a fortune, even if you change sizes often.",5
8057,"I hate shopping but I love ThredUP. This app is the only reason I have any relevant, stylish, and designer clothes in my closet. Knowing I am suitably and fashionably attired gives me so much more confidence in my every day life.",4
8058,"Absolutely beautiful clothes, they look brand new and it's a great way to change up your closet choices!",5
8059,"My only complaint about ThredUp is that you're not able to activate your points for a greater reward other than $10. So if I have 2,000 points. I can only activate my points for a $10 discount on my purchase. Instead of activating a $20 reward. Just a bit annoying, especially because you can't use your reward with other offers.",4
8060,I'm loving this app you can shop and sell clothes you don't were or don't want,5
8061,"So easy to shop, so much great clothes",5
8062,Glitchy. It's annoying.,2
8063,Using the filters dont work,1
8064,No glitches. Easy to apply reward points.,5
8065,Last few times the description of the jeans was not what i received. Very disappointed and dies not pay to send back.,2
8066,I'd give this app a better rating if it wasn't for the fact that it's completely geared toward women and children...,2
8067,Generally really easy to use and navigate. The search engine misses the mark sometimes though.,4
8068,Loved the clothes! Only thing that sucked was alot of items were too ebig and everything I return has to have a restocking fee even though I just want more clothing.,5
8069,I love all the clothes that I have bought from here so far. Prices are pretty reasonable.. I just wish it was a little more customizable to the user,4
8070,Love 💘 😻 💜 💛 it!!!!!,5
8071,Love it!!!,5
8072,Thred Up is amazing/THE BEST!!! Every single one of my fave stores rolled into one! N the prices n deals! I definitely haven't shopped ANYWHERES ELSE! IM A CUSTOMER 4 LIFE!!!,5
8073,"I get great prices and quality merchandise. I have never received a low quality item. Also, I find items on this site that are more stylish than I would be able to find in different stores. It's a one stop online shop for adorable high quality clothing!",5
8074,Excellent!,5
8075,Love it,5
8076,My #1 shopping app!,5
8077,LOVE!,5
8078,"Terrible store! Tons of gimmicks. Pictures not accurate to products and returns are not free, plus an additional restocking fee per item. They say they are eco friendly but packaging is far from it. Take your business elsewhere.",1
8079,"I love love this site...ordering is fast and simple. Returning is easy as well..one thing that I hate is that there are two waist sizes on the jeans one under the brand and one under measuments, the one under measurements is never correct just an FYI I had to return like 10 pairs of pants.",5
8080,No mens clothes just women girls and boys. Other then that I like it,4
8081,Love love love this sight! Great brands and veriety: shipping is fast,5
8082,"Lots of items to choose from. Delivery is fast and so are returns. Since sizes vary so much, a filter for dimensions would be so helpful. Also, white articles should be pictured with a different color background so they are visible.",4
8083,Love the ease of consignment shopping!!,5
8084,I received two pairs of dress pants. One had missing closures and the other had a rip down the rear end seam. Be very wary of your orders they are not as they seem.,2
8085,Great experience! I've gotten two orders from thredup in the past and just placed a new one. It's a great way to get clothes and clean out your closet of things you don't wear anymore. I have always loved thrift stores and this app is great. The clothes are shown clearly and the measurements are included in the description. You can even filter searches to only show your size.,5
8086,amazing used items nice quality and selection. Customer support is so helpful,5
8087,Great app. Easy and affordable. Great clothes.,5
8088,"Great quality clothes ,any size, color and price point. Love it. Plus shoes and accessories.",5

8090,Easy to shop,5
8091,Great site and app,5
8092,Everything I have bought from ThredUp has been in amazing condition and clothes are true to size. I love this app!,5
8093,Love this app and Thred up! I am having better luck finding clothing and shoes in the brands and designers I love than on their websites. Everything I have purchased is as described. A $100+ pair of shoes retail cost me $30 dollars and in almost new condition! Just be careful to look up sizing charts for the individual brands.,5
8094,I absolutely love this app the clothes is very nice quality at a low price.,5
8095,"Very easy to go straight to the app, click on it and it's there to start shopping 🛍️",5
8096,"So far so good, I love how everything is in my price range. Love the variety of items.",5
8097,Love it,5
8098,"I want to love this app, but it crashes constantly and it doesn't always have correct information regarding orders. It would be great if it actually worked.",3
8099,I had a delightful time shopping with Threadup for my FIRST time . In fact going back in right now. Thanx!!!!! Threadup!!!!!,5
8100,Very plesant,5
8101,Love this app,5
8102,Lost me order with no tracking number or wrong tracking number. No shoes for me. Did get promised a refund.,2
8103,Great !!! I'm very happy,5
8104,Love it... Saves so much time! 😍💯❤️,5
8105,its higher priced than a thrift store but quality is good. i just wish searches were easier to do,3
8106,Favorite app to shop!,5
8107,"Love the fact that clothes are second hand and not fast fashion. Generally get things okay, but if something happens they don't have tge best customer service and live chats just spouts their FAQ's which is less than helpful when you have a very specific problem. Other than that ThredUps pretty cool.",4
8108,Love it!,5
8109,Fun app!,5
8110,Excellent/Very professional!!!,5
8111,Good,5
8112,Great app for second hand clothes that are like new! Save money and the environment use thred up!,5
8113,"Love shopping I had a great time shopping with so much to see. Shoes, dresses pants, blouses and more. Prices are great Thanks, will shop again soon.",5
8114,Thredup has come a long way! I appreciate their response time! I only wish I could get more labels 😔,5
8115,The best online thrift store ever. I have never had any problems or issue with any of the things that I have bought.,5
8116,"New to thrifting, but I love what I ordered from them will definitely use again.",4
8117,Did not receive 2 of 4 packages. Never able to get ahold of anyone! I was trying to save $ instead I threw money away using thredUP! Very disappointed!,1
8118,Love this app. Great way to buy clothes at a great prices for kids and adults.,5
8119,Love this app,5
8120,Great,5
8121,Love it! Although shipping could be a bit more updated.,5
8122,The best I've come acrossed,5
8123,Perfect thank you 😊,5
8124,My experience has been amazing and I would refer thredUp to family and friends.,5
8125,Love Thred. Been shopping with them for years. Always a great experience.,5
8126,All that I've ordered has arrived in a timely manner. Clothing exceeds my expectations and I'm super pleased!!,5
8127,I like the site its a great place with resonable prices,5
8128,Had nothing I was looking for..,1
8129,If i could leave NO star it would be more accurate. Unethical- Immoral- verging on criminal business practices. The most dishonest business ive encountered. Not worth the headache with so many decent-honest alternatives to shop n sell at. Fyi...the first 2 experiences with thred up are always good. its the 3rd time on that you will lose and they count on you sending in your best because theyve gained your trust after the first 2... many people have gone through this. like a pattern they count o,1
8130,Great place to shop!!!,5
8131,I might be in touble 😂 this app is addictive.,5
8132,It has the cheap clothing you want but the searching within the app is awful. I can never find what I'm looking for. I always end up just browsing through pages and pages of clothes.,3
8133,The only thing I have had an issue with is that 2 items I ordered were way too short for me. I didn't see any information on the length.,4
8134,"Love the ease of shopping, and the prices!",5
8135,"I love this app. It makes thrifting so much easier and safer, thanks to covid. Everything I've ordered came in the condition promised and for a great price!",5
8136,"I love how their isn't a filter for men lol. But there's women, boys, and girls?",1
8137,I absolutely love this app. It saves me so much time and money... and amazing quality everything I have bought is just amazing..,5
8138,Love!!!,5
8139,Good app good product and good prices,5
8140,"Clothes are a little more expensive than an actual used it cheap clothing store.. basically a Ross or Marshalls.. organization is different, you have to use many filters to get the same experience as Ross or Marshalls..",4
8141,Has great prices on good resale clothes,5
8142,"I just got my first order, it was exactly as described, recieved it in the amount of time expected. They have all different brands from coach, express, j crew, ann taylor, ect. ..really well known brands..I'm hooked and have a new go to shop.",5
8143,Love love LOVE THIS APP,5
8144,This WAS a great app.. I loved their prices and selection in the beginning. Now.. it's stupid expensive for second hand clothes. No thanks.. I'll go to Salvation Army or Goodwill..,1
8145,The BEST place I have ever shopped at!!!!,5
8146,Always love browsing. Awesome finds and really easy to use app.,5
8147,I'm loving buying designer clothes at amazing prices. The clothes are amazing and so are their discounts. ThredUP is my only stop to update my wardrobe!,5
8148,Quality clothing at a decent price!,5
8149,"The app is good, I just wish they had more than two pictures per item. I'm the kind of person who likes to see the inside of purses and shoes before I commit to them.",4
8150,I am absolutely addicted to this app! The sales and selection are unbeatable,5
8151,I was able to completely replace my entire closet after a pipe break in the ceiling ruined my clothes. And I saved loads of money.,5
8152,"Haven't used yet, but was highly recommended by several friends.",3
8153,The fact there's only WOMEN or boys...kinda sucks. Why is there no men's option at all? You're either a child's youth size or a female. Good idea and concept but kind of sucks that it is only for women.,2
8154,"Good app, easy to use!",5
8155,"Easy to navigate, and tons of items to choose from 😊",5
8156,I do not like the timing. It does not give you enough time to make more choices and review the description box. I use my phone so probably that's the issue. You have to keep looking and adding back the items removed from your cart. Super annoying! Other than that a big improvement from the last time I visited the website.,4
8157,Love the different filters for searches,5
8158,Loved everything I have bought!,5

8168,No menswear :(,1
8169,I love ThredUp. There are so many options so you can narrow down to exactly what you are searching for. Their customer service is outstanding as well.,5
8170,Goodbye paycheck. I love this site so much! I always find awesome deals and when those polka dot packages show up at my door I get sooooooo giddy with excitement!! I'm a shopaholic. The first step to recovery is Acknowledgement..,5
8171,Bought 2 pair of jeans second pair is in girl size not womans. Return process not easy.,2
8172,"Where's a section for men, I have two men to shop for, this is disappointing.",1
8173,This is my first time ordering from them. But so far I like them. Will bump my rating up when my order comes.,4
8174,My pants fit perfectly,5

8179,"I was having difficulty narrowing down my searches with the filter, but when I select specific items (tops, bottoms etc) that worked fine.",5
8180,"Absolutely infuriated. Purchased a purse labeled as Michael Kors in the description. Item arrived. Looks great. Exactly as pictured, but definitely not Michael Kors.. Totally different manufaclisted inside. ""Michael Kors "" item listed at $84. Found the same item on Ebay for $25. I like the bag. Looks just like pictured. But the offer to make it right was to take 30% off or a free return SERIOUSLY? This isn't about the dollars. Their offer isn't even close to a fair value. Then they",1
8181,Easy to use,5
8182,Very satisfied,5
8183,I love thredup for a longtime now . The convenience is what I need.,5
8184,I love this app!! It was easy to use and I got 4 dresses for $31! 10/10 would recommend.,5
8185,Great deals and selection.,5
8186,Did not give me credit for my returns after 2 weeks.,3
8187,Thredup is my go to for clothing. I love how easy it is to mail in clothing and earn money or donate clothing. You can't beat the affordable prices and the pieces I receive are always in perfect condition.,5
8188,"Dont send your stuff to them. I sent 4 kits, at the time I was told processing times could be delayed up to 3 months. Well, now that they have all my stuff, we are inching towards the 6 mo. mark, and not one has been touched. When I emailed to follow up I was told they have a backlog of over 180,000 kits (due to covid protocols) and it could be up to another 12 weeks before they are done. Ridiculous.",1
8189,A great way to enjoy sustainable fashion!,5
8190,"Love having quick access when I want to browse, and getting the price alerts",5
8191,"In my box i didnt get anything i really liked. I got one favorite item but in the picture it looked all new but when it came in the box it was faded, a big disappointment. Ill give them one more try to see what theyll send after leaving them comments and if i have a better experience ill be sure to rate them higher",1
8192,"I ordered 2 shirts, and they were sent to the WRONG ADDRESS. Customer service said she apologized. Forget This Mess... I am an ONLINE JUNKIE, Will take my business elsewhere.😡😡 I know I'd better get my shirts that I ordered. I ""ain't"" playing!!!!!!",1
8193,This app is not user-friendly at all. I love to shop at thredup and do so frequently but it is getting to be a headache using an uncooperative app it does not follow your prompts and gives you anything it feels like period after viewing hundreds of items it is a real pain when you are not able to get back where you were because you left to get more information on the item. I don't know what has happened with thredup I have not had this problem in the past,2
8194,I was extremly unhappy with my orded an how it was shipped there was nothing in it i liked only a jean jacket it looked like someone had opened it an had trouble closing an retaping also its like no one listened to what kinda clothes i said i like hopefully the next box will be different thanks,1
8195,I want t o shop where are the thredup clothes,5
8196,"Was skeptical but this app works! Cheap prices for like new clothes, even name brand. For a mom of six, 3 girls and 3 boys, this is a life saver!",5
8197,"Wonderful experience love the clothes,fit me to a t fast delivery.",5
8198,"Great prices! 20 items for $203 including tax! I can't wait for my bundle to arrive. 1 of the dealers is from my state of GA and I love to support local. Best APP when you are on a teacher's budget. Thank you thredUP dealers, especially Suwanee GA.",5
8199,I love this app! I buy a lot for my kids and myself. For the most part the clothes are pretty nice. Kids clothes are ok. Although I do think there are some things that are over priced... They are USED clothes and it seems like they try to sell some things at the retail price. But overall very happy! Ive recommended to many people and will continue to do so!,5
8200,"Thredup is my go to for stylish brand names, good price and earn points for fast free shipping or $ % off. Love shopping Thredup 💞",5
8201,"Probably the closest you can browsing a thrift shop virtually. Good selection, good range of sizes. I do wish sizing were more specific - you can sort by s/m/l but I'd love to be able to filter by measurement since rack sizes change brand to brand. When a small can range from a 30""-42"" bust, the rack size of small doesn't mean much.",4
8202,I'm addicted. High quality for cheap prices 💜,5
8203,"Wish there were options for men. Nothing against wearing women's clothes, but women's sizing is a huge mystery for me.",1
8204,Easy to shop. Would love more photo of items,5
8205,"Such a pleasant way to shop! I've been able to make a new professional wardrobe with high-end, practically brand new items for reasonable prices.",5
8206,This is the coolest site. Just love it. So easy to shop. Nice clothing. Good prices.,4
8207,"I love this online store!! Been shopping here for years and never disappointed. I love the app so now it's easier to shop, which isn't great for my bank account. I love the selection and the way you can filter your search for exactly what you want, or search for a broad category as well. Great deals, great products, great place, and great for the environment shopping second hand.",5
8208,"Easy to use and Fantastic Deals Abound! Highly recommend for eco conscious thrifters. Quality pieces, everything a wardrobe could need you can find here.",5
8209,"I love it! You have options, prices that meet your budget, and new items daily.",5
8210,I Love this app. I've already ordered several items and they look great.,5

8215,Absolutely love this app!!,5
8216,"It was okay. It basically just had a ton of mom stuff though. Not great for young adults or teens, but if you're a mom I bet you would rock these.",2
8217,I love ThredUp so much. I've gotten such good deals on name brand clothing and shoes.,5
8218,I always find the cutest and rarest clothes on this app.,5
8219,Love the app! Can you guys list the color of the metals in clothing and purses? Gold or silver? It's so hard to tell by the photos. 😊🤙,4
8220,"It's been a wonderful experience so far, with timely shipping, and I love what the company stands for, keeping the planet's interest at the forefront",5
8221,Huge selection of apparel but I think it's still a bit pricey,4
8222,You have to pay them to sell your items then they take 10-15 percent of your profits which in the end you might be lucky and make $2- $5 profit. They charge $14.99 per item to sell take their cut and list your items at a very low price and you end up making nothing but overpaying - Have a Yard Sale at home and make more money than this App claims it will make you!!,1
8223,"I recommend deffinitly! I love that your purchases give you points and you can use them points to get free shipping, certain % off of things, or 10 bucks off your order! I love the app!",5
8224,"I love the clothes on ThredUp. Get the app, it's easy to use, great to shop on, and prices are fabulously budget friendly. #secondhandfirst",5

8226,Easy good way to thrift. Items as described and nicely wrapped up. Works best if you already know how a brand fits though.,5
8227,"Thred Up Thrift & Sell Women, 😃",5
8228,LOVE!! I absolutely love this app and company. It's a great concept. Fair prices and love the selling option,5

8231,Perfection! I purchased 3 items. They were all amazing! Shopping was fast and easy. Shipping was quick. Everything was so affordable.,5
8232,Love the clothes I got! Thanks,5
8233,"The search function is too generous with spelling. I search ""swim pant"" and get thousands of results for ""slim pant"". Searched for ""lace"" and my results were full of ""Lane"" Bryant. Everything else is great, but its hard to find things with the search function.",3

8235,Easy shopping for the best clothes,5
8236,Love this app,5
8237,"Love this app! Easy to navigate, super user friendly. Awesome filters and plenty of options for I women, men, kids. Found some great dress options for a wedding ( lovely Badgley Mishka). The variety is great--Diane von Furstenberg to Old Navy. Next I am looking forward to seeing if I can sell or donate from my own closet. Really happy to support the upcycle versus fast fashion.Only thing I would say is that there should be more information about how the Thread Bundle works.",5
8238,Not in to used clothes sorry.,2
8239,Love to use the filters to find just what I want. Excellent service and great clothes. Five-star Experience!,5

8241,Absolutely perfect! Recommended to all!,5
8242,I love thread up easy to use lots of selections good prices I have been ordering and selling through thread up for 3 years,5
8243,"Pricing is only occasionally ok, and the sizing is ridiculous. In what world is a size 10-12US shirt coming with a 30"" bust? Absolute nonsense. And the sizing feature is a joke; it takes your waist size and general dress size (which varies brand to brand) and then just uses those with no accounting for any other sizing. This means if you're not watchful, you will get something that's ""your size"" but way too small or large in the bust or hips. Cool concept, wouldn't really recommend.",2
8244,Great stuff,5
8245,Really good,5
8246,I have to sign up or in to browse. Won't happen!,1
8247,"I love this app, but I wish the clothes were organized by measurement, not size. We all know clothing sizes are completely arbitrary- I've seen size 8 dresses range from a 22"" chest to a 41"" chest on this app alone. Neither of those extremes will fit me, but they are recommended based on my given size preferences, which are also a guess. Am I a large? A medium? I have no idea! There are no provided measurements for reference.",3
8248,"ThredUp is the greatest place to shop for retail clothes of all kinds and it's a one stop shopping without the waiting in line . Reasonable and affordable are the thing for me , weather i'm buying for friends or family this is the place I want and need to shop and I am a forever customer ! Thanks ThredUp....",5
8249,Amazing!!!,5
8250,Love this.... everything I've ordered I love...everything fits perfectly.... comes in a cute package and is shipped in a timely manner.... my favorite new online place to shop,5
8251,The only place I buy my clothing.,5
8252,Love all the things about the app!!,5
8253,Great quality clothes which some are brand new with tags still on them and very reasonably priced.,5
8254,I sent in a bunch of excellent quality merchandise that no longer fit my son. I put him in name brand everything. Thredup did not give me a dime for any of it! I would have felt better given it away for free. But threat up basically stole it from me!!!!,1
8255,Ordered a purse. Was just as described ! Love it !,5
8256,I love everything I have gotten so far! Amazingly it all fits perfectly and looks amazing!,5
8257,I love that I get high quality clothes at a discount and I am helping the planet!,5
8258,"👍👍👍👍👍👍👍just got my first bundles, everything fit beautifully, shipping was incredibly fast and the items were carefully wrapped in tissue. Love the polka dots",5
8259,"I have found some gems on here which I like, but many prices are high and the customer service is non-existent. I recently placed an order which was split into 2 packages, the first took about 2 weeks to get here and the second I have been waiting for a month. What's frustrating is because the first package came in they have now counted the items in my second package as ""unreturnable"" even though I haven't even received them yet! Also they now use 600 points for free shipping rather than 350.",2
8260,Nice place to shop. Melissa,4
8261,Love it and it's easy to use!!,5
8262,Makes it really easy to find everything that you want or need love it,5
8263,"The business committed to provide me with an appropriate payout for my items based on condition and seasonality. This business knowingly listed my items with incorrect information in order to administer a lower payout. Once this was brought to their attention, they were slow to respond and did not update the items accordingly in order to adjust my payout. They repeatedly offeed a multitude of reasons and excuses to why they blatantly refused to correct their errors. BEWARE.",1
8264,"Clothes are great quality, in great shape at a great price. I also had plenty of options. I really liked that it's very easy to sort and filter to find what you are looking for as opposed to sorting through racks and racks of clothes to find something.",5
8265,Awesome selection and extremely fast,5
8266,"Dress was incorrect size Did not get refund or $14.00 return shipping.. No phone number to call No Customer Service just a bunch of FAQ's that keep going in a loop, but never answers your ?. So I'm out $26.00 for the dress and $14.00 return shipping.. Do Not use this app.",1
8267,"Never again, $45.00 for a wallet that is dirty. Really?? It could not have been cleaned? What a waste and disappointment, and just so happens it is a final sale!! Wow. Still waiting on a purse I bought at the same time for $85.00... honestly scared to see it when it finally arrives, since the delivery keeps getting rescheduled. Thanks thredUP.",1
8268,The push notifications don't take you to what the app is trying to show you. It says there a good deal but i then have to scour thousands and thousands of clothes before I find the one reduced price item,1
8269,"I like the app, but sometimes it's buggy",4
8270,Ordered a couple outfits got them today. Exactly as ordered...,5
8271,I enjoy this app and store. It's easy to use and cheaper than other places. The shipping is sometimes frustrating but I believe that is more FedEx problem. Just be sure to Look at the MEASUREMENTS! If the tag size and measurements seem to match up than it'll fit. Just remember that US sizes use the same sizes for girls and women's jeans.,4
8272,"I absolutely 💯 love this site!! Thred UP goes above and beyond, to make sure you're clothes or other and shoes and other items are wrinkle free, smell good and they always look better than the photos!! Great 👍 job ThredUP!",5

8274,Terrible,1
8275,Great. I love this.,5
8276,I was not able to successfully track any of my packages until day of delivery... not sure what the point of having a tracking number if not to be able to take my order. It took 1 full month to recive my purchase.,1
8277,Fun easy and quality clothes.,5
8278,Love the app I shot here a lot,5
8279,"Seemed like a good idea, but lots of freezing. Couldn't select on items to view details suddenly. Found a backwash to do so. Not really the deals they're promoting. Prices are the same as buying items on sale brand. It was so frustrating. So after i racked up a big 400 cart, the affirm was acting all funny too. It's all going in my yeah can now. Bye.",3
8280,Had heard of this great service and decided to try...I love the quality of the pieces I received and got compliments on the jacket! I'm hooked already on this great site/service! Thank you for quality and value!,5
8281,"I had more fun shopping at thredUP. Huge array of beautiful fashion pieces at terrific prices. I found so many beautiful outfits and many items were brand new. Great explanations of size, condition and even a notation regarding the unique find. The retail price of each garment is listed and percentages of your savings. thredUP understands what it takes to satisfy the fashion needs of women as well as providing a fun and informative way of finding that special outfit. Thankful for thredUP!",5
8282,Any time I order from this app there is a problem. I recently purchased an item in the adult women's category and when it arrived it turned out it was a children's garment. Then they made me pay a restocking fee for their mistake in order to return the item. I've also gotten clothes that were maternity clothing and weren't labeled as such and found many items I can get cheaper brand new from other places. You're better of buying/selling on Poshmark,1

8284,Great online thrift store,5
8285,Love the clothes,5

8287,Really cute clothes that I know ill love !! Xoxo,5
8288,Wonderful great price,5
8289,Sometimes it freezes up when you try to check out or when you click on a certain items so you have to close the app and open it again but it doesn't happen often so it's more of an inconvenience than a problem,4
8290,Easy to use platform. Great selections.,5
8291,"I am loving thredup!! Ive ordered a few things, and they've come in the mail on time, in the condition stated, and for a great price!! I would recommend thredup to all my friends!",5

8293,"ThredUP is a great service for finding clothes! Sometimes the app can be a tad buggy, like not showing all of your saved items and things like that, but the checkout process works well and it's a fun way to look for new stuff for my wardrobe.

8312,"Amazing! I love thrift shopping but hate the anxiety that comes with it. This takes all the search work & worry that you missed a hole somewhere away. I have the hardest time finding jeans that fit - I'm very tall and skinny. I found six pairs that fit like they were made for me. I ordered $400 worth of clothes for myself in a week... Showed my daughter the app and ended up spending $100 on her in the same week. If I paid full price, I probably would have spent over $1500. I love it!",5
8313,"Great shopping experience with plenty of filters to make sorting easier. Clothes are reasonably priced and I've loved about 90% of my purchases and found plenty new with tags! I also appreciate that clothes get another chance instead of ending up at a landfill. However, a lot of ThredUp clothes are still overpriced for used items...I try to compare it to shopping at Marshall's or TJX for price comparison. App updated recently and it closes out on me more often. Also unclear how to make a return",4

8328,Very happy with my purchases! Good pricing and fast delivery.,5
8329,Luv It I shop here so I can afford Hubby's clothes lol! Wasnt too impressed with the purches I made when I bought a couple handbags tho!!! Couple of descriptions were misleading. As far as clothes which is hard for me to find seeing I have to wear juniors I love the app it's a 10 all the way,5
8330,"Not very happy with my purchases through this company - I found that the descriptions and details about items and their condition were not true. Bought a hat that said it was in perfect condition and looked brand new - it arrived so badly smashed and crinkled that I don't believe it can be salvaged. And on top of that you have to pay a $2 restocking fee. I'd be ok with that if it was my fault that I wasn't keeping things, but when it's your fault for a false advertisement that seems cheap.",1
8331,"You pay them to sell.your clothes. You make pennies on the dollar for items you sell. There are costs for expedited service, costs to return items they don't choose, costs to send your items back to you if they don't sell and those add up quickly if someone returns your item out of the reclaim window. Originally I could withdraw my earnings by paying another percent in service fees but now I only have the option to shop with my credit. I click cash out and it takes me back to the clean out page.",1
8332,"They still have not processed my ckran out bag I sent it Sept 2020 the ""recieved"" it December 2020 The chat I had in January gave me an excuse that didn't really tell me anything I just want my stuff back I can take locally and it would be fine in a matter of minutes No follow up or email even if computer generated saying ' hey yea we know we a taking forever, but we promise we haven't ripped you off. Just busy' at least if I got that I would not mind..... Stay local",1
8333,All items have been in great condition. Sometimes the size versus the reported measurements of the item do not seem to match so I always go by the measurement size.,5
8334,"Links don't work, evertime I click on cash out it brings me to selling and ordering a new kit.",1
8335,Sucked not any cute stuff and expensive....,1
8336,Love thread up!!!,5
8337,"The website is terribly slow, the app is so much faster and easier. Update: if it's possible for marketing emails to link directly into the app, that would be great. Right now, I click on links in the emails, open the app and I have to find what I want from the email from the homepage of the app.",5
8338,"This company is so out of intergrity. They tricked me into making a purchase and didn't give me 30% they offered me because it was the ""wrong kind of purchase."" When I tried to make a qualifying purchase for the discount, they told me I couldn't use it because it was only for customers who had not made a purchase in a year and I had just made one. They offered me 15% off for my trouble. Out of principle I canceled my purchase and I will never buy from them again. They just lost a loyal customer",1
8339,I had a bad experience,1
8340,Terrible service,1
8341,Very easy to navigate,5
8342,"Love the ability to find exactly what i want (brand, color, size...). Timely arrivals and beautifully packed. Always exactly as described.",5
8343,I'm addicted to ThredUp! I love shopping for clothes on here!,5
8344,"I like that if you have questions, you can get a customer service representative to help you now.",5
8345,"Easy,wide variety,affordable & shipping time is great!",5
8346,"The advertising is deceptive, and never leads to whatever is shown directly, but has one searching endlessly through an endless choice items. I want quick and direct, and have my choice to look through if I have the time to.",2
8347,Like,5
8348,Amazing app. Great deals and reward points! Super cheap and can set my sizes!,5
8349,"Does not sync with website, so saved searches or favorites on website don't show on app. Purchases made on one won't show on the other despite being logged in under the same name. Features also often freeze or stop working on the app, so you have to go to the website to finish. The app continues to have problems making it useless. The latest problems is that they have stopped showing measurements at all . Update: measurements are back",2
8350,Great deals,5
8351,"ThreadUp is an exciting, fun way to save $$ while avoiding the hassle of in-person shopping! App allows you to narrow down what you'll be shown, which saves time!",5
8352,So far so good for,5
8353,Some things can get pricey. Just placed first order,3
8354,Love this app! Great prices and fast shipping! Super easy to navigate!,5
8355,"So far so good, creative improvements could be made to the filtering system.",4
8356,So far it has been great. I have found some amazing deals for my kids and myself. The shipping is fast and everything I have recieved looks almost brand new. I would highly recommend this app. You wont be disappointed.,5
8357,"Not good for large sized women. Or, don't order if you don't have a printer. You HAVE TO PRINT OUT THE FORM, to send things back. I ordered 4 dresses, and only 1 fit. Waste of $65 ! COULD NOT FIND HOW TO MESSAGE THRU THE AP. TRIED.",1
8358,Always get exactly what i order and always on time.,5
8359,"I love this app! Very nice reasonably priced clothes. They bundle up items to help reduce packaging. Low shipping and handling, and they buy your clothes you no longer want. Very addicting!!",5
8360,Legit the best app ever. And just saw a commercial the other day. Great styles and wears. I don't know why people aren't using this site/app,5
8361,Very happy with purchases so far!!!! Great site! One caveat...dont wait too long to order or the item will be gone Trust me!!!,5
8362,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Nothing fit and 90% of the items were TOO BIG. simply too many different brands/sizing differences to nail down the right size. I ended up spending FORTY DOLLARS just to try on clothes bc of their $1.99 restocking fee PER ITEM plus they make you spend another NINE dollars just to return the clothes that don't fit. Terrible business model. Very disappointed I wasted so much time and money when I could have just bought new and tried on clothes that fit.,1
8363,"I cant believe the prices of everything, you cant beat em!",5
8364,"My experience purchasing handbags/wallets has been dismal. The items are not new with tags when listed, not made of the materials listed. There are no interior photos, which would be helpful when the items are final sale and not cheap. I received a Lodis cross-branded promo item credit card case which was listed as a wallet. I am going back to Poshmark, where I can ask for further info, more photos, and feel more comfortable with my purchases.",1
8365,Horrible company both for buying and selling! Constant changes without notifications. Terrible way to run a company,1
8366,"This is a GREAT place to shop. Love the clothes, fast shipping and they have a great price. Stop in you find new things everyday. ,😍🤩",5
8367,I pretty much only buy clothes from thredUP now,5
8368,"This is a great app for finding inexpensive clothing. I love that I can search by material, so I can buy only natural fibers if I want to. Most of their clothing has measurements too, which makes it easy to find the right item before you purchase. My only complaint is the skirt section. They only give you the length measurement, not the waist measurement. So I can't order a skirt with any confidence that it will fit me, since numbered sizes vary so much between brands.",3
8369,Love the variety,5
8370,I haven't got to use order anything off thredup but I love the content and it is absolutely interesting and the prices are great,4
8371,Great thrift finds!!,5
8372,Great way to find quality name brands for cheap,5
8373,Love the idea of this app and use it all the time but don't expect to return anything because their return policy is pretty ridiculous.,3
8374,"Needs easier search filters, but quality and cleanliness of clothing is excellent. Packing/quality of items feels like purchasing brand new! Love it",5
8375,I spend too much money on this app lol,5
8376,Thred up never got back to me after I sent them an email. I wanted to return something but was totally unable to do so. Not happy with this.,1
8377,My fav thrift shop,5
8378,Best app ever! I love finding fashionable things at affordable prices!! Not just for me but for my daughter and SO as well!,5
8379,Find it to be fun and easy to get nice affordable clothes,5
8380,I love this app and all of the clothing. I would definitely recommend. However it can difficult finding things due to it being hard to narrow down the search.,4
8381,Its not easy to send anything back and what u bought didn't fit correctly as it said it would..only a few things have worked for me.,2
8382,The best app I've ever had!,5
8383,Love it! Easy! Inexpensive! Buy a new wardrobe for the price of one store bought item!,5
8384,I enjoy this app. Majority of the items are new or still fairly new. Great quality clothes and shoes. Great option to avoid fast fashion!,5
8385,Love pretty much everything I've gotten!!,5
8386,Love this company. Service is 1st class. Recommend to everyone.,5
8387,"I like thredUP app, it beats going to the thrift stores. You can be at home and, shop at your leisure.",5
8388,Waiting for selling bag to be processed. IT was received 11/23/2020. It is 3/1/21 and no update,1
8389,Shipping takes forever! FedEx sucks,3
8390,I love being able to look for thrift pieces from home and also save money. This is a great way to recycle old clothing or have it disposed of in a proper way. I've been using thred up for about 2 years and haven't had any real issues with the app with crashing or anything.,5
8391,Love the ability to set filters for items I'm looking for! Excellent for kids clothes!,5
8392,Thredup losing stars because fedex is garbage Ive been waiting almost a month for my order No more bundles for me Thred that,2
8393,Amazing deals and beautiful items!! App is very user friendly!!!,5
8394,"Decent prices, so many choices.",5
8395,Good finds at fantastic prices! Shopping with this app is fun and easy!,5
8396,Good app! Not much in plus size ware !,4
8397,I love Thredup and have been using for a couple years but the App has taken a huge turn. I have installed and uninstalled 10+ times and still no luck. It is having several issues and the latest won't even open. Please fix it so I can start shopping again!!! 😫,1
8398,I just started using this app and l love it!,5
8399,Haven't ordered anything yet. I heard lots of good things about this app. I was only wondering about return policies? What if the items sent dont fit? Do i pay for the postage? Although i seen some really nice things.,5
8400,I am more than happy with this website. The clothes are beautiful and priced right. And then when they add an extra discount it's hard to stop. My new favorite place to be.,5
8401,"Easy to use, good filtering options, easy checkout.",5
8402,So far its been great. Website is user friendly and the deals have me on here more than I like to say. I just made my first order and will follow up once I receive it.,5
8403,"Great variety, Very reasonable, love it💖",5
8404,"Love, love, love this app",5
8405,My favorite app to shop on by far,5
8406,"Great business. The website is a little clunky, but it is nice to get clothes here.",4
8407,Love the great quality,5
8408,"Not to sure about this app either? I'm thinking it's not going to be a app I enjoy, but I'm willing to learn.",2
8409,I am in love with this app. Everything I've bought is of good quality and matches the description. I recommend it to all my friends weekly.,5
8410,Easy to use. Excellent inventory. I love every shopping experience on thredUP.,5
8411,"Horrible app, doesn't let you ""cash out"" just keeps routing you in circles.",1
8412,As of 2/27 I have been refused assistance with a purchase that needs to be returned. My app took some kind of dump and wiped out my records to a certaiin date. It is not the money involved but the refusal to explore the difficulty. Any way I cannot use app ever again.,1
8413,I love this app and the philosophy for their business. I've purchased several times from thredup and was extremely satisfied every time.,5
8414,Update: Issues fixed. Now allow me to shop by shipping location 😁,4
8415,"I love thredup! The deals are fantastic, and I like the shipping tracker. Also enjoy that you get points as you buy, and can apply discounts to future purchases.",5
8416,Received my order. Really nice and packaged nice and arrived quickly!!,5
8417,Love this app! Great deals and easy to return if something doesn't fit.,5
8418,"I love this app, shipping can take a minute but it's good stuff and great deals",5
8419,This is my first time ordering clothes or anything online! What an easy way to navigate through.! I paid under a$100 for 2 blouses and 3 pairs of pants!,5
8420,I was very pleased with this thrift the prices was great wnd the qualty of the clothes was great over all very pleased with thred up!,5
8421,Have just run up on thredUP looks very interesting i will get back with you later on about enjoying the app and how much,5
8422,"So easy to use, love that you can save searches",5
8423,Great filters make it easy to customize what you're shopping for!,5
8424,Great purchases! Nice packaging! Good shipping time! Love it and will purchase again and again!,5
8425,"Easy shopping, easy returns, quality product!",5
8426,Boring,2
8427,Better than Poshmark because items are returnable.and shipping Can Be Free if you spend 75.00.,5
8428,Get what you pay for and more!,5
8429,Love this app! So many great deals. Excellent service.,5
8430,Very good but getting my package is taking a long time almist 3 weeks but other than that very good i love thredup,5
8431,"Used to be great.... not so much anymore. I've used thread-up for a little over 2 years. When I first signed up, lululemon items were around $30 each. I checked today and they're charging $80 for old legging styles that are in used condition. Keep in mind that *new* lululemon leggings today are $88 to $128! I used to love how affordable luxury brands were, but it seems that the execs have gotten greedy and upped prices excessively. I also agree with others in that the app is really glitchy.",2
8432,I have loved the items I got in the past but I recently ordered and most of my order was in poor condition. Goodwill quality but more expensive. Clothing looked better in the photos then in person. Hope the quality control improves.,3
8433,What happened to the measurements??? Please bring back! Otherwise a quality app with quality items.,4
8434,I'm really enjoying this app. Got my first beautiful shirt in today and I love it!,5
8435,"I started lovin' ThredUp. But bit by bit they change things that drags it down. Upped the $$ you have to spend for free shipping, return fees, extra fee from different warehouse, great point program but can't use them during a sale. Seven days for a bundle?! (Layaway) That's a joke! Now, one of the things I appreciated most about them, that they provided measurements, is gone! This is a huge drop for me! Sizes vary considerably even within the same brand. REALLY disappointed in them.",3
8436,Love the styles and they arrive super quick,5
8437,"Easiest thrift shopping ever and the selling process is easy to use :) Edit: Pricing seems to have evened out after the boom of popularity in thrifting. More great affordable options than ever! Thank you to the employees still working hard to process all of that clothing, get it priced, photographed etc. during Covid! I've worked at resale shops before and know it can be hard work.",5
8438,"Until a few minutes ago, I would have rated this a 5. However, as I was looking at long maxi dresses on the app, I noticed the lengths where no longer listed in the item description. For someone like me who is 5'9, I want to know how long the dress is. I thought the length was just missing for the dress u was looking at. However I clicked on 20 more dresses they all had no lengths listed. I hope you can bring this feature back.",2
8439,So easy to use.,5
8440,"ThredUp is actually very awesome have not been disappointed with my purchases, but the app is terrible. It crashes, doesn't search properly, notifications NEVER take you to the correct landing page. The app is frustrating, but again, to clarify Ihave found some very nice pieces for very reasonable prices.",2
8441,You can sell on it if you have six months to wait for them to have room for you to be on,1
8442,Nothing for men only boys. Jesuschrist,1
8443,Awsome app!!!!,5
8444,I love recycling clothes and keeping them out of landfills.,5
8445,LOVE,5
8446,This last item i bought was more beautiful than the item displayed. The item in the add looked great but in person it was gorgeous. Bought 3 tines now and perfect. Shoe box is way cool as well.,5
8447,Don't bother,1
8448,"Love to shop ThreadUp! The clothes are always, as described Great packaging materials to reuse. Going green means you need to be using ThreadUp. I would rate them a ten, if I could!",5
8449,"It's just like thrifting but online. I love the deals and most of the time, it's better quality than what you'd find in an actual thrift. Recommended to all friends, family, and clients.",5
8450,The clothes are always in good condition,4
8451,Had a hard time at first. It wouldnt let me put in my shipping address. They fixed it. Sometimes when theres a promo. It wont take it. They are almost impossible to reach. I had grown and unable to wear my usual size. I finally figured it out but got stuck w about $100. worth of clothes I cant wear,4
8452,Only way I shop for me Andy daughter so happy to see boys clothes too now I can add my son to the list.,5
8453,Getcha online name brand shopping wit a discount luv from the company when u order..check it out!!,5
8454,"ThreadUP is great - the search feature is the most detailed I have ever seen. You can search by type of garment, how used/new it is, pattern, color, price, length/sleeve length, style, neckline, fabric, brand etc. - ALL AT ONCE. If you want to see if there's a dress from Banana Republic that's blue polka dots, knee length, short sleeve, square neckline, made of cotton, like-new, and in your price range, you can do that. It's phenomenal. And I've loved the clothes I've bought. Will always buy!",5
8455,So far so good i have redone my sons wholewarderobe for barely anything great brands shopping has been fun,4
8456,Nice clothes,5
8457,I am really enjoying this App so far... I would definetly recommend trying it out!!! I especially like the manner in which the items are shipped!!,5
8458,Great items and priced,5
8459,"I cant make it to the Thrift stores nowadays thanks to Covid, but this is the next best thing! Love it!!!!",5
8460,"I love this web-based thrift shop! I get to see the front and back of every item, and the filters are a huge help, as I am extremely particular about my clothing. LOVE IT!",5
8461,This is my first time using it and I will definitely be using it more,5
8462,Love it ❤️ love it ❤️,5
8463,Easy to order. Can't wait to receive!,5
8464,"My app freezes, and I see some notification but I don't know how to find it. It would be nice if there was a button that allowed customers to chat with the company when questions arise.",2
8465,Good experience over all..,4
8466,Best way to buy clothes,5
8467,Id like to see motr hi tops vsns n Levi s,5

8469,Trying to find jewelry boxes not having any luck,1
8470,Love this app so much! I've found so many gems for my wardrobe!! Thanks Thredup!,5
8471,Best deals on designer clothes. Quality for cheap,5
8472,"Very easy to browse, shop, and purchase. 👍👍 MROX",5
8473,Items are great..just sent some boxes too..so i wait!,5
8474,Thrift shops are knowm for low prices. This is amything but that.,2
8475,I love being able to find new clothes for an affordable price. I also like that I can search for brands that are no longer in stores like Aeropostal,5
8476,"Easy to use and the layout is great! However, this app often closes out on me for no reason, or will freeze up.",4
8477,I love it,5
8478,Easy to shop on with perfect fit filters!,5
8479,"They don't buy or sell Men's clothing, only Women's and Kid's. As of February 2021, their current processing time is 15 weeks, unless you agree to have $12 deducted from your earnings, then they will process your shipment in just 3 weeks.",3
8480,Love it!,5
8481,Great prices.... I found my wedding shoes!!!! There isn't anything I've order that I've had a complaint about.,5
8482,Thred up received my clothes about 5 months ago and just now sent me a notification that they can't find my items. They gave me an $18 credit which doesn't even cover over item! 😡,1
8483,Love it!,5
8484,Love this app❤️❤️❤️,5
8485,Prices still don't beat walk in thrift stores.,1
8486,"Amazing app! Not only they sell beatiful and affordable clothes, they are helping with a huge problem. I think everyone should buy used clothes because of the inmense environmental impact that signifies! Thank you ThredUP!",5
8487,"Would love to use this app but everytime I try to download it, it constantly tries to makw me log in through facebook and keeps popping up on my screen to promt me to log into facebook. I DO NOT USE FACEBOOK. So there is no way for me to use the app. U installed again. Whack.",1
8488,I love the brand names thredup offers at affordable prices.,5
8489,"Glitches and crashes but works. It's more user-friendly to browse the app than the desktop site, but you will have to put up with bugs. Examples: won't always show all of your saved items. Push notifications and email links to specific topics always just go to main page. My bundle showed 1 day left, but when I went to bundle status, it said there was no bundle. Honestly, if the app wasn't so easy in its search functions and checkout, I would probably rate it 2 stars.",3
8490,"I ordered a pair of free people shorts and a gypsie rose bag and I have to say I was throughly disappointed with what I received. Neither items looked like the items I ordered, both items came in completely different colors than what the images showed. I'm also shocked to find that not only do they charge a restocking fee, but if you want to return and get a full refund on an item you have to pay $8.99 for a return label. This should be mentioned before someone purchases.",1
8491,Maybe later. No mens items.,1
8492,Decent items available,5
8493,"Love shopping with thredUp. Have told everyone who will listen about it. Constantly get compliments on the clothes I'm wearing. Still obsessed. Love the easy return policy when something isn't quite right (color, size). $MONEY$ for your clothes OR donate!! Much love.",5
8494,This app works very well. I love the programs that Thread Up offers.,5
8495,Easy to navigate.,5
8496,"I love Thred Up they have awesome deals, and a wonderful selection and filters to help you find exactly what you want!",5
8497,Great!,5
8498,"It is okay, but i have some suggestions. Please allow users to filter dresses by sleeve length. Many people like myself are not allowed to wear sleeveless or strapless dresses to work and i have to look at tons of them when searching dresses. Please allow users to filter rompers out when looking at shorts. Again, i cannot wear rompers to work and it take so much time to look for shorts when i just keep seeing rompers. ROMPERS ARE NOT SHORTS. Allow us to filter them out or put them with dresses.",3
8499,I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled with my goody box.. I liked everything in it except the pants which were pretty close to my style as well,5
8500,I havent shopped yet but I am,5
8501,"Descent for pre-owned clothes. Wish there was a filter for length or width of clothing items. Have purchased a few items now. Had to return 2 items, one was my mistake (didn't pay attention to the width of the chest area) but the other item had stains. Was still charged the return fee for that one. Also whoever completes the description needs to be more accurate. Item list as black it was gray. Will keep it but was disappointed.",3
8502,Amazing!,5
8503,"First off, I love ThredUp. Love how they take returns, free shipping. Very fast and great quality. Dislike lack of customer service and how the app itself constantly crashes, freezes almost every time I use it, and I can't ever just see my bundle. I have to wait days to get my bundle to ship or update. Very frustrating. Please make a change to this guys!!",3
8504,Didn't use the app,5
8505,Search filters rarely work. Purchasing the wrong size is very easy to do with this ap.,1
8506,Received my first shipment. Size 8 is a little loose on me normally. I bought 8's and I could even get them past my knees. There is no way the sizing was correct.,3
8507,"I have over 800 rewards points that I can see on my rewards tab, but when I try to access it from my account, it always says I have zero. Additionally, I have a bundle in waiting, but when I try to access it from my account, it says I don't have any bundles. It seems multiple mechanics from the account tab are broken or simply don't work, and it's really frustrating. I've never used rewards before, and I would really like to. But since I can't access it, I guess I won't be able to.",2
8508,"I think it is wrong, and bad business when i order and don't receive all items purchased. I'am still tracking one of my items that show it never reached ups for delivery. 🤔😒",2
8509,"Easy to use app, love to find sales on items I like..",5
8510,Found lots of great items! Easy filters and good photos,5
8511,It's good so far. Update: love the clothes I've received. Love shopping on the app. The app does have lots of different problems that a lot a people have talked about. I still love shopping on the app though.,3
8512,Great deals to browse with,4
8513,Please put this on nicole t lavare cellphone but do not not allowed no hackers and no viruses into my private informationandmy that don't belong to them and not allowed to go into all my apps that already been installed into my cellphone that are protected and secured into my cellphone,5
8514,"The app is great, however the ""bundle"" feature does not work. When I go to see my bundle, it says I have no active bundle. This causes me to have to wait the full 7 days for my items to ship instead of being able to ship when I'm ready..😒",4
8515,Placed my first order with ThredUP and was very pleased with my product and shipping. I will come back to order again!,5
8516,Awesome variety of practically new clothing!!!,5
8517,App crashes in Android often. This affected my choice to keep shopping there.,2
8518,Havent ordered yet,5
8519,"Never a problem, easy to order!",5
8520,Love shopping- so easy and reasonable- can replace or freshen your wardrobe on a budget. Highly recommend,5
8521,"I love ThredUp! It is easy to search for your sizes and the descriptions, measurements and pictures of the clothing let you really know what you're purchasing. Returns are super easy if something doesn't fit or you end up not liking it. Very easy to see and manage your rewards, orders and returns. Plus, shopping used clothing is better for the environment!",5
8522,Great app. I would like to be notified when I am able to donate. It always say closed for now,5
8523,"Seems lovely! I just wish there were selections for men as well. The app looks very nice, and I'm sure people are finding great clothes! But no luck for me here sadly :(",3
8524,"I love ThredUp because I'm super picky about Jeans! But, It's really hit or miss! Just because they say the Jeans are a certain size, doesn't mean they are! Good return policy though. I love ThredUp! For jeans!",4
8525,"Search leaves things to be desired. Hard to switch categories. Would love to search a brand in a ""baby"" or ""toddler"" category I don't care if my baby is wearing a ""girl"" solid color onesie... And selling is far from worth it. I earned 17¢ for two like new Victoria's Secret sports bras. What a joke.",2
8526,Love the clothes I get at great prices,5
8527,Great app unbeleivable prices,5
8528,Me and my daughter love this app,5
8529,"I love thrifting with ThredUp, however it would be better if the options were accurate. If I select to see blue tops I shouldn't get a variety of other colors. Other than that ThredUp is the best!",4
8530,"I ordered a pair of shoes that appeared to be in wonderful shape. However, I had to give them a thorough cleaning before I even attempted to try them on. They looked like they had been worn, taken off, and sent to me. On a positive note, they are in good shape, and they came in a very timely manner.",3
8531,"My experience with this company is horrible!!! I sent in a clean out bag in August of 2020, they recieved it on 9-09-2020. I understand that they are behind due to Covid. My bag has been pushed further and further behind and I recieved a notice this morning on 2-17 2021 that my bag will not be processed until 11-30-2021! 14 months to process 1 bag?!?! Bad business and reported their Georgia company to The Better Businesses Bureau!!!!! DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!",1
8532,I love threadUP! I tell everyone about it.,5
8533,Very satisfactory.,5
8534,"I found a beautiful dress for an excellent price. I haven't received it yet, but so far my experience has been great.",4
8535,Love the prices,5
8536,"Seems great for buying so far. Very fun to scroll thru items and only see things in your size. I wish I could have more pictures on minor wear and tear, but I understand that's probably a huge undertaking.",5
8537,"If I can put zero I will put it. I cleaned out my close, sent alot of stuff to sell it. They sell one piece at least 15 dollar to 40 dollars and give me 1 or 2 dollars for the piece. What I got is 2 dollars and I don't know where the items they didn't sell. Also I can't even take the 2 dollars. Every time I tried the application take me to the shopping part. I am so disappointed. I prefer to donate my stuff and they don't take it.",1
8538,Easy to use and offers an amazing shopping experience,5
8539,"Sounded like a great app, but unfortunately there was not a single listing for the item I am interested in. I consider cloth diapers clothing, so I don't really get why it's not on here. Just not for me, maybe I'll try it again at later date.",3
8540,The description and condition of the clothes I have purchased are accurate. I am very pleased with my experience and purchases. I will continue to buy from threadup!!,5
8541,I absolutely love this app and store. I have made multiple purchases that were all great buys. 👍,5
8542,"Quality control needs to be improved, much more expensive than other online thrift stores, customer service is not as good as should be.",2
8543,"I have had great experiences with buying but selling is taking forever. It should be a quicker process because thredup winds up losing ultimately. I shop often and buy alot of items but I don't plan on buying anything else until I see how much credit I get from selling my items. The longer they take, the less money they make from me. 🤷‍♀️",4
8544,An online thrift store where searching for the right item is much easier and cheaper,5
8545,i dont want this app,1
8546,Love love love it,5
8547,Amazing in love it going to order something soon as o I ll let u know,4
8548,Great prices easy to order website,5
8549,"I'm on a weight loss journey, and all my clothes are to big, but I'm not at a healthy weight yet, so I need ""in between"" clothes - this is so much better than buying new!",5
8550,"I love this app! I'm absolutely addicted to it, it's easy to use and it is addicting, I love the amazing one of a kind finds and the prices are fantastic. they're even better when they're on sale!",5
8551,Love this site. I will be buying again after I get my first shipment and see my order.,5
8552,I wish there was more detailed description of each listing,5
8553,It's like thrift store shopping from home! Love everything I've gotten and they've been amazing when there were minor mistakes made about making it super easy for me to deal with it!,5
8554,Easy App to navigate and great company. Always great quality clothes at amazing prices.,5
8555,"The past 2 times I have ordered things, the next day I check the status of my order and they have been cancelled. Idk why this keeps happening to me. And if course I'm not notified so I'm just waiting on and order that never comes. I used to order from this site all the time with zero problems. But lately I'm very disappointed and if they would tell me why this keeps happening or why I can't order anything from this site, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1
8556,"Can't sign up. It only will allow an account from a Google or Amazon account, which it won't take either and I can't sign up separately just using an email.",1
8557,"I've used thredup for awhile, and I've never had an issue. However, now that I need maternity clothes, there is no way to filter to only see maternity clothes. You can include maternity, but since there are far fewer maternity items, it takes a lot longer to scroll through. It wouldn't be a difficult filter to add. Edit to add: you can now filter on maternity.",5
8558,Great app and easy to use.,5
8559,EVERYTHING was sooo ugly. I won't waste my time with this app ever again. Peace - out,1
8560,"A Middleman Mindset App -- licensed thievery, if you ask me,-- middlemen pilfering profits to line their pockets, gross mishandling justified by terms & agreements. Providing a consignment marketplace for people to sell their personal property should necessitate that service is both consumer-based & effective. Neither is the case here. ""Regrettably"" is the word wielded against any & all complaints. No reachable customer service, no recourse-- procuring profits pedaling other people's property.",1
8561,Love the quality of the items I've purchased.,5
8562,Took me a while to figure out how the checkout worked But it will be my go to for all my shopping. Awesome site!,5
8563,"So hooked!!! Returns are easy, rewards are great, prices even better! This app has amazing customer service and they really do take the guessing and gambling out of online shopping. You are guaranteed to get a phenomenal deal or your money back ( minus a $1.99 restocking fee). Plus, they ship very quickly!",5
8564,Fair Prices .. Well Kept Product .. Love Them 🤞🏼🛩,5
8565,"Great selection. When clothes come shipped, you open a beautiful package, and you feel like you just shopped at a great boutique clothing store.",5
8566,Loving it!!!,5
8567,I hope that they bring men clothing.,2
8568,"Great prices, and I am pleased with all of the items I have purchased.",5
8569,I love this company and the app is so easy to use!!,5
8570,Like the app. Shop all the time with it. Would help if the listings told whether or not an item has pockets.,5
8571,Easy to navigate with tons of options and filters,5
8572,I love it!!,5
8573,"It's discouraging when you choose to log out then try to log back in, the only option is to log in with an email address. I log in with my facebook credentials. So then I have to log in through the website. Defeats the purpose of having the ""convenience"" of using the app.",1
8574,Easy and fun to use,5
8575,I absolutely love this app/Buisness!! I love the idea of getting name brand high end clothing....like new...for yard sale prices!! Whats not to love!! Awesome Idea! I'll be a supporter for life ❤,5
8576,"This is coming from an alt person who doesn't like shopping, but if I'm honest, this app is... AMAZING!! Its perfect for alternative finds like gothic or hippie. I ordered some clothes about 1 day ago and ive had 2 large orders already ship! The filters are amazing and it makes it easy to navigate your way around! They stock up every single day which is amazing. It's also a huge plus that this app exists so I dont have to go out during the pandemic! Tysm!💕",5
8577,I buy all my clothes thru here now. You can find great clothing at affordable prices! Highly recommend.,5
8578,The seller gave the wrong size and I had no option to return it,1
8579,"When you ask someone if they would like to shop similar styles maybe just go ahead and show those styles in their sizes too. It doesn't make a person feel good to see really cute clothes that are way too frickin small! ""Hey yeah those jean's you wanted to get are gone now but here's a bunch of other jeans you can't get either."" Come on your obviously smart people. Why are you stopping just short of the finish line.",3
8580,Love it,5
8581,Love it! User friendly and keeps you up to date on deals!,5
8582,"As a thrifter, I've never enjoyed browsing racks of clothes this much. The layout is well done ✅",5
8583,ThredUp is incredibly easy to use; and definitely worth using to buy first-rate stylish clothing at affordable prices.,5
8584,"You lose money having to pay for shipping if you need to send it back. Costs too much to return items. Free shipping over $75 is crazy and the presentation of the clothing isn't good. Wont be ordering anything else on here, basically taking your money.",2
8585,Great app!,5
8586,It is so nice to see examples of clothes at such great prices. I love suggestions they make. I bought three items from the app the first time I used it on my tablet. I also tried a goody box from my laptop. It was so much fun trying on the clothes picked out for me. Returning items was easy. All around fun for someone who doesn't enjoy clothes shopping in stores.,5
8587,Always delighted with my orders. Appreciate the prices.,5
8588,I love shopping On my Thred Up app! The cutest clothes and low prices! I'm addicted :),5
8589,easy to use site! great selection! lots of options! great prices! I'm addicted!,5
8590,"great app, great company and clothes",5
8591,"The first experience; they didn't receive my first bag I sent in. And did NOTHING to make up for it. I ordered another bagto give them a second try so we'll see how it goes,.,...",1
8592,Great clothes. Great experiences 👏👌,5
8593,"Love this app, they have the biggest selection on just about anything your looking for, i also love how the clothes always come very neat and clean almost look brand new.",5
8594,I really love this app. So far everything I have purchased has been in great condition. And I love the way it is packaged too.,5
8595,Love the variety of brands and that you can find clothes in such great condition! Also great for buying clothes for kids since they grow so fast!,5
8596,I enjoy this app its easy and another fun way to shop,5
8597,😀,5
8598,"Overall good, the refresh is a bit sluggish.",4
8599,Constantly links are not working and the user experience is mediocre at best.,3
8600,Clothes are nice and fit to size!,5
8601,"This app is fun to browse through, but good luck finding something specific. You *cannot enter anything too specific, or you'll get completely irrelevant results, if anything. I searched ""peplum"" and found some tops, but tried ""beret"" and just found more tops 😐 it only lets you search for types of items or whatever random categories it comes up with.",3
8602,Great deals!,5
8603,"Bought a dress, new with tags. It came with tags, on the inside of the dress and all the beading falling off. It had definitely been worn. I sent it back over 10 days ago and still not refunded.",1
8604,Like the stuffi need large sizes,4
8605,I found just what I was looking for. Check it out.,5
8606,Couldn't sign up,1
8607,No clothing for male gender. 😬,1
8608,"This company is a total rip off. High prices, and minimal rewards. Support your local thrift shop.",1
8609,Need to have more choices for the plus size community,4
8610,LOVE IT!!!,5
8611,Easy to navigate,5
8612,"💚. Good, green deals. Appreciate price and having it delivered to my house. Clean out bags whether for donation or consignment are KEY for this aspiring minimalist 🙂 Would like a better way to sort inseam but overall great assortment of brands & sizes.",5
8613,"I ordered 3 dresses and 2 pair of platform sandals, and omg the dresses are absolutely beautifull everything fits perfect the material is thick I just Very Happy!!! 5 star all the way! Plus fast delivery!",5
8614,God's is good... Sorry don't know what to write... I just downloaded,5
8615,"Good price and quality pieces, for thigh budget.",5
8616,I love the ease of navigating the site and the prices are amazing.,5
8617,"I am a shopper not a seller. 5/5* I honestly started buying from thredup because it was used and i didnt want to buy fast fashion anymore but didn't have the money for ethically sourced clothing. So my alternative was used. I've bought 3 hauls from them now, and all were amazing except for 1 item. I was Very disappointed especislly since it was a sale item and said cannot send back. But i sent them photos and my feelings on it and they refunded me and told me i dont need to send them the jeans!",5
8618,I got my order in reasonable. Time and merchandise was excellent,4
8619,"I love this app and Thredup overall. Easy to use, never any glitches and their products and customer service is excellent.",5
8620,Monica Lewinsky jk,5
8621,"My 1st time on this app. The app itself worked so far, but I was just browsing. The presentation of the clothing was HORRIBLE. They are wrinkled, on a mannequin with the sleeves hanging & deflated. I couldn't get past the garage sale, ""I don't care"" presentation. Some of the prices appeared reasonable, but some unrealistic. Free shipping over $75 is a bit over the top. I'm a country girl & I don't mind 2nd hand clothes at all, but this is a turn off. I'll pass on this one.",2
8622,Over priced items. Kids pants are way cheaper at Walmart and even less at local stores. I'm not gonna pay $10 for a pair of kids jeans when I can get them for $2-4 at my local thrift store.,1
8623,Love this app/store!! I have ordered plenty of things from here and I have been nothing but satisfied with every single piece I bought in great quality everything is been in great condition with no blemishes no stains no reps I can't complain hands down it's the best store I shop at online,5
8624,Love the UI and filters! I can find what I'm looking for easily. It's been great for replacing my favorite items that have worn out. I've always enjoyed that feeling of stumbling upon a one of a kind find.,5
8625,"Great quality items, easy to return items that don't fit as expected, easy to check status of orders.",5
8626,I like what I'm getting and the money im saving,5
8627,"You can pick up some great deals on some clothes. But, shop carefully. When you are purchasing an item like this and only get 2 pictures and limited description, it's hard to know exactly what you are getting. Customer service is not great though. Don't expect to be texted back during chats unless you're willing to devote hours to waiting for a trsponse.",3
8628,"Overall, a great app, but I'd love for there to be a subcategory for wide and extra wide calf boots! They're basically impossible to find. I'm having to scroll through boatloads of boot listings to find the few that are out there and even then, it doesn't list the calf circumference.",4
8629,"Used to love this app, but now it won't let me move past the login screen. I login on the desktop version with my Facebook account and that option isn't available on the app interface so I just can't use this on my phone.",1
8630,Awesomeness at ur fingertips. This has been my go-to shopping tool since Covid hit! I love the quality and deals I find not to mention the opportunity to make a few bucks on items in my closet. I always say someone's giveaways can be someone's treasures. Enjoy shopping 🛍,5
8631,"I love the fact that I get to enjoy superb quality clothing at superbly low prices! Also, It has been my experience that the description of the condition of each piece is exact.",5
8632,"The store is great, the app is user-friendly. However, it constantly freezes or shuts down. I know it's not my phone bc all of my other apps work just fine. It's just this one & I have no idea why. So... I typically just use it to look around & ♡ things. I don't do anything complex, i.e.: create a customized search. It's a nice distraction while waiting for appts or anywhere else you're sitting stagnate & want something to do.",2
8633,💕 it,5
8634,I love everything I've ordered and fit and size is right to what I ordered. Everything has been like new or with tags still on it.,5
8635,Love this app! Super easy to use and makes me feel good to buy gently used clothing to have less of a carbon footprint.,5
8636,I really enjoy thredUP. Really quick shipments.,5
8637,"Amazing, I love it, would give 5 stars but the app is a little glitchy",4
8638,"Cute things, somewhat easy process to order. But has taken over a week to get anything I ordered and I needed the kits to come in by now. Not helpful.",3
8639,"I LOVE, LOVE this! I am on my third order and everything is always really nice. I have yet to have an item that I didn't love. All the clothes fit and look beautiful, and the best part is I'm filling my closet with name brand outfits for way less. I also feel better knowing that these outfits are not ending up in a land fill somewhere, but are given a second chance on making someone else look beautiful. Thank you Thread Up! keep making the world a more beautiful place, one outfit at a time!",5
8640,Great place to buy nice designer clothes...,5
8641,"I ordered 18 pieces of clothing from the app, I was of course leary but took that chance. The 40% off for first time order was awesome!! My package arrived 2 days earlier then expected, and everything was as described or better, great first time order!! Will update after next order. UPDATED 02/09/21 have ordered 3 times in the last month and every thing was as great as the first time, even better because I got 50% off, everything arrived as described in wonderful condition, very happy!",5
8642,Great clothes...good quality and great deals. Worth getting clothes for any size and style.👍,5
8643,"Like the variety and the ease of ordering. Shipping is scattered, UPS/FedEx and postal services. I have placed 2 large orders so far with only 1 return (Heels were too big) otherwise satisfied. Each order came in multiple packages via each shipping company. I have recommended this company. 8/10",4
8644,THE BEST APP EVER,5
8645,Most of my work wardrobe is now second hand,5
8646,"MY daughter turned me on to this great way to buy, sell, and donate . ThredUp is the best way to save time and help the planet while having the secondhand clothes that are in the wardrobe I never imagined having.",5
8647,"The app has been significantly improved but there are still some UI details. On the desktop and mobile app, some items automatically remain under favorites even when they have not been selected. To work around this, you need to select the heart and deselect it and then refresh the browser or pull down on the app. Under saved, the categories ""All"" and ""available"", the text header fits. The text header for ""unavailable"" does not fit in a smaller screen display.",4
8648,The fact they don't have a # for custom service is one reason I rate a 3. #2 reason is some orders are not true to the measurements.,3
8649,"Great shirts, great prices",5
8650,Super cool thrift store online,5
8651,I love this site and the people that I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Hours pass when I'm here!,4
8652,Everything comes as described.. Reasonable prices. User friendly,5
8653,Love it,5
8654,Love this app they are very reasonable pricing and wonderful merchandise,5
8655,"I signed up and was immediately given a substantial percentage off of my first order total, and got in on Thread Up's free shipping. This is a premier site for the kind of clothes every woman wants to wear, for great prices. I am mad about this site and intend to shop it a lot! UPDATE; FEB 07, 2021 App still running smoothly, site is so user friendly, prices are fair and I am still crazy about this app and ThredUP's products. This app has never frozen up on me!",5
8656,Not really what I expected.,2
8657,Amazing,5
8658,Just tried it for the first time. Easy to start looking. Thanks CB Anaheim Ppp,5
8659,Love all the clothes. Very good selection.,5
8660,"I love the unique, fabulous styles that are to be found on the thredUp website. Shopping is fun with thredUp.",5
8661,Easy to use but needs improvement on the search of brands and items,4
8662,Love the choices,5
8663,"They purposly position clothing to hide tears and runs in clothing I spent $12.50 (I believe I know it was just under $13.00) on a pair of pants my son cant even wear I went back to the picture in the listing to see if I had just not noticed it but it wasnt my fault, they folded the back of the pants so the huge section that was damaged was folded under so it couldn't be seen. Very disappointing and certianly a bad first impression since the discription said "" could be mistaken for brand new""",2
8664,Awesome App! I love all the clothes I have gotten.,5
8665,Awesome,5
8666,Love it!!!!. 💯💝🌷💝...,5
8667,"Been great so far. Perfect for my single mom budget. I have loved every thing I have ordered from there. I wish they would make some changes to the selling area but overall great products, great prices",5
8668,This is a wonderful option for people that love getting cool clothes from thrift stores. There is so much to choose from and the customer service is great. I have been shopping with them for almost a year now and the only complaint I have is that you can only use one promo code at a time. I cannot understand why you cannot use a reward code that you earned along with the code for the sale. If I see a sale item I would like to get it for the sale price.,4
8669,"Love this company and all they stand for! Although, it would be so awesome if I could sort my favorites (in app and online). I like that I can see available vs unavailable/sold, but it would be *perfect* to be able to sort my faves by price, size, keyword/type of clothing... When making final purchases, it would help me decide what to get now vs later. I'd give this app 5 stars with that change, because ThredUp is SUCH a great way to find and feel good about awesome brand name pieces for less!",3
8670,"Great place to buy , but I wasn't crazy about selling there. Payout is super small.",4
8671,I bought my first time I have not received it yet it is a purse and it was a great price and I got the $0.54 off for my first time buying I cannot wait to receive it it was exactly what I was looking for and have not been able to find for many years,5
8672,"Bought 3 pairs of jeans, the fit was perfect, I will definitely buy more from ThreadUp",5
8673,So cool ! I LOVE it ! Thank you !,5
8674,Site does not work most of the time.,1
8675,I love this app!!so fun to shop and great quality!!,5
8676,This is a very affordable fun website! Easy way to bargain shop with lots of brand name items but the shipping is slow and could be processed quicker. I would love to work with you i have many ideas for your website.,5
8677,"I've used thredup a TON since I haven't been able to go thrifting in 2020. Love the service, great selection, and the app works well too. The only thing that really makes me hesitate is that they don't offer the waist measurements on skirts. So annoying! It makes me avoid buying skirts unless I've tried the brand before.",4
8678,"Better for the environment, your wallet, and so much easier than buying in the store.",5
8679,"Searches are not user friendly and the parameters are apparently so restrictive that the results are dissapointing. The mininal results of multiple searches just aren't worth my time and effort. This coming from a woman who loves to browse online. I get much more accurate, abundant and satisfying search results from Poshmark, Mercari and Etsy. They seem limited to conservative, office style, old lady clothing If you like young, edgy styles this isn't the shopping site for you.",1
8680,Great pictures of items. Wonderful supply. Awesome prices. Easy ordering. Love the points system. Very nice packaging. Prompt delivery. I'm on this app everyday! Love it!!,5
8681,I downloaded the app multiple times and every single time the app would never open,1
8682,Excelent I love it,5
8683,Love ordering clothes from Thredup. So far I've had know problems with the company or clothing. My orders come in on time and I haven't had to send anything back. App is easy to use.,5
8684,Love this app...there are so many cool things!,5
8685,"Good so far. Just made my first order, but not received it as yet.",5
8686,I love this app!,5
8687,I just placed my order and so far I think it's AWESOME!!!,5
8688,Mucha variedad y la funcionalidad de busqueda ayuda mucho,5
8689,I received an item that is not exactly how the clothes was described. If I return I will loose $8.99 plus $1.99 of re stock fee. I am extremely disappointed. I wish I could have my full refund. I will be fine with the $1.99.,1
8690,"From the seller side, I have not been impressed. Sent in 44 brand new, tags still on most, items and 17 sold with a grand total of $18. Would have gotten $22 taking it to the local consignment shop with a lot less headache and without waiting 6 months for the payout. Maybe it would have been better if we weren't in COVID.",2
8691,App sucks. It wont work on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10. Wth!?!?!,2
8692,I won't order from Thread Up again. Most of my order didn't fit my kids. I think one shirt out of a $70 order. I put their sizes in the search field and what came up should have fit. Very disappointed.,1
8693,They offer a discount and then charge full amount so dont fall for 50 percent off first purchase,1
8694,Great website!,5
8695,Prices are a lil high but overall like the items,4
8696,This app is sweet. Great place to find awesome one of a kinds and lux items. Love it.,5
8697,Great choices,5
8698,This app makes shopping resale so incredibly easy and enjoyable. The more from seller and alike pieces is also a great feature. Love Thread Up since they first started and they are only getting better.,5
8699,"Love this app and this company! Absolutely amazing prices for any item of women's clothes you could dream of! They literally have any brand you can think of, though it does vary from time to time due to the fact that they sell used clothing and rely on send ins. Free shipping and up to 55% discount on your first purchase, you can't beat that! Very easy app to navigate as well!! 5 stars!",5
8700,love to recycle!! its a win win !!,5
8701,"Variety of styles and brands are endless, there's something for everyone.",5
8702,It's very reasonable and sometimes less. Easy to use unlike some online sales.,5
8703,"Love this app, the clothes and especially the prices!",5
8704,"There is something for everyone! The pricing is just right. I've made several orders and have always been delighted. I recommend it to anyone who likes to shop and get great deals, and who wants quality used clothing. Just try it!",5
8705,Easy to make purchases that are described in detail and accurately.,5
8706,Awesome,5
8707,Easy shoppimg experience with quality finds!!,5
8708,Incredible prices. Love it,5
8709,Love it.,5
8710,"Priced more like a consignment store than thrift store but I really enjoy thred up. The reason I give it three stars is the app is more than a little wonky at times, but the website has so many things I enjoy just looking and usually end up purchasing something.",3
8711,Saving money saving earth it's just a win win,5
8712,"Overall, the app offers easy browsing with helpful filters, but there is a disconnect after one of the last updates. When I click a notification, it opens the app and takes me to the home screen. However that screen does not reference to the item or promo code from the notification. This has been frustrating, because I've lost some promo codes that way. Most recently, the app didn't recognize my shipping bundle when I clicked it, and I had to log in on a browser to ship my bundle.",3
8713,"I spent $20 on xl exercise pants that could fit a child not a woman who's 5'7"". If I return them, I can only get a refund of $9. This is a theft. It's supposed to save you money, but it steals your money instead. Not happy at all.",1
8714,"So many name brand clothes, so low prices. Always putting an order in. Must see for yourselves",5
8715,It's awesome!! I love it!! I love it!!,5
8716,Excellent customer service! Beth went above and beyond TWICE to help me out! This is the kind of service that keeps customers coming back!,5
8717,Hi. My name is Jaida. Wilson I am a fashion designer and I am trying this app. I hate it. I hate this app it's slow unsteady and I hate it. The first thing I bought took a year to be delivered and it doesn't even look nice or anywhere near what it looked like it smells terrible!,1
8718,Very easy to use.,5
8719,thredUP is a pleasure!,5
8720,It was easy and quick. I will be coming back.,5
8721,"I've been shopping here since they first came on line. Here, I can find quality items at discount prices. I love it!",5
8722,Awesome 👌,5
8723,Great finds for great prices and less junk on the planet.,5
8724,Was very disappointed my size 23 was about a size one will never order again re turn shipping would cost me as much ad my purchase almost said 23 on a i side lable but was not size lable,1
8725,This store does not refund your money back when you return the items,1
8726,No where for new users to sign up. Only for existing customers! Please fix!!,1
8727,👌 nice,5
8728,Great servíce to have,5
8729,Very neat was able to find what I need.,5
8730,The only place I buy clothes these days. I'm in love with this app!,5
8731,Amazing app No regrets,5
8732,"My order was discounted. All three items. And I was unable to get the promo code.To get my discount. Also my order prices, I don't understand the Total. So please explain why I did not get the discount mark down prices on my order. This will be the only order l will be placing with your company. Please Explain!",3
8733,Awesome,5
8734,"Love this App! I've been using ThredUp for a while now, and I have gotten a few friends to use it as well. I get a lot of compliments on the things I have that are ThredUp purchases, and plan to continue to shop with them. I love their Clean Out kits as well (I need to start ordering more than one kit at a time), but they come in super handy. ❤️❤️❤️",5
8735,Lame search ability and not much of interest for sale anyway. G'bye.,1
8736,Every item I have ordered has arrived in a timely manner and been exactly as described on the app. Easy to navigate and use. Very pleased.,4
8737,All just really ugly stuff.,1
8738,"The best in prices, thank you, later.",5
8739,I don't care for this platform. I get bored easily and can't find what I'm looking for,3
8740,I ordered 2 sweatshirts and they came in good time and matched the way they looked online!,5
8741,good,5
8742,So far just looking...pandemic isn't there 01/31/2021,5
8743,"I sent in a Clean out bag, sold some items, and have a payout which I can eithe spend in app or cash out via PayPal. However, when I click the cash out button, it will send me to Chrome for half a second and redirect me to tab in ThredUp where you order your clean out bag. I have not been able to get my cash out.",3
8744,Sent bundle in November using their label. Haven't heard a word since. They do not answer emails. Guess I'm out a bunch of blouses....,1
8745,I love this site! They have great clothes at really great prices !! It's worth checking out!!!,5
8746,It was was amazing and great..Shoping for new and used clothes and etc. Thank yous for your services.,5
8747,Oh so efficient,5
8748,I have been waiting for nearly 3 months to get any word on the huge lot of clothes I sent in. The status of my bag returned has stayed on received and that is it. I've contacted twice to get pushed further and further out. Unacceptable. I feel like my clothes were just stolen.,1
8749,"It looks like a very solid operation with a variety of choices, but the lack of having a section for men's clothing and accessories is a rather huge disappointment. Maybe something for you to consider and branch out towards other target consumers.",2
8750,Add a men's section!,5
8751,Prices to much for the clothes,1
8752,Just got my order. Opened it. Loved it! Thanks!,5
8753,Love it,5
8754,Love the clothes! Love the awesome picks! Good job!,5
8755,Love it!! Have gotten 12 pairs of awesome heels for under $140 🤩,5
8756,It was great,5
8757,"Great items and even greater prices. However, pics should also include inside pictures of purses and wallets.",5
8758,"I love the idea of this app. It's hard to find clothes at thirft stores that are trendy. Unfortunately, this is the case here as well. The clothes in my size are just ugly. As a reply, no. You just gave very low standards for your clothing. Your terms are so high (clothes have to be in good condition, trendy, etc.) but it's not reflected in your dirty, old, worn-out clothing selection. Maybe takes some notes from other thrift store sites so you can keep up.",1
8759,"Great deals, and there are always new items to discover. Plus, the process to sell items is so simple! A win, win!",5
8760,If i could give them a 0 star rateing i would. Sent them 2 boxes and kept lots of my clothes. To put it playn and simple this place is just THIEVES. They steel your items and only they profit from it. Horriblr customer service. Just a terrible expirience. NEVER EVER AGAIN!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
8761,"All the clothes I have ever ordered have been 100% as seen and described from the details section and true to size. Ordering is a BREEZE. Customer Service is AMAZING. Shipping is on time and well packaged. Great for shopping on a budget. I love this place... I could write a book on all the great things I could say with my experience as a shopper with threadUP* Its a must for shopping. I'd give 1,000 starts if I could. Xoxo",5
8762,I like everything but cart time it should be 24 hours,4
8763,"Thred Up is great, the stocking fee isn't. I love buying thrifted items but not all clothing brand's sizes match. That being said, sometimes you have to return an item. The only problem is the restocking fee is $1.99! Now that might not sound like a lot but if the jeans you bought are $10 you're literally losing money with every return. I understand it costs money to have someone retake photos and post it again but could it be more like $0.50 cents? It makes you not want to buy used anymore....",3
8764,"I didn't like it at all. First you have to send your stuff to them and wait for it to be graded by their ""experts"" and whatever they decide not to keep you either pay $13 to get your stuff back or donate it to a charity of their choosing. I'm not sure if you get the price that your item actually sells for. But I do that ThreadUp's prices are absolutely ridiculously high.",1
8765,Absolutely love the APP and that they sell used brand name clothing at drastically reduce prices. Every item i received has been in perfect condition and exactly as pictured. Only recommendation i have for them is to stop using UPS Mail Innovations. I have been waiting 2 weeks to receive my items with no tracking updates. When they ship FedEx Sure Post or FedEx Ground i have received my items in 3 to 5 days and constantly updated. Overall a wonderful company and I recommend them to everyone.,5
8766,"Trash trash trash trash trash. Lower than a Thrift Store- They sent me a sweater with a HUGE hole in the hood that was 'non-refundable' (wonder why?!!) And several ""bootcut"" pants that turned out to be skinny jeans. They edit the images at the bottom of the jeans to appear bootcut and label the description bootcut but are not. Total trash clothing. Better off driving to a local thrift store or resale store to at least see the items and know EXACTLY what you are getting.",1
8767,"Absolutely love this app! I have placed a few orders from them now and my only complaint is that one of my shipments was 5 days later then expected, but I can't blame Threadup for that... when I tracked my shipment online I watched it sit in a FedEx facility for 4 days straight.",5
8768,I absolutely love tredup!!! I find really great clothes and other items at a great price!!!,5
8769,This app is absolutely terrible not even a one star rate this app deserves a -1000000000 and more 0s after that the clothes are very ugly u order 5 things every order was terrible only good thing about this app it's free shipping!!!!!!DONT RECCOMEND,1
8770,Good overall,4
8771,Orders were great..perfect size as displayed and prompt delivery,5
8772,They were pretty says selling for when I got the code home it was supposed to be a 2X and it would fit a small child I'm really not happy Abraham Lincoln never order of Family Guy are the only thing I'll order off of is it Native American,1
8773,"The returning of items is a complete nightmare. You're charged to return them, and if you want to exchange you don't get credited the amount you've spent. I'm stuck with a skirt that doesnt fit and an ugly grandma sweater.",2
8774,I love this shopping site!! The only change would be pics of inside bags and bottom/ all sides of shoes,4
8775,Very limited.,1
8776,I love the detailed description of the products. The zoom in photos look pretty accurate as well.,5
8777,This is a great place to get excellent merchandise at secondhand price.,5
8778,Paid for a Goody Box I never got.,1
8779,Great selection. Fast delivery. Great customer service!,5
8780,"Great app, makes everything about it so easy to use. And the customer service is outstanding!!",5
8781,"I'm 1,000% all about the concept of ThredUp and have received some really great items...and a couple of real zingers. The item descriptions aren't exactly accurate to say the least. I've ordered several pairs of jeans and the described inseam was way off. I docked 1 star for the inaccuracies in sizing/item descriptions and not authenticating ""luxury"" brands. The customer service is beyond phenomenal--especially during a global pandemic! Keep up the amazing work!",4
8782,"the app seemed nice at first. it looks legit and works alright. but whenever i went to hit the like on an item, the app would glitch out or stop working. I don't know if it was either my phone or a technical issue with the app, but i tried liking different items a few more times and it kept doing it... so.",2
8783,Very nice clothing fast delivery will order more love thredUP,5
8784,Super site,5
8785,I bought a Jacket/blazerthat was overpriced to begin wth but I thought it looked cool & modern. What I received was not the same as a picture. I ordered a woman size and receive something that looked like it been put in the washer& dryer instead of dry cleaners like it should have been. The sleeves were supposed to be long & elongated w/ bell cuffs istead I got a miniature version. If I could show a picture of the 2 side-by-side I would. Buyer beware.,1
8786,Great products. All around great experience!,5
8787,"Terrible experience, shipping time delayed, could not speak with a live person, will never order from this site again! 0 rating!",1
8788,Best,5
8789,"If I'm going to buy something with minor tears,I just wanted a photo of the tear.I also love some detail on some clothes,but I feel like they don't show the beauty of some things.For example,I type in embroidery in the search.One shirt looks like I can really feel the embroidery flowers.You could see the bumps from the full size photo.Another shirt just looked like a printed embroidery.Both descriptions have embroidery.Wish I could explain and say more. Keep this in mind while readin my review.",2
8790,"Good selection, not a lot of plus sizes",3
8791,Nice finds just right for me,5
8792,"Clothing is in good shape, great quality items. Nicely packaged. Bundle options available.",5
8793,These prices are not thrift store prices. Are you people serious?,1
8794,"Why are there purses under ""maternity""? From what I can tell it's just my waist line expanding, not my closet. I need a better search engine. Even before I was pregnant, I found the site hard to navigate. It's very difficult to get the parameters where you want them.",1
8795,Usually a great experience...just be patient. It will come.,4
8796,"Easy to use. I browse a lot and forget about my cart, I liked the reminders. It is easy to use, and I like that you can return things!",5
8797,yay,5
8798,Good.,5
8799,Not Sure,2
8800,"Great app, i love it",5
8801,App works smoothly. Love ThredUp.,5
8802,Love all the choices and awesome prices. Returns are a breeze.,5
8803,I got a purse from here and i didnt have it 2 days and it already started cracking really badly!,3
8804,"Be careful what you buy. My last order had some items that should never have been sold, cat hair on two items and one the strap is barely held together by a string. Most items are fantastic, this is my third order in 4 years and the first time I've had any trouble. Just if they say item is unreturnable, don't buy it.",3
8805,This apps amazing easy to use and got what i ordered each time with in a few days....over all great expierience with them....5 STARS TO THEM AND WOULD SAY YES TO CHECKING THEM OUT ITS WORTH IT....,5
8806,Love shopping on this app,5
8807,Fast delivery & packaged very nice!,5
8808,So easy to use and great clothes at great prices!,5
8809,My oder got here sooner then expected thank you,5
8810,"AMAZING WONDERFUL, WHY HAVEN'T YOU DOWNLOADED THIS INCREDIBLE APP FULL OF BEAUTIFUL TREASURES 🌼😍🌼 IN LOVE WITH THIS APP... THANKS THREDUP!💖",5
8811,Nothing much to offer on here sorry.,1
8812,Always easy.. Never a problem.,5
8813,"Great clothes, selection, and prices",5
8814,This is the absolute best second-hand store app. I am addicted to it now.,5
8815,Great app,5
8816,Easy to navigate and order. Love ThredUp.,5
8817,Again I have to go into my play store and open it before I can use.,2
8818,"My items were recieved on Dec 15th, it is Jan 24th and I havent heard a thing about my items.",1
8819,"I love shopping here! I wish I knew about this sooner. There is so much variety, and the quality is excellent. Great shipping, great searching capabilities. Love!",5
8820,My girls and I love using the app. Find it easy to use.,5
8821,Yall don't have anything for men 🤬,1
8822,Nothing for men.,1
8823,Good,5
8824,Love this site!!,5
8825,All merchandise received in timely fashion and was as described,5
8826,"Love buying from thred up! However I was disapointed with my selling experience. I felt ripped off kind of. I believe there % from the profit should be higher for the persone whos sending in clothes. Also they should allow a longer selling period like a year, or at least 6 months.",5
8827,When putting product in cart price changed,1
8828,Pretty nice. Love quarantine thrifting y'all. Search feature is a bit iffy. But the fact you can save your sizes is a delight.,4
8829,Muy buena,5
8830,My experience is excellent i only my the merchandise that are and it exactly like the picture and I also luv affirm with the monthly payment.,5
8831,Can never find anything.... Stock too vast & app cant keep up,1
8832,Best online consignment!!,5
8833,Awesome,5
8834,"So easy & a great way to change my wardrobe! Months later, I still love this company. The clothes are in great condition!",5
8835,I love this app,5
8836,Would never open,1
8837,"I haven't purchased anything yet but this app is fun and ez to use. Good photos and description of items. Fast forward. Carona virus shop on line time, clothes i have purchased are MARVELOUS, thredUP IS FUN and affordable! 1/23/21 I just bought three beautiful wool and wool blend sweaters today at 30 percent off. Fabulous deal at $36 including shipping!! I cant wait to get these beauties. I live in Colorado so warm sweaters/coats are very important. Thanks for the savings, thredUP, you rock!!",5
8838,Wonderful & simple to use.,5
8839,Just love it!,5
8840,Do not like,1
8841,It was really easy to shop. And I love the discount.,5
8842,"Love thredUP! I have purchased a formal dress, shoes, purses and clothing and all have exceeded my expectations. The packages arrive on schedule and I love the care taken in how the item is wrapped and presented!",5
8843,So much fun shopping here,5
8844,Great selection!!!,5
8845,Never again. I can't even believe the amount of clothes they literally stole from me I sent them in a bunch of name brand clothes 20 30 items of name brand clothes they gave me less than a dollar for seven of those items and the rest of my clothes aren't returning them to me and the prices it should be so illegal what they are doing they are giving you pennies on the dollar and they turn around and they sell them for high prices. The clothes that didn't sell they wanted me 2 pay to get them bac,1
8846,Omg!!! BEST 2nd hand clothing shop EVER!!!! ❤❤❤,5
8847,Some of the prices are pretty reasonable for second hand clothes but you need to check the final price before you buy. I like that they have an assortment of items for all shapes and sizes. I would recommend this site to others.,5
8848,I love the way i can literally type in any specific item and it will ALWAYS provide results. I love that you can buy things brand new with tags or specify how used of an item you want. It is very convenient and i can shop for hours!!,5
8849,I have ordered several times and have been more than satisfied with every purchase!,5
8850,"The purse I ordered looked way smaller in person. However, it is a great product. As far as clothing is concerned, the items run smaller than what they appear. I love the name brand items for low prices! That is my favorite part of the whole app.",3
8851,Know your inseam,5
8852,To hard for me to use since I had a stroke. But I still tell people about the store.,3
8853,All the dresses i ordered were used rags i could have done better st my lical thrift store. Shame on thread up for taking money from people who depend on used clothing because they cant aford new ones. Broken zippers stains and faded material.,1
8854,Boots are perfect thank you 😊🙌💕✨,5
8855,these apps are for app developers. this is a nice ads for a business.,5
8856,It's addictive!!! I find myself scrolling through the app at night until I fall asleep. Love Thredup!!,5
8857,Beware of false subjects that don't send your item. Mostly good experiences.,4
8858,"Great buys, fast shipping, can always find something I need",5
8859,EXCELLENT!!!,5
8860,"I love shopping on ThredUp. Their app is good - matches well with their website. There are definitely some items listed that im not sure why they got approved, but you can find some gems - just a lot of scrolling. I wish there was a way to search & sort favorites, or even create multiple favorite lists.",4
8861,"Good selection, great prices. My order was shipped on same day as ordered. Awesome!!!!",5
8862,Dissapointed with selection & prices! Uninstalling. I did what creator did before being advised. Thanks anyway.,1
8863,There is no mystery! Everything is well layed out and the quality as well as selection is incredible!,5
8864,"It's easy to use, huge selection, many brands, unique and everyday pieces.",5
8865,Perfect delivery of what i expected. Loved it,5
8866,Beautiful and inexpensive items.,5
8867,Great app! Love it ! Great prices!,5
8868,wish there was an option to send things back if not accepted since some of us are as broke as those who would benefit from donated charity items... that way one could at least find another place/person who would trade clothing for $ and not be flat broke without anything else to sell.... otherwise I love the app and business and idea and even the donation part.... I'm just literally penniless lol,4
8869,"No matter how long I stare, I still can't find the style of clothes I'm looking for.",1
8870,Easy to use and search!,5
8871,Would recommend! Really good way to get cheap and thrifted clothes :),5
8872,awesome p,5
8873,Very good experience. I like the filter process. Just let them know what you looking for and the size and they will do the rest. Got 7 dresses for approx. 70.00 dollars. Thredup will be my first go to shopping site,5
8874,Not used,1
8875,"Love it, haven't had any issues with it. I've placed 3 orders so far and I'm very happy.",5
8876,I am addicted to Thredup,4
8877,I sent a large bag of cloths ..some sold ..for pennies ...i purchased shoes ..2 pair ..nothing like the pictures ...very small ...sending them back ..return is costing 8.99 and 3.98 restocking fee ..not fair or responsible..i am very disappointed with thredUp,2
8878,I live to love thredup best thing poppin !!!,5
8879,Great if you like the name brand things at discount prices,3
8880,I have bought from here many times and its a great experience every time!,5
8881,"Great deals, inexpensive way to renew your wardrobe",5
8882,So much stuff! It's just really hard for me to decide on anything. Great prices for sure.,4
8883,Awesome finds & reasonable prices!,5
8884,A very rewarding business to support! Many compliments,5
8885,"I dig the minimalistic style, as it's sharp looking but aesthetics are great until you try to go navigate. For some reason and I don't have the most nimble of fingers by a longshot but I find myself kicked out of my search by an errant pressing of something that is no longer there, I suppose. That sucks but when you can't go back to it and have to start again, I find myself taking my frustration out on my phone, which phone abuse is phone abuse and I don't want to be that person.",3
8886,"Great experience so far, finding wonderful items!",5
8887,Exceptional!!!,5
8888,Women and youth only. F off.,1
8889,Trash,1
8890,It a great day ever time look &buy thank god for smart people .,5
8891,Good deals!!,4
8892,i dont use this,1
8893,"Did not save my searches. I ""hearted"" several items but when I went back to put items in my cart to checkout, they were no longer saved. Very irritating",2
8894,Addicted,5
8895,"You can find some good items there to buy but when I tried to sell they just lost my bag. I received the clean out kit and dropped it at the mail, followed every instruction, yet it turned out it got lost, the tracking only says shipping lable created like it never even arrived to me. So take your stuff elsewhere. After talking to customer service I got $35 on my account as a courtesy which is nice of them but I still don't think I will be using the clean out feature anymore.",2
8896,You'll find what you're looking for in wvery price range!,5
8897,I give this a 2⭐bc there sizes are not accredited at all. I payed $45 and I can't even wear what I ordered bc it's too small.I wear a medium in clothes and I ordered 3 different things I was very excited and they don't fit there too smal l there med are like a small or xsmall. there sizes are not accredited at all. there clothes are not what they seem either. the only thing that I love is the back pack. I am very disappointed with there clothes 😡😡😡,2
8898,There are so many things I LOVE about this app. You guys are doing such great things for the planet by offering easily accessible thrifted clothing that you dont have to spend hours picking through racks to find. I love that I can donate items without the potential of them ending up in a landfill. Knowing that you will recycle items unable to be used is a great relief! My only qualms is the push notifications and emails can be a bit much and more sustainable shipping material would be nice.,4
8899,"I've been using thredup for at least 5 years,probably closer to 10. And the app which is new to me makes things easier.",5
8900,"Easy to navigate, clear on sizes and how they measure, and great deals!",5
8901,This is one of the best online shopping experiences I have had. Reminded me of those times on Melrose going thrift shopping. Those were the days. Anything I have ordered has been a great find. Now I am addicted. Thank you ThredUp,5
8902,"I love this app, but it's got a lot of great stuff. This is a problem. I am buying too much stuff. I need to not buy more stuff. But this app is too good.",5
8903,Just made my first order,5
8904,"I love this app. Sometimes there are some hidden flaws in items, but the return process is quick and easy.",5
8905,Love this store!!!!,5
8906,"Easy to navigate. Wish you could select the type of pants you were seeking like you can with tops. Having now accidentally bought a velvet dress I can't use ( looked like a T-shirt dress in the pics), I wish they explained what the materials were better.",4
8907,I love the fact that you can re use clothes. They have cute styles and always have promos.,5
8908,"I warn others that they don't stand by their policies! I ordered $100.00 worth of clothes and only received 1 item worth $5.00,I was promised a refund and now they are making me wait for 2 more weeks and on top of that my package went from my town back to another place hours away, unless you have money to throw away, I DON'T ADVISE YOU TO ORDER AND THE CLOTHES AREN'T WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE! I want to help others from making a mistake!!!",1
8909,Love it! This is a great resouce to purchase clothes. Good quality items at a great price. Love thrift shopping to save money and to be less wasteful. I have been a customer for 4 years. Purchased t-shirts to suits. Love to open my polka box and see that polka dot tissue paper. So cute! Thank you thredUP!,5
8910,"Recieved my first order quickly. Ordered 2 dresses, they were in great condition. I have since placed 2 more orders. Fantastic selection to choose from and good for the environment!",5
8911,I ordered a goody box and at first I was unsure but after seeing at least 2 fav youtubers order one with positive feedback I decided to take the chance. 7 days after I see an email in my spam folder saying I never ordered. I contacted them and all they could say was the system didnt push it through right. I checked my bank account and the charge completly disappeared. They wont do anything for my inconvience either and just said i have to reorder and start my 10-14 wait time over. No thanks!,1
8912,Lol I,5
8913,"I'm plus size, just about 99% of the plus size clothing is boring and just so ugly. Maybe just my opinion but idk. And you'd think for a thrifting app that clothes would be cheaper but NO. So expensive!",1
8914,Awesome!!!,5
8915,Awesome app I recommend anyone who wears clothes and doesn't want to pay full price for name brands to check out thredup!,5
8916,SCAM. DID NOT RECEIVE ORDER! I AM COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS APP. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN ENEMY. ORDER OVER 30$ WORTH OF CLOTHING. NEVER RECEIVED IT. SAID IT WAS DELIVERED AND WAS CERTAINLY NOT. CUSTOMER SERVICE STILL HAD NOT GOTTEN BACK IN TOUCH. READ SHIPPING REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING. EMBARRASSED MYSELF RECOMMENDING THIS APP AND NEVER RECEIVING MY ORDER.,1
8917,I bought three items from treadUP. I was able to get a really good discount on my first purchase. I also found clothing that I already have on the app. It was interesting to see how much those items were worth. Loved buying from their app and am planning on ordering from there again.,5
8918,I LOVE LOVE LOVE 😍 this place... Thif store without any messes see only your size... Thank you guys for all your hard work... My ONLY issue is that the cart occasionally doesn't add up the total amount correctly and somehow charges more money than its calculating up to. Hasn't happened in a while now.,5
8919,Great options and prices for clothing,5
8920,Do not like sites that I have to enter email into to shop...so I left your site,1
8921,First time ordering a clothing box that had thrift store clothes in it. I liked the idea however the stylist did not get me. 2 purses I would never wear. She got the size right on the jeans. In my opinion the clothes were definitely old and used . They looked dirty and worn. The brand names were decent. I did like the sports bra and the black jogging shorts. The stylist did good. The purses were terrible. Probably not going to reorder.,2
8922,Wish they were open for selling. Ive got some great stuff that needs a home,5
8923,"Revised - Thredup cooperates very well with its sellers. Although not having a phone number to be able to verbally communicate with clients/customers (I'm both) will remain a frustration, they DO have a very helpful and competent chat department.",4
8924,Great prices on alot of items. Especially with all of the discount codes they give you. Items are in good condition when they arrive.,4
8925,"Good pieces, well organized, fast shipping",5
8926,The app has been improved! Thanks!,5
8927,Super easy to use and find clothes that are extremely cute!,5
8928,I love all the variety of styles & colors!,5
8929,"Easy to use, great interface, love Thredup!!!",5
8930,Not my place,1
8931,"Searching not intuitive, that's the whole basis of finding/buying items. Listing descriptions bare & unhelpful, can't ask more detail. Stop wasting your money and ours w ur warehouse scam. Depop successful bc buyer reviews matter. Take note of search filters Mercari uses, much more comprehensive and user-friendly. Prices are inflated. Been browsing for months, afraid to buy. Many better thrifting apps, step it up & get competitive! Seems y'all are on the way out if you don't make big changes...",2
8932,I love thredUP!,5
8933,Good app but not really low prices,3
8934,LOVE THIS APP!!!!,5
8935,Wow! As a plus size person I never order on line. But every single item I ordered fit perfect. Everything was as described. Best of all no odors on anything. I will definitely be shopping again. Oh the prices were amazing.,5
8936,Love this app!!,4
8937,"I'm very pleased with quality of the items purchased. Also, the return process is fairly simple, since purchasing a printer. The app needs a little help in the notification tab. The functionality for "" tap to learn more"" doesn't work. Overall, I love THRED UP. It's the best shopping experience for a thrift store! Thank you.",4
8938,So easy to use. Great suggestions. Love the search alerts,5
8939,It wont let me pay for my clothes.. Keep saying try again later..,2
8940,Later,5
8941,I adore this app. I have gotten so many cute items at such good costs. I'm always so excited to see a polka dot package at my doorstep.,5
8942,Found lots of nice stuff cheap,5
8943,Love it! Easy to use had just what i was looking for!!,5
8944,Excellent app. Very affordable high end finds... 5 stars,5
8945,"Some of the stuff is amazing but beware, some is not what it seems. I paid 20 dollars for a pair of heels that looked brand new in the pic and even if they weren't brand new, the pic looked WAY better than the item I received. The item I received is very worn and has many different parts where it's falling apart. And even though the site says you can return it, it'll cost me over $10 in fees, plus shipping to do so. Disappointed bout my experience and definitely don't recommend at all.",2
8946,Ive ordered multiple timws and have been happy with everything feom the items to the peocess so far!,5
8947,"It was great when you could get a bag. Now I have a ton of things to sell and I am moving so I am not dragging it with me and I would love to send it in but they aren't sending out clean out bags now and the notify me when they start sending them out again doesnt work. I always spend the 4 or 5 bucks I get on more stuff from them plus some because its never much wich is fine. Not being able to get a clean out bag is not. I think i need to quit being pissy about it, spend my 5 dollars and be done",1
8948,Easy to use,5
8949,Can get expensive and I probably could by more at Goodwill but many of the items I do buy you can't find at Goodwill. Hope that makes sense. I do enjoy thrift shopping here tho!,5
8950,This is joke. The clothes on here cost more then what you pay in the store.,1
8951,Loved everything I have ordered. Was delivered when it said it would and items are very well priced. Great experience so far.,5
8952,Love this app,5
8953,Exceptional Service,5
8954,I ordered two different dresses. BOTH are too small! I have verified my size so they should fit. I am so frustrated! I'm losing $1.99 on each of them.,2
8955,The only way to shop with great choices while helping the Earth one step at a time.,5
8956,"The fit is spot on, but it smelled a little dusty when I got it. So 4 out of 5.",4
8957,Can always find something you'd like.,5
8958,Nothing but good experiences!,5
8959,Best secondhand clothes app ever!,5
8960,Excellent customer service! A good selection of clothes at a variety of prices. I like that they're picky about what they sell. I have ordered two things that did not match the picture/description 100% and they made it right both times. I do wish they sold men's clothes. But the womens and kids is great!,5
8961,Many items new with tags or like new at unbelievable prices. Wide range of sizes. Fun to shop.,5
8962,Amazing. I love thred up,5
8963,Works well. Quality pics with zoom options. The fact they use maniquns is helpful too.,5
8964,"Great app like to go finding the great Deals the only issue is the return policy is just 15 days, a small window and for the holidays it is just not enough. Many items your gambling with the quality with their final sale claus.",3
8965,"Love the concept! Took a hot second to figure out the execution. The body measurements are WAY MORE IMPORTANT than the sizes. If the item is the same or nearest your own measurements, it'll fit. If not, DON'T BUY IT! This is not a ThredUp issue, this is a fashion industry issue but it's harder online. Stick with the brands you know so you are familiar with the fit also. Other than that I LOVE this app. Secondhand fashionista for life!!",4
8966,Love it!,5
8967,"Lighting is horrible on All pictures! Alot of the clothes are wrinkled and hung up looking messy. I can get past the messy wrinkled items. But take better pictures with better lighting, especially with ur stank a$* return policy. If you don't want people to stay on your app .. you found a way to keep NUMEROUS ppl I know off... Improve your quality.. SMH thred up, better pics and actual ability to talk to a person about the item on Poshmark. Shouldn't be that way since your an actual COMPANY. 🙄",1
8968,"Terrific app makes it easy to shop responsibly and filter to find great deals. I wish they included more details about each item, like if it has pockets which is sometimes hard to tell from the photos, but overall I'm definitely keeping this app for shopping.",5
8969,I've used thredup for the past 6 years and slowly they have become a scam. They charge decent prices at best for their clothing but usually its over price. Then you are charged for shipping. I've gotten so many misidentified clothing and they charge so much money for restocking fees and shipping fees. They are a waste of money.,1
8970,I love that app is easy to use and that can save on clothes shopping and sell items from your closet to Ive use this app three times and plan continue use in the future.,4
8971,I found that some clothing are not fully labeled and doesn't show up when searched.,4
8972,its awesome,5
8973,Such fun shopping...rewards collect FAST!,5
8974,It is nice and cheap clothes I really like it,5
8975,Great thrifting!!,5
8976,Awesome,5
8977,"I have found some awesome clothes for my grandsons and myself, i highly recommend it to anyone 😀 they are no longer having the option to mail out a bag for cash selling just printing labels, do not like this.",5
8978,So much fun shopping this way!,5
8979,Honestly easiest way to sell my clothes. Most of the time I just use the money I make on getting something else I wanted. 10/10 would recommend.,5
8980,"Easy to use, great selection, and sustainable! Yay!",5
8981,Love love love,5
8982,"Love Thread up. My only complaint is the sizes can be very misleading, for instance, a 2x can be huge or very small. Not enough description. Shipping rates are good, returns are easy and overall, I really like this site and buying gently used.",4
8983,More like a goodwill price vs a thrift store price.. cheapest there is on here is 3.99.. thrift store girl here n that is not thrift store price lol. But theres nice stuff so it is what it is,3
8984,Great experience. I would recommend this for everyone.,5
8985,I am very unhappy and disappointed with this company! didn't realize when I ordered something that I wouldn't be able to return it and I had to keep it even didn't or was damaged! I received merchandise that was frayed around the neck and all stretched out in it looks horrible and I wanted to return it but then I realized that they weren't going to give me but a quarter of what I paid for it! There is no phone number for me to call anybody to speak with them because I also received the wrong siz,1
8986,Good,5
8987,Love love love this store,5
8988,I love the new design of the app. I still wish I could search a little bit more specifically. Like when I search southwestern nothing comes up.,4
8989,"This app seems wonderful. Great items!! I've purchased 4 items at 3 different times... had to return 2 of them due to incorrect descriptions. Specifically measurements on pants. Yes you can return within 14 days of receipt, but you don't get back the original shipping fee. Totally fair if it wasn't their error, but I think good business wouldn't dock you if it's not your fault.",3
8990,A great I have a few items that were not exactly as they said however that's the risk you take buying clothes on line. The higher-end clothes are such a great deal and have come in flawlessly. Had some trouble with shipping during the holidays it took almost a month to receive my clothing but I understand that in the times we are in and for the time of year there was nothing the company could have done. Love this app I buy from it often probably too often. You'll love everything!,4
8991,"I absolutely love the way the company is run. I love the goody boxes filled with clothes. I try them on, and I keep the clothes I like and send the other clothes back. They'll just charge me for the clothes I kept.",5
8992,Love it,5
8993,I like it. But it is exspensive clothes to buy,3
8994,Love it...But....need to hold the page and get to new pages .Page continue to drop and I have to start over and over and over again.,4
8995,"This app regularly crashes. Currently filters are not working, therefore rendering the app useless.",1
8996,Every thing I bought was well made and great condition. And fit I love them.,5
8997,"Love this site, great deals.",5
8998,I like to get my clothes here!😊,5
8999,Good,5
9000,I Totally LOVE ThredUp!! I enjoy everything I purchase from them.,5
9001,Great app. Easy to use. Enjoyed shopping,5
9002,They keep your money and take forever to respond to a refund request hoping you'll forget. The clothes they send are an insult to me since they're thrift store rejects. If you're thinking about downloading this app... RUN. This company is not on the up & up.,1
9003,Great,5
9004,I love this app. Most of the clothes are so reasonably priced.,5
9005,My first order was delivered quickly and was exactly what as described,5
9006,"It's just as good as the website, if not better for seachability! I can make purchases when I'm away from home. It's so convenient for my demanding schedule and helps keep me look polished and professional while reducing waste!",5
9007,One of my items didn't show And no one is doing anything about it I'm done buying from this company GOODBYE!,1
9008,Great clothes at great prices,5
9009,I'm happy to find a safe and effective way to to buy good second hand quality items. My only constructive criticism is that I can't type in exact words what I want/need to buy I have to be extremely vague. It's ok be I still found exactly what I wanted/needed to buy and in the right size. It just took longer to find than if I bought it first hand.,4
9010,The best and easiest way to shop for clothes,5
9011,Fine,4
9012,"Horrible, I ordered 3 things that were stated ""great condition"" ""might mistaken for new"" uhu, one item stained in what looks like oil drips from eating. And the other one which was said you could mistaken for new had a 6 inch hole where zipper is. As if someone was trying it on and tore it. The other item was fine. This was my first and last time every buying from here.",1
9013,Great clothes. Great prices. Great value. Great idea!!,5
9014,Love me some second hand!,5
9015,"The clothes I recieved feel basically new which might be why things can run a bit pricey compared to average thrift stores. Loved the filters for colors, sizes, styles etc it made my buying experience way easier than walking in large retail stores. The only issues I've had were with estimated shipping times being inaccurate and the sizing being different across different brands.",5
9016,Enjoy,4
9017,The all time best name brand used clothes of all time!!!!,5
9018,"I love ThredUp and the app makes it so easy to browse, save searches and checkout. 10/10 recommend",5
9019,I'm addicted!!,5
9020,I just ordered three pairs of jeans one was Hollister the other two was American eagle well I have gotten two of them which are in excellent condition you might as well say there brand new I cant wait to get my third pair thanks thredup for such excellent items you sell at a very reasonable price I needed jeans like bad lol,5
9021,Holy COW! I cannot believe the amazing deals! I got 2 amazing designer shirts for less than $15!! This is an amazing app and a fantastic idea!!,5
9022,Has always been great,5
9023,My only feedback is sometimes when I hit the back button on my phone it takes me back to the home page instead of where I left off shopping after looking at an item.,4
9024,"I have used ALL resell apps and this one is the best! 100%. Name brands at great price, easy to sell, they do work for you & still only charge what other apps do. No ship, no package, no posting or going back/forth with buyer. When you buy something, you know it's the best, bc they only accept the best. They also make it easy to return with no questions asked. They even worked with me with a delayed return due to the pandemic with no hesitation. They also have sales constantly.",5
9025,Love this app,5
9026,Best ever,5
9027,The best way to shop ever,5
9028,I adore the dress shopping. Its one of the best on line experiences I've had. Thank you.,5
9029,Fast shipments and amazing finds !!!,5
9030,Good prices! Quick delivery!,4
9031,"The app UI is decent. But their business model and prices are horrible. They mark the ""original price"" at what the item was worth when it initially came out. For example: if the item is 5+ years old and is worth $50 today at retail, thredup claims the item is worth $100 because that's what it was worth 5 years ago at retail. Flat out lies about what pieces are actually worth and the customer ends up paying nearly full retail prices. I'd strongly suggest another company.",1
9032,"I love this app. Purchasing clothing is super easy, I love that it's thrifty and reusing! The Goody boxes are well done, items picked for me have mostly been great and free shipping both ways doesn't hurt!",5
9033,Love thred up..name brand clothes gently used and most look brand new! Love ordering from here!,5
9034,Good prices what normal would have cost me over 200$ only cost me 87$ When i did reci e the packages i was so pleased i cried with tears of joy!!!!!!,5
9035,Great,5
9036,Different,4
9037,I absolutely LOVE ThredUP!!❤️ I am a true regular customer!! THANK YOU FOR SO MANY AMAZING DEALS!!!💯,5
9038,Always a variety of items and brands to choose from PLUS budget friendly.,5
9039,Beautiful,5
9040,"I tried selling something using the clean out bag feature, and I've been reading multiple reviews and claims that it can take up to 5 months of processing which I am up to 2 months at the moment. And apparently many of the items are not accepted and you are paid only cents for the items that are worth way more. These claims are true because theresnt arent only 2 or 3, there are over 5 claims, so I wanted to let whoever is reading this and the company",2
9041,Great brands great prices,5
9042,Cute clothes,5
9043,"I love ThredUp! I rarely buy new nowadays, and having a large online thrift store to fall back on is great. My only issue with the site is pant sizing. Every time I buy pants, shorts, etc., they are always much too tight and don't fit. I am wondering if the sizing procedure during processing could include thigh width (or wherever the pants are at their widest)? It would help immensely.",4
9044,Great!!,5
9045,I have scored some good deals on here and very nice stuff,5
9046,I have been a customer for almost 6years. I have never gotten anything that bad. It's a great way to buy and sell recycled clothing. 💝,5
9047,The clothes are more expensive or the same price as buying new clothes,1
9048,Works well most of the time,4
9049,"Trying to be reasonable I donated a few items the wait is so long I could come back after a couple of half a decades an still be waiting to receive any money. The clothes are priced too high for my budget thats it gets three stars, it was easy to navigate ""kinda"".",3
9050,Good,5
9051,Not as good as poshmark or mecari,4
9052,Havent recieved order yet but like knowing its on its way and where,1
9053,"I'll keep buying from them but I won't send anything to them again. I did it once and it was so disappointing. I sent several items, some with the tags still on, and got a very small sell back amount. Live and learn. Recently placed an order 5 pairs of jeans all the same size. Only one pair fit properly, every other pair wasn't even close to the same size and one was likely a child's size, it was that small.",3
9054,Currently the filters aren't working properly. I put a filter on and it doesn't apply it. Please fix this.,1
9055,A real pleasure,5
9056,A great alternative to thrift stores. Beautiful items ❤❤ I really love the treasure hunt process ❤ still amazing. 💕💕,5
9057,Just a little difficult to filter quickly,4
9058,Great way to shop second hand,5
9059,AWESOME!,5
9060,Clear and easy to use.,5
9061,The app wouldn't let me sign in and the prices are a little high but when the app did work it worked great.,3
9062,"I love this store and app so much. SO many discounts and deals on excellent, high quality clothing. The app itself works well and I enjoy being able to like clothing to look at later, shop similar clothes if they get sold before I get to them, and also the fact that your likes don't leave the system once they're sold. That may be something other people find annoying but I like being able to have that article of clothing bookmarked in case I can find it again or find something similar.",4
9063,Love it. So easy to shop. Recycling is best!!! Awesome rewards.,5
9064,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE thredUP! Designer high end clothing at a fraction of the price. Great deals and always fun to find unique rare finds! A truely enjoyable shopping experience ,while also good for our planet! 5+ stars.",5
9065,"I used to buy so much stuff. I am losing interest in Thred Up. I sent in a clean out bag in September, they have yet to process it, and the estimated date came and went. Also, they moved the estimated date, to process it, a month from the first estimated date. That is really bad estimating. Maybe don't do that... just stop accepting clean out bags til you catch up.",3
9066,I am always finding great things whether they are for me or my daughter and it really helps me stay on budget with the prices,5
9067,"App is very easy to use. Their filters really narrow down your search and it saves ""your sizes"" so you aren't looking through items for hours. They are generous with promo codes for discounts and credits to your account for spending money with them. Return process is simple and customer service is easily contacted through email.",5
9068,"This app is very misleading, don't trust the pricing shown. The discounts are already applied in the price shown, the verbiage is very misleading. For used clothing, the prices are high, the delivery is slow and the customer service is terrible. I was super excited when I got the app, but one order in and I'm deleting the app....when I finally receive the remainder of my order. Better to shop the thrift stores :)",1
9069,The app works for the most part and is easy to use. I gave 4 stars because it gets stuck often.,4
9070,It's an addiction best shopping app I have on my phone.,5
9071,Love this app! I have become totally addicted! I bought my mother a Coach purse brand new with the tags still on it for Christmas and she absolutely loved it! I find myself on here shopping in the middle of the night. Everything I have ordered has been in great condition and I will continue shopping with thredUp! Keep up the good work guys!,5
9072,Love this app!!,5
9073,"I really love this app. However, as much as i shop here, I wish you could fix the following things...filter your favorites, select multiple options at once to delete in your favorites, and be able to choose more than just one category option in the filters.",5
9074,Great product for the money,5
9075,Great app love it,5
9076,Not giving you my email address just to look and see what you have. Ridiculous.,1
9077,Love to try,5
9078,Great deals,4
9079,IT'S GREAT IN DEALING WITH TRACKING PACKAGES,5
9080,Couldn't. Get. On,1
9081,Sent my back back in Nov. Its been almost a month and half and they still haven't processed it.,1
9082,I like it but they need to tweak searches a bit an keep better track of points 500 points got lost or disappeared 🤔,4
9083,Awesome app. Awesome store,5
9084,"I live on this app...I have redone my wardrobe for winter and summer and saved an obscene amount of money, all high name brands in my closet now.",5
9085,ThredUP is my favorite place to shop. Saves me tons of time and money 😂💰!,5
9086,Works well on my galaxy,5
9087,Absolutely ❤ Thred Up!!,5
9088,"I didn't find a style I liked. I browsed throught it, lengthily. I see where jerry springer guests get their clothes. Second, aside from your pricing thred up, you are vague on damage. Take pictures of affected area(s). You described an items condition as: ""This hugely discounted item still has a lot of life left, but may show signs of wear. Signs of wear include"". End of description. Last, the return policy🤔 Shipping $5.99(both ways), restocking fee $1.99, processing fee;$8.99. $$$$👀",1
9089,"Great , easy, and good deals!!!!",4
9090,"I am going bankrupt! JK!... this shopping app is absolutely my F A V E ever! So so so sooooooooooooo many options/choices/bargains...it's like yard-sale-ing from the comfort of your smartphone. The clothes are considered secondhand (hence the discounted pricing) but are FAR from 'used' condition! And SO MUCH merchandise to shop for! Women's and Juniors name brand clothing: coats, hoodies, cardys, cords, sweatpants, leggings, swimsuits, Activewear, shoes, handbags, jewelry, plus accessories. A++",5
9091,It's TrashUp. Not good for sellers. Too cheap! Too slow. Too tricky,1
9092,Amazing! They got just about everything I'm looking for,5
9093,Love this.,5
9094,Impossible to get the shipping label the app emails you.,1
9095,My whole closet just about is from Tread Up. In fact I just placed another order today. Only problems I've seen some of my clothes have a couple of holes. But nothing you can't sew up and make better. Another thing is selling to them isn't great but can be worth it. Shipment is pretty decent to.,5
9096,"Sooo much fun-quality items,and an amazing selection!",5
9097,"I've been using ThredUp for over a year and I am addicted! I love shopping for cute pre-loved clothes, especially because there is SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM even after you filter with your sizes! Almost every article of clothing I bought this year came from ThredUp, and I'm gonna keep coming back for more BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS MORE!!!",5
9098,"Most of the time they have offers that are new or barely used, always able to find what I'm interested in.",5
9099,"Every pair of pants and Jean's I've purchased has been incorrectly described, even when the item clearly states what the size, cut, etc... is. And then I'm charged 1.99 restocking fee to return them. I would have never purchased if the correct description was given.",2
9100,Found what I was looking for!❤️,5
9101,You now can only have items in your cart for 4 hours at a time. It used to be 24 hours. Also Ive bought items that later I was told was no longer available. This has happened multiple times.,2
9102,"Amazing clothes and quality, awesome customer service. I will be doing all of my future clothes and purses and shoes from Thredup forever!!!!!!",5
9103,Still more expensive than I expected,3
9104,"ThredUP has been the best used clothing app for me. Especially during the quarantine, it's been so convient to shop online. They always have great deals going on, and the site is easy to use in the app or even on a computer. Returns are simple, and I love that I can use my points to waive the restocking fees. Even when I had to reach out to their costumer service to change my address for an order, they were quick and incredibly helpful. Give them a try and don't forget to use a discount code!",5
9105,Great,5
9106,"I really enjoy shopping with ThredUp, and every product I've ever received has met or exceeded my expectations!",5
9107,To be able to shop more sustainably and still have high quality clothes is so ideal. Sometimes things aren't exactly what you expect for I'd say 90% of my purchases have been amazing. Love the sales they always be having too.,5
9108,"I shipped my bag of clothes off 5/2020, on 8/05/2020 my items showed up as ""received"". It's December 30th, 2020 and I'm yet to know what items were sold or kept. My bag history has stalled and I'm yet to move forward to the processing stage and complete stage.. This is so unprofessional, I will not recommend using thredUP.",1
9109,In Love!,5
9110,"It's great, used clothes, cheap!",5
9111,Takes too long,3
9112,"I love this app! I rarely buy brand new clothes anymore since I discovered Thredup. The prices are great, so many name brand items that are in quality condition. I have not been disappointed yet with any of my purchases. I have and do highly recommend this app💯",5
9113,Very great,5
9114,Great clothes for an even better price!,5
9115,Prices are unbelievable plus they let you know when it ships how many boxes and when to expect it!!! I am expecting 4 different boxes with 20 items for only $137.00.,5
9116,Phenomenal,5
9117,Love this app! Very easy to search your sizes and favorite brands.,5
9118,"I have received beautiful, gently, or never used clothing items, some still with the tags on from ThredUp. Shopping is fun with ThredUp because of the ability to select sizes and styles and colors and only see those choices. They ship straight to your door in a timely fashion and the price is always right! I love ThredUp!",5
9119,Paid for a pair of shoes and never received them. Merchant never contacted me either. I was given a refund but this was definitely a disappointment.,1
9120,"I already said ,I like thred up I ordered a bag and got it really fast ,but my next order hasn't arrived yet so my uncle works for channel 7 news we can get a lil time to talk about this matter on the air 😫",1
9121,I love bargain hunting and at thredup I get that!,5
9122,I like buying quality used items online. Just wish there was a better way to see the products. A zoom in feature or seeing the clothing on a model would be helpful,4
9123,Fast delivery--great clothes!,5
9124,"So easy, quite fun, great bargains, little risk. Whats not to like?",5
9125,I received free shipping and 50 percent off.,5
9126,"Great deals on designer handbags, & endless selections to choose from.",4
9127,"Not any good stuff on here at all and some of it is to pricery ,used items should never be expensive ,idc how much the person paid for it .it's used .",1
9128,"Why do I see walmart clothes being sold for $20.00 and I can go in walmart and buy that same thing for $6.99,I feel like this site is very misleading!!!!!",1
9129,"Omg, it's my new addiction! 😊. Amazing deals, awesome brands, an incredible selection of clothes, in every style",5
9130,Great app! I still wish you would bring back your Kindle version though.,5
9131,"I can't order a clean out kit because when I tap on print out my shipping label, it just freezes.",1
9132,"Really easy to use, for both selling and buying. Excellent customer service and amazin range to thrift from. Love it",5
9133,"I was so happy with my order I could have screamed!! I'd looked on Thread Up site for months, but was very uncertain about ordering. Saw lots that I liked but I wasn't sure about quality, fit, sizes, real condition & value. Everthing fit perfect, was wrapped lovely in tissue paper & delivered within a reasonsable time.!! I was excited & delighted. I wore the perfect fitting red dress on Christmas Eve & felt elegant!! I topped it with the black sweater. Very very happy with my order.",5
9134,Awesome,5
9135,The app doesn't work,1
9136,App that makes it easy to view and purchase a wide selection of desirable thrift clothing,5
9137,I love THREAD UP. I have been shopping here since 2018. Great clothes and prices. Second hand is the best way to go. Try it! :-),5
9138,Great Deals and Variety,5
9139,So many items,5
9140,"Easy to use app. Maybe too easy😀. I've scored some screaming deals on high quality clothes. Found 32"" inseam pants that are impossible to find in stores. Easy order, easy returns. I'm hooked.",5
9141,"Frequent browser, first time purchaser! I am eager to receive my 1st order (4 dresses for under $50!). I have missed my trips to my favorite local resale shop during the 2020 ""stay at home"" times. So, I was able to get my fix thanks to ThredUp!",5
9142,"Last year, I rated this app 5 stars and I repeat it again this year. They're transparent about shipping and the clothes are as advertised.",5
9143,Love this site,5
9144,Absolutely love Thredup. I've gotten so many awesome pieces.,5

9146,Cool app.,5
9147,"Seems kinda cool I guess but they only sell women's clothes, no men's stuff.",4
9148,"I used to get my clothes here, quite regularly, but had to curtail my spending, and have not shopped on it for a while.",5
9149,Best app to buy designer clothes!,5
9150,Too expensive for used items,2
9151,Enjoyable Thanks,5
9152,"AAAAAAA-MAZINGGG DEALS! Just without a doubt...110%, all-around, absolutely, A-MAZING deals/prices/savings. Both the ThredUp site and/or app are incredibly user-friendly - logical, systematic formatting makes everything easy-to-use, and comprehend. Also, another HUGE PLUS/BONUS FACTOR -- THEY HAVE HELPFUL, EFFICIENT CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS, who are as personable as they are professional. THEY GET THE JOB DONE, and without hesitation. Thanks for your services and all you do, ThredUp! 🤩🤘 ♥ 🛍️👗",5
9153,Love it,5
9154,They don't guarantee the shipper.will ship on time..I've ordered four things at the same time I still have not received my last two items it's been over two weeks,1
9155,Good morning and thanks again and please let everyone know if there is anything 😊 😀 or use for the inconvenience of nic is behind the game of the inconvenience lately,2
9156,"Love it. App works great and they have amazing deals on designer stuff, which has all looked brand new when they are delivered. On top of everything else they give rewards on purchases. Highly recommended!",5
9157,Great job,2
9158,"After sending in my clothes, I find that the more trendy, or expensive, or name brand items do not make it to thredup but instead the cheaper hollister, American Eagle, or Tillys clothes are chosen to sell under my account. Also, lots of clothes on the site seem to be outdated, pictures taken are not the best and make it hard to tell how the quality of clothes are. Would be helpful if tags are used also because it's difficult to search for specific items. I'm just not a fan of thredup anymore.",2
9159,😘 I love e,5
9160,"Always great experience. Clothes are high quality. I buy ""nearly new"" and stick with brands I love. Save so much money on quality clothes. I would rather buy from ThredUp than new. Can get so much better quality at great prices. Delivery is quick. Love ThredUp. Highly recommend!",5
9161,Satisfing,4
9162,Never really used this app so not too sure about it!,3
9163,This is a great app!,5
9164,"No items for men, alienates half the market. Strange business move.",1
9165,Very easy to use,5
9166,App is easy to use. I love that you can save searches and come back to them over and over again.,5
9167,"Overall a good place to get second hand clothes and everything else. Alot of selection, no enough sales, I have seen alot of good stuff .",4
9168,I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE them,5
9169,I shop here ALOT!!! The app is super simple to use pretty self explanatory.,5
9170,Fast shipping!!,5
9171,Love it!!!,5
9172,Awesome,5
9173,Likes to ruin Christmas!!,1
9174,Great product!!! Haven't been disappointed yet!!!,5
9175,"After several years of purchasing, needed to return 2 items not properly sized. No help from company at all. No replies to emails etc. I'm done.",2
9176,This app is the best. I have bought many items and will buy more.,5
9177,May not recieve all items that you ordered/bought. Nor will you br able to contact anyone about any such matters. Buyer Beware! If all goes well it's a great sure to use with a ton of cute items but it's unfortunate that there's no one to turn to when things go awry,5
9178,ThredUp is a sustainable way to shop for cute clothes at an amazing discount!,5
9179,The app has problems resetting to a new clothing category to allow for an accurate search.,3
9180,I think its kind of ridiculous that I need to use my Facebook information to sign into three up. Everytime I try to choose a different way to sign in it brings me back to Facebook sign in. Please fix this!,2
9181,I love the clothes.,4
9182,Very easy to use and order from. Love the special rewards for members too!,5
9183,Great deals 4 cheap nice brands and prices My favorite shop for clothes and everything you need,5
9184,Ur prices are out of whack,1
9185,This is my favorit app I joined and i purches every month everyone needs to check it out anyone can afford and cloths are all name brand and in really gret condition and the time it takes to get your items is only days best thing i found in 2020.,5
9186,"Good stuff, good sellers, best of all - working to fight the environmental damage the fashion industry creates with reuse and smart shopping options!",5
9187,"Horrible, don't waste your money. If I could give it a zero I would. DO NOT believe what they say about sizes. Out of 3 supposed womens jeans, 2 ended up being long shorts and one a child's size. False advertising about sizes. Go somewhere you can see what your buying.",1
9188,I am not satisfied at all could not get my returned items or even pay the measly price they wanted to sell them for yet the price they were selling for was higher total scam,1
9189,"Easy, quick shipping, cute packaging, and quality cute clothes for thrift store pricing",5
9190,"I love that my orders don't take long to arrive, and I'm never disappointed with my purchases.",4
9191,Really enjoy buying from thredup. Excellent selection quality and numerous name brands to choose from. Prices seem a little high at times so getting incentives and codes are helpful. I'm from SF Bay area so I love anything that promotes and supports the bay area! Keep rock and rolling! 👍,4
9192,"Always great quality clothing, never dissapointed. Descriptions are spot on, love getting name brands at a big discount.",5
9193,"They said they paid me for the items I sold but I never got the payout. Not very ""user friendly"" when trying to inquire about it and no way to track the payment. Not impressed.",1
9194,Love how cheap everything,5
9195,Haha the prices are like buying them new.I thought the prices would be low but no and not worth.,1
9196,"4 name brand pairs of Jean's for under $40, I'm stoked",5
9197,"I love thredUP! I usually spend hours upon hours scrolling! I have made many purchases so far and have been happy with every single one. Sometimes they offer free shipping, sometimes you have to reach a certain amount. The prices are good, I usually filter price low to high.",5
9198,"Will NEVER shop or send clothing ever again! They're completely money hungry. My clothing came way past delivered date, then it the Jean's didn't fit also had a hole in seem of leg. Couldn't return because it was pass return even tho it didn't come they delivery date! Clean out kits I'm still waiting for mine since mid july!!!!",1
9199,"I appreciate the notifications on my saved searches but when I click on them, it takes me to the main page, not my saved search. And when I click on saved searches, it's rarely there. They may sell that fast, not sure. Also, why so few pics of shoes? If I'm going to pay $100-$200 for a pair of slightly used shoes, I need to see the soles, insoles, lining, and tongue to review use and ensure authenticity. A front and side view is not enough. Hope to see these kind of improvements in the future.",3
9200,Some things can be a bit expensive considering the thrift but I love this app,5
9201,Best site EVER,5
9202,I will buy from here but not sell. I sold several brand name items with tags still on them and less than $5 for each!,2
9203,Amazing I love it,5

9209,Absolutely perfect.,5
9210,I will,5
9211,"Issue #1: I sent my things in to thredUp, had all the outfits folded together so they could be sold TOGETHER. Several months after they received my clothing they were finally posted for sale. As i scrolled through the inventory they posted for sale, several of my good outfits were separated and sold individually!! This made no sense to me! Issue #2: it is nearly impossible to contact their customer service but i finally found an email address and i have yet to get any response back!",2
9212,Love it,5
9213,Not impressed.high prices and very un orderly,1
9214,"Fun,easy to use, clothes are new to me!!",5
9215,IDK,4
9216,Variety of nice inexpensive item to chose from. Timely clean out package label.,5

Ive been telling my friends about u all to.. l will definitely getting the goodie box there awesome so if u want to some awesome and rare clothes or just different very nice prices to I recommend u to down load this app thank you..,5
9218,"*(Caution)When I started buying*:》 love this app.. the clothes are like new. You choose the best, all together . Very good variety. Everyone is going to love it. Of course, if it doesn't matter to use second hand clothing. But I think you'll to like it. *Second review months later(caution)》The prices are RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. Come on, people!. This is USED( second hand) clothes. You are a selfish, abusive company. Hate the prices.people...They think they are selling brand new products. Please😡",5
9219,Happy with almost everything. I think tracking returns is something that needs improvement on the app.,4
9220,User friendly,5
9221,the company is a scam sell your own stuff on poshmark or depop. they fold your items forever and then say here's $5,1
9222,Never got order. Can't reach customer service. I'm out 50 bucks. Don't use them!,1
9223,"i really like this app. i just wish the filters were a bit more broken down into subcategories. I also hate that ya'll list damage such as ,""minor stain"", ""wear on fabric"" but there are no pictures to show damage.",4
9224,You only chat if need help people should be able to call.,2
9225,"Amazing deals, great items andfast shipping. Never disappointed when a package arrives",5
9226,Loooooooooooove!,5
9227,"The personalization on this app SUCKS. It does not recommend you clothes that you'd like. Also, I requested for them to send me a donation bag, as I had clothes that I wanted to donate to them, but despite them claiming my request was accepted, the bag never came. It wouldn't even let me follow-up on the request, which was frustrating. Searching through this app is also a pain. It's very difficult to find what you're looking for, and being a seller on there is also hard. I don't recommend this.",1
9228,Cheaper at my local Salvation Army and just as good.,1
9229,"Going to re-rate the app... It was amazing until they decided to jack the prices way up on everything. Ur selling a shirt on here that I can get for 10 less from actual Victoria's Secert pink store them selves! FYI, Google the prices of some of the items there selling. For instance, a KOOBA tote handbag they r selling for 50 and stating the original price is 498 but its actually only worth 115!",1
9230,Everything I've bought has been in excellent shape with amazing prices! I haven't bought clothes or shoes anywhere else in years. Easy app to navigate very neat and easy on the eyes. No clutter!,5
9231,The heels I ordered came today( 12/14/20). They were practically new and comfortable to walk in. The price was just awesome.,5
9232,Love the concept and simplicity of thredUP although its very addictive. Deeper search refinements would be helpful but overall I love the app and concept!!,5
9233,"Y'all!!! I am absolutely sold and I will also be a loyal customer! How awesome to receive 4 pairs of jeans, that fit!!! And I didn't have to take up a dressing room only to leave store empty handed.This online gig is the best thing you can do for yourself! Save your patience, your time and if a pair doesn't fit then give them to someone you know! Thank you THRED UP!!",5
9234,Fast shipping and amazing prices!!! Love to take advantage of the sales!!! Every order fits perfect and is always in new condition!,5
9235,Need to down load this app,2
9236,"I love this app. It's amazing! The discounts, the packaging. The ckothing they sell its like buying it at regular store. Exceptional customer service too!",5
9237,Great deals and service,5
9238,"The selection is huge and the prices are amazing! It is a little difficult to look through everything to find what you like, though.",4
9239,I love being able to buy darling clothes at affordable prices and help the planet along the way. Shipping is always on-time. I simply have nothing negative to say about thredUP! Give it a try!,5
9240,Great product,5
9241,"I❣ it, everything I have purchased I have been happy with. I will buy through here before I buy through a chain store. I love everything about it the rewards program is awesome and how the purchases help the Planet!",5
9242,"Some of the items I received had stains, or what looked like crusty food on them. Will not use again!",1

9245,Amazing deals on great clothes!,5
9246,Great!,5
9247,Good,5
9248,Wonderful to purchase used sale if items you may enhance your wardrobe.,5
9249,I love thred up. The prices are great. The clothes are in good condition. I have found lots of stuff I love. I love the packaging. I just wish the app was a little faster and I wish the app had a bigger range to search by style.,4
9250,"Bought 3 pairs of shorts and a pair of capris. They all said size 24... Yeah, if I had a 24"" waist! I can only return 2 of the items, have to pay a restocking fee too! I should be able to return it all with no restocking fee since they were not advertised as the right size!",1
9251,Quick service. Easy to use app.,5
9252,Love thrifting online 🖤,5
9253,"Retrieving the money for the 16lb bag of New or like new Lularoe wardrobe. Email's have gone unanswered. I have been in hospital more than I care to share, causing in inability to monitor the constantly monitor the website",3
9254,Very poor customer service and web site is becoming very hard to manage.This was at one time one of my favorites but feel the company is becoming rude and very selfish with their policies and changing things to satisfy an agenda and not caring about their faithful customers.,1
9255,A great way to help the planet and clothe my family for less.,5
9256,ThredUP Is a great online shopping experience I am very happy with everything I have ordered,5
9257,Love it,5
9258,"I've been using thread up for a couple years now. I've sent in several bags of my clothes over the years and I'm hooked! Theres something so rewarding and happy about receiving your little 'clean out' bag, I get excited to get rid of clothes that no longer serve me. It's such an easy and enjoyable process. Prices are fair. The app is simple to understand. I've used alot of my instore credit to fill in my wardrobe and I've gotta say, I love it. I could go on. So yes, I highly recommend!!!",5
9259,LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!,5
9260,"Overall this is an excellent idea and I have received many high quality pieces from Thred Up. I wish that the shipping was more reasonable (and as long as I am wishing), can a more environmentally friendly method be utilized?",3
9261,Easy to find cute clothes,5
9262,"Love this app, but with one annoyance. The way jeans are measured is inaccurate. Thread Up doesn't seem to actually look at any tags for information on the style of jean, just their own way of measuring which in my experience is always wrong, even with brand new jeans and original tags still attached, they get it wrong. Thankfully the accept returns. It's become trial and error to find the jeans your looking for.",5
9263,Cool app,5
9264,I love there clothes there just like brand new,5
9265,Easy to use app and great inventory of affordable sustainable clothes!,5
9266,"I just purchased 4 like-new expensive outfits for $140, which would have cost well over $400 in the store. Very very happy customer!!",5
9267,Cant get any better on the size cart. You can find what you need by it.,5
9268,Great clothes for really good prices!,5
9269,Excellent! I always shop here first now.,5
9270,They said i could not prove i was me...took pic of id and they said decision was final!!! I wanted my order-!!,1
9271,not interested,1
9272,I don't have nothing to say...good or bad,3
9273,I love thread up,5
9274,Awesome place to shop for new and gently used fashion. Great prices. Good return policy. Quick shipping. I would recommend this app to anyone. Go used!,5
9275,Sucks prices way to high for a thrift store,1
9276,"Very straightforward, easy to navigate, clear pics of the merchandise and pretty great prices! And take advantage of the big discounts on your entire first purchase order! New stuff constantly appearing, can be extremely addictive- always tempting to check and see what's new!",5
9277,Love this app.,5
9278,I've bought a few shirts in the last few months and while the items were in good shape the delivery time stinks.. 1 1/2 -2 weeks for a delivery thats along time to wait for something.. but items were as described..,2
9279,Great,5
9280,"Thrifting was a favorite hobby pre pandemic and I've been able to continue it safely here! Definitely not the same great prices you'll find in you're local goodwill, BUT- if you're looking for something specific or designer this is the place! Don't shop, adopt!",5
9281,B.s.! They charge a rediculous price for used items that don't look anything like they do online when you receive them! An you send them stuff to sale and they don't even give you a quarter off the money they make! Its no good!,1
9282,Unsatisfied with a return issue stuck for paying for something I'll never get.,2
9283,Great stuff!,5
9284,"Love the service and love love love the clothes! I can finally afford to dress the way I want to and do the right thing for the planet. Sometimes I wish there were more descriptions of the items (e.g. waist or hip measurements), but everything I've ordered so far has fit like a dream--even better than clothes I try on in stores.",4
9285,"Okay, i understand covid has some things behind .... But you guys say u received my clean-out bag 8/28/20 and its been processing for almost 4 months??!! I need my clothes back!! You guys charge way too much for free stuff u get from people like me barely getting by, thinking youre going to help put some $$ in my pocket!! I would like my clothes , i could make triple if not more than thred-up",1
9286,"Addicted. Great deals, pretty fast shipping, totally worth it!! Love how easy the app makes shopping and I absolutely would recommend this to a friend.",5
9287,"Found what I was looking for, paid and package was sent out next day. GREAT",5
9288,Way too many emails.,2
9289,"Great second-hand clothing shop. I do wish there was a bit more information on some items such as measurements or details. Other than that, I think it's great!",4
9290,This is the worse online selling place I've ever dealt with. I sent my stuff in 4 months ago and they still haven't touched my bag.,1
9291,Ok,3
9292,Items are always in excellent condition. Reasonable prices. Easy to use. Ships fairly quickly.,5
9293,I literally just downloaded it give me a minute to unpin this app I'll go through it and thread out you can see what I'm talkin about,5
9294,It's a fun escape from IRL retail therapy. I often find myself looking for items I've owned in the past or no longer fit and I can usually find them! I even found a favorite brand and go on the hunt for duplicate items... So far 2 of one style I love & 4 of another. I'm old enough to know that beloved staples do wear out and the company eventually stops making them.,5
9295,I enjoy this app.,5
9296,Love the filters. You can find exactly what you're looking for.,5
9297,Very displeased that I sent in a pair of practically brand new Cole Haan shoes and they did not make it into my items being sold. I feel that certain people in the company may be keeping items for themselves.,1
9298,Love that it saves my favorites so I can think about it.,5
9299,Great variety from bargain basement to high end designer.,5
9300,This use to be an awesome place to send on clothes for resell and recycle...now it takes months and months to get processing done...very sad! Won't be using Thred Up anymore.,2
9301,"I sent in a bag of clothes, making sure that nothing had a tear, stain, run or any thing wrong. That's fine. Sold some things, but when I tried to get a payout, the app kept taking me back to the clean out page. After a couple of weeks of that, I thought I'd just buy something with my credit. I chose an item where the description said, ""you may mistake it for new"". That's a joke. Covered in pilling, stretched out of shape, and a quarter sized hole. Once and done for me.",1
9302,Always great,5
9303,I have used thred up for years love it,5
9304,They never have my size or anything appealing,1
9305,Order a purse came pretty quick and if you watch there are awsome codes to use for your purchase.,5
9306,"Love it so much!! Easy app to use and the company is amazing. Good communication, and they take returns. So many good deals!",5
9307,I just love this app..,5
9308,I used to love thredup I thought it was a great app after I got hacked and you guys did nothing about it except for I'm tell me that I I got some letter in the mail saying that I hadn't ordered anything from your f****** website I've spent over $75 probably every 3 months for the past year on your website so don't f****** tell me anything about not spending money on your website for 1 and 2 I had to open multiple accounts because you locked me out of my own account because you believed the other,4
9309,I love it! It saves the planet and my wallet!,5
9310,The fun way to shop!,5
9311,Love it!,5
9312,Easy to use app with a good layout. Great selection of clothes. I wish the photos were a little clearer as it would be easier to judge color and see flaws in an item. A way to search or organize favorite items would be fantastic as well.,4
9313,Love this app! Addicted!,5
9314,Great clothes good sales short delivery times I love this app,5
9315,Great selection of clothing and accessories for all sizes and styles.,5
9316,"I shipped a bag of high end wool coats, suits & clothes that took me a while to collect. Only the clothes were added to my profile to sell. The coats and suits were put on someone else's account. My guess is someone who works there or does the intake of clothes from the way their account looked with my items on it. Maybe they made a big error with 5-6 expensive things -Kind of unlikely. their is no way to track your stuff from received to posted. Re: I didnt review this with a made up story",1
9317,"I love shopping here, especially now during COVID-19. I love to window shop mostly but they have constant deals and you get either cash or credit for donating your old clothes. No hassle.",5
9318,Love this app,5
9319,"Love this app,",5
9320,Nothing for mens clothing,1
9321,Im in love with thredup!,5
9322,"Love the variety, quality, and overall experience!",5
9323,"Returns are a joke and items are overpriced. The description of the items and flaws are terrible. You won't know if the item has a stain or tear until you get it. Why do they feel okay with charging $40 for a shirt that has a hole on it?? Especially, when you won't find out it has a hole until you get it. You can't even return or you'll be charged a restocking fee. Wish I never bought anything from them.",1
9324,"Thred Up is, hands down, the best shopping app ever created!",5
9325,Retail prices wrong. Ive sent in bags to be processed pre covid. I have some due to be processed THIS MONTH. They changed things on the app where sellers could not reclaim items w/o notice. After the outcry the changed it back & saidvthey'd give advance notice on when the policy would be enacted. On the SAME DAY of the change was when they let people know. I sent out a bag prior 2 that. My bag showed tracking the same day affecting my bag. Don't send high end items to them. Payout will be low.,1
9326,Always enjoy seeing the fashionable clothing!!!,5
9327,❤💞💚💜💖💕💙💛💓💗🎀😗😙😁😌🤗😚☺😊😀,5
9328,"Love it! So easy to shop, using the filters they offer. So easy to consign your own items and so easy to return items that didn't look, feel or fit right.",5
9329,"Good for your closet, your wallet and the planet",5
9330,"I really love this place! Great stuff, good price, and saves good clothes from the trash",5
9331,App is very easy to use and sorting feature is a great help. I would use Tired up again.,5
9332,Love thred up!,5
9333,Switched back to my android phone after several months of using an iPhone and I HAVE to update my review of this app because ThredUp had done an awesome job updating it! It works just like the iPhone app now and I love it! Thank you ThredUp!,5
9334,Its just too pricy 4 my taste,1
9335,Hate this app everything is over priced,1
9336,False ad,1
9337,Great prices,5
9338,Great app!!!!,5
9339,"I have been very pleased with the items, until my last purchase. I was able to contact someone and they have been responding to my questions in a timely manner. The prices, are amazing. The shipping is quick. The selection is huge!",5
9340,I downloaded the app to buy clothes but everytime I try to put something in my account it says this platform doesnt support international shipping. I live in canada so it says they ship to canada. Tried to talk to someone about but the customer service was not helpful at all.,1
9341,I LOVE this app! Sooooo many really cute things. Soooo many to pick from and lots of unique items.,5
9342,Love this site.,5
9343,I love that i can buy second hand clothes and new clothes online at a discount! I'm a huge saving person. I have shared with many of my friends the website/app and how great it is! I have bought way too much and way to many times from Thredup... but then not enough! Lol. I will continue to use this app and continue to tell everyone about it. The one thing I would change is to add or filters or make the filters easier. I like to search for Lularoe and tops or bottoms but I can only search Lularoe,5
9344,So very happy I found it!,5
9345,I love this site!,5
9346,I love this app.,5
9347,Has anyone sold anything on here? In 6 months I havent..only sent top of the line clothing and shoes.,2
9348,"It's very easy to use, especially with the ability to get really specific with your searches so you're not sifting through tens of thousands of items. The only reasons I didn't give five stars is because I wish they had men's clothing, and because they have almost zero jewelry. Otherwise it's fantastic.",4
9349,Endless options. Enjoy this company.,4
9350,Really easy to navigate. Inexpensive clothes.,5
9351,Love this app!,5
9352,Didn't care for it,1
9353,"I think I'm officially done with this app. I purchased items that say they are like new but have runs, holes, and stains on them. Just recently they canceled an order on me that was meant to be a gift for someone and now I can't find this item anywhere else. I used to love this app but now I can't shop here anymore. I'll use postmark and ebay instead.",2
9354,"I absolutely LOVE thrift stores, so this app/website was totally an act of reading my mind when it was created. Im such a fashion junkie and a bargain hunter from hell, thredup appeals to me for those reasons and because I feel much better about spending money on fashion that helps in reducing landfill dumping and helps to recycle our reusable resources... Than supporting large chain corporations like walmart and such just to be able to get clothes I can afford.",5
9355,"App functions well, even during blow out sales. Easy to navigate!",5
9356,"Didn't try very long. But, good deals on clothes. I didn't see where they give clothes to people in need. But, maybe I just couldn't see that part.",3
9357,"Love thread up! As a busy working mom, I do not have time to shop in stores anymore. This app has reasonably priced, nice clothes that I can buy from the comfort of my home. I highly recommend it! My only criticism is that the search function sucks, I have to scroll for a while to find what I am looking for.",4
9358,So far so good,5
9359,I need to block this site too many cute things. It's like a garage sale from my bed.. At 3am..,4
9360,"Love thredUP the store though the app is buggy (saved searches that have a low number of results don't display the items, sometimes the shipping from value says null, not seeing all saved searches sometimes unless you restart the app)",5
9361,I am new to app so still learning while scrolling thru all the very nice merchandise and the great prices!! Awaiting my first purchase to arrive...cant waite so excited. Did I mention that most items have free shipping !!!!👍👍👍👍,4
9362,Super user friendly!,5
9363,"I love clothes, accessories, shoes. I love everything! Thank you guys!",5
9364,Cant find what I look for! Like tennis shoes!!,1
9365,I bought items that where not the size stated but didn't worry just figured I return them didn't know that you don't get your money back you only get a shop credit after they take a restock fee,2
9366,Wonderful selection and price to boot!,5
9367,Clothes are just not my style 😒,2
9368,Just blah,1
9369,Easy to shop. Good description of clothing. Great discount!,5
9370,"Displays items nicely, works quickly, and the filter and search functions work efficiently.",5
9371,"not interested, much designer clothing. im not into labels",1
9372,Super easy to shop!,5
9373,Over priced for used goods. Don't waste your time with this app. You will get better bargains at Goodwill.,1
9374,"Really great except the general search could be better, like winter coats should pull up heavy coats but nothing comes up.",4
9375,It's the only way I buy clothes. Filters and My Sizes make it easy.,5
9376,"Choice, prices and ordering are awesome.",5
9377,Addicting!!,5
9378,The ONLY way I shop. Amazing deals for brand names clothes♡♡♡♡♡♡♡,5
9379,Have been waiting for over a month for them to process my bag and when I check my account they tell me I don't have a bag!?,1
9380,I find high quality items which looks better on me a better prices.,5
9381,"Best idea ever. This site has everything! Vintage, morden, and new age. Its like going through hundreds of your best friends closets.",5

9383,"Simple, easy, fun!",5
9384,"I absolutely LOVE this app! Prices are great, shipping times are great! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",5
9385,"I've had Countless problems. I have to request refunds, awaiting my items be processed. Paid for full refund and got credit. Order a goody box horrible choices and wreacked of cigarettes. I only give 3 stars because what I pick is generally pretty good but I'm not sure this is the company I trust to work with loosing money. Reward points and time to ship. This has been a 6 or 7 month relationship that I feel I do there job not them.",3
9386,5 Stars,5
9387,Easy to use,5
9388,I love everything I've purchased from your company.,5
9389,Fantastic!,5
9390,I love the browsing experience. When you leave a page you go back directly to where you left off so you don't need to scroll through items you have viewed already. Little things like this makes the browsing experience better for the end user.,5
9391,Love it. So easy to create your own favorites and then store it for review. Good sales and customer service is great.,5
9392,Love ThredUP!,5
9393,My new favorite addiction.,5
9394,"Great clothes, great prices, and always will find something you must have right now. Lots of fun!",5
9395,I love this app! Will there ever be a section for men? My husband would really like to buy clothes from here.,5
9396,So far I've experienced the perfection that this app can be. I favorite items and purchase them when I can. And they take no longer than 5 days to receive and my daughter now loves her wardrobe so thank you for that.,5
9397,Love thred up!!!,5
9398,Exactly what I was looking for.,5
9399,You got my clothes and never got paid.,5
9400,"Wish the app deep linked. I love thredup but when it sends me a notification of something I've favorites that's on sale and I click on it, it takes me back to the homepage. It's very frustrating.",3
9401,Amazing,5
9402,"Love this app! Shopping is so easy, the filters are great, and of course thrifting from your phone is incredible!!",5
9403,Love it!!!!,5
9404,"I really like the app, it's easy to use, 4 stars because there are a few times when errors have occurred.",4
9405,Stupid,1
9406,Awesome site,5
9407,Prices are nearly as high as buying new. Literally.,3
9408,"Great finds on this site. It's fun to find a bargain. I've sold quite a few garments through thredup, too, and it's easy.",5
9409,"I love it so far. Just made a few orders, once they come in I'll know more about the full experience. There are tons of cute things in my size. Huge selection. I really enjoyed the sale options, reward system, and buy/bundle features (helps save on shipping).",5
9410,I ordered a purse and sometimes when you order a purse online it doesn't fit your body because when you're in the store you kind of put them on your arm and see if they fit good. well this one fits perfectly and I love it and I didn't know it was purple my favorite color. even better. I will share the love,5
9411,"I gained weight and changed my sizes in the app, but for whatever reason, no matter what I do, it continues to search with the old sizes included, which is so so frustrating. I know that stuff won't fit me.",2
9412,Great app. Love it!,5
9413,Items ordered received promptly in promised condition. Allows me to purchase quality clothing on a limited budget.,5
9414,So far I enjoy shopping with you 😉,4
9415,I have ordered from this app twice now and I was able to get the gift card fixed. They where able to email me to help fix the issue. Now in order to use the e gift card you will have to log in on the PC version and not the app version. The app version does not let you pick the gift card as an option. If you have any issue ls with the e-gift card the way to contact them is pick one of the topics and then type out the issue. There is no e-gift card issue option.,5
9416,Updates really helped ease shopping with my phone. I have recommended to several people.,5
9417,The Thredup app works well.,5
9418,Was good for a while then the new update caused it to quit working. App won't fully load or it freezes. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still didn't work. I'll probably just have to use the website. Oh well,3
9419,"Don't buy the rescue box! Invoice comes with box states you purchased ""rejects"" and that's exactly what I got! I will be redonating everything! What a scam!",1
9420,Fast and easy. Everything arrives well packaged and the paper is very good look- ing.,5
9421,The best,5
9422,I just looked at it once time restrances,3
9423,It is easy to use and has a good selection of items.,5
9424,They items I purchased where Perfect! I will shop here more often for sure!!,5
9425,Love the prices,5
9426,Expensive,3
9427,"I created my account through Amazon ages ago and could initially sign into the app that way, but haven't been able to for months. Works on the desktop site, but not the app. No other way to sign in or transfer my account info to a new log in. Super frustrating.",1
9428,"I was addicted to ThredUp at 1st. Now I've spent a boat load of $ with them they started getting sloppy. I wear a wide shoe, started getting my size in narrow. I'm full figured women's (2x) now I'm getting 2x in kids clothes. Don't get me wrong, I purchased some sharp items, but it upsets me when I can't fit them, and charged to return them, so I'm stuck with them. This is a Update. It's currently 11/23/2020 Thredup is a scam. They promise no hassle returns, they block your assess to returns",1
9429,"Great prices. Returns are easy. Points add up! Very happy. So far, so good. 👍",5
9430,"This is best app created so practical to earn money, gently used clothes and brand new clothes! Could not be happier with this app because the possibilities are endless and the upgrades they have made has taken this app to the next level.",5
9431,This site sucks there Customer Service sucks they have 6 of my bags and refuses to send them back there a bunch of thieves dont trust them,1
9432,I love thredUP!!!!,5
9433,Good idea!,5
9434,ThredUP is my go-to online site for all things fashion related. 29.99 Vintage Silver Jeans in like-new condition? Crazy! But the best kind of crazy!,5
9435,LOVE this app!!,5
9436,This app is a online consignment shop. I mainly buy my Dooney & Bourke bags from them. The really are gently used. The bags I have gotten looked brand new and also the clothing items.,5
9437,"The app does not have the features of the website. It can be a glitchy when switching inbetween favorites. The payouts are terrible, but you don't have to work for them. The customer service is slow, but at least they get back to you.",3
9438,The turn around time for clean out bags are shameful as well as response time for emails.My bags were received in August and nothing has been posted for sale I was hoping to use the cash for Christmas gifts .,1
9439,"I love shopping with ThredUp! I've made a few orders now and each time I've loved what I've received. I just bought an item that was brand new with tags on it for half of the original price. It's good for the environment and I get a good deal too...yet no one else can tell I'm wearing second-hand clothes! Especially during the pandemic it's been great to shop from home. I believe you are able to return in the same envelope they mail your order in if you wish, though I've never needed to!",5
9440,"Sent in a box of stuff in March, the finally got the stuff listed in November. The percentages that I will receive IF the Summer clothes sell is not worth the effort of sending them in. Will not make this mistake again.",2
9441,"All in all, good app. It's easy to place orders and the shipping is free with orders over $75, it's not insanely expensive if you don't reach $75 either. The clothing on the default page or the new page isn't great looking, but it's easy to find great discounts and nice clothing if you search a brand that you know you like.",4
9442,I sent 3 bags in to this place in June 2020nand here it is November 2020. My earnings ZERO... .SOME STUFF NEW WITH TAGS. DO NOT SRND YOYR STUFF TO THIS RIP OFF PLACE. JJMYERS,1
9443,"Thredup as a whole is good and this app makes it easy to use on mobile. I just wish it was easier to find exactly what I'm looking for. You can't really look for ""puff sleeve blouse"". You have to look by generics or brand and filter to find good stuff.",4
9444,No way to see the history of items you viewed. If you accidentally hit your back button app closes and there's no way to pick back up where you left off and with no history you will have to start over to find that item.,2
9445,Great App,5
9446,I absolutely love this app the prices and selection are great I recommend it to all of my friends the only reason I did not give it a five is because occasionally the app will fail thank you thread up,4
9447,This is very cool,5
9448,No men's section,2
9449,"Super easy to use, and also extremely easy to look for anything with all the filters you can add to a search term.",5
9450,"Love having this ar the tip of my fingers, maybe too easy ;)",5
9451,"Really nice way to shop for wardrobe pieces. Sort by price, color, brand, category, occasion, etc., whatever is important to you. My daughters and I are dressing well for less thanks to ThredUP and this app.",5
9452,"Love, love love it!!!",5
9453,You can find lots of things that you can't find in a regular store. I really like shopping treadup.,5
9454,"Great prices, great options, great cause, great app",5
9455,Its ok not really a sheap shopping the app when u get the box but its nice try new things to see of like the style,2
9456,Amazing App. Amazing deals.,5
9457,I am still waiting for my bag to send items to company. smh,2
9458,Terrible customer service. Chat function is never actually available. I have sent two emails over a month ago and still have not recieved a response.,2
9459,Great clothes and low price,5
9460,No mens category. Uninstalling,2
9461,Trusted site,5
9462,"Awesome prices, great selection, easy to use!!!",5
9463,Fun! The sellers are great. And prompt!,5
9464,Quality sucks. Not worth your time.,1
9465,Did not like,1
9466,Yuck,1
9467,"So happy to see two of my favorite things in an app, shopping and sustainability. The process is easy. The goody boxes are well thought out. I'm looking forward to my next order!",5
9468,Ok they take forever to post ur clothes. Covid slowing them down. I buy jeans had a issue so i needed more time to return item . Oh hell no 14 days. Money u get not worth it. Consignment better off,5
9469,"Unsatisfied The app is great to purchase items but, to placea Bag sucks. Months ago in July my package was received, its November and yet to be processed. I do know there's weeks of wait but months.. SMH, lost items...",2
9470,Amazing app for finding the hard to find items at Amazing prices!!!!,5
9471,I like the clothes are hard to find styles. Love the app.,5
9472,AWESOMENESS,5
9473,Great buys,5
9474,"Great prices, and service. Thanks i found just what I was looking for!!",5
9475,I would rate higher if ThredUP had listings for men's clothing and accessories.,2
9476,I really love revamping my wardrobe for cheap. They have cute clothes and options. It's almost easy to find what you want... I tend to have to dig though.,5
9477,Love thtedUP,5
9478,"The only reason For 1 star is so that I can say just how Very Much I Dislike this App. A complete Waste of Time Each Time, Weeks apart.",1
9479,"My favorite app to order clothes from. Have the best children's clothes at HUGE price cuts, plus sizes as well. Highly recommend, they're generously priced and always have sales!",5
9480,"I bought a total of 3 items for the first time. 2 items that I loved were unreturnable. 1 item that was returnable and I wanted to return for store credit because it was see through material, I was not able to return? The purses were cross bodies and perfect for an upcoming trip. They are 5 stars, but your online process for new buyers sends mixed messages.",3
9481,Seamless,4
9482,Expensive,2
9483,Nice,5
9484,Terrific!,5
9485,I deleted the app the same day I put it on my phone. I just didn't like it. I'm sure others would enjoy it.,3
9486,The most amazing thing ive ever experienced without this app i am nothing,5
9487,Very easy app to use and also receive items very fast. Love this app.,5
9488,Excellant fair pricef,5
9489,"Great good quality, name brands great prices!!!❤",5
9490,Great app for an already great site,5
9491,"Go head 🗣️. I love ordering from here. Reasonable prices, always.",5
9492,I finally received both jackets. Both of them was in great shape and one jacket looked new. Fast shipping even tho UPS delivered to the wrong house. But my neighbor put them in my mailbox.,5
9493,Great quality clothing at discounted prices,5
9494,Clothes were like new the fit was perfect and I will order more Love thred up and I will orde more,5
9495,"Great concept, great app.",5
9496,it's good.,5
9497,Great shopping experience.,5
9498,"Awesome finds, and great prices.",5
9499,Love it. Most of my favorite outfits have come from thredup,5
9500,Good app. To vent.,5
9501,Didn't like the application,2
9502,The best clothes ever with a size chart,5
9503,Loving this app I find everything I need.,5
9504,"I have shopped with ThredUp since slightly before Mother""s Day and I have been very pleased with the results so far. Good selections to choose from, very good prices and excellent deals besides the already decent amount you pay. This was the first time in a long, long time that I have bought this much new (to me anyway) clothing since high school and before I had my son in 1983! And I still wish I had saved a lot of the clothing from back in the day, as they would still fit.",5
9505,Awesome! Love it!,5
9506,"So disappointed anymore. The more I thrift, the more I recognize how outrageous these prices are! I only use when searching for a specific item now :-( (I'm completely addicted. It's extremely user- friendly, organized, and always operational!!)",2
9507,Google new phone,5
9508,There is no option to shop men's clothing. I will be deleting.,2
9509,"I really enjoyed thred up for a long time. I had requested several bags which I had actually stolen from our mailbox to send items. since coronavirus I have not received a bag , although I've requested. Even though they say it's been shipped Not one has been delievered. The new format is not user friendly. I have difficulty getting online to see the items and to check my account. I have purchased items and sold many too. I would love to continue doing this but have no luck getting into the site.",2
9510,"Great stuff, Great prices 👍update 11/20 Awesome Stuff!!!!",5
9511,I love Thredup!!! Ive received beautiful clothing and it was very aforadable. Everything I received looked new!!,5
9512,DO NOT SEND YOUR CLOTHES IN TO BE SOLD AND EXPECT TO MAKE ANY REASONABLE MONEY. THE PAYOUTS ARE RIDICULOUS. SOLD A $200 COACH BAG FOR $20 AND GAVE ME $1.87. NOT SATISFIED AT ALL. I WAS HOPING TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY. I COULD HAVE SOLD IT FOR $1. SUPER UPSET. 😡,1
9513,Love it great deals,5
9514,"Love, love,love Thread Up!!! I've been very pleased with everything I ordered. I tell ALL my friends about ""Thread Up. Keep up the good work and I will always be a loyal customer!😁",5
9515,UPDATE : NOT WORKING ON MY FIRE 10 TABLET :( I love the thredup app it gives you so many options and filters for your particular choices the only thing I would change I would love to see a way where you could actually share your favorites list with your significant other or spouse my man loves the clothes that I buy or that I pick and he loves it even more when he's able to buy them for me hint hint Thank you thread up Why cant i shop a cart???,5
9516,Need to work onthat part,4
9517,Great,5
9518,I will never go through this app again. When I donated my bag it took 4 months longer than the time that was already extended from COVID. I then was told I would be paid upfront for my items by customer service but that wasn't the case once they got my order. They charge an insane amount to have your items shipped back that they didn't take and they charge you AGAIN for any items that didn't sell that you would like to reclaim. This company scams the person selling clothes. Never again!!,1
9519,"I am updating my previous review. I have it been able to use the app for the past couple of months. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it several times and it just won't load up. I would give it 5 stars except when i click the back button, it closes the app instead of just going back 1 window. Annoying when you have been shopping for a while. Fix that and I will give it 5 stars!",1
9520,Great place for second hand clothes. Great discounts,5
9521,I love it! You can renew your wardrobe without breaking the bank!,5
9522,"UPDATE: Vinted is another online thrift store that is so much better! And 100% of the sale goes to the owner of the item being sold!*** Not really a 'Thrift'... Nothing is listed for under $5 which is what a thrift store is all about. Its more of just a used clothing store with mediocre pricing. Also, searching for clothing is a maze. You type a key word in the search bar and it only shows clothing that has that word in the brand name. The only ' sundresses' you see are the brands names SUNDRESS",2
9523,I love Thred Up . the prices are very affordable,5
9524,I gave 5 stars however I did find someone's dirty sock in a pocket of a jacket I bought LOL.,5
9525,My new go to. I check here first when I need something. Have found excellent buys.,5
9526,"I just love everything I have purchased from you!! When I need something specific, I look to you, no going everywhere, no mask, social distancing, and everything always fits. During this time when it's hard to go anywhere I still can shop & get quality. Thank You",5
9527,I love this company.,5
9528,"Great deals in name brands, lots of options, good pics, easy returns when needed",5
9529,"Opened 2 separate accounts for our house hold. Promo was only applied once. Several orders were made and they took my money. Orders were canceled for having 2 separate accounts in same house hold. Even though 1 promo was ever applied to each account. Clothes came with buttons missing, and not matching the photos. 1st time user and last time user. Nothing else had a promo and my money is tied up in them and they email that they are going to cancle because of this! SO WRONG!",1
9530,Not sure it's for me,1
9531,Purchased a few things,4
9532,Loving the new version! Much more user friendly. Love the shipping options and disc. Given regularly,4
9533,"I've purchased alot of pretty decent things but on my last order it was cancelled for no apparent reason... I spent a good 2+ hours carefully picking out the things I desperately need for work and the next day all cancelled! I tried to reorder but naturally it was all gone. That was it for me! I messaged them and got no response, also one would think maybe a small discount for essential workers who are struggling nope absolutely nothing!",1
9534,The best way to find designer gently used clothing at wonderful prices! I love Thread Up! It's my new addiction 😁,5
9535,Amazing service! Everything was exactly as it was described! I'm hooked!!,5
9536,This a wonderful source of clothing for everyone. I have 4 great nephews and I purchase a lot of stuff for them. Their prices are good and I receive the merchandise in a timely manner.,5
9537,Tried cancelling several several times can't get through,3
9538,Amazing customer service! I had a package that showed it was delivered but i did not receive it. They immediately refunded my money and told me some times the tracking is off and i could still receive the merchandise. A week later i received the clothes. I am addicted to this app!,5
9539,The quality of whatever I purchase is just awesome. I love it!!!,5
9540,I love Thread Up. So many choices. Returns are easy and un complicated.,5
9541,I love the Bundling. But i have enjoyed shopping with thread up for some time now. The ease of ordering and returning if becessary is great.,5
9542,Great finds!,5
9543,Have never recieved any orders from thredUP.,2
9544,"Some major price hikes took place just over the past few days and every item in my favorites list has gone from dirt cheap to higher than retail when buying new! This has all but ruined this app for me as well as completely diminished all hopes I once had of purchasing these things from Thredup! This absolutely screams of price-gauging, and during a global pandemic to boot... You should be ashamed of yourself Thredup, for becoming so greedy at a time when you could have actually helped so many!",1
9545,Awesome buys,5
9546,Love to shop here!!,5
9547,I am addicted! I cant quit buying!!,5
9548,Some of the items are overpriced for being consignment. Sometimes you can find the same or similar items cheaper elsewhere. They offer fair prices on higher end brands. I recently had a bad experience and reached out to customer service not really expecting anything just wanting to share my experience with them and their customer service team went above and beyond. I was impressed with how they handled everything and how professional they were.,4
9549,I love ThredUp! The app is really easy to use and they have lots of great items.,5
9550,"I love finding great deals on this app. I did lose several offers as I tried to use more than one offer on a single purchase. It seems unfair that the reward/offer is counted as used when it wasn't. Lesson learned! Otherwise, I am very pleased with my purchases!",4
9551,Good prices on a wide variety of items. I enjoy looking for good deals.,5
9552,Perfect way to find clothes you love and support sustainability by buying and selling gently loved threads!,5
9553,"Clean out bag disaster!!!...I returned a Clean out bag to Thredup back in June, and they received it on June 14th...it is now November 13th, almost 5 months later, and I have not seen any progress except for today, and it was a message to tell me the estimated processing date was 8/15...now is that 2020, or 2021? I don't know, but don't send them anything if you want a quick turnaround.",1
9554,Many of the clothing are not sized correctly. and many of the clothing that's suppose to be new look like they have been worn.,3
9555,I absolutely love this app,5
9556,Atleast they are consistent!!!!! In their horrible customer service but to add their prices are not even that good anymore why would I pay more for used clothing when I can order from Nordstrom's rack for same or lately much cheaper!!!!! Even handbags on coach website go for less than used one. This is just to warn customers because even if they respond to a complaint on here and ask to give them a chance to make it right. I've sent emails multiple times 4 months ago STILL WAITING NOTHING,1
9557,I sunt my clothes to them but get pennys for giving them my clothes.,1
9558,Great they are awesome,5
9559,Shoes!!!!!,5
9560,I like it. Get nice clothes for cheap. Especially with growing little ones. Hard for me to get out to go clothes shopping so this makes it easy.,5
9561,The app won't open on my phone. I use the web browser version.,2
9562,Nothing better than threadUP! I love this app so much!!,5
9563,Clothes are not whats trendy. Tons of old women clothing for decent prices but anything trendy or for a woman under 60 years old is pricey even though its used. Categorization is not good. Options not good.,1
9564,"Love this app, it's a great place to find deals on all your favorite brands!!!!",5
9565,"I really want to like this brand, but I just don't. The prices are way too high for used clothing. You can get 90% of these items for much cheaper brand new if you wait for a sale or have a promo code. Why would a pair of Carters 0-3 month pants cost me $15 used?? The app is trash as well. Every time I use the filter option it never works. So instead I have to fish through the entire clothing category and hope to find something in the size that fits me.",2
9566,"It's great! I buy all of my clothes from here now! They even let you know the status of an item now. . whether it's reserved, sold or available! Update: new updated app is so crappy. The thing won't even open ugh!!",1
9567,It's cool,4
9568,I lovs thred up. Its great that you can search by brand or material or something but I look forward to the day you can just put a word or description in the search bar and find all the shirts with a sports team or stars on them in one go.,4
9569,"So easy to use and great clothes!! Really intuitive to search and find things. Wish the ""other similar clothes,"" would search by size as well as type.",5
9570,"Not convinced the wins are worth the losses. The quality descriptions are misleading. Received a final sale item that was described in ""you might mistake it for brand new"" condition; it definitely was not. Tried Thred Up again because of a few good finds, but yet again, I received an items listed as like new with obvious flaws. It is frustrating to spend hundreds on an order for a pair leather shorts to have a belt loop ripped out and a beaded dress with a string of beads dangling off.",1
9571,Fun place to shop,5
9572,Update! They gave me my refund and I was angry when posting the first review. Still upset about the search format but its alright.,4
9573,LOVE this app. LOVE the care that they put into every single order. LOVE THREADUP!!,5
9574,"Ordering and receiving the items I ordered was no issue. Thredup sent me 3 out of 5 items I ordered correctly but 2 were way off. One pair of ""black"" pants ended up actually being blue and the size small black dress I ordered ended up being a 3x !!! They are non-returnable items but they are literally not even close to what I ordered. 😐",2
9575,Great prices quality clothes,5
9576,Easy shopping,5
9577,Love Love Love 🤗,5
9578,Really good prices and selection,5
9579,"Do not recommend selling or shopping with thredup. It takes weeks to get a response from customer service. They mess up constantly, list things wrong, undervalue items and then refused to reimburse anything close to the value of an item. (10% of retail really?) They just announced their ipo and all they care about is making money for investors. They do not care about you and their customer service absolutely reflects that. Shop at your local second handshops. Not here.",1
9580,I love this app so much I keep coming back!!,5
9581,Got everything I wanted,5
9582,"Horrible customer service. Bought a wool sweater and received it with moth holes, despite excellent description. Theres no way to reach a live person for help, all you can do is send a message and wait with no way to check on your request in the meantime. Also, extremely low consignment prices for sellers with most items unaccepted.",1
9583,"I'm addicted to the ""browse"" Great fun and items I can afford",5
9584,"Probably the best clothing subscription I found so far, they totally sent things I wanted! Things I would wear! I will keep my subscription",5
9585,Would like mire pics of the each item.,3
9586,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you cannot sort through your favorites by size, price, color, etc. I have hundreds of items on my favorite list, and it's hard to sift through. Wonderful app!!!",4
9587,"Worst company to cancell an order,specially if you didn't make the purchase,no one to talk to or a phone #,not supplying a phone is very sketchy. ,we as older people not familiar with computers are vulnerable to these scams,i was charged not my doing,they are still sending me merchandise not ordered one was $164.00 they made sure they send out the most expensive one. The chat they offer comes with a price of 12.95 per month,if you don't pay this,they want cancel your order. Very disappointed 😞.",1
9588,Like things and gift given.,4
9589,I still have not received two packages that were for my daughter's birthday and it's been over a month and no answers or reasons why,1
9590,"I 💗💗💗LOVE💗💗💗LOVE thredUP!!! It allows me to shop in my budget, &, everything I have purchased, I love!!! Thank you, so much💗💗💗11/8/20 I boufht a pair of boots, said size 8 M, but, they fit like 71/2 N. It would cost a lot to send them back, and, they were not cheap. Thred up does not include a return address label.",5
9591,"I love the thriftiness here! It takes a minute to learn to work the filters and the bundles to get the absolute BEST deal, but it's worth it. Marked down 1 star because the email response is very slow if there is an issue. (I had a return that was destroyed by FedEx and it took quite a while to get a response. I will also share; however, that as soon as they looked into it, they refunded my money immediately and in the original form of payment and dealt with FedEx on their end).",4
9592,Love the store hate that the app stops working on my Pixel every time there is an update.,2
9593,Terrible company! THIEVES. Take your good items for their profit but you think they're being donated. Company is a scam. DO NOT USE THREDUP,1
9594,Love it!!!!,5
9595,Awesome,5
9596,"Huge selection and options. My one request would be a few more filtering options. They have a lot now, but I find myself wanting to filter by a few options the don't have.",4
9597,"Was paid disgustly low. 99% of my items were new with tags. Also, my second bag still has not been processed since 8 months ago. Horrible company and experience",1
9598,Used clothing at new prices! Don't waste your time. Almost all the pants I looked at were $22 and up!,1
9599,Failed to mention its WOMANS only with children clothes,1
9600,"Love this store!!!! Wish the restocking fees weren't a thing, but I like that I can waive them with the rewards points.",5
9601,Ive me more time.,2
9602,Thrift store without mens clothes. Sad.,1
9603,"Pros: the user interface is cool, I like that you can customize your search and look things up by brand. The clothes I received were in good condition, they did not smell weird, and fit like they said they would. Cons: the shipping is annoying. They have an option where you can bundle but it seemed weird the way the had it and I just didn't want to deal with it. I wished it was a little faster. Also WHERE ARE THE MEN'S CLOTHES? The prices are not revolutionary either. Just my opinions.",3
9604,Amazing!!!,5
9605,TERRIBLE,1
9606,"Love browsing in this app! It's quick, easy and fun to use",5
9607,Got used clothes it's too expensive,1
9608,"I like that they only sell items above a certain quality, but I wish the search function was a little different. If I don't use exactly the perfect words, nothing will show up.",4
9609,"I love shopping for baby clothes on here. Returns are easy to make if something doesn't fit or is more worn than I expected. Occasionally the prices seem a bit high for used, but it is consignment so it's going to be a little higher than thrift shop prices.",4
9610,Haven't placed my order at this time but I will be able to let you know then.,5
9611,I absolutely love love love this app pluses all around great for the planet not to mention your budget,5
9612,"Not impressed, not really thrift store prices imo. I could buy brand new lesser known items for less that look just as nice as these designer brands.",2
9613,"Do not send your items in. I sent in a full bag of items, many new with tags. I received maybe $10 that I could never get transferred to PayPal. I finally ordered a shirt and there was a hole in the sleeve.",1
9614,"Ordered a lot of stuff for very great prices! Quality is top of the line for the stuff that I ordered! Will be keeping all but 1 of the items and am only returning because there is a peekaboo on the stomach of the dress that wasn't visible in the picture. Will edit and adjust stars accordingly if necessary after return process. Items delivered in 4 separate packages. 2 have already arrived and it hasn't even been a week since I ordered! Very neatly packed, easy checkout. Will be ordering again!",5
9615,"This is my first really disappointing item. In the description, this was called ""could be mistaken as brand new"". The condition of this bag definitly says "" it was USED. Its not returnable so I'm stuck with it.",2
9616,Affordable! Love it!,5
9617,I love the clothes!!! They are true to size!! Thanks!! Keep up the great work!!!,5
9618,Excellent way for finding quality clothing for great prices!,5
9619,"Love this app! I haven't purchased new clothes from a store in years! With the ever changing bodies women and kids have, there's no point to buy new. We fill our closets from ThredUp and when we grow or shrink or get pregnant or give birth, our closets can adapt with ease.",5
9620,"Super easy to search and browse, the site has great deals and is forthcoming about any imperfections on the items they're selling. I could scroll and browse on this app for hours.",5
9621,Shopping for a an outfit is so easy now. No more waiting in lines. It is all done from the comfort of my phone.,5
9622,It was a lot of fun to use,5
9623,Got a great bag for a great price! Love this app. Trust and recommend,4
9624,I absolutely love threadUp! I have discovered many new clothing lines that are now within my budget thanks to threadUp. Awsome prices for Premium Products !!!!,5
9625,Great Deals,5
9626,i Love This App..,5
9627,"Loves it.iv gotten new WITH TAGS VIC.SECRET, FREE PEOPLE & SO MANY OTHERS FOR 87% OFF, IF BOUGHT IN STORE!!!! IF U NEED ANYTHING BUY FROM HERE!!!! IV GOTTEN HARD TO FIND CLOTHES, SHOES, & IM SKINNY& TALL, & IV GOTTEN SZ.3 TALLJEANS FROM THE MOST $$$$$$ BRANDS& PAID DOLLARS!!!! NOV.5TH2020, FILLED THIS OUT.",5
9628,Love it! Addicted!,5
9629,I really like all the clothing I have purchased from thred up. Thank you so much 💗,5
9630,Love it,5
9631,♥️,5
9632,"This is my favorite shopping app. Great prices, shipping, everything.",5
9633,I always get exactly what I ordered. Great experience!,5
9634,Awesome!!,5
9635,Much smoother to use than using the site on your phone. Sometimes freezes on load/launch screen though. Seems to be a more recent problem. Using Samsung galaxy s20+5g,4
9636,Cute clothes at bargain prices. Pleased with every purchase!,5
9637,Everything I purchased was always in great condition n I've been very happy with my purchases!!,5
9638,I'm addicted to this app and spend way more money than i should but honestly it's worth it,5
9639,Great deals but need more promos for exsisting customers,4
9640,I would give a 0 if I could. I am going to report them to the Better Business Bureau because I cannot get in touch with customer service and I never received my payout for the many designer clothing I had sent.,1
9641,"Love the ThredUp! app. I love that it's got a huge variety of clothes, shoes and accessories. And you have a choice of your price range. Whether I'm feeling thrifty or I feel like splurging. Super easy to return items also if you need to. Best of all it's great to recycle to help our planet. ❤️",5
9642,Love it!!,5
9643,Slightly addicted,5
9644,"Very very poor customer service! My package was supposed to be delivered 5 days back, there is no update of it. Neither thredup has any answer nor carrier service. Both the parties are just blaming each other. Thredup customer representative is rude as well !! Very very disappointed. My order was a gift for someone and it is way past their special day!! Thredup does not provide complete refund as well !! Even asks for re-stocking fee. Cheap !! Very disappointed with Thredup, had high hopes😞",1
9645,Love thredUP!! Sizes from brands I love!,5
9646,Freezes constantly! Also the items I see in ads are never actually available. Click bait!,1
9647,Love it!,5
9648,Prices couldvbe a bit lower but they do have good clothing,5
9649,"Love this app, love the selection and the range in prices. The only problem I have had recently is when I open my ThreadUP app, the loading circle appears, then nothing loads...UPDATE!! the app is back to normal except I still can't start my returnings... As soon as click the box to return, click the reason, and click the big black ""return"" button, the app crashes...",3
9650,Shopping from new to gently used. Great variety to choose from. Super selections including must have brand names.,5
9651,Love it,5
9652,"I don't like that it is mainly a brand search centric thrift service. I'd rather be able to search keywords. There is a filter to kind of help with that, but I find it highly annoying to use. Measurements for the sizing are too general, women's clothing is extremely varied based on brand. 3 out of 5 items I ordered I have to return because of sizing and there's a restocking fee for returns. I'm not impressed.",2
9653,Love Thred Up. Great deals,5
9654,"Always love this site. I almost always keep what I've ordered & if it doesn't work out, Thred Up has made it so easy for returns. Thank you Three Up...",5
9655,Love it,5
9656,Do not buy from this place! Not only do you have to pay for the return label you have to pay a restocking fee and you do not get the full amount you paid back you get refunded at a discounted rate. And all the clothes smell like mothballs.,1
9657,Easy to sort/shop. Nice getting notifications when something matches my searches.,5
9658,I've sent a bag with clothes to sell and they received it on July and it says in the app that it hasn't even been processed yet. I've tried to contact them a couple of months ago but they didn't even respond to my emails.,1
9659,"VERY bad first experience. I bought a ""final sale"" pair of shoes that I intended on wearing at my small outdoor wedding. The pictures were very deceiving and discription was vague. It said ""minor wear""... but the bottom of both shoes were flapping. That's not ""minor"" and I WOULD NOT have wasted my money if I had known. I will not be making any more purchases through Thredup.",1
9660,I still love this app and use it all the time! one of my favorite shopping apps. I always find something I like at a great deal.,5
9661,"Should have better options if you want to browse a type of item vs a brand. As far as brand is concerned, I always look up torrid, but your items are double what I'd pay with on sale or clearance items on torrid for new items. (There is always a sale on something!) Your pricing needs to be adjusted by someone who actually looks at these brands websites and not what the tag says so much as how quickly an item is comfortably under 20 dollars.. my advice, just stop new, this is a waist",2
9662,Love the selection and fast shipping,5
9663,"They are well organized, easy to use and have great selection.",5
9664,"I am in love with this app. Great prices, quick delivery and so many options and deals all the time! My wallet is cringing, but I'm one happy camper.",5
9665,"This app is the bee's knees. A selection that is consistently growing and has an excellent variety. Great prices, great sales, many ways to earn discounts, super friendly and helpful customer service and no issues in with any order I have ever places. Thr clothes arrive packed with care and are always in proper condition. My new favorite way to shop for clothes.",5
9666,"Found the cutest jacket here on ThredUP, and with the 50 percent off code, it was well worth it. Just like new too! Pay attention to the actual measurements, because the site doesn't distinguish between womens and juniors, you may think you are buying a womens medium until you check the measurements. While I can fit into both womens and juniors, I'm a medium in womens and an extra large in juniors, so just be aware of the difference.",5
9667,"Easy as pie, love Thredup!",5
9668,"Easy to use, good deals",5
9669,It's cool,4
9670,I have bought shoes. Vera Wang and I was not let down. Sad that the big girl collection is lacking but hey I get it.,5
9671,Exciting,5
9672,Is this supposed to be a thrift store app? Because it sure gives off that vibe. The clothes look rather ugly and worn out. I can get those in my neighborhood grocery store. The clothes do not look good so I will not buy it. I don't know if the company creators have anything to do with it but try to improve.,2
9673,Nothing up dated,2
9674,"This is the worst online experience, I am trying to find something and when I sea it doesn't have any of the options. And the models they have do not make it any better.",1
9675,Love getting new clothes at a discount and no problem sending them back.,5
9676,TOO MANY NOTIFICARIONS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY! VERY IRRITATING!,1
9677,I like this app for my shopping needs,5
9678,"The app is really good. It works very well for me, and I love this type of shopping. I just ordered my first order of clothes, so here's hoping they all fit well. My one minor complaint is that it would be nice if it were easier to find certain types of shoes. I feel I should be able to segregate ballet flats from other no heeled shoes.",5
9679,For a used cloths app store your stuff is steel priceie. Id ratger keep ording from Wish and its all new. It really disapoints me cause i was looking forward in ordering for me and my family.,2
9680,"The app is much easier to navigate than the website. Its very clean and organized, and makes it so easy to find the modest dresses and other garments of your dreams. One thing I think they should update is just with the blouses, allow a option to choose the sleeve cut on dresses as well. Other than that, its a wonderful experience through and through.",5
9681,"Horrible! Worst customer service that I have experienced. I sold an item for well over $250 , waited for the return period to end to collect my money. Emailed the following day and waited the recommended 10 days for a return email. I recieved nothing. So I emailed again and a week passed and still nothing. I finally found a chat link. Not easy. I presented my case along with screenshots. I was told to basically f- off. My item was returned and put on massive discount. Do not recommend at all.",1
9682,Why do you want me to rate you and I've never purchased anything from you,5
9683,"Great experience so far. The clothes are what they look like in the pictures, and ypu can find really special items for low price. I only wish all of the items came with measurements, because sizes vary so much and sometimes its impossible to find the brand's info online. Edit 10/2020: the new version of the app doesn't work well on my android. Never loads. It doesn't work at all if I'm on wifi!",3
9684,staff is wonderful thank you,4
9685,Nice stuff,5
9686,It's not a bad app just not my style,2
9687,I love buying used and this app makes it easy. Returns are also very simple if you get something that doesn't fit right or that you don't end up liking.,5
9688,I really love the quality of the clothes,5
9689,"**Edit: I get you want to push out old, frumpy, out of season inventory, but why not discount everything when you have a sale? I'd be more interested in purchasing something if it had the added sweetness of a flash sale.** An easy, fast, and streamlined consignment shop. I love the ""favorite"" feature, especially, for comparison and finding liked clothes. Features are being added all the time, which is nifty. I just hope it doesn't become a corporate conglomerate and start up charging everything.",5
9690,Good. Improvements needed. Trouble accessing app thru notifications - app opens but not the actual notification. Saved searches won't all load of re-entering app; must close and reopen app to get to work.,4
9691,The app is fine. Thredup is a rip off!,2
9692,Great app.,5
9693,"I have throughly enjoyed my items. The filtering is great and pricing is nice. I wish I could filter bust size though, it is time consuming looking at every dress and shirt to see if it'll fit my chest. Also I would like to pick a bigger waist size, it doesn't go up to my size. Additionally, it would be nice to filter out fabrics. I make the material cotton, then click on an item and it's 20% cotton 80% polyester. Stacking coupons would be nice. Overall nice way to shop ethically and affordably.",3
9694,I've bought so many nice things here. They come as advertised. Great sales and deals all the time.,5
9695,Good app. Bad because it can be addictive when you start saving items. It's almost like a game when one item is in someone's cart and you are waiting for the time to be up so you can add it to your cart.,4
9696,Great place for clothing that is good quality on a budget!,5
9697,The thredUP app is easy and fun to use!,5
9698,I don't see anything for men. Uninstall.,1
9699,"Dont use it. Their customer service is AWFUL. Do they even understand what customer service is? Its not worth it to sell through this unless you really dont care if or when you get paid or have a reply from customer service. It takes over 10 days to get customer service to reply, if youre lucky. I dont understand how companies this size have customer service departments that are so small or inefficient that you cannot recieve support in an effective manner and method. Use poshmark instead.",1
9700,"I love this app. The clothes are affordable, the packages always come quickly, and the items always look new or close to it. It's my favorite shopping app",5
9701,"Shipping takes way, WAY too long. 20 days for the last 3 items I ordered. If your shipping is that slow,, it should be free and have an option to pay for faster options. If items are wrong, damaged, etc you still pay restock fees, they don't credit it back anymore. Carts need to last longer especially during sales. When you're shopping the app during sales items will disappear before you're done shopping. Prices are not deals anymore. This app used to be good. Poshmark is now the better app.",2
9702,"Sizing is false, brands are sketchy. I looked at multiple pairs of jeans that were marked size 28, but upon reading the description they were in fact sizes 30 or 31. This occurred on at least 5 of the items. I cannot spend time selecting each/every item to verify its size. Also, many of the jeans (90%) were from Joe's Jeans. My search for 'flare jeans' didn't give me anything from gap, express, lucky, etc. And ALL of the jeans were dark wash when the blue color filter was selected.",1
9703,No men's clothing.,1
9704,I like it.,5
9705,It's too easy to shop online,5
9706,My favorite app to shop on!!,5
9707,"I have had the best experience so far personally. I appreciate them reducing the time to 1h for holding items in your cart instead of 24h as sometimes someone else might have kept it and forgot about it. The delivery time is normal and I don't make a fuss about getting it soon. It's also a nice option to bundle up several orders into 1 shipment to reduce carbon emissions. However, recently since newest update, the Facebook login doesn't work anymore so I can't log back in to browse.",3
9708,Cheap,5
9709,Very user friendly and nice things,5
9710,Ordered and all items came before the estimated ship date. Very satisfied with the fast delivery and i love the shoes and clothes i recieved. I will be shopping thred up again. Thanks,5
9711,"App is great, easy to shop, unfortunately I order the goodie box for comfy and ended up with casual work. Not even close. I sent back a clean out bag, have been waiting for it to ""process"" for over 4 months now with no updates. I have tried emailing asking about it was told would receive a response within 10 days, 3 weeks later still nothing.",2
9712,"It is hard to know exactly what you are getting, but I love that you can pick the condition and that they do have a return policy. There is also a huge selection, its always easy to find things I love!",4
9713,Doesn't have a men's section??,2
9714,I was able to find plenty of great deals in my size and style.,5
9715,This app is very easy to use.,5
9716,Love the selection and the prices are great,5
9717,Love it. Easy to use great concept!!,5
9718,"So many choices and opportunity to buy designer names I personally could never afford plus the descriptions are true to their word of the conditions of the item. Key reason I gave a 4 and I kind of wish that some of the people selling would make their items look a little better, maybe is the people that deal with this site could make that suggestion? It would be better for both are all people concerned. There are items I passed on because they just looked horrible. Just a suggestion",4
9719,Great!,5
9720,Got this app a while ago when app scrolling not impressed,3
9721,"Love shopping this way! So many great deals, and more environmentally friendly!",5
9722,everything ive bought is wonderfuj,5
9723,"I LOVE the company! They offer great deals and good products and I LOVE how they measure the garments to help you know if it will fit! The app could use a little work. You can't zoom in well to see details. If you hit back, you close the app. If you go to a different app or come back after downsizing, it freezes. And the available choices for bust/waist/hips measurements are SUPER NOT inclusive. They stock sizes beyond a 10, so how come you can't choose waist sizes above 34 inches?",3
9724,I love everything about this App!!!😁,5
9725,"So wonderful great deals and shopping from home , what more could a girl want",5
9726,"I really like this app. Great deals if you look for them. I wish the ""rewards"" you earned could be used with the current sales that are going on, but you can't. Also, users should take their idea of ""excellent condition"" with a grain of salt. That is rarely an accurate description. Measurements/sizes are usually waaaay off too.",4
9727,Simple and easy to use. Love it,5
9728,Love the selection and the prices. The rewards are an added extra.,5
9729,"I used to get really good deals using ThredUp, but now prices are almost full price what I would pay in stores. Disappointing.",3
9730,"Love, love, love it. The whole idea, the service and delivery and the great items.",5
9731,"Just stops working periodically. Have to uninstall, reinstall.",2
9732,"I adore thredup. Easy to use app with a nice selection. It'd be nice to 1) filter out what you don't want to see. My skin is sensitive, I don't mind mixed fiber clothing just not mixed with certain fibers 2) more details regarding the fiber content. I purchased a vest that was supposed to be 100% cotton, the lining was polyester 3) more sizing details: hip size for pants, jacket/coat length, dress waist 4) sort or filter saved items 5) not significant but fabric close up. Hard to see sometimes",4
9733,This app is so much fun! Great filters to search for clothes and shoes!,5
9734,"There is no men's category. I'm a woman who enjoys adding menswear into her wardrobe. It's what I wear most of the time, in fact. Pretty disappointed that the men's section in non existent. I unfortunately will not be using the app. At least until a menswear category is added.",2
9735,Very easy to use! Items are accurately described. Love this app!,5
9736,5☆☆☆☆☆ for shopping 🛍 ❗🐾🐾,5
9737,"Thred Up is the place to go for those items you just can't find in stores. If you don't see it today, keep looking. They also offer some worthwhile shopping incentives, discounts, free shipping, etc.",5
9738,I use to work for ThredUP but moved on to other things. But I've always been obsessed with shopping on here. I would love to be a reviewer for them to show everyone how amazing ThredUP is.,5
9739,Best shopping experience ever! Love this app.,5
9740,"Got the app, got the bag, not sure WHAT prices my items will be listed to sell for, or WHO will determine this, and if they don't sell I have to PAY to get them back?? Hmm, then they KEEP them if I don't? Hmm, sounds fishy, but thanks for the bag.",1
9741,All my items have been amazing,5
9742,"I love the app! I like how it is easy to search, save my searches, view my favorites and my cart. The only thing is that could be improved is that sometimes when I'm searching it doesn't refresh with the saved filters I just set. Then I'll have to exit to the home screen to do a new search.",4
9743,"I love this app! I like your company a lot! It is everything I wanted and more! You need to update your advertising, you're still showing things I purchased!!! I never received my refund, or a credit, for the shoes I returned!!!",3
9744,"Sometimes the search options aren't perfect and navigating can accidentally kick you out of the app but I have replaced my entire wardrobe across all seasons with cute, new or like new clothes for less money than I pay in rent for a month :)",5
9745,Love it. No bugs so far.,5
9746,Amazing,5
9747,I love shopping on thredUP,5
9748,Great way to recycle! I always find something I like.,5
9749,"Hi, wondering if you are aware that the pop-up notifications about a favorite's price reduction just goes to the app front page rather than the actual item.",2
9750,"This is a great app, it works perfectly well on my android phone. I still prefer thrift shopping in-person as prices are cheaper. This app will have high priced retail clothing still priced over $100. I enjoy the convenience of online shopping and delivery, but think some prices could be lowered. The selection is nice and varied, the photos clear, measurements and additional details are great!",5
9751,"So-so. The filtering needs to expand a bit, but the app isn't my biggest issue. It is the lazy, half-assed way they display the clothing. It is all wrinkled, which tells me it hasn't been laundered and probably has an odor, not displayed on the mannequin properly. Very off-putting. Not to mention, pricing used clothing based on brand new retail is bogus.",3
9752,I've found so many deals and steals on here! I love buying stuff for less money!,5
9753,"I love shopping here. Great way to recycle. Shop sale items, get even better deals! My closet has a variety of clothes that are different from those in my small town. All seasons are covered! Love the way they are delivered inside the box. Clothes are presented like they came from a boutique! Complaints: too much to look at, only an hour long cart. Filters should allow multiple checked items at a time for better shopping. Too many unwanted things to look through in a ""rushed"" environment.",5
9754,Everything on the site is user friendly. Returns are a snap. Clothing quality is great.,5
9755,Excellent experience and good sales promos,5
9756,Fine alot of things I like,5
9757,"Love the prices, promotions, convenience, and selection of clothing! The customer service is great, as well!",5
9758,Love having so many affordable styles available. The app is easy to navigate. Sometimes a page won't refresh after adding a filter and I have to begin again and I find it a little annoying just how exact the search is when you type in a word and get a wholly unexpected result. Other than those two things I enjoy shopping with ThredUp and have had very good experiences both with my orders and with the Clean Out Kit!,4
9759,Kind of addictive to browse and filter. I enjoy shopping this way because I don't spend too much and can sort by brands and sizes. Fun store and easy app!,5
9760,Awesome,5
9761,"Thredup is an excellent concept, and the app works well.",5
9762,"I used to love it. Then today I received someone elses box instead of my own, plus a second order also showed delivered and it wasn't. Customer service wasn't much help, either. Not pleased after singing their praises for years. UPDATE: I went through customer service for the third time and got an agent that corrected the problem in less than five minutes! I have also since ordered several times with perfect results.",1
9763,My first rating was harsh and after help from thredup techs...I LOVE THIS APP! I shop for myself and my granddaughters and have told and shown others my experience.,5
9764,"For this being a thrift store app it's pretty expensive.42.99 for unbranded shoes is a bit much if u ask me. I shop on a thrift store app to get deals but it's definitely not cheaper ALOT of clothes they have at Walmart cost less for the same thing they sell for more, so be very careful and price check. They also take their sweet time to send you your thredup sell bag but not the items you ordered instead of sending them together. Shipping should be free especially for a thrift store app.",2
9765,This app is easy to navigate and has a lot of great content that is constantly changing! This is one of my favorite app's right now.,5
9766,💜,5
9767,Love this app. I can search for any style and no issues,5
9768,I going to go through out all the saleswomen clothes jackets hopefully I get first North face or Nike one for winter to keep myself warm and a. hat as well,5
9769,The app is fine. I wish there were more filters,4
9770,I love all of the variety of quality name brand items.,5
9771,Great stuff at low prices!,5
9772,One of the best apps ever,5
9773,I Love Thred up! The shopping experience could be addicting.,5
9774,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I returned 2 pairs of jeans in September because they did not fit. I STILL have not received a refund or a response to my emails butasking why I have not received my credit. I am not even looking for a cash refund! Just a credit! Or a reply! But nothing has been answered, no funds have been returned to my account. The items were returned on 9-25-2020. It is now 10-16-2020. This is terrible service. DO NOT RECOMMEND! Update 10-23-2020 STILL NO ANSWER OR REFUND",1
9775,It's a trap! I keep buying things!,5
9776,Junk,1
9777,Best ever! Blown away with this apps detailed searching capabilities and all the filters available. I Love this company,5
9778,I have been very happy with what prices are and the quality of the clothes sold on this app.,5
9779,"I have had nothing but great experiences everytime I have ordered from thredUP. The descriptions of each product are accurate, the delivery times are accurate and the return polices are more than fair. Thank you for making ""boutique like* shopping easy!",5
9780,"Not a perfect app, but I have never had a bad experience buying, selling, returning, etc with ThredUp. Overall a great concept and a great service. Good rewards system, good selection, and so on. I'm a loyal ThredUpper.",4
9781,"I LOVE THREDUP! I have never had a bad experience buying or selling stuff. My favorite to shop is sale stuff, and I love the rewards points too! I highly recommend thredUP!",5
9782,"Thredup is a very well structured, detailed, and organized site that lets you browse exactly what you're looking for. They ship items in great condition and in a clean, presentable manner despite that they are second-hand. My only wish for Thredup is that they would allow at least some coupon stacking, which they do not. Only one coupon code is allowed per order. Overall, I definitely recommend Thredup!",5
9783,"Fun, easy website, love that they have a lot of unique clothing. I could spend hours going through the different categories. I like that they offer percent off and free shipping codes.",5
9784,Always a pleasure! Never a problem!×,5
9785,My packages were being shipped to the wrong address and the company refused to help me. I was able to get two of the four packages but 3/4th of my order is missing and i have yet to hear back about a refund or any sort of substitute. The clothing however was all great quality and good brands. Due to this incident i would still not reccomend them.,2
9786,Prices seem to be increasing every time I shop,3
9787,I love the assortment of name brands. The products are great. Love everything I've gotten. Thank you ThredUp!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
9788,"Easy to use, search, and filter. Great secondhand clothes!",5
9789,Love this game!,5
9790,These boots are like brand new and the nicest I've ever owned and I'm in utah and 45 so I've had alot of boots.,5
9791,"Love second hand clothes. I have only bought second hand the past ten years. Everything is always clean, great quality, and saving things from the garbage makes me happy. I just wish the app had an easier way to input gift cards. Can't figure it out.",5
9792,Awesome,5
9793,I just got on today and I couldn't believe the prices am here to stay this is my shopping place thank you keep up.the good work LM I rate a 8,5
9794,Poor....no response to my not getting my packages yet everything states they delivered it. From the purchase on I've had nothing but problems. They have my money and I don't have my items. They haven't responded to my questions or concerns at all. This was my first and last order.... I want my money back since I haven't received my order nor have they assisted me to find it. Disappointing experience since it was my first order....,1
9795,"Amazing! High quality, cute clothes for great prices. Love it.",5
9796,"Love thredUP! Great place to find used clothes that are in almost perfect or new condition. I've bought so much through them over the past few months; I finally just got my first item that wasn't perfect. A tiny hole in the back, naturally not eligible to return. Thankfully I got it cheap with a sale code. Up until now, everything has been perfect. I guess the only real complaint I have is the app tends to be really glitchy when it comes to the search feature. Overall love and recommend!",4
9797,"The search function isn't very useful. I want a long sleeve shirt and somehow end up wading through hundreds of things, only about half of which are long-sleeved. I tried searching for flannel and got nothing. Otherwise the premise is good and I have received many good things. Don't send your clothes here though - it's more than likely that you won't get anything for them. I sent a beautiful pair of barely used Sorrel snow boots and they weren't accepted or sent back.",5
9798,Love this app There's always something new everyday.,5
9799,Awesome deals!! And offen have great sales too!!!,5
9800,I can shop for hours and save so much with thredUP Love It,5
9801,I love this app. I did all my 4 year olds school clothes shopping on here! I find great stuff for myself all the time too!,5
9802,I love ThredUP! And the app is very user friendly. I have an Android and am technology challenged. But this app is so easy to use.,5
9803,"Great clothing, but as the company has grown, so have their prices!! ThreadUp used to be the perfect online thrift store with great clothes and really fast shipping! Now, it's just another store that's over-priced with slow shipping. Sad to say that there's not much ""Thrift"" left with ThredUp.",3
9804,Love this site I was going through resale withdrawal now I'm soo 😊,5
9805,I love having an endless clothing store at my fingertips. I'm liking the branch out to kids clothes too! I'm always accumulating points for discounts. 😊 Only negative is that my clothes I send in to sell are never usually sold.,5
9806,Im a fan!,5
9807,I love thread up. There clothes are so njce and clean and instead of going to the salvation army or a yard sale you can get so many clothes for a low price and in good shape just as easy. I personaly love thread up and I will never stop shopping at or on the site thread up.,5
9808,I actually love this app but need someone to return my emails...I can't get my cash balance to transfer to my bank account... I've emailed a handful of times without response... Will change to 5 stars once I get a response ....Thank You Dana,3
9809,Excellent,5
9810,Really fun to use and track my items.,5
9811,Always something to find. Great prices. Packages always come in the perfect box folded nicely. I would have given 5 stars if the return window was a bit longer.,4
9812,Love Thred Up and the app!,5
9813,"I ordered a shirt 10/8/20. As of 10/19/20 haven't received the shirt, AND they somehow have charged me for the shirt and a dress I didn't even order",3
9814,"I really enjoy this app, but only gave it 4 stars because most of the time I go to view an item it exits out of the app. Otherwise it works extremely well.",4
9815,Not GOOD-TIME EXPENSIVE AND THE CLOTHING IS POOR QUALITY!,1
9816,"This is absolutely disgusting...the prices are more than getting the same item brand new in the store with a good sale...way way way too expensive....LOL FOR USED CLOTHES I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE LIKE $5 DOLLARS MAYBE $10.. Well my opinion was from looking at the pictures of the clothing..Everyone has their own option and mine is the pictures I seen on this site and I looked for quit a while , I mean most looked ragged..shirts all wrinkled and worn looking was 25 bucks..I mean helllooo..sorry NFM",1
9817,The products are as described & tracking your shipment is great but customer service is practically unreachable.,3
9818,😊😃,5
9819,Love this app.. so much variety and amazing prices.. if you don't mind buying second hand or if your a thrifter u would absolutely recommend it to you. My only critique is that it's only woman and kids.. gotta open it up to the men!! I would have spent 2x as much if I was able to shop for my husband as well.,5
9820,Have enjoyed getting good clothes for less than retail. Also enjoy that it is helping recycle perfectly good clothes to a new home.,5
9821,Loving cleaning out my closet!!!,5
9822,I have not received anh of my money.,1
9823,Great clothes. Great prices. Wide selection of plus sizes too.,5
9824,Just started. No opinion yet.,3
9825,Love it. I have found some of my favorite clothes for cheap.,5
9826,Can't even open the site,1
9827,Threadup is easy to navigate and offers great prices. I appreciate the care of packaging and shipping items.,5
9828,"After the upgrade, this APP is still very user friendly and the photos of clothing look sharper to me.",5
9829,Love💜💜💜,5
9830,"I love looking at all the great products they have. It's from very reasonable to very expensive. If you see something you like buy it, it won't be there for long. They have a very big selection of clothing, shoes, handbags etc. I love looking at the handbags my obsession. You have to look everyday because of new product in web site.",5
9831,"Not worth it. Prices went SO HIGH for Used clothing and sellers still get paid in pennies for shoes or a top apparently qorth up to 100s to thred up... you can get used clthing prices off ebay and poshmark but not here. The sight is just as bad at the app, its actually gone downhill. Photos qnd descriptions are still often not accurate.",1
9832,I Love This App,5
9833,U dont make much with them,3
9834,"App simple to use , excellent",5
9835,Havent seen much,2
9836,"Fun to browse but most of the sizes and descriptions are not accurate and articles of clothing are listed as the same price in store, so may as well just shop directly from the stores?",2
9837,"I have really enjoyed using thredUp. It's pretty easy to use. Hardest part is all different sizes depending on brands fit differently. But that is a risk from buying secondhand online. I can find some really good deals and some also really good stuff. You can track packages, although it would be nice to know what was in each package without having to do detective work. There are kids clothes. I just ordered a couple things for my son and daughter. I have ordered a few times for womanly self.",5
9838,their processing time for the kits is absolutely ridiculous!!!!!,1
9839,I love the shopping experience. The clothing choices are unlimited!,5
9840,"I LOVE GOING TO THRIFT STORES LOOKING FOR CHEAP NICE CLOTHES, THIS APP HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT WOMEN CLOTHING STYLES AND VERY GOOD PRICES AND FOR GREAT QUALITY CLOTHES. I GIVE IT 5 STARS. PLUS THEY HAVE PLUS SIZE CUTE CLOTHES AND CLOTHES, SHOES AND PURSES WITH BRAND NEW TAGS STILL ON. I BUY BRAND NEW CLOTHING NEVER WORN WITH TAGS FOR 60% TO 90% OFF. I LOVE THIS APP FOR SHOPPING ❣️👍🏼✌🏼",5
9841,The app is easy to use and I have found some good items. Returns are easy so that is great. Don't bother trying to sell anything through them though or doing the closet clean out. You are lucky to get a few dollars at most. That was disappointing but otherwise the app and service in general are good for buying.,4
9842,Excellent,5
9843,So far pretty good excited about my bag,4
9844,"Great app. Descriptions are accurate, pictures are good. Check sizing and you'll get what you expect.",5
9845,Love the ability to filter searches for specifics! ❤️,5
9846,Great so far!,5
9847,Good,5
9848,"Very easy to buy and sell on this site. Items are as described, and arrive on time.",5
9849,"I enjoy shopping @ ""thredup"" Very detail about their items & lots of options 2. 😉 ""Pls. Take Real Good Care of Yourself...Stay Safe & Keep Healthy 😷""",5
9850,"Great way to shop second-hand. I do wish the search options and filters were better though. A lot of items don't show, and it's hard to find things.",4
9851,The best place to find resale clothing that is upfront and decently priced!,5
9852,"To many ""hidden subject to c hange""",1
9853,"Love browsing items on my own, easy to use. Wish search app was slighlty easier to use, also that you could see pics from more angles, bottom of shoes, top of shoes etc.",4
9854,THE POP-UPS HAVE TO STOP I love shopping here but the pop ups for saved searches is so so so annoying,2
9855,Always enjoyed shopping at ThreadUp. The clothing here are pretty awesome and so affordable. Even kids clothing. They don't have men's clothing though. It would be really nice if they starts having men's clothes. Thank you ThreadUp. You guys are so AWESOME. By the way what i like the most is how the clothes are packed nice & neat wrapped upbin tissue paper and all. So fancy . Thanks again to all employees at ThreadUp for all the nice & hard work and to make it possible. ;) ;) ;),5
9856,Love it!,5
9857,Sent me the wrong item. Not even the right size!,1
9858,Can't get help. Jeans I receive is child not women's plus size. The tag says w26 but I can't even get my arm in it. It is for tiny child. I want refund . I be telling all my friends not shop here.,1
9859,Old lady items,1
9860,I have successfully sold multiple items on the app. However thredup makes it nearly impossible for sellers to cash out. I am not able to log into the app. I tried multiple times to reset password and I never received a email. I tried cashing out and I never received a verification code via email. It has been a horrible experience. I am still unable to cash out my earnings. Sellers beware of this app as it has been a struggle to obtain your earnings. I don't recommend this app.,1
9861,Fun,5
9862,This company is here to help all working women that want to dress to impress i have had so many compliments on my new outfits people r asking where did u get that outfit well heres a great big thank to all u hard workers at thredup yall rock!!!@#!!👚💓💋💗,5
9863,"This app is the BEST. Super adorable clothes, a wide variety that updates every day, and speedy shipping as well! 99% of my wardrobe is now thredup treasure 😁",5
9864,Love it,5
9865,"The app is so addicting! It is easy to use, and there are always great deals! So fun!",5
9866,It's not an awesome selling app as mentioned. You have to send clothes & blah blah blah. I want to sell my clothes 1 by 1 & make money not waste it on others items.,1
9867,"I like how you can edited what you're looking for. And how they have discounts every now and then and secret sales, I also like how you can build up your points. It's nice having every brand name in one spot. And it has pretty fast delivery I like being able to track my shipment as well.",5
9868,Extraordinary,4
9869,Consistently improving!,5
9870,I cant join and it keeps saying my wifi is down but my wifi is fine i would like to have it fixed please if u can and thank u!,1
9871,I love it,5
9872,"I used to love shopping on this site, but with the new update, its super glitchy, I used to be able to click on the clothing that I liked through the emails but now it only takes me to the homepage! Its hard to shop on here now 😫",2
9873,"Easy to navigate, straight forward.",5
9874,Quick delivery and items look great and the prices are even better. Love their no hassle return policy.,5
9875,I really like this website it's easy and the clothes are nice. Overall love it,5
9876,Excellent and very easy to use. Thank you!,5
9877,Phenomenal,5
9878,"I have bought several Coldwater Creek and Chicos clothing from tredUP in the past and I have been happy with my purchases. I have noticed recently that your prices have increased greatly on your clothing for new or like new conditions. You have overpriced your clothing. Even though clothing might still have the original tag, or you state like new...most of the clothing is still 5yrs or older and your prices used to reflect that. I'm very disappointed.",2
9879,Wonderful!,5
9880,Love the app and ordering experience. Love goodie boxes. Always a sale.,5
9881,Love shopping when I use the thredUp App. Great filter features! Make shopping fun and easy! Keep up the good work!,5
9882,Good,5
9883,"I like the clothing options but I don't think the conditions always match the descriptions. Also, feel the sales are not really sales anymore. The prices have gotten expensive for used clothing. And shipping takes soooo long...",3
9884,Too expensive on everything,1
9885,Love it!,5
9886,Still alot $$$$,3
9887,I have enjoyed shopping @ thredUP. It's hard for me to go shopping for clothes because of my wheelchair.Clothes shopping in some stores with tight places are very hard or in possible for me.,5
9888,Would be better if you could search items by subcategories like cardigans as subcategory of sweaters,4
9889,The app is super user friendly and easy to navigate. Also love all the deals and points thredup provides.,5
9890,I have gotten some of my favorite items from this site,5
9891,Bad prices and poor customer service. The prices are too high for being second hand and its almost impossible to get a hold of customer service.,1
9892,Really good,5
9893,I love thred up,5
9894,It sucks!!! Only for women and children. Nothing for men.,1
9895,Love this app but could we get pictures INSIDE the purses? That is a major point for me buying one online.,4
9896,Extremely user friendly. Great shopping experience.,5
9897,When I went to go return items that I got they werenr on my returnable list so I had to keep them regardless that they didn't fit me. They don't give you enough time to ship things back because it takes forever to receive them. No way to really contact companies for question or errors with shipping.,2
9898,"Wont use again. I ordered a jacket I thought was adults size since that is where I was supposedly looking in acording to their website. When I received it it was a childs size! Also there is not enough photos or information to know what it is you're actually receiving. That ""jacket"" was so thin it was barely passable as a shirt. No thanks, I'd rather go buy new at stores like Ross for potentially better quality, same price or less, and best of all, less hassle.",1
9899,Using Pre owned clothes is one of the best things you can do for the environment. This app is nice to use and with great offers.,5
9900,Lots of great name brand clothes,5
9901,"The app itself is fine. I've bought several things and I've been happy with the items. However, it is so difficult to find clothes that fit. Size numbers vary WIDELY between brands, and even within the brand depending on the style of the clothing. While you can see the bust and hip size in inches upon closer inspection, I would rather be able to filter by my bust size in inches than select five or six different ""dress sizes"" only to find like one that fits. Im often dissuaded from even looking.",3
9902,"I don't ever have problems with my items. Returns are easy & what you get are nice, no complaints here.",5
9903,"I enjoy taking a moment to find unique pieces at affordable prices. Because its on my phone, its super convenient!",5
9904,Great app but I don't like the prices I go thrift store shopping all the time and I can buy like a dozen items or more for like $30 so definitely don't think this app is anything like a thrift store also don't care about name brand clothing so not for me but ladies who love shopping and spending a lot on clothing this is for you,3
9905,"Love the app, use it daily. I would really like to be able to filter my favorites by price or categorize.",4
9906,I sent my bag for clean out over four months ago. I have not received an update on what's going on with my clothing.,3
9907,"I've really liked ThredUP and have gotten some great items on here, as well as successfully selling some items as well. Here's the thing: It doesn't matter which side of the fence you're on, anyone who makes disparaging, disgraceful, and defaming public comments - especially if this atrocious behavior is exhibited by a celebrity representing a company like ThredUP - against the President of our country, like ThredUP's golden girl, Olivia Wilde, then I want nothing to do with that company.",1
9908,Exceptional,5
9909,"Fun, thrifty and new items with tags. I was able to find brand name items with tags, new and lightly used. Excellent prices and discounts offered frequently",5
9910,The update is great. Love shopping in a way that leaves less of a carbon footprint,5
9911,Amazing App and user friendly,5
9912,I've sent multiple bags and for 4 months now its saying my items were recieved and processing.how long does it take to process?starting to think i was ripped.just took my clothes and notgiven no credit .no notice saying they didn't want then just processing?,1
9913,I have been able to find several items for my wardrobe. Most recently a dress and handbag for my niece's wedding.,5
9914,love it,4
9915,thredUP is a pleasure!,5
9916,Shipping is crazy I have a credit and by time i use it plus the shipping i owe more..Got my bag in june this is Oct still have not processed.,3
9917,Not interested,1
9918,"Not enough varieties, your clothes are wrinkled, hard to see style.",1
9919,"Fun site, love the promos and prices",5
9920,Really dislike the constant updating..,2
9921,"I tried for a couple weeks to shop around but there really wasn't anything interesting. It's all very niche, boho style clothes. At least it's well made and easy to navigate, so 2 stars instead of 1",2
9922,😍,5
9923,Love this,5
9924,Totally satisfied! Amazing app,5
9925,Easy to navigate and filter. Enjoying thrifty retail therapy. Bought some beautiful pieces without breaking the bank. Up-styling while up-cycling.,5
9926,Love this sight! Great clothes cheap prices!,5
9927,I like to check them out.,3
9928,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP! I HAVE BOUGHT SO MUCH & IT'S SO NOT A GUILTY FEELING LOL. I HAVE SAVED SO MUCH USING THIS APP! THANK YOU SO MUCH! VERY MUCH APPRECIATED FOR SUCH A FANTASTIC APP!!,5
9929,"I just love it. It's easy to use, eco-friendly. Now if they could add a men's section.",5
9930,Good,5
9931,The items I ordered have been perfect,5
9932,I got a ton of things for so cheap love it thank you!!,5
9933,Simple n fast,5
9934,Wonderful clothes!,5
9935,Lovedthecost,3
9936,ThredUp is AWESOME!,5
9937,Lovely the store!!!,5
9938,Everything I've purchased so far has been brand new or almost brand new looking. Very pleased with this app so far.,5
9939,"Love this. Only two things, i wish you could share your favorites items and I wish there were men's clothes.",5
9940,I love the clothes I get from this app,5
9941,Wonderful site to save money. It is amazing.,5
9942,Ive always found awesome deals,5
9943,Love it!,5
9944,I love shopping thred up!,5
9945,Love it so far!,5
9946,I have tried to use this app for a month. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled about 15 times. No items show up when I go to home. I tried to select womens clothing with Zero results found. I haven't been able to see the first item for sale.,1
9947,Amazing outfits at a reasonable price,5
9948,Love the clothes I've gotten. Ordering is a breeze. And the selection is wonderful!!!! I've never been disappointed.,5
9949,I gave 5 stars because I support your business and love what I have read about this app so far.,5
9950,It's easy to find the type of clothes or accessories you are looking for at fantastic prices. I have ordered several items and they are always in good condition and arrive in a reasonable amount of time. So easy. This is my new favorite way to shop.,5
9951,My first goody box was great. I sent back what I didnt want. Now the second box I sent back most of it. And they are trying to charge me for the whole box.,2
9952,"It was fast and exactly what ""i"" ordered. Aa",3
9953,"Great app, with large selection and it has new arrivals every time I refresh the page. The only thing I would improve on would be that I wish it had more jewelery and accessories, and I don't understand why there is not a men's section included. Most the time i can't use the promo code that I'm given. But overall the clothing is good quality and I see myself buying from here often.",5
9954,"Good, but watch your push notifications. I have bought from them and have sent clothes into them, it is a Gamble on how much money you will get I would have gotten more money if I would have taking some of the clothes to local consignment stores, which after taking nearly four months to process my shipment was disappointing. I probably won't sell on this app again but I will buy from it.",4
9955,Easy returns.,4
9956,Really like options for filters...and favorites .,5
9957,"Love thredUp! I get name brand clothing for cheap cheap prices. The clothes are pretty much brand new! And I haven't had to wait longer than a week to get my items! U can even get paid sending in clothes you no longer want. I will most likely never buy clothes, heels and purses from anywhere but thredUp! Trust me and order some stuff.. you won't be disappointed!",5
9958,Excellent clothes for exceptional prices,5
9959,This app is a lot of fun if you like to shop. There are some fantastic buys but be alert because there are some deals that are ridiculous,4
9960,Fast service,4
9961,"I HAVE NEVER ENJOYED SHOPPING SO MUCH! THEIR CLOTHES SMELL SO CLEAN AND IN SUCH PERFECT CONDITION. Recycle for the planet and get excited about new, cute, fun pieces to add to your wardrobe at about HALF the price of stores and magazines! Love it!",5
9962,A lot of fun,4
9963,Love thredUp more than most things! I find what I need and Love..everytime I visit!,5
9964,Excellent,5
9965,Love it ALWAYS on time for selling and right on with payment,5
9966,Best place to shop hands down!!,5
9967,Love it. I've ordered through thread up and from thread up on walmarts app. Always a good experience. Never been disappointed so far 😊,5
9968,Ok,1
9969,"Eww what's with the new gray and black color scheme. Measurements are unreliable, and it's hard to get a good view of the item's flaws with just 2 pictures. Return policy is bad, and prices are too expensive for used clothing. Wish you could stack ""coupons""; I have rewards for free shipping and $10 off, but i cant use both on the same order. So essentially the $10 off is just another free shipping plus a little extra once u cover the shipping costs, and that is incredibly frustrating.",2
9970,Very good app! Great products and prices!,5
9971,Great app!,5
9972,There's a whole NEW way to Shop!! TreadUP has been UPdated!! New offers and fun games to enjoy!,5
9973,Great deals and good finds,5
9974,Love it!,5
9975,Very fun a guilt free,5

9984,I loved everything I recieved. Quality a d sizing were perfect.,5
9985,"I love Thred Up! I am petite, so it's hard to find clothes that fit just right and at reasonable prices at other stores. Thred Up has everything. When I'm unsure if my favorite items fit or suit me, I order Goody Boxes to try before I buy. The app is fun to use and it seems to keep improving.",5
9986,Best online thrift store ever!,5
9987,Excellent selling experience!,5
9988,Wonderful.,5
9989,I love thredUP. I've so much stuff from the store and really nice things. I have recommended the app to some of my friends.,5

9999,Addicted!!!,5
10000,"I had gotten a shirt that had four buttons missing in off spots. Wish they would disclose such Information. Other than, that's the only issue I've had",3
10001,It's awesome. I absolutely love this app.. once I got used to it and understood how it all worked everything went much smoother.. I think this store has THE BEST deals when it comes to pricing.. hopefully they dont change how most places do when they become more popular. I am very happy with thredup --macy rydez,5
10002,"It is a scam, I sent many cloth and no money",1
10003,Love!!,5
10004,"Fun to look through, love the bingo and update",5
10005,Not as good as I thought id be. N deff not as cheaom,3
10006,❤💓💕❤,5
10007,Haven't seen this yet.,5
10008,"No driving to store, looking for hours & finding nothing. Variety every hour is great. Narrowed down searches are quick & easy.",5
10009,"app is great! Good prices. Have not been disappointed in quality of clothing I have recieved. Returned some items, just werent me once tried on. Process went well used my points to waive restocking fees. Only complaint- when an item is sold or in someone's cart and it says ""shop similiar"" it shows you similar clothes- yes -but in all different sizes, not helpful. And you should be able to use your points along with other promotions, to get free shipping when your only buying 1 or 2 items.",4
10010,"Love, love ,love this app. I spend all my free time browsing their selection.",5
10011,"I love it:) voting is starting to get a little pricey here and there though. My first order with them was horrible. The clothing condition was awful, but I tried it again and it was great. 2 more Orders on there way so we shall see...",5
10012,"Really my only complaint here is that they don't offer waist measurements on skirts, only length. I've gotten medium skirts that are too big and medium skirts that are too small.",4
10013,"I have found a lot of amazing steals, but descriptions are horrible. Wrong sizes, incorrect fabrics, stains, holes on ""like new"" items, and most recently I was sent two shoes the left is an 8, the right is a 9! NO customer service available until it's almost too late to return items. I don't want to pay shipping on their mistakes, I just want to return it and get my money back. There is a $2 restocking fee, which I wish was waived on incorrect items. I wish I could keep loving this app...",2
10014,Horrible DO NOT RECOMMEND,1
10015,Love this! What a savings of time and $,5
10016,Cant ever get rescue jewelry box or my thredup bag processed after months of waiting,4
10017,So disappointed send items to sell on august and still not being process send an email to see what can be done to help the proccessing and no answer is a little fustrating,2
10018,I think this app is great. However there are 2 things I don't like. 1 there is no mens selection 2 the FedEx smartpost used for shipping takes a very long time.,3
10019,It takes too long to ship,4
10020,Love the app!,5
10021,Love this app. Sometimes the item is not as cared for so you need to be careful but most items are nice,4
10022,Love love love love love this. I'm obsessed.,5
10023,I love this sight. If you love fashion you need to try it. You won't be sorry.,5
10024,Easy! Fun!,5
10025,"Love this app! Thrift store shopping from home, more organized, great pictures, prices and shipping is so reasonable, or bundle and it's free. I can't say enough good things. Love love love",5
10026,Always have an amazin experience! Always find some great items.,5
10027,Cheap and easy.,5
10028,Everything I need in one place!,5
10029,I love it....I wish we didn't have to push NEXT to keep shopping and it would just scroll.....or we could jump to a specific page..buts its great!,3
10030,"Returns seem to not be filled. Notifications are excessive and unable to be adjusted. Your saved can not be sorted or filtered. Do not recommend this service. App it self does not fail or start though feed regularly duplicates items. Multiple items are double tagged and marked in the system with different prices, so keep scrolling to make sure you don't buy the more expensive post. Really wanted to love this company and service is more than slow due to COVID. Don't spend your money.",1
10031,"Extremely overpriced, wrinkly, outdated clothing.",1
10032,Too slow to load,1
10033,No did not like the store,5
10034,I have only purchase work shirts but they have been great quality. I will be ordering more.,5
10035,Nice items. Good quality. Fast shipping. Will be shopping again.,5
10036,I love thrift shopping! But I expected more from an app. For starters I love that it remembers the sizing that I want. But when I favorite something and it's no longer available and you click on find something similar...why does it give me cute clothing in not the sizing I'm looking for...? It's a let down haha. It's somewhat reasonable pricing.,3
10037,This app is good for thriftiness and especially in Covid times.,5
10038,Fun to browse and easy to navigate. I've ordered from Thredup several times over the years and am always happy with my purchases. I've never made a return so I can't speak on that. Excited for my latest shipment! Still good!,5
10039,If you have a question for this company it will take 10 days to get an answer,1
10040,"Great thrift store online, has everything,all organized",5
10041,Good,5
10042,I made many attempts to reach these folks to no avail. This has proven to be just one more way to get ripped off even with used items. Enjoy thredup.,1
10043,I could stay on this app all day long. The one time I had to contact customer service they were very professional and prompt. Thred Up has always been a positive shopping experience for me!,5
10044,I like everthing they have u can fine it all,5
10045,"I love ThredUp, but this app is awful. It keeps freezing. It won't open. For days. I've restarted my phone multiple times and I've uninstalled & reinstalled the app twice - the app still won't even open. Please fix this. Android phone here.",1
10046,"Absolutely LOVE this- from the easy navigation, to the quick shipment and tracking notifications, to the products themselves. Totally recommend.",5
10047,"Love love love ThredUp. I am used to shopping here via my desktop, but I am learning the new app and it has great features.",4
10048,"I love it, found a lot of awesome finds on it. Great prices, fast shipping",5
10049,Great selection. The site itself is hit or miss. I've had 6 orders of multiple items. One item was sized completely wrong as if they don't actually measure but go by the tags. It was listed as an adult size but clearly young girls. The return process is tough. Have a printer for free return label -full price if by in-store credit or pay restocking fee to get refund to your card - OR pay your own shipping for a refund to your card.,5
10050,"the clothes I got were nothing like they were advertised, the one pair of pants were a knock off of champion pants...if you want to return them you have to pay a restocking fee and shipping!",1
10051,Fantastic app!,5
10052,It took my 1000 REWARD POINTS did not give me discount NO ONE WILL TALK TO ME???,3
10053,I'm glad I gave it a try and I don't regret it,5
10054,I want a clean out bag when well you be receiving?,2
10055,"Absolutely love thredup- with one exception: the shipping is slow and no choices available. Still waiting on items from August order- hopeful for this one area to be worked out- other than terrible shipping, very good experience.",5
10056,"Convenient, great value, I am a fashion consultant and the quality of clothing is superb.",5
10057,It's been great,5
10058,"Love thredup, but I often have to restart the app to search and see saves.",3
10059,Love this app! I have found many steals!!,5
10060,Good quality clothes and shoes for good prices,5
10061,I love 💘 u so much!!,5
10062,"Prices are ridiculously high for wrinkled, stretched out tops! You can't get a good deal here, you're better off at goodwill!",1
10063,"This app is so much fun! I'm a huge fan of the site, and now being able to have an app specifically dedicated to this wonderful company on my phone is worth it. Thredup is amazing, from the items they sell to their goody box. I want it all!",5
10064,It's cool alotta choices but you get discounts you can't use when I go to checkout I couldn't put em in sooo that's useless.....any how I didn't order from the place and I'll soon uninstall the app....,3
10065,Only place I shop now!,5
10066,Fun,5
10067,Have had a wonderful experience with every purchase,5
10068,Purchased a item that was not fit to be sold. Was to be a medium in adult womens. Would not even fit my 10 year grandaughter. I would think the merchandise should be inspected closer than it was. I am assuming it was washed and shrunk. Come on people need to do better job. I need a total refund. There is no excuse for this to happen,1
10069,Does not allow me to reset password tried everything!,1
10070,Love this app!,5
10071,First time,5
10072,"My first orders went well just ordered from current sale I accidentally put in wrong email when I placed a second order and they cancelled my order saying I tried to use saving code twice I used a separate code from there sale code paid with the same paypal account I have spent a lot of money here very dissatisfied they didn't just contact me just cancel my order really I won't be doing any further business here,could have just notified me put my order under my correct email and sent it",1
10073,"Did not find one thing I liked, clothes are outdated",1
10074,Prices are a little high!,3
10075,this app doesnt work. i would give it 0 if i could. it just opens up and says thredup then stays there.,1
10076,"Love the clothes, prices and the shipping does take some time but it's loads of fun when the clothes arrive!",5
10077,0 customer service. Left voicemail. Emails. No response in 6 months. Donate your clothes this company is not worth tha hassle.,1
10078,I requested a bag to sell my goods three months ago but never received it. Yes I've contacted customer service but no response ever.,2
10079,"Horrible , twice Ive ordered from there. The 1st time they sent my order to wrong address and had to ho through heck to contact customer service. Now this time my order was separated into 2 seperate shipments and only 1 of them has tracking information and when I click the order details page, nothing comes up. Absolutely a scam rip off company and website with the worst customer service if you can even call it that! Do not use or buy anything from them, they'll just steal your money.",1
10080,"I love thredup. My only reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are pretty expensive for a second hand store. Brands from walmart or target or F21 are significantly overpriced. If they lowered their prices of already cheap stuff, I'd give it a 5 star.",4
10081,Love thredup. The ap freezes up and shuts down all the time though.,3
10082,Best way to thrift,5
10083,Items are always as described. Easy checkout.,5
10084,I loved my last order,4
10085,Awesome place. Send in unwanted clothes and get what you love... Very addicting...love them...go threadup...,5
10086,"Reducing my carbon footprint by buying secondhand, AND it's a smooth digital experience.",5
10087,love this app is irreplaceable,5
10088,Love shopping high end clothing!,5
10089,Awesome,5
10090,Great secondhand finds! I have been very pleased with buying and selling on this site. Orders are shipped in a timely manner and very easy return policy if item does not fit or you decide it's not for you. Selling it just as easy! Credit toward future purchases or cash in your pocket.,5
10091,I can always find incredible deals on anything I'm looking for.,5
10092,Love,3
10093,Been awesome,5
10094,So many options,5
10095,"The app is ok. Thred up is a problem, my 1st order and will probably be my last. 2 BIG issues, no invoices, no easy way to contact about sizing and returns and when I finally figured out how to make returns, I found I needed a printer which I don't or pay, what I consider a lot, for them to send a receipt. By the time I considered that, plus restocking fees, it would cost me 25% of what I paid. Will only be doing business with real stores or on-line sites more user friendly.",2
10096,Easy to shop and save.,5
10097,Everything I have gotten has been on time and perfect. LOVE this app,5
10098,I wasn't able to return some of the items I purchased. I wasn't a happy camper.,2
10099,I wish they measured all of their items but it very sporadic of which items have measurements.,3
10100,Didnt blow my mind clothes seemed not very fashion friendly a few gems but not enough to stay installed on my phone but i will check back and always give a 2nd chance just could not be my style but perfect for you just what u were looking for give it a try never hurts to take a look,3
10101,"It's great, addictive 🤯",5
10102,Bought some things was not happy with most of them. Hem out of dress. Dress to short: has to be worn with leggins. Never got my percentage off. And more. I'm returning 2 items. One thing I'm keeping but it is so wrinkley (sp) I'm not sure how to solve it. Wash it and hope its better? Buy a iron?! Or send it out $$$!,2
10103,SO FAR SO GOOD,4
10104,"Great app, great deals, great clothes",5
10105,Great!,5
10106,Love this organization!! Great choices- will be shopping again soon! My stylist is spot on. Could not be happier😊,5
10107,I love shopping on Thredup.,4
10108,Makes it easy to shop...,5
10109,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!! I ORDERED FROM HERE LESS THAN 12HR AGO !!! THEY HAVE A PAYMENT PLAN BUT YOU WILL GET CHARGED THE FULL AMOUNT EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE THAT OPTION.. AND CUSTOMER SERVICE NO HELP WHATSOEVER!!! DONT ORDER FROM HERE !! THEY WON'T CANCEL OR CHANGE THE ORDERED AFTER THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY!!! B***S***!,1
10110,"Some things are not properly described (condition) but overall great app. Easy to use, nice interface. Easy to return. Customer support was helpful too. Good prices.",5
10111,Don't sell from site! Bag received from them in May and now it says it will not be processed until June next year!!! Rip off! Waste of time and clothes are practically brand new store price!,1
10112,"Love the app, so handy for sudden wardrobe changes",5
10113,"Awesome stuff. If you're having any problems, forget about getting help. You get to speak to no one. You get Q&A instead. One size fit all don't always work.",5
10114,Love it. Things from there are like brand new,4
10115,These prices are outrageously high especially consider much of it is previously owned! Deleting. No deals here.,1
10116,"Love the app, and love the store!",5
10117,Awesome!,5
10118,Eff this company. They take your items and never pay you. They've had my items for 4 months.,1
10119,Only issue is with trying to order a clean out kit. Other then that great site!!!!!!,3
10120,I just got my first package from thredUP. It was sooner then expected an great stuff for low a price. I love shopping in the app it has all the great brands I like an all the right sizes. I recommend thredUP to everyone.,5
10121,Awesome prices! It doesn't take forever to be delivered to your house! All the clothes I've gotten fit perfectly! This is the best online thrift store EVER! Whoever came up with thredUP is truly brilliant and amazingly amazing and I would love to give them a billion hugs!,5
10122,"Shipping takes a little longer but it's totally worth it. They have accurate tracking too so I always know when to expect my packages. The clothes look exactly like they do in the pictures. The customer support are super friendly, I had to change my delivery address after submitting an order and they helped me right away.",5
10123,Love thred up!!!,5
10124,Good,5
10125,"I initially gave 2 stars because the sign up process did not work on my Android phone. I had to use a PC to create an account. After that, it has worked well. I like the thrifting concept and the photos are pretty good. Can't always get a good size or description, but the price is right and they do accept returns. So, I do recommend thredUP once you get past the initial signup process",4
10126,"Love shopping on here!! Saving tons of money. I recently bought 10 outfits for work on here for less than $200!! Only thing i would recommend is on the coats and jackets, have a picture of the inside.",5
10127,Affordable good quality clothes. Quick delivery.,5
10128,"I love Thredup! The app is great, prices are good for the most part, customer service is amazing.",5
10129,Love It. Best place to shop for second hand clothes. Fast service. Easy to use the app. Many choices.,5
10130,Liked the ease of ordering,5
10131,Always a satisfied customer!!! Just wish they had more off brand clothes for us really thrifty shoppers!!! Wish the size filters could me more detailed too.,5
10132,"I love the selection and ease of shopping. The sale prices are really good. It can be a bit frustrating to have to reset my preferences every time I do a new search or click on a new category. Also, when I click on the link to a particular sale in the email, it doesnt take me to that sale, but to the regular home page.",3
10133,So good! Sizing is pretty spot on actually,5
10134,I love that everything I've purchased from thredUp has been just what the description says.,5
10135,Love the site!,5
10136,Muy bien. Los zapatos me encantaron.como nuevosy a buen precio.,4
10137,Way too expensive. Not thrift store prices at all. I'm uninstalling. Joke pricing.,1
10138,I kept asking the website to go to Juniors it would not accept me in women's and every time I would try to get to Juniors to order stuff for my child it wouldn't allow me so I had a very bad experience with this website,1
10139,"The app is ok. I'm deleting it because I'm not finding anything I like in my size. I deleted 1 star because you only get 2 photos per item. After over a decade of shopping on an established platform I've come to expect more than 2 pictures. Especially when buying used shoes. I want views from all angles, top and bottoms of shoes.",4
10140,I feel pretty. 💯 I'm in love with my last order I I received the Dooney Bourke green is so luscious I love it thank you. 🛍️,5
10141,Experiance ?,5
10142,"I love shopping from the comfort of my home. Yet, Buyer beware of unknown brands they usually have inaccurate measurements or are from foreign countries that have smaller sizes than U.S. sizes do, you will have to pay a restocking fee as well.",5
10143,I love love 🥰 love this app! Not only is the app asome and I find some really nice cloths at grate price that are in top notch if not new condition. I'm helping the planet go green 🌱🌻🌍🌎🌏 help save the planet and have fun doing it by recycling cloths I never really thought about it like that tell I received my first box then I read the pamphlet that came with my cloths and the company's objective I was like I like this app even more! You should try it people don't miss out!!!!!!,5
10144,Great deals! Shop in the comfort of my home. Love it!!,5
10145,Easy to search and order better then going in the stores. Good value ... lots of savings!!,5
10146,Underwhelming. Had for all of 30 sec before deleting once i realized their size range for waist measurement stopped before mine.,1
10147,"No mens clothing. Disappointed for sure, there's not even a category for it.",1
10148,They dont sell men's clothing. Negative 10 stars!,1
10149,Good product,4
10150,"OG customer and only have good things to say great value,received in very nice package . No worries",5
10151,Excellent condition clothing.,5
10152,Love the app. Its so much fun looking for good finds. I think i am addicted. Love it.,5
10153,"Was really excited when I placed an order.I got the items and out of 8 items, only 2 fit. I ordered most things 1 or even 2 size larger.The quality of items did not look like picture, either. Some things looked like they were sitting in someone's closet for 20 years. No worries, I'll just return, right? Well they charged me $8 to send back as well as 1.99 PER ITEM fee. So I ended up paying them almost $30 to return. I do not recommend ordering from them.",1
10154,I love everything about thred ul!,5
10155,"Recycled clothing! I love recycling, and why not try it with clothes? Manufacturing clothes is madly wasteful, and THREDUP lets you sell as well as buy! The app makes it wildly easy.",5
10156,"Always fun looking, finding what I want is easy, and when I order it......never had a problem there either!",5
10157,Geear,5
10158,app does not support filtering and sorting,1
10159,"Love this app! I find so many amazing clothes on ThredUp, at a fraction of the original price. Affordable and sustainable fashion is the way to go!",5
10160,Love it,5
10161,Thankyou,5
10162,"Love this online thrift store! Better for our wallets, economies, and the environment!",5
10163,Still waiting on my second Coach purse...I'm going to be nice and see if it still comes today.,3
10164,"You can't use gift cards on the app, but it is easier to search and scroll on the app vs a desktop!",4
10165,I used to love this app because everything was actually priced like a thrift store and now I'm getting a massive amount of things priced well over $30. I found a spaghetti strap body suit priced for over $100. Not to mention the pricing isn't consistent for similarly (originally) priced items from the same brand. Call me cheap but if I'm buying used clothes I'd expect something of a discount more than a dollar or two.,2
10166,I love it great deals,5
10167,I love this! I work all the time and don't have time to shop or go to yard sales. This was a wonderful idea.,5
10168,Aweful,1
10169,I love it!!,5
10170,Clothes were just like the photos. For the prices I honestly think its fair. I am not disappointed I LOVE thrift stores!,4
10171,Super easy to navigate. Quick loading during searches. Would recommend 👍,5
10172,Easy to filter and shop,5
10173,Easy to find items via use of website filters.,5
10174,Very fun!,5
10175,Love this app great prices,5
10176,The best way to buy clothes. I'm amazed at how there's so much to choose from.,5
10177,Use this app! My favorite thrift store :) Finding clothes is super easy and there are loads of super helpful filters.,5
10178,"Truly great values to be found here. Thrilled with items received to date. Great time and money saver. Quite addicted to shopping here. (It is now 2020, and I am still very happily using the thredUP app, still 5 stars ☆☆☆☆☆. Still finding great variety and value. Still love the app and the convenience).",5
10179,"Everything I've ordered is exactly as I expected. I am a former Community Donation Manager for Savers and we would receive trucks from you. Every time your merchandise would come in, it never disappointed! Our store alone kept over 800,000 pounds out of the landfill last year. Due to Covid, I had to move back to Florida where there is no store. I'm a HUGE advocate of recycling clothing and keeping them out of landfills. ThredUP, should you need an advocate, I'd be proud to work for you!",5
10180,I absolutely love this app. I can afford to have a beautiful wardrobe and the pricing is very very reasonable. I have so many nice clothes that I don't even know what to wear EVERYDAY because of my selection!!!!!,5
10181,"I 💓 this app. I have made several purchases from thredUP and I have been very happy each time! The pieces of clothing I've received are either NWT or even though it was used you would definitely mistake it for being new. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who likes to save money on brand name clothing that doesn't mind their clothes coming from a secondhand store. Threadup is not your normal everyday thift store, they are by far the best online secondhand shopping destination.",5
10182,So far so good!,5
10183,"Choices were very limited, I thought.",3
10184,I'm sorry but these are NOT thrift store prices what so ever. I have seen the same items cheaper brand new on the actual brand website.,1
10185,"Wish Thred-Up would include waist and bust measurements on ALL items. Not all sizes are created equal and they don't consistently differentiate between country sizing (a size US 10 is NOT the same as a UK 10). I want to love ThredUp but it's always a gamble, even with the photos they take of the items. Pricing (for buying and selling) is also sort of high. You sell something for $30, for example, but you might only get $3 for the item.",3
10186,Addictive!!! Within the first 5 weeks I have spent over 1200.00 that should have gone to rent. I am screwed but I look soooo cute!!! So worth it. Even if I have to live in my car 🚗 LOL. Love 💘 it. Brilliant!,4
10187,Disconnects frequently.,3
10188,This is my first order so far the experience has been great. When I receive the order that will be the full testament.,5
10189,"I LOVE ThredUp! I always find what I'm looking for on this app, with great quality clothing and timely arrival for a much cheaper price.",5
10190,"Easy to use, great deals!",5
10191,Easy to use,5
10192,Saving money and the environment,5
10193,I received exactly what I was expecting,5
10194,"Basically everything I have ordered is poor quality. Descriptions said ""might mistake as brand new"" doesnt look brand new. I ordered a back pack and it looks like a 3 year olds toy. They also charge you $8.99 processing fee on the few items you can return. Dont waste your time or money. Update: I was able to return everything but only for store credit, used the credit with the same outcome. Nothing looks as pictured or fit, it was all trash which is where it went so Im out $300 and deleting app.",1
10195,Disappointed I got this app to look for wedding dresses and every time I look up for wedding dresses it gives me options for wedding guests or bridesmaids but not for actual wedding dresses. I'm highly disappointed by this.,1
10196,"Super easy to use, Thredup delivers a very personal touch, all throughout the experience, and I walk away with my 5 pairs of designer Jean's, with tags on, having spent only $52.00 USD, , not $750.00 USD. Thredup asks all the right questions to get anybody outfitted. Thank You!! Juliet K.",5
10197,2nd hand and new items added daily excellent way to shop pre CoVid19 and currently when you Enjoy online shopping.,5
10198,"One of my favorite places to shop now! You can find anything you want and the quality is great. I was a little worried at first but I have recieved multiple orders at this point, and everything has arrived in great condition.",5
10199,Love this app!!!,5
10200,"I really love the concept of this app however I have attempted using for several weeks, and it logs me out and freezes when I try to log back in to view a product.. doesn't seem like the bug has been fixed for awhile",2
10201,"Since most thrift stores are closed because of Covid, I think this is a great alternative. It's also a nice sustainable way to get new clothes. Everything is well described and decently pictured.",5
10202,So easy to operate!!! Lots of options to choose from,5
10203,I knew I wasn't going to make a bunch of money but $.37 for 4 articles of clothing that hadn't been worn and were still in the packages for the most part??? Had I known i was going to get less than 50 cents i would have just donated and taken it off on my taxes or tried to sell them myself. This was a rip off and I will not be using them again,1
10204,I always feel like I'm getting the best deal. Great customer service.,5
10205,"Is good, unfortunately don't have products for men.",5
10206,"There's no men's clothes, why!?",1
10207,Great 🤗💛💙❤️ I love ThredUP. And my friends too ...,5
10208,This app is not at all user friendly.,2
10209,Great!,3
10210,Great for vintage collectors,5
10211,Everything I've ordered I've loved....and had fun finding stuff!,5
10212,Have enjoyed most everything I've purchased,4
10213,Nice Company,5
10214,My new addiction,5
10215,Awesome stuff. Never a problem and the prices are fantastic.,5
10216,"I loved using this app a few months ago to buy and sell my clothes, but since some recent updates, there is a serious bug with the logging in functionality. I tried to reset my password, use magic link, etc. and it just sends me back to the app with no ability to reset my password. Once I navigate to my sell bag, it prompts me with a modal to log in again. Authentication is just broken and I'll no longer be using this app.",1
10217,Can't get through Check out,1
10218,Shopping spree from home! Haven't seen the goods yet...hope it looks as good as it does in pictures.,5
10219,Have received lots of great items. Every item has fit and has been in great condition.,5
10220,"I have reached out to Customer Service about my missing order and was told to give it few more days. After waiting for over a week, nothing came. I am always home and gets notified through my Ring if there is mail or delivery. First order and I am already missing 4 of my 5 items. Tracking said it has been scanned. It has been a long time since the supposed delivery. I have been trying to reach somebody through the app and it is almost impossible to get help. Update: 9/9 resolved",1
10221,Addicting! I've never had so much cheap fun. It's just what I needed during these challenging times. Thank you Thred Up!!!,5
10222,"Love it. Perfectly good clothes, almost brand new for cheap...",5
10223,Ordered 4 pair of jeans. Three pair says delivered which ive yet to see and the one pair i have gotten was supposed to be flared leg but they are striaght leg. What a joke.,1
10224,"Time waster for me. Trying to get kit to sell or donate. Fill out form and nothing happens when hit ""next"" after filling out name & address. All kinds of bulk ad emails. Great idea but app does not work",1
10225,"Totally happy with purchase! Everything was just like it showed and shipping was awesome! Can't believe how fast it arrived,in a nice box too! Great job!",5
10226,Good app. I wish they would add a sort feature though,4
10227,"My experience with ThredUp has been positive. I've used the app for a couple of years now and I enjoy being able to filter to exactly what I have in mind. Returning an item is easy, I've returned a couple of pairs of pants that didn't fit and did the free shipping back for credit on my account. I haven't provided anything to sell on the app yet. Overall experience is I have a polka dot box on my porch almost every other week or so. My items have been clean and neat when I receive them. 😊",5
10228,"I am giving three stars because I am frustrated by this app and I expected more from an editor's pick. I could not use the search to find a robe, and there are no categories for sleepwear. It appears the clothes may be pinned at the back to create a more flattering outline on the models which could make it difficult to assess final fit and appearance. ""New with tags"" items are barely discounted. I was very disappointed by the savings. Sorry Thredup!",3
10229,"I never got the passwoed reset email. I signed in by facebook, then How the Heck do you get it to proceed? stuck on the same page. no button to click. HELLOHELP!! Guess yoy just wanted facebook info. I guess it'll be uninstalled. SMH",1
10230,Over all I love the site I just had a couple of things that didn't fit and they does set in over there,5
10231,This used to be a good clothing app. Recently I have noticed that none of the Jean's I've ordered have fit me. I've noticed that they have 2 different waist sizes on their Jean's and you have to pay a restocking fee for their mistake if you send them back.,2
10232,"I liked it until I realized they'd blocked the following searches: Lesbian Lgbtq Queer And yes, they actually blocked ""rainbow"" I switched over to Poshmark.",1
10233,This site helped me discover my true style! Great customer service and a rare opportunity to try out different labels and designs. Way more variety than you can even find at local thrift.,5
10234,"After ordering several times with success, i recently placed an order where the discount code did not get applied. Although i contacted customer service right away, they refused to apply it. I guess a few dollars means more to them than a continuing happy customer and more orders in the future. Stupid. Be very careful with your promo codes and don't make any mistakes, cuz these money-grubbers don't care.",1
10235,2020: a year plus later and I am STILL loving this app!! absolutely LOVE how easy it is to search and buy!!,5
10236,Love this app!,5
10237,Great deals 👌,5
10238,ummm no men's clothing?? thats just stupid. i may be female but I like men's clothing and not selling it makes me not even want to use this ap to sell items. poor business decision guys 👎👎,1
10239,"I like the clothes I bought, except one dress said it could be mistaken for new. The dress was nice except for a wire by the bust area sticking out, the seller had to know about it and should never had sold it like that. Every other item was as described.",4
10240,Love this!!,5
10241,Just like all the rest Expensive and slow,2
10242,💯,5
10243,I like that you can save your favorites and see if anyone else is looking at it too. Good discounts and large selection.,5
10244,Love everything I've gotten.,5
10245,"Easy to use and great selection. Shop by bust or waist size though, because women's sizing is insane.",5
10246,Thank you..i had fun..the good part is waiting..🙂for my box to artive..ppl always say the best things about u...and guess what..ill see....im waiting..🙂,5
10247,I love looking through the clothes. The app is very easy to use,5
10248,"Can't log in at all with my Amazon account on mobile. This works on the site, and is how I set up my account and made past purchases, however the mobile app will not complete the log in, even after I confirmed I had the right credentials. I will still use the site, however the app is unusable for me which is frustrating",2
10249,"Great shopping App. I have found some adorable outfits for my nieces and adorable Designer brands for myself that I otherwise would have never bought. I've discovered some new name brands. Convenient to sell items as well, but the payback isn't much, which is a reason I knocked it down a star. Also wish search features were more specific.",4
10250,"I LOVE shopping at ThredUp! So fun finding treasures here! So many too! Very CLEAN, neatly folded, adorable packaging ~ if I didn't know better, I would think I had bought brand new! ❤ 4 stars not 5 because of shipping - Fed-Ex takes forever (1 week from PA to NJ ?? 😳) to only be handle by USPS for actual delivery - USPS would have delivered in 2-3 days instead of 7 day Fed-ex.",4
10251,GREAT,5
10252,Love all the options!❤️,5
10253,Love it,5
10254,Excellent!! Very easy!! 👍👍,5

10258,"Great clothes, website easy to use, can return items... But they forget to say that every time you do something like cancel an order they stop giving you coupons/sales or reduce your cart timer to 4 hours instead of 24...",3
10259,Quick delivery. Everything is what I expected it to be. Love this place!,5
10260,Showed a promo code however it was not added to my cart.,4
10261,Gives alot of information. Fast and easy to use. Love It!,5
10262,Terrific,5
10263,"I always find great deal for my kids and myself. Some gently used and some brand new!! Returns are available, if items don't fit. I also love their in person store. Great app, too...never any issues.",5
10264,Like,5
10265,"No Men's items. If you gets Men's lines then maybe, just maybe I will give you more than one star. Otherwise you are just sextist trash.",1
10266,Money saving app and fast app,5
10267,"Items are just as described, and in great shape! Excellent service, I highly recommend. 😁👍",5
10268,Amazing place to cure your thrifty craves it has endless clothes. I'm amazed that 5 things I ordered it was less than $20. I actually feel like being at the mall. I love this place we're going to become thredUps fanatics!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,5

10271,This app is very useful,5
10272,Best prices,5
10273,love it!!! great amazeballs selection.,5
10274,"I like the quality of clothes, the frequent deals, and the timeliness of orders. The Goodie Boxes are a great service, and the favoriting system works well. I'm annoyed that I can't filter *out* brands or items in the filtering system, but I'm pleased overall.",4
10275,"I love this app! I literally have an addiction! I would never even go into the high end stores that a lot of these clothes come from, let alone pay full price for them. I have gotten such amazing deals, that I honestly don't want to ship any other way! So glad I found ThredUP!!",5
10276,"I just ordered a dress to wear for his wedding in October. I have ordered 2 pair of dress pants and one pair of genes. I have ordered two blouses. I am 90 years old and no longer go out to shop. Some of the items are used, but you would never know it. The prices are perfect and service is great. The wedding is my grandsons and his lady friend..",4
10277,Wow just installed but omg the stuff!,5
10278,"Was hoping to find something in my size as far as shoes, but apparently no one accounts for shoe sizes above 12 women's. Only damn reason I downloaded this thing.",1
10279,Great clothes and earth friendly!,5
10280,Love it,5
10281,Love it always has what I'm looking for,5
10282,"Easy to use, quick and convenient!",5
10283,"Love the app, but wish that there were more ways to customize what you are looking for. All in all, I enjoy shopping with Thread Up.",5
10284,Good,5
10285,Love this app.,4
10286,"overall wonderful app experience, the mobile version does lack a few things the website has and from time to time it lags, but nothing no other app does. Just be careful not to spend too much time in it or you'll be shopping hours ! 😂",5
10287,Easy & affordable,5
10288,I've been using this site & app for a few years now... because I really like it!,5
10289,"WOW ! I Just shopped THREADUP ! I am Shocked at their HIGE Prices,I will just go to Original retailer,and buy same item,for less..for example TORRID,where everything is discounted,,and put on clearence,quite fast !",1
10290,Great app. Nice and affordable clothes and purses!,5
10291,"Great quality at amazing prices! I have to be careful because I spend a lot, but for the amount I've spent, I got to triple the clothes!",5
10292,It says wrong password Everytime I log in. I can only log in on a computer. Which makes things difficult since I sell on the app.,1
10293,Great and accurate descriptiona of the clothing. They arrive like a brand new article of clothing. I love it!,5
10294,Never received any communication back from the items I shipped them months and months ago. It's a scam.,1
10295,Very disapointed. There is no mens' department or clothes.,1
10296,Great clothes and awesome arrival time,5
10297,The absolute best!,5

10304,Good,4
10305,I have gotten a ton of great deals through thredup. The app is is super easy and fun to zero in on exactly what I'm looking for.,5
10306,"I have been a very frequent shopper/buyer on ThredUP now for a while, by far they are the best! I have shopped on Merci and Posh and price wise thredUP can not be beat. I have never received an item that wasn't in near perfect condition and shipping is pretty fast compared to other like wise apps/websites . Over all a great app and company.",5
10307,I love thredUP and may never buy clothes in a store again! 🤩,5
10308,😍😍😍😍😍,5
10309,"Great for buying, not very good for selling. The percentages are low. They sell something for $10 and I get like 60 cents, not even $1. I'd advise selling things you would basically give away anyway. I feel like the app is purposely not user friendly when selling and contacting customer service is not available thru the app.",1
10310,"The app had a user friendly interface. It is easy to find what you are looking for. As other reviewers mentioned, things in your cart get deleted after two days. If not for that I would give the app 5 stars.",4
10311,Excellent experience so far!,5
10312,"I get kicked out of the app a lot, and it never saves my spot. Other than that ita pretty easy to navigate.",3
10313,Was everything it advertised! I haven't received my order as I just placed it today. I am excited to see the products that I ordered,5
10314,"Easy to use, no issues with app. Love the clothes! The shopping and returns process has been extremely easy. Definitely recommend thredUP!",5
10315,Won't open.,1
10316,Always really good quality and timely in shipping. A ton of options. Clean when they arrive. Company obviously cares about the customer.,5
10317,Great so far only got one of my items but very happy.,5
10318,So easy!,5
10319,I love that you can get decent quality clothes for a fair rate. Shipping is fast and pretty package.,5
10320,Easy to use and great prices!!,5
10321,If you're on the bigger size don't waste your time here... shoes..shoes...and more shoes ... sorry its the only size 8 I have on my body,1
10322,Did not receive delivery. Tracking shows its been in my city since Wednesday. Today is Friday and I have not received my purchases. The schedule said I would have delivery by Wednesday.,1
10323,They sent me a skirt it was to be a size 30 or a 4x but it was a 30 regular. 🤨😤 And the shirt says 4x but is more like a 1x. I will never order from here again.,1
10324,"I love it. I have ordered from them, 2 times, now. My size is easy to shop for. The clothes come in different original fashions. Delivery is quick& the clothes, are clean& ready to wear. Bayo Elizabeth Cary, AA, BA, MLIS",5
10325,So easy to use. Like new items.,5
10326,Very bad company don't buy or sell your stuff. They lost my sell package. And credit me $35.00. I had purse in the bag that was worth 150.00. Don't do it.,1
10327,Most of your dresses are ugly!!!,1
10328,😍,5
10329,Fast,5
10330,"I love this shopping app. It is so easy to find really great, cute clothes, and it's reasonably priced. I absolutely LOVE thredUP!!!",5
10331,"Needed to cancel an order, but could not get to customer service. The app kept saying to rephrase my question or taking me back to the FAQ page. Now I'm stuck with an item that is not returnable. Otherwise shipping is fast and good selection which surprised me. I didn't think they had plus size when I first watched the ads. Pleasantly surprised.",3
10332,WAY TOO MANY TEXTS/EMAILS!!!!!,3
10333,Don't have any good clothes are shoes they look very old like my grandmother would wear,2
10334,Its helpful and you can find thangs easily,5
10335,My first experience was not what I expected. The clothes I ordered were to small and there was no return on almost my whole order. I just waisted $100 or more. I think I will just shop new. This experience was not good.,2
10336,Very nice clothes! Very pleased!,5
10337,"Awesome prices, quick delivery and sizes are right on.",5
10338,Love it!,5
10339,I always find good deals!,5
10340,A great resource to finding good quality used clothes,5
10341,"This app works really well, its easy to search and save items and it runs smoothly with little lag waiting for items in the lists to load. The service it provides saves me a lot of money on my clothes habit too.",5
10342,"Love browsing, it's never ending clothes. Takes FOREVER to deliver though. I ordered clothes for summer time a few weeks ago and now its September and still no where near here. Big sad about that.",3
10343,"Overall the shopping experience is kinda fun and easy. The prices for things that are used are ridiculous! These are used items and they want 30 sum odd $ for for something with holes, that isnt supposed to! Make sure you zoom on things you want to buy!",3
10344,Greatest,5
10345,"Worst experience ever. I would give zero stars if possible. Don't send your clothes here, they will rip you off and then make it nearly impossible to get any money back. My family and I spent hours shopping only to have all of our accounts canceled because we were under the same roof. However, thredup then decided we could have ""some"" of the stuff we ordered but split it into different boxes and charged us separate shipping. The whole ordeal was a joke...",1
10346,"Everything I have order has come quickly, been in great condition and fit perfectly! I have a whole new work wardrobe thanks to ThredUp!",5
10347,"I used to love thredUP. I rated it five stars earlier this year. But since then it's become such a disappointment. Shady corporate partnerships, a constant barrage of high-pressure sales events, and now the choice to cut cart timers so drastically without warning, screwing over the customers least financially able to make purchase decisions on impulse -- and, conveniently, most limited in where they can afford to shop instead. It's not fun anymore, just stressful and manipulative.",2
10348,Don't like this one bit. Completely different from Letgo. Cannot see my current listings that was posted for Sale.,1
10349,Love the notification when prices get lower!,5
10350,AMAZING! I love thrifting and to find it so easy and online is just beautiful!! Thenonly thing I wish.ia I found this earlier! Cant wait for my 9 shipments ahah have a great day,5
10351,Super easy to use app. Super easy to find deals. Super easy to earn extra $$$ for new fits ;),5
10352,Easy to use Fast shipping Great customer service,5
10353,I love this website. I ordered 14 name brand shirts for 60 dollers. Absolutely love it.,5
10354,"I love that I can buy high quality second hand clothes. Good for our beautiful earth and good for the purse. App is a little hard to navigate, mainly because there is so much inventory, so it takes time. But I'm happy to do anything to be better to this planet.",4
10355,this is a horrible service in my opinion. I'm a heavy girl now that I've gained some weight and I ordered extra extra large pants and they wouldn't even fit a 7 year. I ordered size 16 and they barely fit a 12-year-old. They do not let you know whether it's a child size 16 oradult. They mix all the clothes together you have no way of telling and then it's too late it cost too much to return them it's not worth it,3
10356,Excellent delivery service & clothes for a great price & every item you purchase is in tip top condition keep up the good work thredUP (人 •͈ᴗ•͈),5
10357,"Nice selection, great prices",5
10358,They took the money out of my account and yet it said there was an error processing my payment.,1
10359,❤❤❤,5
10360,"Awesome, so excited about every order I receive!",5
10361,I LOVE THIS STORE!! 😘🥰,5
10362,I like the format & low prices,5
10363,"I have been using this app for years & I absolutely love it. I shop for myself & my son. I have a hard time buying clothes brand new, when I know I can find high quality items at great prices! It is super fun to hunt for one-of-a-kind pieces & their sales are so worth it!",5
10364,Grea,5
10365,I love shopping on this site! So many beautiful items to choose from.,5
10366,I enjoy receiving my box from ThredUp. It is always filled with very nice items. Several of the items still have the original price on them. The company gives you A+ service. I would recommend this company to everyone.😊,5
10367,"I love shopping on thredUP, very good quality clothing.",5
10368,If you know your sizes you can score new pieces for a fraction of the cost at the department stores.,5
10369,"I love this app, super easy to search for particular sizes, clothing, shoes, and accessories at great prices. Shipping is super fast and its overall a really easy site. I would highly recommend this app..",5
10370,"Excellent experience, excellent selection.",5
10371,Love shopping here,5
10372,Large variety of items !,5
10373,Loving it~☆,5
10374,Fun.,4
10375,it did not let me put my application in kept asking a last name and there is no filter for last name😒,1
10376,This game looks like it will be fun.,5
10377,"Shopping made easy, with great prices on all our favorite name brands.",5
10378,"Nothing better than quality shopping from the comfort of your jammies! Luv the 'HEADS UP!' when FAVS go on sale. Thanks, thredUP. ❤",5
10379,Love !!!!!,5
10380,"While I enjoy donating my clothes without having to go to town, and earning money for them, I am not a fan of the shopping experience. It is difficult to search for specific items, and to return an item is difficult.",3
10381,Cant beat the prices even the hubby's not complaining.,5
10382,"Easy, straight forward",5
10383,I wished there were more filters. You need to know exactly what you want.,3
10384,"Order shoes for a wedding in 8/13. For some reason they never shipped them until 8/27. They are now estimated to arrive on 9/3. The day after the wedding. So, when I return from my out if town wedding, I'll have to return the shoes. I also have to pay a 1.99 restocking fee to return them. 🙄 Can't find a place to actually talk to a person or call. I just keep getting redirected to their FAQ.",1
10385,Neatly boxed..got all items that I ordered..,5
10386,My account has a balance and I've been locked out of it since Feb. I've contacted them numerous of times and I still haven't been contacted back. As serious as this is you'd think someone in account support should care. I guess we will see.,1
10387,"Be warned, this app can be addictive!",5
10388,App works great! Good and fast.,5
10389,"FANTASTIC! I was apprehensive to try this, not knowing what I would truly end up with. I bought 5 pairs of pants for about $35.00! It took about a week for one of the 2 boxes to get here. I'm okay with that. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! Everything was wrapped with care. You open the box to find the items carefully wrapped in beautiful tissue paper. All the items underneath were folded to perfection as if id just purchased from an upscale store. WOW. didn't expect that. Will be be purchasing more.",5
10390,No selection for men.,1
10391,Great app. Very much Like the web browser experience. Makes it a lil too easy to shop. Haha. Thanks,5
10392,"AWESOME, ordered 18 shirts for only $70. All in perfect shape. Love love love it.",5
10393,Kept crashing 😒,1
10394,Wow! Have snagged some amazing buys. I recommend thredUP to anyone who likes to save money and still enjoy name brands.,5
10395,Exactly what I ordered and super fast delivery. Thank you so much!,5
10396,"Its good for shopping, I like that they filter by your entered sizes automatically. Wait for coupons and special offers, you can almost always expect 20% off. If you choose to sell, the cash out functionality is rough and needs some rework. If you click to cash out on the app it redirects you to order another clean out kit instead. I end up going to the website to cash out.",3
10397,Buggy and isn't linked properly. I'm trying to fix an issue with an order and the app doesn't show the problem. When I click to email support it has a 404 error. I would reach out another way but can't find one. This is no the first time something like this happen e d,2
10398,Love,5
10399,"$80 to get free shipping? No thanks. That's the highest shipping price I've seen first hand -aside from rim/tire shipping. Some of these prices are awful high for second hand too. Name brand means nothing to me, price does though. I'll stick with buying NEW items from other online retailers for similiar pricing. Easier on the planet? You're literally doing nothing to help the planet - buying used does not slow down the production of new clothes. Nice try. I'm sure some naive people believe...",1
10400,Like the variation of styles and colors and good choices on size.,4
10401,Love 💕 it Love ❣️ it!!! It's Fabulous!! 😃,5
10402,I have not had a chance to use this app very much however so far it's been great. I did buy some things and received them within a week so I'm very pleased!!,5
10403,I used to loooove this ap. Nothing loads now.,1
10404,"I love the THREDUP App altogether!! Because, I can get rid of my new, old, used &/or gently used items by just filling up a ""CLOSET CLEAN- OUT KIT""!! You should try this app BC you're gonna love it as well!! 💯👍❤️",5
10405,Beyond fun...,5
10406,I've been buying from this app many times and have lots of cute clothes for great deals.,5

10410,Fantastic site. Great selections. Extremely affordable.,5
10411,Great app AND great mission. Quality products. I buy and I sell. Works flawlessly,5
10412,"Great search options! I love the ability to search by multiple options per criteria, such as color and fabric content. Frequent sale coupons are such a boon. I'm not a big online shopper when it comes to clothes, but I've already bought more on here in a month than I ever have anywhere else online in over a decade. They have a generous return & credit policy that I greatly appreciate, as I have a hard time getting clothes that fit in general.",5
10413,Amazing clothes,5
10414,Lovely prices,5
10415,So no mens?,1
10416,"Beautiful used n new clothes!! Great prices , I will say more once my dresses arrive",4

10424,was an Awesome app. filters for materials styles and detils no longer efficient,3
10425,Love this site! Great ideas and beautiful clothing,5
10426,"The interface has become glitchy and terrible. Even though I have the newest version, the app keeps randomly deciding whether I'm logged in or out without any input on my part. Also, it's become impossible to access the ""selling"" page to edit the price on my existing items through the app, causing a few to expire and now I have to reclaim them. What a hassle!",3
10427,Love it,5
10428,"Super stuff, Grand prices, lots of fun.",5
10429,"Everything costs money, not fun game.",1
10430,Great search engine within the site. A great place to shop.,5
10431,"My experience is awful, I've sold items on this site and cannot get my money , I've texted n texted but just get ghosted because I've no response back or money have asked 2 send my money to bank or PayPal haven't been sent to either remind me of another site that you can't get in touch with as needed",1
10432,Great,4
10433,There are great discounts up to 50% off on special days and it gives you the ability to search and filter. Best thrifting ever and easy to use app.,5
10434,Great!,5
10435,I love this site,5
10436,Very easy to navigate and check out,5
10437,"I love the app except for the fact that you can't buy stuff with a sale coupon code and use your reward points for free shipping on the same order. You can either get stuff for sale OR use a free shipping code...not both. The app itself is very easy to use, you can save searches for different things and when new items that fit your saves queries are added, you get a notification.",4
10438,Excellante,5
10439,Haven't been distracted yet 😁,4
10440,Just amazing whole family loves this site and so does everyone I've referred to it.,5

10450,"I ordered a purse, very good condition, but it wasn't cleaned out. There were cookie crumbs, cotton balls, gum wrapper, and rubber bands in the pockets. If you have time to throw your own tag on a product, at least make sure the pockets are empty please.",4
10451,Enjoying the discounts! And great items,5
10452,"I love shopping second hand! Sometimes you find things the brand doesn't even sell anymore! And, in my experience, for a lot less money then when it was on the rack",5
10453,Love it,5
10454,I have placed my order so excited for my shipment to arrive.. will do another review once my clothes & shoes arrive..,5
10455,Great communication and social media presence. Cleaning out my closet has never been easier.,5
10456,The quality of everything I've ordered is in amazing condition. App is user friendly and u can't beat the prices. Most of all... I love and totally support ur mission statement and company concept! Thank u!🤗,5
10457,So far I am really happy with this site. I love everything I have ordered on this site and everything is in really good condition. I will definitely be shopping here more often,5
10458,This company doesn't respond to answer specific questions such as. Did you receive my bundle question. I am waiting over 3 months for a reply. Also. Can't talk to a real person.,1
10459,"I love thredup. I use the app all the time, especially now.",5
10460,Good 👍,5
10461,Love it! Was nervous at first but am really enjoying shopping this way!,5

10464,I like the app its user friendly!,5
10465,Great,5
10466,"You can't cash out on the app. Very inconvenient, I spent so much time contacting the customer support because the app would not allow me to cash out.",1
10467,Cool way to shop,5
10468,So much fun and so easy...,5
10469,I love thred up! I have never gotten anything that wasnt in near new condition and the prices are unbeatable. If youre someone who i'snt a fan of going to real life clothes stores but likes retail prices its perfect.,5
10470,"Great app, I'm a little addicted though!",5
10471,I love shopping on thredup when i am looking for a older piece i can find them here and great prices.,5
10472,Was easy to find what i was looking for,5
10473,"I love Thred Up! I've purchased several items over the past few months and like the process a lot. I found great pieces for way less than I would have if I bought new. Some were even ""new with tags"" and hadn't been worn! I like the easy return process for the items I didn't like. The only issue I've had was the app not letting me log in without having to uninstall and reinstall.",4
10474,Its like thrift shopping but online,5
10475,I can't use an older version of the app and I also can't download the new version. It gets stuck around 40% whether I use wifi or my data plan.,1
10476,I have found amazing clothes on this app... however I will order something and the inseam will be completely wrong. I ordered a children's small shirt for my daughter. It arrived and was an adult small. Luckily that's my size so I was able to keep it. Many of the clothes have exceeded my expectations. I am a thredup junkie.,3
10477,Very easy to use,4
10478,"Simple, easy to use. If you shop Thredup at all, you should get the app.",5
10479,Great sales and fun games. Great quality for choosing used. I love getting name brand clothes for a fraction of the price!,5
10480,"I love ThredUp so much, I've gotten so much cute stuff already! I just wish they didn't use FedEx to deliver the clothes because the FedEx service is absolutely terrible in my area... They're always at least a day or 2 late from the estimated delivery day...",5
10481,App crashes at least twice daily for me. This has been a problem for a least the past 2 months. I'm also logged out every time it opens,3
10482,Highly recommend I place order and about two or 3 weeks later in arrives at my house. Of course different prices but when they have sales it's great deal. Be on the lookout for the sales and outfits your buying. Great quantity clothes and pls enjoy the clothes.😁,5
10483,Easy to use and search. Accurate descriptions.,5
10484,Thread up is the best thing ever happen two online shopping,5
10485,Me like!,1
10486,"Generally good but the auto-buy feature does not show up in my app and the ""in someone's cart"" filter doesn't appear to work properly. I also wish they offered more measurements on some pieces. Other than that no complaints. Great selection and quality.",4
10487,Easy to use and great customer service ☺️,5
10488,"I love this app!! Such a great way to reduce, reuse and recycle!",5

10511,Tried to update won't let me tried again and again finally I am giving up keep your old worn clothes it's not that serious to me. But those who it might be just don't even try skip it and go to Amazon,1

10534,Its great,5
10535,Wonderful,5
10536,Forcing a person to update an app in order to use it is wrong,2

10542,Great,5
10543,Not easy to navigate; needs improvement,2
10544,"HUGE selection of high quality clothing at thrift store prices without the ridiculous shipping fees (I'm looking at you, Poshmark)",5
10545,Great prices and great variety,5
10546,Great app,5
10547,It's not easy. Not easy to drill down to your choices.,2
10548,"USED TO.. Love, loVE, LOVE this app! NOW..I only like it...okay i still love it..but not as much. When i first became a customer i was instantly hooked by the cool teal polkadot tissue paper and the unbelievable volume of clothing you could choose from. And i am still in love with those things, but the prices seem to have gone up recently and i have noticed on every order lately, i am being overcharged .... just adding up the items BEFORE taxes and rounding UP gives me a lesser figure!! Wth?",4
10549,it's alright,5
10550,Way Too Expensive for cheap and used clothing,2
10551,New 1st time npt look yet,1
10552,I love thredup. I love the goody boxes!,5
10553,Exceptional products and services thanks for a reliable online merchant to shop from,5
10554,I love thredup. Great bargain and access to so many things! I purchase almost every month. I wish the outlet section had a local warehouse filter so my shipments don't travel so far. Would also like to be able to filter out synthetic clothing. The material filter dosen't work accurately. Downside to the latest app update locks me out of my account. Hoping uninstalling and changing my pw will fix this issue.,4
10555,"I love Thred Up!!!!! I have bought clothes from ThredUp, and i love them!!!! I bought a dress for my son's wedding, i love my dress! I will be looking for a dress for my daughter's wedding for next year! Thank you ThredUp employees!!!!",5
10556,I love thredup but with the new update I lost a coupon that I had in my account for 35% off for my next order. Very disappointed.,4
10557,"I just placed my first order, I haven't got it yet, but I like the diversity of the clothes & cost, I wish that u could organize your favorites into different wish list, jeans, tops, dress up, sale, kids, etc. 😁, Update: Clothes showed up fast! Everything fit well & the Jeans are now my Favorite jeans! thanks thred up!😋",4
10558,Thread up is awesome! The app works great and I have had nothing but a positive experience both using the app and ordering from the company! Thanks!,5
10559,Love this app.,5
10560,"Prices have gone up to retail price for used clothes. App has become glitchy, It wont allow me to favorite an item sometimes. Even though the item is still available. No mens clothes, I emailed support and they said that could be a possibility in the future however I read a redit forum from 2014 stating the same thing!",3
10561,Love this app,5
10562,"I love the variety of styles, the convenience, and the price of items on the site. Everything I've gotten has fit beautifully. My only criticism would be not enough of a description on some items, especially jewelry, no size on necklaces, and some of the clothing has no description on what type of material it is.",5
10563,"If you are too lazy to drop off your load of clothes to Goodwill this is the next best thing. They give you almost no money for your clothes so it is practically a donation anyway. The app is only user friendly if you are a customer because I've had technical difficulties with this app since day 1 as a seller. The app crashes, logs out , the way everything pans out eh. There are definitely better apps ,but if you are looking to thrift from home, not sell anything ,it's chill.",3
10564,Too slow,3
10565,I like shopping,5
10566,Always great,5
10567,I love the idea of second hand shopping but why not sell mens clothing too,3
10568,Love it! Love it! Love it!❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
10569,Great ! Love the shopping . Love the sizes.,5
10570,"Wonderful business and app! Shopping for any size wallet and delivery within a totally reasonable time frame, and you can opt in for delivery notifications to boot!",5

10575,Addictive!!!! Love them!!!,5
10576,"I can never get into the seller section to readjust my consignment items when time is running out. When purchasing, I have had the wrong item sent to me and 1 item was marked unavailable after I paid for it .",3

10592,addictded badley,5
10593,"Lots of issues. Randomly tells me an item is no longer available although I haven't selected anything. Pops up saying I need to download the latest app since the current is not supported, so I click the button that directs me to google play, which in turn tells me I am up to date with the latest version. What gives?!",2
10594,What Ive bought was great. I would love more info. Length is important. Im very tall. Material.,3

10601,Horrible app...keeps asking to log on...it never asked that until recently,1
10602,I love this app,5
10603,Hard pass on any shopping site that doesn't allow product browsing without signing up and also has a terms and conditions that you auto agree to by signing up. You want me to give you all MY personal info (which you get from linking into those other sign in options) before I get to see your products? You gotta be joking.,1
10604,Love it! Neat & organized & easy to browse & shop. The prices are resonable anyone can buy no matter what budgey ur on. The variety is incredible & shipping is super fast. I should do a commercial Im telling everyone about the site anyway. Enjoy shopping !!!,5

10617,Horrible to navigate cant find anything I'm looking for trying to get customer service is a joke.,2
10618,"EDIT: Now with the new update the app signs me out every time I exit and attempt to reopen. EDIT: I can't see any merchandise since the 10/10 update. Customer service is looking into it. Some glitches.. searches for maternity clothes yields lots (up to half) of search results of non-maternity clothes. I also miss having ""favorite brands"" as an option.",2
10619,Wonderful app,5
10620,if you can provide the kids with clothes and shoes and provides third-party was clothes and shoes the woman's and provide me with sports and shoes for shoes and sports clothes I would appreciate it I don't have no money to pay for that but I promise you I'll pay for it when I get some money 💰🙂😉😜☺️😉🤣☺️,5

10630,Excellent pants . Wonderful deal. Loved it. Will buy again.,5
10631,I am hooked! Great prices on everything. Especially high end designers.,5
10632,"We like everything about the app and service, but the one minor annoyance is that once you ""like"" an item it doesn't allow you to remove it. When buying shoes we would appreciate pictures of the bottom of the shoe as well.",5
10633,They already know the sizes are wrong. This has been going on since I have shipped with you. AN i am sick an tired of it an wasting my time.,2

10643,I wish that using the phone''s back button (which is instinctive) didn't clear where I am browsing in the app. Takes me a lot of time to go back in and find my place.,4
10644,Great app! Easy to navigate,5
10645,"I love Thred Up!!! I'm getting such great deals on name brand clothes that I love; such as Abercrombie, Aeropostale & Victoria Secret! They may be gently used with minor wear, still in Great shape... so I don't care 🥰",5

10650,Why am I suddenly having an issue with viewing my selling bundles? Everytime I try to check on the items in the sell number it directs me to the home window and tries to get me to sign in and says FB is having errors despite me being signed in with that. And when I try to sign in normally it says try wirh fb. So what on earth is going on with this app?,1

10659,I adore this app! Prices are good 👍 What I really want to see are Goody Boxes that I can personalize to my kids! That's something I've never seen anyone do is goody boxes for kids. Pleaseeeee and then 5 star review,4
10660,I love thred up but it is difficult to locate your selling kits to update prices on the app.,4
10661,Love this shop easy site to use and such a wide variety for everyones type,5
10662,Way too expensive for thrift store clothes. I can get new clothes cheaper at TJ MAXX or Marshall's or platos closet or Ross or Burlington. Not impressed,1
10663,"Well, i deleted previous reviews, now I'm a seasoned thred up customer, and a few things ppl should know. #1 customer service is almost non-existent I have accidentally ordered a cart full of things while phone was in my pocket, and i panicked, looked everywhere for a # to call, there is none. It says 'chat w us' ya well, they don't mean that. You can email their 'customer service' but don't hold your breath, cuz it'll be a few days at least before they send you even a generic respon",1
10664,Best prices! Most descriptions are accurate! I just wish there was a way to ask questions about it! I've loved most of what I've purchased! Deals and specials make the purchases even better!,4
10665,Good app Easy to shop,5
10666,Love the clothes,5
10667,Love everything I have bought!!! :),5
10668,App Problems!!!! Love Thredup! I can't get into my selling logs to reclaim my items.. Pls Help!,4
10669,"There are things I don't like about your app. 1. I wish I could filter in my favorites as sometimes I only want to see skirts. 2. I love the sold see similar, but many of the suggested are not remotely close to my size or in the same style as the sold item. 3. I wish I could set sizes per clothes type. I wear a large in tops but large/xlarge in blazers. 4. I wish i could block a material by item. I HATE polyester in shirts, but ok w/blends in bottoms. I want to buy. Make it easy for me!",4
10670,"I would like to give a higher rating, but the app is super glitchy! I have attempted to order goody boxes and just pieces on their own, but it keeps making me re-enter ALL of my info multiple times and will not allow me to check out! The items that I complete on the BINGO card do not save, things keep showing up in my favorites that I did not put there, and the app will send me back to the home page in the middle of doing something else! Very frustrating.",2
10671,"Easy to use, easy to understand",5
10672,"Good descriptions, easy returns, and I love trading my old clothes for new ones!",5
10673,Find fashion at great prices,5
10674,I ordered a pair of jeans and a pair of shorts im a size 20 and im so happy with the clothes because they actually fit they arent big or to tight around the stomach and it covers the fat i feel good in them and i am happy with the prices and everything was worth it,5
10675,Easy to use & fun to browse!,5
10676,"All items purchased has been pleasing! I love thrifting, to have online access is awesome 👌",5
10677,"The best online secondhand store. When I can't get to my local thrift and consignment stores, this is a great alternative. Some of the sizing measurements seem a bit inconsistent, especially in the chest measurements, but the return policy is fairly generous so I'm okay with taking the occasional gamble.",5
10678,Wonderful second hand clothes that are very well taken care of...almost look brand new! Excellent prices as well!,5
10679,"So much fun!!! A bit pricy sometimes, but it can be avoided",4
10680,"I cleaned out my closet and sent the two large bags of very nice, clean items MONTHS ago, and I understand they may be swamped right now but now I want my stuff back so I can sell it myself on another platform. DO NOT send them your stuff, better off just putting it on your stoop for your neighbors.",2
10681,"Love this shopping, so addicted to this app",5
10682,App would not open. Tried a few times. Nothing.,1
10683,Great,5
10684,"Amazing treasure hunts and deals! Only improvement would be to create more specific search parameters to narrow down items people are looking for. Also, please allow ""skirts with pockets"" and ""suspenders"" to be searchable words. Also sleeve styles need to added to the filter. If people were able to quickly find more items they are looking for we'd all spend a lot more money! Help us give you our money! Some people find the site too time consuming and lose interest which is a bummer.",4
10685,Wonderful platform to buy & sell,5
10686,Love it,5
10687,Absolutely addicted!,5
10688,"I love this site, I've bought off of here many times and love most of the items but there is room for improvement. The filtering system is great, it would just be nice to be able to filter categories out instead of just categories to include. The only other thing is that I wish they would suggest things for you specifically, or had a dash of clothes you've tagged adjectives of to scroll through, I'd spend even more time on here. I love this site, I just wish they'd do more",4
10689,Thread up is thumbs up!!!!!! Love love you guys!!! You make a poor person able to feel good about their clothes and have a standard at a resonable cost.,5
10690,"The new update on this app is terrible. Every time I try to use it, it forces me to re-log in. Then it tells me my password is incorrect so I have to keep changing it. On top of that, I have to do several ""select the photos"" security checks. I just want to look at my kits, but I have to jump through hoops just to get into my own account.",1
10691,Absolutely fabulous service!! I will never go to another department store again!!!! Great job and very impressive.,5
10692,I've been able to purchase several designer items at considerably lower prices.,5
10693,Love this app!,5
10694,"Great app for shopping second hand. The prices are ok, having a coupon is everything.",5
10695,I originally wrote that I love this store and I did however the service has gone way down.. I ordered a pair of bathing suit bottoms and per My account they were shipped however they were not.. There was no notice in my notifications that they found a flaw and was not going to ship them. . I wasn't notified until I emailed them. I should have been notified when they found the issue and given the chance to order something similar. Not sure I'll be doing much shopping here anymore,2
10696,I LOVE thredUP!,4
10697,I absolutely love thred up,5
10698,Love the deals and that it is environmentally friendly!,5
10699,Your customer service sucks and your a RIP OFF! You don't honor your coupon codes and response time sucks too. I am no longer your customer.,1
10700,Havent tried that one yet,2
10701,"Good app, it would be nice when i apply a size filter all other sizes don't show up. I try to filter for size 7/8 and i'm getting 4t clothes.",4
10702,Love everything about this. The only way I might add onto the experience would be to have the ability to sort your favorites in various ways.,5
10703,"I would give the app a higher rating if it weren't for one big issue. For the past 2 weeks I haven't been able to access the section where you view the items you are selling. I keep getting errors for ""too many redirects."" I can see the cash out amount, but not the individual items I have listed. It's easy to shop on here, but the selling section is glitchy.",3
10704,"Nothing for men, pretty sexist but it's agaisnt men so it's okay",1
10705,Great place for clothing,5
10706,Everytime I try to look at items that have sold or cash it it takes me too the website to login. Then I can't login ever. Never had issues before. Uninstalled and reinstalled same issues.,3
10707,"Everyone should be doing it! Everything overbought has been in exceptional shape! I can't believe it's used! The free shipping is fast! They say 7 to 10 business days, it's always way earlier! Your also helping the environment! It's a win all the way around! Prices to, any wheel you can get 200$ Jean's for 15 to 39$ it's a steel! Look brand new, lots of stuff is but used stuff has yet to look used in 6 orders! Love love love ThredUp!!",5
10708,Love it!,5
10709,I can't get my money back to my card after I return my order,1
10710,Always find nice clothes for my children and my myself. Great prices. Love that you can earn points towards coupons. Thrift from home!,5
10711,Too expensive for used clothes,2
10712,I like this app makes shopping easier at the tips of my fingers anywhere I go.,5
10713,Just one click to great buys!,5
10714,This was a waste of time I put in filters and they did nothing at all thousands of items but 95% didn't apply to what I needed at all.,1
10715,No assistance. TON of emails and I have been unsubscribed for months,1
10716,Lots of great brands for discount and the clothing is in excellent condition!!! My new favorite shopping app!!,5
10717,"My items have been as described, shipping is fast, and you guys have great deals and specials keep up the good work and thank you! :-) also your user interface is easier than a lot that I've tried",5
10718,The clothes great shape but the goody box charged too much it was $36.00 before it went up to 302. Dollars before I even knew it.,1
10719,You guys are so addictive in the last two months ive placed 5 orders. And i love the shipping.,5
10720,To many nice things to pick from!,5
10721,"I LOVE this app!!!! My husband, however, not so much 💁🤣",5
10722,"I love this app so much, literally the only thing I would change is being able to search a specific item, so far you can only search brand name??",4
10723,Super convenient and easy to navigate.,5
10724,"Sexist app, Sexist company, not for men. Wont recommend to anyone.",1
10725,I always find things I love at great prices!!,5
10726,"I've been buying, selling, and donating clothes on here for years for myself and my son. Absolutely best way to do it. It makes it so easy and convenient and helping our planet! Love ThredUp!",5
10727,They are awesome!,5
10728,Love this whole thing! Easy to use and shop. (Maybe too easy!) 😆,5
10729,Love it!!,5
10730,"Once all is said and done, the foundational elements of a successful business are very simple: respect, service, value and sales. This company is AWESOME 😍",5
10731,Great! Fun choices,5
10732,So far I love the options. I haven't made a purchase yet. But I would like to see the option to un like something. Take a item out of the favorites by hitting the heart. Also if something is sold that is in my favorites it should be deleted and not show up.,5
10733,"Annoying harassing loud obnoxious stupid popups about contests, etc. Uninstalling.",1
10734,I love this place. They have great items and even better prices. I cant believe i paid even regular sale prices for DG2 jeans at retail stores when i got better ones here for $10. Any issues or questions were resolved promptly. Youve got a lifelong customer in me! The only thing i didnt experience was selling off my old stuff. I had it all ready to go but being a procrastinater i ended up at the donation place instead of the post office. Oh well. There will be more im sure! Take a chance.,5
10735,way overpriced for thrift,1
10736,"Love all they have to offer on this app, everything is in great condition if it's not new and amazingly priced!",5
10737,"Love Thred Up, such a great and easy way to shop and get great deals!",5
10738,"Fast shipping, great items and no hassle returns. Love this app!",5
10739,Love the app! I have found so much on this app and i have never had any issues with their condition. Everything ships quickly as well,5
10740,Everything I have purchased has been in the condition advertised. Please read the description on items as sizes vary frim one manufacturer to another.,4
10741,App doesn't work anymore. Glitches and can't sign in with Amazon. Frustrating!!,1
10742,Great,5
10743,Love,5
10744,"Love shopping Thread Up,but the app needs work.It closes its self out constantly",3
10745,I get what I order at a Great Price. Most are name brand. I told alot of people about Thredup.,5
10746,"Started using this app to buy maternity clothes when I was pregnant and I got hooked! Always a great variety of selection and value, high-end designers too. The app has endless filtering options and I love that it tells me if someone else is eyeing my favorite items.",5
10747,Great quality deals,5
10748,"My app wont open, hasn't worked for a week. I uninstalled it and reinstalled but no luck",1
10749,"Clothes expensive, almost the same price as at the store and it has already been used. Don't like that some of the clothes looks poorly. Definitely not worth the $ that they're asking for.",2
10750,"I love ThredUP for the awesome selection I can't find locally, for the great deals I get, and the customer service. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for these reasons: The app crashes occasionally or won't close. They sell cutoffs for shorts. They sell a fantastic variety of brands, but also sell Wal-Mart stuff. I have had returns take almost three weeks to ship and process. I bought a skirt that was described as having a minor stain. It was a large bleach spot.",4
10751,I love this thrift store so easy in every way,5
10752,I enjoy the shopping experience aswell as the consignment cleanup bags.,5
10753,"Amazing prices for gently used and like-new clothes! Thorough descriptions on each item including condition, materials, and measurements. I love that I can set it to only search my sizes automatically!",5
10754,Love this app. Love shopping from my phone!,5
10755,Bomb,5
10756,"thredUP has pretty good prices, the packages arrive in a timely fashion and the packaging is super cute.",5
10757,They don't have a men's section at all. It was very disappointing.,1
10758,"The app is incredibly glitchy. The item descriptions have become increasingly inaccurate; i have received items that were the wrong size, fit/rise, and color. Also, the prices for children's items have drastically increased since the app's inception. I can often buy items new for the same price or even less. After I receive a credit for yet another return (inaccurate description) I will be deleting.",1
10759,I love shopping this way and such great deals on name brand clothes. This is every woman's dream. This is where I will continue shopping.,5
10760,"Super easy to find, sort and choose your favorite things.... Awesomely easy to navigate!",5
10761,Never used,3
10762,Love this site. All the stores in my town are closing so ThredUp is a great substitute!,5
10763,"I've bought 4 pair of Levi's for less than 20.00 each, and they look brand new. I'm getting points for each order, so soon I will get free shipping.",5
10764,I am addicted to this app!!! Love it. Wish there were more jewelry options but I love this app and have told family and friends about it!!!,5
10765,"As a seller, after this update i can't acces my kits. I can't see what has sold and my money is being held hostage.",1
10766,Love it,5
10767,"I love the detailed search filters and the ability to save searches. I've received 3 items and they were all in great condition. One dress was much shorter than knee length, despite the description, but it was just so cute that I kept it anyway. Plus, I should have paid more attention to the length measurement provided. I love being able to shop secondhand so I can save money and avoid contributing to the problematic fast fashion industry.",5
10768,I love the clothes on this app but giving them clothes to sell and only getting about 10% of the profits isn't fair.,2
10769,Many of the clothes appear to be dingy for the price.,2
10770,Super fun.,5
10771,"Wow!! All my orders are super cute, excellent quality and nicely wrapped! The sizes are correct as listed so pay attention and use tape measure before you order.. I got my stuff so fast, I was surprised!! This will be my go to store!! No more going to stores to search all day and sometimes find nothing and then to stand in long lines when I do.. Update: The app is very user friendly. I really enjoy shopping on my couch but need more time to search and keep items in the cart. So much nice stuff..",5
10772,"I love ThredUp! I'm on the app everyday, I've found amazing deals on brands I love. I also, so appreciate the referral and rewards program! Getting rewarded for shopping and then being able to shop more with my reward or referral points is fabulous!",5
10773,Every order has been great. Glad I came across site. Excellent,5
10774,love this app!! If your looking for freat quality name brand clothes but for half the price? You need this app ! Plus you can resell your old clothes!! In with the new out with the old!,5
10775,Great clothing great prices 👍,5
10776,"Terrible, Terrible business structure. They are the one making the big buck for your money. Selling your items for example a $16.99 item you get paid $1.70🤮 and customers has 60 days to return item, someone is probably wearing your high end item going around for 2 months and then they can return it and get their money back. Will not recommend this business to anybody. I love Mercari, Offerup, eBay, Letgo, poshmat and any other, even local consignment shops. I like to be in control.",1
10777,only sells 'christian girl autumn' style,2
10778,Affordable and Nice Clothing!,5
10779,Very difficult app not informative at all,1
10780,"Easy to use, lots of filter options for searches, good selection for my size (medium). Decently quick shipping with minimal packaging. Just sent out my first box to sell, we'll see how that goes.",5
10781,"I really like Thred Up. But they ask me to give them a five star review every few weeks and it's annoying, since I've posted my review several times. I've been happy with the clothes I've bought. Quality was only questionable once. Watch their pricing... Sometimes it's way off. Also, sometimes the descriptions on their clothes is puzzling and even laughable. At least someone there doesn't understand what ""ruching"" or ""color blocking"" is. And PLEASE Thred Up: MEASURE YOUR BELTS.",4
10782,"Easy to use to clean out your closet of things you no longer wear to replace with new to you items. Great way to find specific items at an affordable price. Easy and convenient shopping, shipping, and returns.",5
10783,Easy to navigate and reasonable prices,5
10784,Made me long to be in Paris.,4
10785,"Love it! I am ""older"" (56) as far as newer technology goes. This app is very user friendly. As far as sizing? I typically go with the brands that I know the fit, having purchased in-store prior to shopping on-line. I am 5'1"", 118 lbs, typically wearing x-small to small depending on the brand. I love that I am helping the environment by purchasing items no longer wanted by others!",5
10786,Update. This company is getting better. Found items looked for easily. User-friendly for old people. Still not great on measuring items though. I recommend!,4
10787,"Simple, easy, and budget friendly! Loved the experience of using thredUP!",5
10788,Love Thred Up,5
10789,Awesome deals,5
10790,"Don't do it. If you're just looking for the easiest way to get rid of clothes, donate them. If you want any money - like any at all - do PoshMark. I sent in three bags, absolutely stuffed full of JCrew, Madewell, Ann Taylor, Theory, Zara... all in great condition. I got $10. Two things sold, one was a pair of Madewell jeans which I got $7.80 for.",1
10791,Way more expensive than their ads leave you to believe.,2
10792,Love this site!,5
10793,"Really awesome! So fun to shop. My only nitpick is that I wish the Favorites could be filtered, too.",4
10794,I love it!!!!,5
10795,Too many glitches,3
10796,Amazing,5
10797,My favorite place to buy clothes!,5
10798,Absolutely love it! Easy to use and a lot of items to choose from. Great brand names cheap.,5
10799,I've ordered a few times and loved everything I've received! The app is super easy to use and the search filters are as specific as you could ever need!,5
10800,"UPDATE: Response to developer's inattentive, dismissive reply: 1. I did NOT say I was unable to find what I was looking for. 2. I'm well aware wrinkles come out when laundered. Duh Given the volume of clothing received, I absolutely doubt the majority arrive looking that way. I was looking @ clothes for my 5 yo son & approx 90% of long & short sleeve & button up polo style shirts look to be dug out of the bottom of dirty clothes pile/hamper. I do not understand the lack of presentation effort.",2
10801,Love the name brand items.,5
10802,"Great selection, poor search engine: Love the variety on this site, and prices are awesome. But the search engine is really lacking, and leaves the shopping experience disorganized..suggestions: style categories(boho, punk, classy etc.) Key words(layers,lace, text, etc.) Sort by: most favorited, most viewed. *amended* : just received my first purchase and I LOVE it, +1 star for the sweet booklet, and thoughtful packaging, worth the time spent.",4
10803,Never had any problems. Items arrive very quick and are in good shape.,5
10804,"A very user friendly app. Easy to apply sorting and specially filters. Love the fact that let you save your sizes, so you can see what is available in your size.",5
10805,Didn't know where to go for coupons,5
10806,"I have been using thred up for many years when we used to mail in toys and i have never had one bad thing to say.I would tell all my friends about it but the last few times i have ordered, from here they have become very rundowm. This last order i recieved was horrible. The hoodie victoria secret had so many lint balls on it and both items were faded. They were both on clearance and unreturnable. I dont kno if ill be going back here",2
10807,Love the prices and selection keep up the good work!,5
10808,"Very user friendly app. Great job UI team! Also I never have issues with transactions, nothing freezes ever, excellent job on back-end too. One thing that's off is when it offers you what to wear/match the product with. E.g. I get a coat, and it shows me it goes with some summer pants and sandals or smth like that. Your Ai in terms of recommendations sucks. I never rely on it though, don't need style tips, so it doesn't influence my shopping experience, just funny to see it.",5
10809,Love,5
10810,Takes over a month to process clothes I guess.,1
10811,Too expensive for used clothes u better off going to the high end clothing stores and going Thur the clearance items that's on sale.,3
10812,"Great value, unlimited variety, and excellent customer service!! Orders come quickly and in great condition! Packaging offers easy return process!",5
10813,I'm very happy to been shopping this way thank you Thed Up,5
10814,Easy and quick to use,5
10815,I love ThredUp. The app is easy to use and has a great search feature.,5
10816,Experience is great.,4
10817,💝,5
10818,I haven't shopped in a long time due to uncontrollable circumstances! I was glad to see the new reward system and shipping options! Still wonderful items at wonderful prices! I can't wait to receive my shipment.,5
10819,So easy to use. My only wish is that I could more easily access items open for bids on the app like on the desktop.,5
10820,"I used to love to purchase clothes from thredup, but recently I've found that their measurements are frequently very far off and it becomes more of a hassle than it's worth if you have to return every order. I have ordered several pairs of jeans and the listed length measurements have been off by more than 3 inches. That is a huge discrepancy.",2
10821,I like thrifting and enjoy the app and discounts they offer...points add up and it is relatively easy to return items.,4
10822,"Took way to long and confusing, i need a phone number; so that i can speak with you by phone about why you did not accept the pair of Vince Camuto pink suede pumps i sent Thred up too sell and to return to me if not accepted ( they we're never worn. Why? did you not accept them?",1
10823,One of my most used apps!,5
10824,I love everything I get,5
10825,Love it. Easy quick and cheap!,5
10826,I like using the app its so easy to shop and find what you need but some things are just way over priced in my opinion,5
10827,"Prompts you to redeem ""points"" but then you have to pay higher amount for items?!? Now points can't be credited back to account, even though I am not going to make a purchase because I will not be purchasing items for more than advertised cost because they are a cheap company that pushed to redeem reward points but then removed 20% off coupon from order",1
10828,"Love the app and saving favorite searches, but I can no loner unmark favorite items. My list is crazy long! Please help.",3
10829,I love the quality of their products. You receive items quick. And they are reasonable.,5
10830,Loved the whole experience. Would recommend this app.,5
10831,Makes shopping fun and inexpensive. I love everything that I've ordered,5
10832,"This is the best way to shop during quarantine, period. 1. Everything is pre-purchased so you are being kind(er) to mother earth than buying new. 2. If you don't like something you can return it no problem. 3. Everything is so cute, and they are adding new stuff literally every minute.",5
10833,I love thred up! The only thing I can say is make sure you buy something when you see it because it could be gone the next day😂,5
10834,So many great finds at great prices!,5
10835,Love!,5
10836,What a rip-off. I'm not sure why anyone would order from here. Their prices are outrageous for second hand clothing. Some of the things I've seen are cheaper brand new. You're better off buying from poshmark from an actual seller. Whoever created this is definitely taking advantage. Uninstalling.,1
10837,"I love this app! Really cute clothes, and the way your able to sort everything is very useful. I've bought quite a bit from this app already. Everything comes well packaged and in a timely manner.",5
10838,"I used to be able to log in with my Amazon credentials and that option disappeared from the app. This company also failed to ship a significant order from their Arizona warehouse, said they ""lost it"". Because of this, I have since gone to another platform for my shopping needs.",1
10839,I'd like to have a link to search by brand from the item page as on the website. Also suggestions of similar items to be my size or don't exist at all. Overall good and useful app,3
10840,"Easy and affordable buying experience, but app glitches often and fixes are far and few. The ""Shop Similar"" and ""You may also like"" sections are great ideas but only work occasionally. Currently you're only able to favorite, but not unfavorite, items, rendering the ""Favorites"" section more like a frustrating ""view history"" section. It's the biggest reason I don't really use the app anymore, but I come back every so often in hopes of a fix. Been waiting maybe 6 weeks for this fix.",3
10841,Fun way to shop for used clothes. Lots of rewards too!,4
10842,Customer Service needs to improve,2
10843,Wanted to log in thru Facebook. You wanted my email...no spam. No thanks,1
10844,Great way to buy second hand!,5
10845,Love this store,5
10846,excellent site. fun - love the premium merchandise - chat support is virtually useless. They really need phone customer support.,5
10847,I love ThreadUp,5
10848,"Amazing app!! Great, low prices for name brand clothing. They even have a donation option and you can even send your ""newish/old"" brand name clothes in for them to sell for you. Hasslefree!!",5
10849,"I absolutely love ThredUP!!! I especially love the bundling and Goody box features. I can easily shop for items, bundle and ship in a week. Earning points while shopping is a definite plus.",5
10850,Sent clean out bag in June still nothing. Now I see it takes 16 weeks to get credit. Really? Wish I had not sent now. App not clear🙄,2
10851,Always good finds.,5
10852,I am absolutely in love with thredup and just making my sixth happily pleased order and cannot wait two again receive second hand clothing that looks like it had been tailored so incredible these items have no where it seems like they are all brand new. My experience has been for real great on all angles fitting description wise timely shipping has always been even earlier and keeping me ordering second hand not having to go to the mall and also I'm cleaning out my closet,5
10853,Keeps crashing,1
10854,I'm not paying 20$ plus for second hand items..,2
10855,"Hell yeah, this app really helps me develope my style without the stress or limitations of in person shopping",5
10856,works different,4
10857,The best,5
10858,"I use my email to log in. Every time I pull up the app, it forces me to use Facebook and I can't log in using my email.",1
10859,"I had to delete my previous 2 star reviw so that I could post this one. No matter. Thred up never replied to my concerns anyway. This morning I was looking for a dress. I know they go quickly, but I didn't want to look at dresses already on someone elses basket. I set my filters accordingly, but it didn't make any difference. I gave up, completely frustrated and went to Poshmark. So sad that Thred up isn't what it used to be - a great place to get inexpensive clothes and have a good time.",1
10860,Jean's experience was fit perfectly!! Jackets and skirts n tops beautifully fitted!! Shopping your store is my best ever shopping store!!! Thank you.,5
10861,Amazing quality and fast and reliable service,5
10862,I love thredup!,5
10863,"Love this app. However at the moment i can't login I'm getting a server error. My wifi is fine, is there maintenance going on with the app?",4
10864,I love being able to find clothes I love with out paying full price!,4
10865,Great deals plus coupon code use equals a wonderful experience.,5
10866,"This is my new favorite app for buying clothes for me and my 3yr old grand daughter. Ive ordered 4 formal dresses for her and they all look brand new and they fit her perfectly. And ive loved all my items ive ordered for me too. Plus, we are helping save our enviroment too. Its a WIN WIN... YOU CANT LOSE. IF u loved platos closet and other consignment shops.... You will love thread up.",5
10867,"""problem connecting to server""... Doesn't work at all",1
10868,Terrible. They sell your clothes for super cheap prices and you make little to nothing.,1
10869,I like that thredUP especially 50% 40 % off. I got some nice blouse for $2.99. Nice clothes for under $10. I wish they posted more pictures of the items👍👍👍,5
10870,This is one expensive THRIFT shop 👎,1
10871,Great app - my only wish is for a men's and children's section!,5
10872,Awesome variety of clothes for everyone,5
10873,Love this app. Great selection. Easy to use.,5
10874,"Will not be buying from again. They charge way too much. They had a pair of Cat & Jack leggings for $9.99...Target sells them for $5-$6. Why pay double for used clothing when I could buy it for half the price new? Also, last order I made, the picture showed it in good condition but when I got it there was damage to the back of it. It was unwearable. Sizing is not accurate. With the restocking fee it makes it too risky. They should post pictures of the tag with the size.",1
10875,"Love this because it makes thrift shopping easy! The only thing that I think needs improving about the app is that you can't edit your search term, rather the search bar makes you retype everything.",4
10876,Love it,5
10877,Write,3
10878,Bad ass,5
10879,"I love the filter selection! I can filter by neckline, sleeve length, color, brand and dress length, to name a few!",5
10880,"App freezes and and needs to close often, but it is otherwise easy to use and convenient",4
10881,Love thred up!!,5
10882,Love the prices and it's fast and if something doesn't fit or anything like that it's so easy to send it back 😃,5
10883,Fix the app so you can remove things from your favorites list!,3
10884,Love Thread Up!,5
10885,"Absolutely love this store, I basically buy of my clothes through here! The only real complaint I have is that they don't have men's clothes.",4
10886,"I absolutely love Thred Up!! I buy 100% of my clothes & shoes from them! It's wonderful to go online & pick something out, pay for it & wait for it to come! Great prices & quality items! Check it out!! Enjoy!",5
10887,"Nice app, let's see how fast they ship the orders",5
10888,My favorite spot to shop for clothes online! A five star game changer for my closet.,5
10889,Love ThredUP!! Getting cute boho dresses that are hard to find!!,5
10890,Loved my first experience with thred up. My order came quickly and packaged nicely. I will order again,5
10891,"The website and company is great but the app lacks functionality and glitches out often. Last night I went to check out and an error popped up on the screen to say try again. I tried 3 more times and none went through HOWEVER it already put holds on my credit card. C'mon guys if you flub this so badly im not going to purchase from you anymore! Also i can't figure out how to permanently ""unheart"" an item. Many things have sold so theyre just cluttering that page.",2
10892,Sizing is horrible.,3
10893,Very good,5
10894,I have noticed while browsing that a number of listings have incorrect information or categorization or are styled sloppily on the mannequin. I'd be wary about listing items for sale just based on what I've seen. Just feels very rushed and disrespectful to the seller. It also doesn't appear there's a way to flag items for incorrect information.,3
10895,"The app is okay. Some features are easier to find on the website. They have a ""favorites"" feature that has been pretty buggy lately. I can save things to my favorites, but have been unable to un-favorite them which makes the shopping process harder.",4
10896,I love this app! It's my go to when I wanna shop online for clothing. I love that you can put in all your sizes and filter everything else out.,5
10897,"I really like this app but it really upsets me that there's no choice for mens clothes I can shop womens, girls and boys but not mens I don't know why and I hope that a mens choice will be added soon but other than that its a really good app",4
10898,"I only wish returns were free. I don't mind the restocking fee, but I don't like nine dollar return fees if you want your money back instead of store credit. Otherwise, I've found some great stuff",4
10899,"I love this app! The clothing selection is great, easy to navigate, and the customer service is really good. The only thing that I've noticed recently is that you can't unfavorite an item anymore. Other than that it's a great app!",5
10900,Love this! goodwill organized,5
10901,"I've never bought anything off this app, and I don;t plan on buying anything off this app.",3
10902,They don't have a men's section?? Deleting my account.,1
10903,"Customer service is the worst! I am a seller and it's very frustrating, send the same email for almost two weeks and nobody solve the problem yet. Just horrible customer service!",1
10904,I LOVE this app and company in general! Wish I could have some additional filters/ability to search for more specific items... but it's getting better all the time. <3,4
10905,"Great prices, easy to use and great selection. Love it!!",5
10906,"Pretty terrible. To demonstrate I picked a NWT Calvin Klein dress Thredup has listed for over $120. 1. It only has bust & length measurements so I don't know if it would fit my waist and hips. 2. Other than content there's no description of the fabric, is it stretchy, lightweight or thick fabric, is the dress lined? 3. TU only has two pics. 4. TU claims the retail price is $180, I own this dress, it retails for $120. 5. In just a couple minutes I the same dress on Poshmark NWT under $40.",1
10907,Great site. App is much more user friendly than the mobile site.,5
10908,It was a great experience!,5
10909,Great selection with great prices,5
10910,I love the clothes and shoes,5
10911,"Spent hours picking out over $300 worth of items and 2 days later was notified my order was cancelled. I think it was because my mother used my credit card on her account and it flagged it. If i had known that, i would have used a different payment method. Now it says all the items i picked out were sold so i cant even try again. No response from customer service and a huge waste of time.",1
10912,I actually deleted this app after having it for a day. It advertises that it saves a ton of money on top brands but I could get a better deal with a coupon on most of it. Do not recommend.,1
10913,Great app! Quality used clothes! Also you can earn money by selling your own used clothing and it's all super easy and free!,5
10914,"Not that great (for the seller), you can only make like $2 if you sell an item for like 19.99 which is insane and a rip off for the seller honestly. They can make there money but they shouldn't take over 50% of your money for your clothes :/. You can only get a decent amount of money if you sell something for like $200 (or high prices) cause you get 80% of the income so like & $160. Great if you're looking to buy though.",3
10915,"I like it , however i just wish we had more time to decide ro purchase that item in the cart",4
10916,Very professional and quick,5
10917,Exceptional. Great products. Reliable shipping and quality.,5
10918,I sold a few items on this site asked to be cashed out...and i have never seen my money Still waiting .. as of june 2020,1
10919,"I have lots of fun shopping, HUGE selection of clothes & shoes!",5
10920,Love this app it's my favorite,5
10921,I have ordered over 50 dresses...some jackets as well. I am addicted..,5
10922,"Such a great website to shop on! Great sales,, clothes, shoes, bags, and prices! Highly recommend this company.",5
10923,Great app.,5
10924,Great app and support!,5
10925,Love the prices,5
10926,Thredup is awesome their customer service is great and their clothes are amazing. I will definitely be recommending them to my friends and family. Keep up the good work,5
10927,Like,5
10928,"Love the app, but when I try to remove favorite items, it favorites them again. It's extremely annoying to look in my favorites and see many items that are sold. It wasn't always like that.",3
10929,Absolutely in love with this site!,5
10930,Best place to thrift shop! I love it!,5
10931,Love the under armour selection,5
10932,"ugly clothes,glad I never bought anything here,wouldn't even recommend it to my grandmother.",1
10933,Great For shopping,5
10934,Love this app.,5
10935,"I like ThredUp and the app is basically user friendly. I just really hate that there's no way to hide items that are already in someone else's cart. At least on the Pixel phones, even when I try to remove that from my search filters, I still get about 40-50% of items listed as in someone else's cart. Also, under sleeve length for tank tops, the results still show several items that are not in fact sleeveless. These are small annoyances but still, they're annoying.",4
10936,"Love, Love, Love.",5
10937,"Can no longer unlike items, even after updating. The app is practically unusable like this.",1
10938,Love this site.,5
10939,"Still haven't bought anything from them, but there's so much that I would love to have.",3
10940,"Great app love it, use it for many years, great customer service!",5
10941,Love buying and selling my gently used clothing thru this app.. My wardrobe is ever changing and growing with me..I never get tired of or have to wear the same worn out threds..love my thred up!!,5
10942,Easy app to use,5
10943,Love this app. So many cute clothes. And always can find good deals.,5
10944,Love it!,5
10945,"App is good for the most part. Sometimes freezes on certain screens, but overall is pretty useful.",4
10946,"Love this app! But, for some reason, after the last update, I am unable to ""unfavorite"" items and I don't know how to fix it.",5
10947,Very Easy to use.,5
10948,"I love ThredUp but I hate this app. It's constantly glitching or failing and the search feature is useless. The filters are often wrong, too. I think a lot of that may have to do with how the garments are being categorized or described--whatever the problem is it's very frustrating.",2
10949,Love it,5
10950,This ap is much easier to navigate than the website.,5
10951,Great site n prices so far.,4
10952,"Second hand clothes for designer prices. Absolutely astonished with the prices of the items I looked for. Some of these items were 10+ years old, no way is the fabric in that great a condition! Uninstalling!",2
10953,"I love this app! It makes it extremely easy to shop for my unique sizes. The feature of filtering by fabric type is also a wonderful option, one I don't see anywhere else with online shopping. The one and only flaw I see to this app is that it does not include men's clothing. I can shop for women, boys, and girls; but not men. Will you be adding this section to the app at all?",4
10954,"Thredup has solved my closet problems. I love thrifting, because I don't want to add to landfill, But it's hard find exactly what you're looking for in a store and you settle for what you can find. I end up donating most of what I thrift at a store. Enter thredup. Everything is clearly measured and easy to search for. If im looking to add a specific piece in my closet, I can narrow search and see 20 versions, pick 2-3, and simple return the ones that don't win. I love it!!",5
10955,Love it!,5
10956,"Love all the items I've ordered, but damn some off your prices on Harley clothing are higher then buying from dealer. Used sweaters for $100 or more terrible can buy new one for that.",4
10957,To expensive for second hand clothes,1
10958,"The clothes are in excellent condition, very happy with purchases",5
10959,Each order has arrived as expected and the quality of the clothing is impeccable! Will continue to use this app as often as possible. I will use this app before going shopping. ThredUp has everything I need!! Never been disappointed!,5
10960,You should not call this a thrift store with 300.for shoes . Some stuff is only a few dollars off . I will be uninstalling this over priced app. Try rose gal app better new n pluse size .,2
10961,"Well two of my items had holes in them when i recieved my first order .. they clearly state that they do not accept any item with a rip, tear, or hole so not too happy with that discrepancy, plus they are a tad bit pricy considering the clothes have holes in some of them .....",1
10962,"I like it pretty well. But I keep trying to change my sizes yet all my search results keep showing my old sizes. Literally want to stop seeing size 14 dresses when they're not selected for my search. Small thing, but it's annoying. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling, I still am unable to get rid of seeing that size.",3
10963,I mailed bags months ago and still no updates. I should have taken the stuff and donated it.,3
10964,"This app makes it so easy to browse, i love thredup!",5
10965,I am so glad I found this app. I'm finding great clothes and bags.,5
10966,Great!!!!!!!!!,5
10967,Fun to shop and great prices. Great filters and sorting options.,5
10968,"Wonderful! I love the site, very easy to use.",5
10969,This website is easy to use! I can search my favorite brands very easily,5
10970,"Thred up is truly amazing in my opinion they offer a variety of name brand clothing at extremely reasonable prices. They even offer options for you to buy new items with tags still attached, like new items etc. You can filter items by brand names, colors, sizes which make your shopping experience even better. They also have a reward program that helps eliminate shipping charges too. You can also return items as well. Check it out you won't be disappointed!",5
10971,"Always good deals,easy returns.",5
10972,I've been ordering from THREDUP just since this summer 2020. I love the app. The shopping is great and the variety of items is substantial.,5
10973,This app is sexiest why don't tredup sale mens clothes,1
10974,Love the ease of ordering and quality of everything I have gotten!!,5
10975,Love seeing new items all the time,5
10976,I've used ThredUp several times to buy clothes for work. Items have always arrived as advertised. I've been very happy with the experience.,5
10977,Pretty good app with lots of ways to search. I just wish they would add an exclude option and more waist sizes in size charts. Not everyone is a small size.,4
10978,Great possibilitys with this cool app! Love,4
10979,"Great, clean items and fast shipping. Highly recommend",5
10980,"This website has been awesome! I'm a college student on a low budget, and finding nice clothes for good prices is a breeze on ThredUp! So excited to show off my new outfits!",5
10981,Love this app and store,5
10982,Absolutely love this app.,5
10983,New Favorite App!,5
10984,"I was sceptical at first. You have to sign up before getting a peek at the goodies inside. I almost quit right then. So glad I didn't. Once you get started, put in your preferences and sizes it's simple and fun. The app shows only items that are in your size range. There are so many new items added every hour, I find myself popping on so I don't miss anything. I've purchased a couple items. The shipping isn't super fast, but reasonable. All items have been just as described.",5
10985,Please fix the glitch that doesn't allow you to successfully unfavorite items. This is getting very annoying and makes me want to shop elsewhere.,4
10986,"Fun, easy, no monthly fee!",5
10987,Very poor..i sent a fill bag of nice items to make a lil profit. Its been months and i havent recieved my items back nor has anthing been sold,1
10988,Great service.,5
10989,Great company! Makes my wardrobe better!,5
10990,I love thred up. I have bought several dresses and they are great! Everything is top quality and great prices!,5
10991,I love this app! It's a great way to thrift online and find items you're looking for without having to support fast fashion companies would 10/10 recommend!,5
10992,I left a review stating that the app won't allow me to un-favorite items I've added to Favorites. They were very responsive and said the issue was resolved in only two days. I updated the app today and I still can't remove items from Favorites. Try again please! It's still not working! Thank you for the quick response!,3
10993,Sent clothing in May and have not heard anything from them. RIP off company. Can't contact them.,1
10994,"I tried downloading this app and it wouldn't let me open it. I tried a few more times, tried closing the app and reopening it, and even uninstalled and reinstalled, still won't open up.",1
10995,"I like that you can scroll forever in the app (vs. Needing to select the next page on the web version). I don't like that when I'm using my saved searches (I have ~15 saved), I often won't be able to see the searches that are near the bottom of my list (after approx. #8) Sometimes I can fix this by restarting the app, but it only lasts for a few searches until I'm limited again",4
10996,Love this app! So addicting and super easy to use.,5
10997,Very fun and easy to use!,5
10998,I am in love with Thred Up. I have managed to acquire several outfits that I absolutely love for under 200.00. That has never happened before!. I have to admit that I was very leery of this site because I thought that it would probably be mostly yard sale rejects. Wrong! To start with I ordered a few shirts to test it out. When my order arrived it was EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND PICTURED! Every order since then is the same as the first.,5
10999,I love shopping on thred up its my new favorite store. They have so many items to choose from. I find myself browsing the app everyday.,5
11000,"First time using this app, was referred by a coworker. Let's see if I get what I ordered :)",4
11001,Best second hand app!!!,5
11002,"I love ThredUp, it makes online secondhand shopping easy. I love that they measure things so you know how big the clothes are, that's what makes it work. One change I would make to the app is for their ""if you like this item, you might like these"" section to used your saved size, or the same size as the item you looked at first.",5
11003,This is the only app I trust and will order from.. Found ALOT of name brand clothes at great deals... Alot of cute clothes to pick from.,5
11004,Love thred up!,5
11005,Great fun,5
11006,It is addicting. My new way to shop for clothes.,5
11007,Only place I am able to find small waist and long pants! Great prices and awesome quality!,5
11008,I am more than satisfied with the quality and promptness of the items/ service I've received on this app. - { My only concern and/ or hesitation to purchase more is not knowing for sure how to cancel items in cart before going to checkout. I find something I like or need a little bit more than something I had previously placed in cart and I'm not sure how to remove it from my order. } - Thank you. Have a blessed and beautiful day. ~ £isaCaye,4
11009,On time. always find what I am looking for,5
11010,Expensive,2
11011,Lots of everything!!,5
11012,So far so good.,4
11013,Just placed my first order for my daughter! Really loving the prices and variety of clothes! Will edit once package arrives!,4
11014,Great variety for cheap!,5
11015,"Extremely user-friendly app. Very easy to find what your looking for- I especially like the ""find items like this"" feature that will show you pieces in nearly the EXACT same color and general design. I'm going to be buying clothes from here from now on. 👍",5
11016,I love this app... Best clothes i found in years. And easy to find my sizes!,5
11017,Prices are too high. I will not pay such high prices for used clothes that come wrinkled and smelly. Good will is not far from me. I'm very disappointed,3
11018,Great app. Very great user experience,5
11019,Poor communication I never get feedback or result from selling either they accepted it or not. The processed took 4 months but never get the answer from the customer service.,1
11020,Love it! Cheap finds great deals. Big money saver!,5
11021,Great site,5
11022,Easy to shop,5
11023,"so far I've really enjoyed thredup, they have great prices.. I just made my first purchase so ill see how it goes",4

11025,Clear and informational product listed. Returns are easy.,5
11026,"Offers clothes I've never seen before. Condition has always been ""spot on."" Fair pricing.",5
11027,Love the quality of everything that I have purchased. The variety of name brands to choose from is amazing.,5
11028,I love this site only problem i see is they charge you a fee to return an item and a fee to restock an item so.if the item you pay for is only say $5 you can be charged up to $10 to return it if it doesnt fit,4
11029,"This is my first time shopping online and its been great! Thread up makes it so easy and gives step by step directions, i am new to technology and its been easy for a person like me.i love pre owned clothes and i am really enjoying looking at all the beautiful clothes and shoes!

11035,I think the idea is great. Haven't received my order yet but think it will be fine,4
11036,you think it's an excellent idea but I also know too many people in real life that I can switch clothes out with so therefore I don't even need an app in order to get what needs done.,1
11037,Love this!! Brand name items.,5
11038,Customer service is very responsive. I like the Bundle option because you get free shipping on anything you find over the next 7days after your original purchase. Haven't sold anything to ThredUp but the app gives you an estimate of how long it will take them to get to your bag.,5
11039,Three up,5
11040,Prefecet,5
11041,So addicted. Ships fast have not been disappointed yet Highly recommend,5
11042,I've sold and purchased. Great experience.,5
11043,Nice thrift store.but prices to pricey .for being online,4
11044,Awesome!!!,5
11045,"I just love, love this app. They have the cutest clothes.",5
11046,I LOVE ThredUp!!!! I was a thredUp customer before it became cool!!!! 😏😎,5
11047,Fun and easy way to shop for Women and Kids clothes,5
11048,Ordering has been quite easy I've got no issues so far.,5
11049,Ketchup and mustard go lol,5
11050,Great place to get awesome kid's clothes for cheap.,5
11051,"Its been great! I've only got 2 items that were wrong size. Decided to donate to kids that could use them, rather than do a return.",5
11052,Enjoy just looking,4
11053,Love shopping here. Better than the mall.,5
11054,Love thred up. It's like goodwill hunting without ever leaving your couch! Wish the site included item descriptions like whether a workout shirt is fitted or semi fitted or whether skirts are elastic waisted or zip up. This would help narrow down my purchasing needs.,5
11055,"I love this app and I find it so reliable for finding good clothes at amazing prices! I struggle a little with finding pants on here (happens when you're short), but other than that I've had no issues of any kind.",5
11056,Amazing and great customer service!! I love buying and selling.,5
11057,I personally just have had an all around bad experience. The first few items I ordered did not fit and it took almost a month for me to get my money back! I requested for a clean out I got them but it looks like it's going to take another month for them to get to it. Oh and if you want your money back and not merchandise credit good luck because you'll lose half your money.,1
11058,Why is everything wrinkled?,2
11059,Absolutely laughable fees.,1
11060,Fantastic,5
11061,Love it so much...,5
11062,"I'm buying a new wardrobe where I'm actually able to get the styles I WANT instead of what's just given to me/cheap. This is where I'm finding a LOT of success. I have 2 huge bags full of clothes to give them to sell and a 3rd started. It's literally every thrift clothing shop in one place. I'm super impressed with the variety & styles. I found Dollhouse & Haute Couture with Old Navy & Lane Bryant. The search is solid, you can choose your sizes in your profile so you only do it once! Marvelous.",5
11063,Love it! but I would like to have more options to personalize my shopping. Maybe a family account option so you can save prefs. for everyone you shop for. Other than a lack of personalization options the app is fantastic. I just placed my first order and have not sold anything yet. I recieved an email after the first day asking for feedback on my experience and if i had any issues since i hadnt made a purchase. I thought it was cool. Will shop again soon.,4
11064,Prices are too high. Not a decent deal on here,2
11065,Improve the maternity search,4
11066,Love thredup.,5
11067,Fun and Easy!,5
11068,Junky clothes. Ugly too.,1
11069,Clothes are ugly! Priced a bit high and isn't from a thrift store. Might as well shop on LetGo.. 1st buy discount wouldnt work either. Don't waste your time!,1
11070,Loving this app!!,5
11071,Great App,5
11072,Who ever thought of this is a pure genius.... I love the app. Its very convenient for me. Thank you,5
11073,Wonderful app! High quality clothes delivered to your door quickly!,5
11074,They are expensive clothes in this app and they dont even look that good . Yaw ever tried Shein. They got some of the best styles fashion clothing for fair price.,2
11075,Enjoyable shopping experience. Makes shopping for specific items a breeze.,5
11076,So easy to filter for what you are looking for!,5
11077,"I love this app bcuz it has soooo many choices and such great prices and good deals. And it ships in a reasonable amt of time. And the quality is excellent, I love it",5
11078,I have ordered several times from ThredUP. I have been pleased with their service and items! The free shipping deal is what attracted me to ThredUP!!,5
11079,"I am losing weight, & this is a great place to get new (well new to me) clothes without breaking the bank. While they do offer returns on most items, after you factor in the restock fee, sometimes its not even worth it, so be sure to check the measurements before you buy",5
11080,Clothes have all been beautiful and pretty fast shipping!,5
11081,Love it.,5
11082,Easy to use.,5
11083,Great deals,5
11084,Love this site! Always finding amazing clothes for amazing prices! Love shopping second hand!,5
11085,Amazing!!! I bought a few things from here and I just got the first box and I am in LOVE with this site!! So easy to use and if you dont like something you can return it for a small fee but I am not returning anything as everything I bought fits perfectly! Can't wait to do more shopping from #thredUp,5
11086,Great connection,5
11087,DO NOT SELL YOUR STUFF HERE!!! I sent in brand new items with tags- never worn and got a payout of $1.60. Hand bag that was brand new with tags and I received 3 dollars and some change for it SERIOUSLY? Sell your items on Offer Up. The convenience of Thredup is not worth the price gouging.,1
11088,"Fast, efficient and easy to navigate, cudos to the developers!",5
11089,Addictive😳,5
11090,Super easy,5
11091,Got my first package and love it.,5
11092,Awsome selection of clothes.,5
11093,An online thrift store with reward points? This is my favorite shopping app.,5
11094,"Love the company. But the app could use some work. You can ""favorite"" things, but it more often than not doesn't allow you to ""un-favorite"" it. When the order is coming from multiple places, it would be nice to be able to reference from the app what items are in each package (it'll say on the confirmation email, just not in the app). And lastly, I returned 2 items and there's no way for me to track if they've even been received by thredUP.",3
11095,Great app to use while in the covid lock down,5
11096,"It is so much fun to look at clothing from the comfort of my home especially when stores were closed due to Covid-19. Stores now have reopened and still many dressing rooms remain closed. I have been personally told I could not return clothing bought from a brick & mortar store because of the Corona virus & they do not know where the clothing travelled to and yes, all tags are still attached. Returns will be accepted at a future date but not at this time!!",5
11097,"Large selection, great quality, updated fashions and prompt updated on shipping and eta of products purchased.",5
11098,"When I sent clothes in to sale, name brand, I made a whopping $20.00 woohoo. I've been trying to return a pair of shoes although I get the paper that says return that's upstairs I get no address to return them to. I won't buy and trust me, even think about selling, I don't pay two or $300 for a dress to maybe get a $ 1.60 for when they still have the tags on them, never worn. I prefer to donate them to charity. If you're smart you won't buy unless you are 100% sure you want them! I'm ticked!",1
11099,I love the app,5
11100,My favorite clothing app!,5
11101,Awesome,5
11102,Great price good quality of clothes really enjoy looking forward to good things coming thanks I love it,5
11103,"Very fast delivery, and the clothes is always in good condition..",5
11104,"It would be much better if products were measured by measurements instead of sizes. As it is, it's very difficult to find things that will fit unless you have a chest size or 30-34, which excludes the majority of American women.",3
11105,Great deals on great looks!,5
11106,Love this app. Its affordable and nice quality clothes.,5
11107,I have been very happy with everything I have purchased from them. Always find nice things for great prices.,5
11108,Good,5
11109,It wont let me cash out my account,2
11110,Love this site for one of a kind thrifty shopping!,5
11111,"I have bought a few items from thredUP good quality, recieved items quickly. However I had to return some items recently their customer support sucks ass. I have emailed them numerous times, and nothing back. Waiting for my account to be credited back and still NOTHING! I CANNOT GET AHOLD OF ANYONE. thing is I didnt ask for my money back, I asked for credit so I can purchase something else. It has been well over 3 months without a word.",1
11112,Absolutely love thred up. Lots of goodies at reasonable prices,5
11113,"this app functions well, so far, and thredUP is an original idea for getting quality at a low cost.",5
11114,Every item I have ordered has been on point. From shoes pants shirts and dresses. Just perfect.,5
11115,Awesome deals!!,5
11116,"I love shopping here. It's one of the only ways to shop second hand online that allows returns. I just wish there were more specific search options sometimes. But overall, it's great.",4
11117,"App is great, waiting for my product to test the quality of ""lightly used"" 😉 Update: Everything is awesome!!",5
11118,Love EVERYTHING about thredUP! I haven't been in a store in almost a year. Great merchandise & Great prices!,5
11119,Love thread Up....have found many great pre-owned tops!!!,5
11120,Great merchandise at affordable prices!! Love Love Love It!!,5
11121,"Fun, easy!",5
11122,Love shopping used goods here!! They really make sure the clothes are fit to sell!,5
11123,"App is simple to use, but sometimes gets stuck on one page during navigation. Still very well done, I use it all the time!",4
11124,"On both the site and app, it says that my orders have been delivered but they haven't, I was wondering if that's because all items are from separate locations? But none of my items have come in.",3
11125,"This is an awesome place to shop, as well as turning in some clothes for store credit. What doesn't work for resale is then donated. I love it!",5
11126,This company is a joke. The app crashes frequently. The measurements are always off. I gave it another shot and ordered two cute dresses thinking there is no way this can be messed up. WRONG. One dress isn't even a dress. Its literally like a spandex hospital robe- tying on the sides included. Like wth. Never again.,1
11127,Quality clothing at unbeatable prices!!,5
11128,Great experience,5
11129,Cant open website..then when it does come up..half later..cant see any items,1
11130,Great place to sell and thrift! Even thought it takes a while for them to process your things its still neat they sell your items and you still make some $ off of it that you can either cash it in or use the credit to shop on the app.,5
11131,"This company will not allow you to use their platform unless you log in with Facebook or Google. Both of these companies are known for collecting + selling your personal data. This is a huge invasion of my right to privacy. We can't create an account without Google or FB?! There are SO MANY awesome apps like this that respect your right to data privacy, and this doesn't make the cut. HARD PASS for me.",1
11132,Love it,5
11133,Wonderful app with so many varieties!,5
11134,I use Thredup all the time. The app is easy to navigate and their returns process is simple and straightforward. I highly recommend it!,5
11135,Best shopping experience ever!!,5
11136,"Your returns are the worst I have ever encountered!!!! Will never shop with you again and will post me dissatifaction on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!",1
11137,Great way to get your thrift on at home!,5
11138,Disappointed as a seller on ThredUp. I sent them $280 in garments with the tags attached and I only made $6.60. These garments were not selling on Poshmark. I feel that was ripped off by selling these new items on ThredUp. Never again will I be a seller on this site. They took advantage of me.,2
11139,"No men's clothing. I'm sure it's great but I can't sell my old clothes here so, yeah, pretty useless for some users.",2
11140,So far I love it. No probs!,5
11141,I love this site it's great,5
11142,Just wish the new discount applied to more clothes.,5
11143,"Sizes are not listed accurately and the pictures dont shop details, like they dont even show zippers, pockets, etc.... not happy. Plus returning cost u money and is a hassle. If something is listed Inaccurate then I should get ALL My money back..... 😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
11144,I absolutely love it,5
11145,Awesome!,5
11146,good prices. huge selection. love it.,5
11147,"Love, love. Easy returns, no hassle at all.",5
11148,Well-designed app. Great service.,4
11149,Thrift store from home? Yes!,5
11150,Delivery was a little long but i love it,3
11151,It's nice and surprising. Easy,4
11152,I always find something I love!,5
11153,Love this!! Easy to use,5
11154,Good,4
11155,Great selection. Easy to search!!! LOVE THREDUP!!!,5
11156,Good when tou know what your doin. Hard to get answers or contact,3
11157,"Excellent!!! Thredup not only is exceptional in the selection, organization, accessibility, item descriptions, categorical breakdown...the customer support is outstanding! They are so prompt to assist with personalized attentiveness. They ensure issues are resolved and walk you through matters. Cant thank and say enough about the support and site. Both go hand and hand to provide a wonderful experience and quality across the board. Thanks so much especially to Sara and Ariel 😊",5
11158,"The size filters are amazing. I like that they get automatically applied for any search I do. I wouldn't shop for used clothing for gifts for others, so it makes sense to always apply my sizes. I don't get disappointed when I find something isn't available in my size, like I do on other sites. I also really like that if someone has the item in their cart, they only have so much time to buy it or they release it. I got to buy a shirt that looks so nice this way when the app notified me.",5
11159,Nothing for men. Probably should explain that in the details,1
11160,"ThredUP gives different prices to each customer. They remove items from your cart while you're checking out, resulting in a price increase that they claim they are powerless to help with.",1
11161,Not worth shopping there!!,1
11162,"Best app I've gotten to help me sell, donate, AND buy quality used clothes",5
11163,"Super easy to browse, save, and shop!",5
11164,Good site for used clothes not much for tall people,3
11165,"Installed this after seeing the television commercials which don't mention it's exclusive to women and kids, no men's items.",1
11166,"Works well most of the time. Easy to use. Lately (June 2020) I am not able to remove items from my ""favorites"" list. I can ""unfavorite"" them but when I refresh, they are still there with the little red hearts.",4
11167,"I like it a lot it's easy less expensive, free RETURNS on most items not all but nice option ! Low prices on most items also. Great pics and great customer service via chat. Know your measurements and colors is my advice before you shop and it's super fun !",5
11168,"Was fun to buy items but I don't like that items time out of your cart. Also tried to sell, like they state you can, and was unable to do so in the app. It kept giving me an error. Very irritating.",3
11169,I love thredUP. You can buy new or used. They have the styles that I want.,5
11170,Has gorgeous clothes for great prices! It's all I've used during this quarantine and even back when I was in school this was place I came to for dresses for sorority events. The one thing I wish we I could do is apply the discounts (which is when I shop) and apply my reward certificates (I have 3000 pts accumulated) but we can either do the discount or the reward.,5
11171,I found the perfect outfit for a bday party right away and super cheap,5
11172,Super easy way to make some extra $$$. Made $30 on my 1st clean out bag. Yes please! 😄,5
11173,"Lots of items to choose from! So far, items I have bought are as described and as shown in photos. You can find some good deals on quality clothing!",5
11174,Second hand clothes at $169 ?? To hard to follow,1
11175,Like buying here.,5
11176,They really arent good about giving honest descriptions or on paying for your items. :(,2
11177,Love love love this app ❤️❤️❤️💖,5
11178,"Most of my clothes and my kids' clothes come from ThredUp. The app makes it easy to find what I'm looking for, with several options for narrowing down the search. It remembers my sizes, and brands I like and gives me alerts when something comes up for me. The pictures of items are very clear and everything runs smoothly. This is a great app!",5
11179,"Promo codes don't work, things disappear from your cart, really was hoping this app would be different...",1
11180,Awesome and easy,5
11181,"Very easy to limit my search to exactly what I wanted to search for, like for a denim jacket, and also nice how they give you the promo code for a discount at checkout. Overall, a good experience. App works well too.",5
11182,I dont know yet,5
11183,I LOVEEEE y'all's stuff!!!,5
11184,"App is easy to use, photos are good quality.",5
11185,Love ThredUp! Customize your sizes to make shopping simple. Great discounts and returns are easy. Highly recommend 👍,5
11186,Great prices and great deals,5
11187,"Customer Service is awful, no shipping notifications, charges happen randomly...horrible idea!!",1
11188,"Great site, great prices and app is user friendly",5
11189,Good,5
11190,"What a joke, pain in the ass to get done. 4 months for them to even look at my stuff, and they will only take half in which case I have to pay to get my clothing back. Bad deal",1
11191,Love shopping here. I have purchased designer brands for a fraction of the price with tags!,5
11192,Excellent shopping experience. Would love to see more expanded search capabilities.,4
11193,"Amazing, easy ....and great selection! I'm very excited to share this is a great way to shop! I love consignment and this is just as fun as digging for amazing finds! I've even done some returns for items that qualified, and that was crazy easy too!",5
11194,"I wish it was easier to search for shoes and accessories! They aren't listed under ""categories"" which makes it impossible to search for shoes by type. you just gotta scroll through every single shoe they've got. I also wish the ""similar items"" you see on each item detail page were items of a similar size and type, rather than color. if I'm looking at a purple shift dress size L, I don't want to see a purple mini dress size XS.",3
11195,They did not have what I was searching for. Something that I would think should be several of. Summer mid length dresses,3
11196,"This company is horrible. They sell used clothes at a huge markup. Shipping and receiving is so slow. Great concept, abysmal execution.",1
11197,If trying to sell items...takes forever for bags to be processed!!! Over 2 months and bags are still not processed!,1
11198,"Great app very convenient fun way to thrift! Awesome customer service, very convenient!",5
11199,"Great clothes, but the search engine and filters could be more specific. I would like to be able to look at a brand and choose shoes without having to look through all that they have. On the topic of shoes, I wish you could sperate clogs, ankle boots, sandals, thigh-highs and the like. Often have trouble processing my order at checkout.",4
11200,"I love thredUp because you can find one of a kind items without spending hours flipping through store racks. Items also ship fast, and are as described in the listing. Love it.",5
11201,Love it!,5
11202,Easy to navigate. Good photos though wish there were more angles. App stops frequently. When I remove a Like from an item the item and Like reappear the next time I open the app. Love the rewards you earn and the Buy and Bundle feature.,4
11203,"A most terrible experience.. Clothes advertised are not exactly in the condition you see..(ie faded, old worn out material). When returning them you get no reply or assistance. I've repeatedly tried to get my refund as promised even using their return label. It has been over 35 days..no reply..nothing. Wal-mart should think twice about joining up with this company.",1
11204,"LOVE thredUP and the app! Great deals on fun clothes, shoes and accessories. The app makes it even easier to find and buy items, track reward points, check status of orders and see previous orders. I have not tried to return anything yet. Usually find such good deals that if I don't like something, I just donate or give it away versus return.",5
11205,I love this app! Everything I've gotten is in great condition and I spend so much less than full retail!,5
11206,"App is easy to use, just used customer chat & it was very quick efficient & pleasant. Company easy to work with.",4
11207,Love it....,5
11208,I send my bag a month ago and I haven't heard from them to check if my bag got there. This was my first time doing this.,1
11209,Love it!,5
11210,Completely sexist app. Don't bother if you're a man.,1
11211,nice,5
11212,Omg,5
11213,A few glitches but works 98% of the time.,4
11214,Awesome!,5
11215,Really cute clothes and higher end brands available for a really good price. I have ordered alot of jeans and I'm very satisfied!,5
11216,Very easy to use!,5
11217,Love this app! What a great shopping experience.,5
11218,Love ThredUp!!,5
11219,Mom,5
11220,Best app for individuals who are on a buget and great quality. Great brands! My favorite app.,5
11221,Love this app!!!,5
11222,I love this app! It's all the unexpected delights of going to a high-end consignment store without the crowds and germs. I was so shocked when I searched for clothes and shoes in my size and literally THOUSANDS of options popped up. The search feature is also so specific. I love being able to search for a specific fabric too. I can't say enough awesome things about this app.,5
11223,Easy to use and helpful!!,5
11224,Great selection of high end high quality items that would ordinarily be out of mu price range.,5
11225,Shop second hand and save the earth!!,5
11226,Clothes r ugly🤢...srry💁,1
11227,Ok,5
11228,"thredUP is an amazing online consignment shopping experience. They make browsing easy, convenient, and fun. I love that they filter everything based on your sizes.",5
11229,Cannot open after the update. Guess I won't be shopping here anymore as the app was super user friendly.,1
11230,App works ok but returns take longer than you can imagine. Sent my return 2 weeks ago still waiting on the refund. Makes it really difficult to want to buy again knowing this information.,2
11231,Pleasurable,5
11232,"Disappointing profit. Great set up for sending items in, but very little $$ for those items comes back to you. Plus, I was disappointed in how items were described. I sent in a dress that still had the original tags on it. It was a decent name brand and the original tag was $129.00. They described it as used and showing minor wear???? Nothing about having the tag. It is the last item to sell from my bundle. Currently, if it sells, I get 75 cents. 😒 seriously?",3
11233,Awful,1
11234,Love the store,5
11235,Great,5
11236,Alot if friends are very happy with this app.,5
11237,Excellent. I can't wait to receive my merchandise,5
11238,Solid Shopping choice. Great app for buying and selling clothes. It has changed my approach to fashion by helping me explore new looks.,5
11239,Good,5
11240,Awesome clothes. Give thredUP a try you wont be disapointed.,5
11241,Noice,4
11242,Love the app,5
11243,I literally found the most lovely jackets on here that I probably wouldn't have easily found elsewhere for a great price 💖💖💖,5
11244,Easy to use. Variety of items,5
11245,Threds up is the new used or not outlet. Huge...,5
11246,All is well arranged in detail. I am impressed with your layout. Good job.,5
11247,I love thredUP!,5
11248,"I thought this app and app concept was great, I just wish there was a mens version or inclusion so I could properly shop thus apps deals. For its intended audience of women and children however, I think its a good choice.",4
11249,"Love Thred up! Perfect way to try something new, save some cash and the do some good for the environment plus fast shipping and lots of perks!",5
11250,"This app needs some digging to find good cute clothes but once you find them it is worth it! The deals are really great, just know that they don't pay you very fairly for your clothes donations since their prices are so cheap. Great app interface!",5
11251,"I've ordered from thred up multiple times and all those orders, I've been so excited and happy about! I get compliments on my shoes I bought from Thredup even when I'm at the mall! And I really love their deals and shipping is so fast!",5
11252,Everything has been as stated.,4
11253,So easy to navigate and the prices are amazing!,5
11254,"Sent a large bag of clothes in, processing took 3 months. Photos of items are great. Description mostly accurate. However, I had a brand-new with tags dress they posted as 'gently used', minor wear/fading'. I contacted them, response took longer than what I'd be comfortable with and all it said is that there's nothing they can do about it. Reclaiming your items costs quite a bit, eating up almost all $$ from sales. I doubt I'd use thredup for selling again. Haven't bought anything yet.",3
11255,The app is easy to move around in an easy to purchase.,4
11256,Super fun and easy to use!,5
11257,My oants are comfortable and just what theg were supposed to ne,4
11258,"After trying to change/add/remove filters after the initial search, the results wouldn't apply. So I had to go back and reinput all the information with the adjustment. Good stuff good prices though",4
11259,Rewarding,5
11260,I really like the huge selection and all the filters so you can find just what you want very quickly. Great site!,5
11261,Love this app! I just place my 3rd order. Everything has been just as described and very accurate on measurements.,5
11262,"I love ThredUp and the idea of shopping sustainably, keeping clothing out of landfills. For me the apps falls a bit short. At times I have to restart the app multiple times for it to perform correctly.",4
11263,I love it! So affordable and nice clothing!,5
11264,Love it best deals ever,5
11265,Great,5
11266,Perfect!,5

11280,"Received my items yesterday! Love all of them! All were in mint condition and fit perfectly. Hard to believe that's possible when virtual shopping, but it is and I am so pleased. Will use this app again and again....... and again!",5
11281,Really like this app. Have bought a few products from this app. Some items are reasonable prices if you are browsing through the site. Items come shipped pretty much quickly like 2 days or so. You also can donate clothes as well or sell them but if you do that it takes time to progress them tho to actually get feedback about the items you try to donate or sell.,4
11282,Just cashed in on some clothes I haven't worn in a couple years!! Feels good.,5
11283,I have always been a second hand shopper so when I fell upon thredUP I was super happy. The online app is easy to use and the selection of merchandise is great. Because the items are screened and only the best pass I always know that I'm getting high quality clothing and accessories everytime. The prices are great for what you get and the shipping is fast. I am so happy I found thedUP.,5
11284,$136 for a used dress. Y'all lost your dang mind. What a joke!! Deleting app and never looking back.,1
11285,Love it!💝💝💝💝💝💝💝,5
11286,Great place to shop. Excellent customer service.,5
11287,these people make this work it's really hard because someone I think. My address and it keeps saying that there was an error that I cannot have the address that I wanted to because someone maybe God is so please make this work I really want to start selling clothing but it just won't let me I don't really recommend this app stupid app😡🤬😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠,1
11288,I don't like the fact that all clothing items have to have the tags in them and in perfect condition so they can sell them for you and make money for themselves. I ended up using the bags sent to me to fill them full of clothes and donated them to charity. I felt better about that.,2
11289,"I love it! I need clothes for work, and I love thrifting. It's impossible to do that right now because of covid-19, but thredup is making this experience easier.",5
11290,Never disappointed with clothes,5
11291,Great way to shop! So easy to use to search function and filters to look through the clothing options. Really like that it saves your sizes and only displays items that fit - fabulous feature!,5
11292,"Ok so customer service actually got back to me when I emailed them. They were patient and kind when helping me understand their site better. I would be rating this as 5 stars. Here is my suggestion for improvement: Your mobile site is difficult to use as the filter system is clumsy to set. I prefer using a P.C. as it seems my preferences are more likely to stay set the way I want. If you develop the filter function in mobile, shopping may become addictive rather than a chore.",4
11293,I love to scroll through all the pretties.,5
11294,I absolutely love this app and thredup. The quality of the clothes are remarkable and the prices are very fair. Walmart definitely lost me as a clothing shopper now lol j,5
11295,"I'm a regular customer, there's some good deals,but there items that are overpriced for second hand clothing. I emailed customer service twice in the past and they never got back to me. Its hard to reach them. There were items that I recently returned displayed for sale which i paid with my debit card and I paid for postage and I haven't seen any refund yet. I'm very disappointed and I hope to see that refund on my debit card soon",2
11296,"I'm a total thrift store shopper, but Covid put a stop to that. With Thredup, I get to shop at home and they have tons of variety. The clothes I've ordered are all like new and just as described.",5
11297,They are very patient and is a great app to actually clean out your closet but not so great about accepting your items.,3
11298,Great app,5
11299,It is a wonderful app to have...,5
11300,Nice,5
11301,Wasn't sure about online thrifting at first . But I've had nothing but great experience with this app ! So many cute clothes !!! I don't think you'll be disappointed with it !,5
11302,"Having difficulty with the app, when on wifi the screen stays blank. Have to use data or a browser to make it work.",3
11303,It is always a uneventful visit each and every time i visit the site!,5
11304,Easy to use. Great deals to be found. Easy returns if you don't like it or it doesn't fit. You can not combine discounts at checkout. If you have a free shipping discount you can't add on a discount on your purchase. Fyi,5
11305,"I love this app! I shop thrift stores, but this makes it easier.",5
11306,"I love this website, it has alot of versatility on choices for name brand clothes for kids clothes and womens clothes along with asseceries. The pricing is very reasonable and you can get discounts, which is great when you have a budget!",5
11307,"Adictive, quick turn around for purchases, not as quick with receiving, but may be due to safety measures and volume!",4
11308,Im very happy.😊,5
11309,Great quality and great prices! Many items still have the tags on them! It's an affordable way to expand my wardrobe.,5
11310,"This is a thrift store with store prices, too high cost NOT, FOR second hand CLOTHES",1
11311,"Easy shopping, fast delivery.",5
11312,"Great app, more helpful than the site with the quick option to auto buy or get a notification if a garment you want becomes available from another person's cart. I also enjoy the infinitely scroll rather than clicking next on pages and how you can apply several filters at once without having to load the page over and over. Although it is easier to browse a lot of clothes on the website. After downloading, I've definitely used the app more than my laptop. Almost too easy to buy things!",5
11313,Doent have a search for men. It's all about women and children.,1
11314,Great bargains,5
11315,Awesome app love you guys,5
11316,Im addicted!,5
11317,Love thredup!! My favorite place to shop now!!!,5
11318,Love it very affordable,5
11319,"As a plus sized girl, the best app I have ever downloaded in my entire life",5
11320,"I have ordered from thredUp since slightly before Mother's Day. So far so good! I have been quite happy with the results. Good quality clothing, good prices and deals! I will definitely keep ordering from threadUp. I have also shared thredUp with some of my friends and family. 👍👍👍",5
11321,Timely delivery and reasonable prices,5
11322,"💕⭐💎🎉💫💐💋 But more seriously, I'm so glad I found this site/app from bestdressed's YouTube because I've never been good at thrifting and you open up a whole new world of cute clothing for me!!! (The only problem is how dangerous it is for me to open the app. My wallet...)",5
11323,Love it,5
11324,I received my first box. Everything smelled stale and all but one item was winter wear. This is Summer. Directions were not clear for returning. When I figure out how I will cancel future boxes.,2
11325,Great deals nice stuff,5
11326,Love this app!😀,5
11327,"I bought three dresses from this company and omg all three of them are in good condition for them being used. I got better service from this company, then I do my own therft store in my area.",5
11328,Terrific,5
11329,fantastic,5
11330,Have always been satisfied!,5
11331,Looks like a really good app but 1 star because there's no mens section.,1
11332,Beware...addicting!,5
11333,Interesting but fun.,4
11334,Loving!!,5
11335,Great Clothing,5
11336,This is the best app. I love everything about it!,5
11337,I'm Hooked,5
11338,"I ordered a few pairs of jean and saved so much, not to mention the shipping was done quickly. I also got reward points toward different things, such as: free restocking, free shipping; ect.! Love the app!!!",5
11339,"It took a few months of browsing before I finally started purchasing, and now I'm hooked. It took me time to figure out how to search for items I'd be interested. There's usually some kind of discount code going on too. My only complaint is sometimes the app freezes up, but that could honestly just be a phone/usage issue.",4
11340,"Poor picture quality, wrinkled clothing and high prices. No thanks!",3
11341,Wonderful,5
11342,Easy to use,5
11343,"Awesome prices, selection, and ease of quality service!",5
11344,Very good,5
11345,I love the quality of the zoom in feature. And all the filter options really saves me so.much time and I love how it customizes itself to your needs .,5
11346,"Such a great way to shop! The clothes are also in great condition, and ThredUP has such good prices!",5
11347,I love this site but seems takes a long time to get your items compared to when you order from other retail stores kinda stressful but more than happy with the one Abercrombie tshirt that I have recieved at this point. Hoping in the future there is more of a discount for the loyal buyers,3
11348,Piss poor info,1
11349,"hey @thredup, with your newest update, your app has a bug that is causing ""sold"" items to not be unfavorited by me. Might want to fix this bug before it makes other members angry",4
11350,Sux,2
11351,LOVE IT,5
11352,"I like the idea of threadup but the app leaves a lot to be desired. The search is lacking. If i type in things like ""high collar blouse"" it should be able to find tops that have high collars. It also lacks in the ""similiar items"" category.",3
11353,Love this app,5
11354,I love the measurements and descriptions. I can buy with confidence.,5
11355,takes to long to pay out,3
11356,Great Selection of clothes.,5
11357,Deceitful selling process.,1
11358,"Theives! I sent numerous bags of $$$ Brand name clothing with tags on to Thredup. Any items Not Acceptable were paid to return to me. Only 3 small bags were returned. All my very expensive items vanished! 2 years later, i try again...my order and money vanish. AVOID THREDUP. STILL THEIVES!!!",1
11359,Finding nice clothing for my teen age daughter,5
11360,If you havent downloaded this app already. Download it now. Amazing prices great selections in every size! I'm addicted,5
11361,"Ordered shoes listed as ""excellent condition"" but when they arrived they the soles were scuffed to the point of falling off. They had been listed as eligible for a refund on the site but took so long to ship and arrive I lost the ability to get that refund.",1
11362,Awesome designer clothes at great prices!,5
11363,Great service!,5
11364,OH MY GOSH I LOVE THIS SITE. AND THE CLOTHES ARE GREAT HARDLY ANY WEAR. I Got really really nice things,5
11365,Shopping made easy,5
11366,Great,4
11367,Love everything about it!!!,5
11368,Great,5
11369,"Love Thredup but the app is not as good as it should be. Favorites doesn't work, for me nothing loads. If you task switch to another app, it reloads the app so you lose the search or whatever you were doing. And it's a slow reload. I think the website is probably a better option for now.",3
11370,"After posting my review here, I was able to get in contact with their app support which was the first contact I'd had with their support, despite multiple attempts. Luckily whoever moved in to my address forwarded my packages so I ender up receiving them. Lesson: triple check your listed address. There is no way to change it immediately after and contact takes a while to establish. -- Package was shipped to a very old address. Never asked me to fill one in just autofilled in my account. C",4
11371,"In love, let's me choose clothes and shoes to my true size from designer or high fashion brands,for lower prices, warning to you all,this app can get addictive,,I haven't received my purchases yet but I'm Soo excited about it!",5
11372,Love ThredUp so much!!!,5
11373,"You have update your look on Merchandise, I shop and sell on other online consignment shops. People like when they buy quality looking merchandise, you guys have update that look.",5
11374,Love it,5
11375,Poor i purchased a fress cant find checkout,2
11376,Great app for thrifting without leaving home! I've found some awesome items for a fraction of the price,5
11377,"Would give the app 5 stars if they included mens clothing. Everything ships in a cute box. If you start a bundle, which in my opinion, is an excellent option. I can continue to add items for 7 days until my item ships and I LOVE that feature!",4
11378,That was so much fun!! I ended up in a situation where I lost all my clothes and have been trying to find a site with cute good clothes for a great price because i have a whole wardrobe to replace and I've been through so many apps but then I tried thredUP and I put in my size and filtered it price low to hi and within minutes had a full cart with a great deal. I had 18 dresses for $189!!! It was great. Thank you thredUP,5
11379,"This was my 1st time using the app. I ordered boys clothing, size XL (or 14). When items arrived some of them weren't the size that the app listed them as or appeared to be girls clothing which fits smaller.",3
11380,"😁 I love this site, such good deals and great quality.",5
11381,AMAZING! BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT!,5
11382,I like expensive things at cheap prices. But sometimes I get things that I don't like in person and the return policy isn't the best. I understand why it is that way. But who wants to pay for something they don't want?,4
11383,They received my order 4/29/20. Still no update. Ugh...,2
11384,"App works great, selection is meh: I wear both men's and women's clothing. Some cuts are just more comfortable in one than the other. Thredup only works for half my wardrobe because they just will not carry men's clothing. Seek out other apps/sites unless you're all femme, all the time. Doesn't fulfill the andro niche market.",3
11385,Easy to use,4
11386,Would like to have measurements on every garment especially bust and length on all jackets and shirts. TY,4
11387,I have so much fun with this app. New items are added every day and I love to check it every day to see if there are any must have items! They have sales all the time and sometimes your favorites get lowered in price. So check back regularly to see if anything you've been eyeing is on a good deal.,5
11388,So easy to use!!,5
11389,Great way to shop and fill up your wardobe .,5
11390,Awesome. Easy to search and everything I've ordered is in almost perfect condition!,5
11391,It is always fun getting a polka dot box from threadUP!! I love upcycling,4
11392,Excellent quality with honest ratings...fun app!,5
11393,Amazing things to buy . Great prices and fast shipping. Love this app so much!!!!,5
11394,"Doesnt let me buy anything. It just tells me ""oops we cant process your order at this time"" over and over. Ive checked and the item is still available so idk why this is happening. There is no reason it should.",1
11395,Everytime I order they charge me then cancel my order. Taking days to refund my money.,1
11396,A total scam,1
11397,"I love the business itself and obsessed with second hand finds. Even still, it's been irksome with customer service (it will take up to 11 weeks to process your clothes to sell. I understand it's pandemic related, but they're better off temporarily closing to catch up). As for the app- It's always super buggy! If I want to go to Account, it stays at my Cart. Never updates my sizes, and I missed out on some promos because it wouldn't apply points that I earned. It's BEYOND frustrating!!",1
11398,I love shopping on ThredUp. The clothes are always in good condition. If I want to send something back its so easy.,5
11399,"My first order and everything had some sort of animal hair all over. Dirty. I'm pretty sure they send you the opposite of what your size is just for fun. The goodie box was the ugliest over-priced , wrong sized garbage. So bummed",1
11400,Easy to navigate and moves faster than the website.,4
11401,Love being able to buy used clothes online!,5
11402,Great prices and fast shipping!,5
11403,"Love this app!! It like having ur favorite thrift store in your pocket! I can get lost in the unbelievably well organized, intuitive, layout of this beautiful app. It's the bane of my existence...lol. can't turn away!!!🙄 Working for a company like this would be like a vacation to me! ❤️❤️❤️",5
11404,"Overall good site to shop at. Wish the description of items were a bit more descriptive. Pic's could be better, as well. Quite a few times I've bought items that were listed ""Like New"" & they had a lot of noticeable wear. Sometimes things are perfect. I like the option of taking store credit & a free return label if items aren't as described. Good way to balance out the gamble!",5
11405,Great,5
11406,"Now that I have a better understanding of what throw-away fashion does to the environment, I only buy clothes second-hand and, for me, ThredUp is the most convenient way to do that. The app is a bit buggy, (thus the 4 stars) but if you're looking for an easy way to Do Good, ThredUp fills that roll well.",4
11407,"Only shows relevant sizes, which saves me scrolling time! The app gives me access to high end brands that we don't have in Oregon! Thank you!",5
11408,Awesome,5
11409,L O V E!,5
11410,"The best experience shopping online! It's fun, exciting and affordable! Plus you can sell you items! I believe I'm addicted now. I want to shop for everyone, lol.",5
11411,Good quality items at a good price.,5
11412,Love the ability to shop online for good used clothes,5
11413,Loved it found awesome clothes and very affordable,5
11414,Great deals!,5
11415,Great app,5
11416,Good place,5
11417,Found a great purse at a great price..,5
11418,I downloaded this app because I saw a commercial on TV but nowhere did it say this app doesn't sell men's clothes. Thank you for wasting my time.,2
11419,Love the clothes and the huge selection they have! Really reasonable prices!,5
11420,"Way to price happy, for used items... don't think I'll be shopping here.",1
11421,"I love using this app and the prices are reasonable. Plus there's always discount codes being offered and free shipping. I only hate that the cart expires. I understand why they do this but it's annoying because for people like me who like to take their time to decide and switch things around a few times, it was frustrating when I lost something. If it weren't for that I'd rate 5 stars. Also, I received a pair of shoes that were advertised as a 6 but came as a 9 but it was handled.",4
11422,I've been pleased with my purchases and my experience so far,5
11423,Love this. The ability to thrift shop online with the biggest variety ever! Nothing beats going to the shops in person but this is grear.,5
11424,I SPENT an hour ordering a couple of items then they were lost from my cart when I was knocked off and had to come back.,4
11425,Enjoy this app,5
11426,Wonderful i love this app. Everything i have orered has came very quickly and is in great shape. I love shopping with Thred Up!!!!,5
11427,Great!,5
11428,Easy to use and good clothes.,5
11429,Very confusing. There's no category for men's clothing and there's no category for pajamas. Impossible to look for matching family pajamas.,1
11430,"Everything I was hoping it'd be. I needed an entire new winter wardrobe (usually pretty expensive) as a college student switching climates and ThredUP has let me buy so many quality wool sweaters and coats for hundreds of dollars cheaper (+discounts on top of that!). Their measurements, photos, and search filters are so helpful. If you need clothes (or love shopping), ThredUP is for you. You get to contribute to sustainability and your closet at the same time, helping the planet and your wallet!",5
11431,Its AMAZING!,5
11432,"When I first starting using ThredUp I actually got deals on items. But now clothing items with Walmart brands are so highly priced, I can buy them brand new at the store cheaper than on here. It seems to me they are becoming greedier for used clothing. Very disappointing!!",1
11433,Easy to use. Enjoy the online shopping spree.,5
11434,Has been sitting in the loading screen for the past month now. Loaded in once but clothes never loaded in.,1
11435,I Totally Love Shopping Here,5
11436,Love the clothes just wished that it would show you similar styles with your size,4
11437,Wonderful app,5
11438,Love this app! Great clothes and great prices.,5
11439,"I just ordered things last night. MK shoes for 60 bucks? Uh heck yes! And knee high boots for 17 bucks, and sexy little black dress for 6 bucks! It's worth the try. The only thing I'm worried about is the condition. They used bran new pictures for the things I purchased but it was noted the items where not bran new. So when I get my things I'll definitely update on condition. Also each thing I purchased was in a different state, so that made me worry. I think its individual sellers??",5
11440,Quality clothes. Easy-to-use app. Fast shipping. Hassle-free returns. They have styles not found in stores. My new go-to for clothes shopping! LOVE IT!,5
11441,Thred up is awesome! You can pick and choose the clothes you love and other accessories too.... so glad I looked at the app when I saw so many friends loving it too!,5
11442,Good. Except when im ready to check out and change my mind i have to start all over,4
11443,I've had a universally wonderful experience so far.,5
11444,It's better than playtos closet,5
11445,Awesome,5
11446,Great quality clothes and very good deals!,5
11447,Always find great things on this site..did recieve a goody box as everything fit well didn't make me feel I comfortable at all..did have to send avfew things but it's oh ok.,5
11448,"Boring, plain clothes from bland brands",1
11449,Great quality items huge inventory easy to use am pleased about walmart connection,5
11450,Happy,5
11451,"threadup ! Shop has great things, thank you",5
11452,Would only search on petites. Saved my sizes and saved TALL search returned nothing but petites. Tried several times still just petites. Was also slightly put off by the wrinkled look of the clothing . I know they are second had but an iron or steaming before taking pictures and listing would make it look better.,1
11453,Shopping made easy for brand name clothing. Everything I've ordered so far has been in great or new condition and the shopping is fast.,5
11454,"I'm OBSESSED with thred up, I literally am never going to shop anywhere else. It's option of looking at premium clothes, discount designer and new clothes/shoes etc. with tags is amazing!! There is a close up feature so u can inspect clothes for yourself, and its description on quality of item has been 100% accurate, so be sure to check condition so you can expect what your paying for. I just printed a few labels to use their clean out closet feature so I can make room for more new-to-me clothes",5
11455,"The commercial that aired at 5:29 a.m. on MSNBC worked real well,+1 😊😎",5
11456,"The clothes are in such good shape. The fit is so right on. It so much fun to shop this way. The points are so generous. What a money saver. I had to return something,and it is so easy and simple to do. Thank you, for helping me dress with style, and save so much money. Looking forward to alot more fun shopping experiences. Sincerely, Laurie",5
11457,The clothes are in GREAT condition and my orders come in the cutest packaging.,5
11458,"I bought a beautiful summers wardrobe of dresses, including little black dresses for special occasions, (my sister's wedding in September). All of them absolutely gorgeous and mint condition, if not brand new. I am thrilled at the uniqueness in each style. WOW Threadup, you are my new favorite online shopping mall! Fast shipping on everything.",5
11459,I go to sleep leaving ThredUP and when I awake The first thing I do is turn on my Laptop and go straight to my Addiction. My happy place,5
11460,The app has some great features and is easy to use.,5
11461,"First time user, easy to shop!",5
11462,I have found 4 or 5 great outfits already. I love it.,5
11463,I love this app,5
11464,DEFINITELY DO NOT SEND YOUR CLOTHES TO THEM... THEY WILL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR FOR A $40 ITEM...NEW WITH TAGS also don't buy anything that's not returnable!!!! They manipulate the colors and sizes of the purses and wallets,1
11465,"Just placed my first order ... The app is easy to navigate, has a lot more options than I thought it would and then there's a little something for everyone.",5
11466,Loved it so far.,5
11467,I love ThredUp!,5
11468,Great clothes great prices and great deals. In this quarantine it's gotten me to blow a lot of money but who hasn't done spring cleaning in this time and wanted to change their wardrobe,5
11469,Home page just hangs on loading. Doesn't display what's wrong,1
11470,LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. I seriously have had to Uninstall it to stop me from buying. Its back though lol. New stock everyday. They have measurements on almost all the items.,5
11471,😀,5
11472,"Not too many designers available If I want to shop Old Navy, I can go to their website.",2
11473,Great clothing for the price,5
11474,Great team! I have so many sales. Very responsive when I email to them! God bless you!!!,5
11475,Not for big girls,1
11476,great and easy,5
11477,Not too bad. Still so annoying that some items listed as 100 percent genuine leather are CLEARLY NOT. I tried to get them to look into more closely monitoring the description. They thanked me and did nothing. Makes me wonder about authenticity. On top of that some are final sales.,3
11478,Great selection,5
11479,Love it. I've been very happy with everything I've ordered.,5
11480,Prices way too high for a thrift store.I can buy new jeans from Walmart that haven't been worn for the same price or less. Sorry but if I'm going to spend $25 for used jeans I'll go to the real store.,3
11481,"I didn't realize they carried 3x - lots of interesting options available. I had to remove items from my cart, I found so many cute tops.",5
11482,Fantastic deals. I get great quality clothes that are like new or have the tags still attached for a fraction of the retail price. No more gaps in my wardrobe!,5
11483,Great fashionable clothes at gentle prices. I like the filter features.,5
11484,Love shopping with Thread Up! And the app makers it simple to shop anytime ;),5
11485,It's alright.,4
11486,Nothing but fabulous and easy to use.,5

11488,Great variety...great prices. App easy to use,5
11489,Site is user friendly and the deals are great.,5
11490,"Easy to order items and easy to send them back if they don't fit. The pictures are the same thing your getting, not a stock photo.",5
11491,Never disappointed,5
11492,So far so good,5
11493,This app is OK if you just wanna get rid of close but as far as getting money for your value you're gonna get next to nothing for your clothes,1
11494,It is a fun place to shop.,5
11495,"Well made, easy to use.",5
11496,Hate it,1
11497,"Dislike the way credit is handled. I have almost 100$ ""available"" but it ISN'T. I have to enter the credit when I'm ready to purchase. No idea why they changed their format. An extra step that makes me disinclined to shop on the app.",2
11498,Love it! Great for work clothes. As a hair color specialist I ruin everything I wear but still need to look good. This way I can look expensive without freaking out about every bleach spot.,5
11499,Great product for a great price!!!,5
11500,No men's clothes??,1
11501,Fun!,5
11502,Great shipping! Love the clothes!,5
11503,It's so easy and it has great items for very reasonable prices.,5
11504,Love thred up,5
11505,not interested,1
11506,I love ThredUp! They measure the clothing so you can make sure it fits before you order it. I have ordered several things through the app and recommend it to everyone!,5
11507,"I LOVE this site! I've been using for over a year and am a very happy returning customer. I'm able to thoroughly view each item and with the accurate descriptions listed, I'm never disappointed with what I purchase.",5
11508,Nice clothes for my Beautiful plus size figure.,5
11509,"I like thredUp but this app is buggy. Seems fine for browsing stock but I prefer to organize favorites & check out on the website b/c of app issues. Certain features such as cart notifications seem to stop working randomly which I find frustrating. Also, the push notifications area will not allow for true preferences - choose no in on area & app defalts to yes in other areas. I will prob just delete app if bugs aren't fixed.",4
11510,It don't have men option to choose from i only women and children only what a disappointment in option,1
11511,Nice selection,4
11512,Never lets me down🥰🤗👌👍,5
11513,Awesome,5
11514,My favorite place to shop!,5
11515,Didn't really get anywhere with this,2
11516,This app is for women only very biased towards gender,1
11517,I just made my first order!!,5
11518,I see that you can also sell or donate your own clothing but I see no reviews on that. I'd like to see someone else experience with selling or donating before I make that decision. Thanks.,3
11519,"Easy to shop, easy to filter good clothing descriptions",5
11520,Delightful! Fun to shop. I love everything I ordered! Highly recommend!,5
11521,I was not having the best purchasing experience with thred up last year in ( 2019) with a few issues of them linking mine and my sister's account together which was later fixed and I'm am so glad because of course I absolutely love the prices and quality of items this site offers.,5
11522,"Accuracy of quality descriptions has gone downhill. Several ""like new"" products have shown up with obvious flaws.",3
11523,"Ever since I have been using thredup I haven't had to wait for tax time to get great quality clothes for pennies on the dollar. ""Break me off a piece of that""",5
11524,Wide variety of clothes and accessories at great prices!,5
11525,It's ok could be cheaper on some items but they ship things fast.,4
11526,Overpriced. Dirty used Nikes shouldn't be $42!,1
11527,I never had a problem with the condition of my choses. Im very satisfied.,4
11528,"Just got my first dress in, it is absolutely gorgeous! Can't wait to receive my first bundle!",5
11529,New update is broken,1
11530,Definitely a Must try!,5
11531,They have good specials. Just buy the brands you know very well.,4
11532,Great thrifting store with all different price points.,5
11533,So happy I found this site. Quality of clothing is great! Love the low prices and taking advantage of the deals this site offers!,5
11534,"The site itself is fine, however these are not thrift store prices.",3
11535,Best online thrifting!,5
11536,"I use larger sizes. Not too many of those, or cheaper in town where I can try on. Shipping puts in another ""ball park"".",3
11537,Easy and fun shopping experience! Easyvreturns and fair pricing! Reccomend to everyone!,5
11538,"love this company, excellent payout and super inexpensive name brands I couldn't afford other ways!",5
11539,"I love being able to thrift online. The item selection is also very nice. Sometimes there are bugs with receiving and redeeming coupons codes and offers, but otherwise is a great shopping experience.",5
11540,Loved the layout and fast shippong.,5
11541,Only have women's clothing and no shoes,2
11542,"This is my go-to whenever I want to buy clothes- I am finding more & more of my closet is from Thredup! Search features are easy to use to find what you want, you can favorite items to watch the prices & buy later, & returning items is very easy with just a $2 re-stocking fee.",5
11543,Love it,5
11544,Great,5
11545,I love thredUP!... I have bought numberous clothes over the last few months from them and am happy with the condition of each item and the discounts they often give out are amazing too! Highly recommend!,5
11546,Love this app it's the greatest app ever,5
11547,Love this app,5
11548,"Never ever again will I use this BS app, they make profit while you make pennies. I say use a app where you do the work yourself, least then you will be making a profit.",1
11549,Sent damaged items and sizes descriptions are not available and refund does not show itemized,2
11550,"I've received items that smelled terrible, are not as described, or supposedly like new or NWT that are damaged. To top it all off, I returned hundreds of dollars worth of purchases due to such defects and I got $36 back. I know the items arrived, so it's just the company ripping me off. NOT COOL, thredup.",1
11551,Horrible,1
11552,"I really do not like this app or ThredUps business practices. I've been selling and buying using ebay & poshmark for years, so I thought why not.. Let's try a new app! Right off the bat they offer a 50% off your first order which sounds like a great deal. I browsed through specific brands and styles attempting to use their clunky filter to find cool items. They were specifying 20% or 30% off on some. Their unmarked items didn't get ANY discount I found out prior to checkout.",2
11553,Fabulous styles & brand names for discounted prices! Whats not to love?!,5
11554,I haven't received any items I'm waiting for my Orders Now I will give a Review Later.,5
11555,"I absolutely love this app. Everything ships really quick and almost everything looks and is brand new. Some of the things i bought said ""some wear and tear and fading"" but when i recieved it, it was just fine. This is a great app with great prices for what you get! I highly recomend them! Its seriously unbelievable how quick the items you buy get shipped out and show up at your door step and are always very nicely packaged! And the amount of items you can get for such low prices is so awesome!",5
11556,"Just placed my first order, very easy site to use, clear descriptions and prices, no hidden fees.",4
11557,👍👍👍👍,5
11558,So far so good,5
11559,Great items in great condition! Love this app!,5
11560,Super fun to browse and I havent got anything that doesnt fit yet. All of the clothes come in looking great.,5
11561,"Prices are good! Professional and causal, can't go wrong.",5
11562,Just wish the site matched be w the app. I LOVE & LIVE for thred up. It's like a bunny filled with ever changing Easter eggs!,5
11563,"I'm very upset with this app. At first I was so excited as I was taking the ""test"" to get my $60-$100 goody box and all was great until I had to put in my credit card information THREE times! It just kept sending me in circles and I did everything correctly and I know my credit card is Gucci so there shouldn't be problem and I better not get charged THREE TIMES! Bc there was never a confirmation on my purchase!",1
11564,"I love, love, LOVE this site and everything I have purchased from it! Good stuff, lots of variety and very accurate descriptions. It took me a bit to figure out how to save my searches, but after that, it was GAME ON! I love that it alerts me when new stuff is available. Shipping has been pretty quick and the tracking is good, too. And you just can't beat the selection!",5
11565,Absolutely love this app!!!,5
11566,Easy to use,5
11567,"Great app for quarantine! Good quality product, great prices, and even better discounts. Efficient packaging for easy returns.",5
11568,Great!,5
11569,To expensive,1
11570,Awful. Waste of my time and money.,3
11571,"1st time I used thredup I loved the selections and made the order. Items arrived in good time, and I was pleased with all my purchases. The first-customer discount is a great feature too. I love the variety of styles, and my selections are always right for ME.",5
11572,"Waiting for my first box, let you know more then.",5
11573,No live comunication! Confusing site.,1
11574,Great clothing and accessories are fabulous,5
11575,"I rate thredUp 5 stars , l love that l can buy designer ,otherwise i could not afford.",5
11576,Great way to shop!!,5
11577,I love this app. Every item I've bought from this app has been wonderful. 👏,5
11578,Always happy with the price and condition of clothing. Great options.,5
11579,"This app is great, and an easy way to enjoy the best of buying and selling on thredup!",5
11580,"Expensive Thrift - this app is overall ""meh"" in my opinion but I am a seasoned online and second hand shopper so I have my opinions. The prices can be extremely high for second hand $50+ for some items. Shipping takes a week+ via FedEx which is unfortunate as they are a large enough company to negotiate better prices and shipping terms with different carriers. I prefer selling apps such as Mercari or Poshmark for better deals and faster shipping.",3
11581,I would not recomment Thread Up. I bought an item which did not look like the picture shown. I inquired to return the item and it has been months and I have not recieved my money back. I am glad I only bought 1 item.,1
11582,Quick shipment and nice quality second hand clothes!! Love the prices and selling with them is a breeze.,5
11583,👌,5
11584,Great products! Description of items are honest. Love the special attention given. Items individually wrapped and presented in a special treatment.,5
11585,I have sent these folks messages and they have not sent me any messages at all.plus I have sent them 3- packages of clothes that are in excellent condition and I still can't believe nothing has sold,1
11586,Loved my first experience of online second hand shopping! Thanks!,5
11587,I love this app great prices with unlimited choice's,5
11588,Always good experience.,5
11589,My husband says I am addicted to this app. I admit it. I am. Every time I pick up my phone I have to see what has been added. I love that you can filter to your preferences and size. There are so many different styles to choose from. I have bought 8 items so far and plan to buy more. Why fight the busy stores when you have this app at you finger tips.,5
11590,"ThredUp on your phone, why not?",5
11591,Lime thred up,5
11592,All the fun of going to the thrift store but without leaving your home. I'm obsessed!!!!,5
11593,Most of items I've received are just like in the photo's and description,4
11594,I was truly amazed at the quality of my purchase and the prices fit my budget! I'm sold with promptness of delivery shop thredUP !,5

11596,Amazzzzzing❤❤,5
11597,"LOVE this app! Although my husband doesn't appreciate all the money i'm spending 😂. New looking clothes,price is cheap! They always have discount codes. Easy to use,pretty fast shipping. Over all,i LOVE it and will continue to keep buying all my clothes from here! Also love buying high end retail clothes for a very discounted price! Keep up the excellent work Thread Up!",5
11598,I love thredUP and the app works perfectly.,5
11599,Although it was my first experience with thredUP...I truly would not recommend this shopping experience for any of the clothing...unless you have a smaller dress size...i waisted money on two pairs of jeans...1pair of capris...and a pair of straight legged jeans...which none fit!!! I did order a pair of sandles which did fit...now I am stuck with these things..that i woll not send back...because it took so long to receive them...waiste of money...,1
11600,"Awesome everything I've received was absolutely gorgeous and in great shape!!@ Very pleased with Thred Up, will be a long time member😊Thank You all",5

11608,"Really easy to use, great filtering",5
11609,So simple to use! I absolutely love this app. It has all of my favorite brands at incredible prices in wonderful condition!!,5
11610,Fun and affordable!,5
11611,😁👍,5
11612,This is a great app if your looking for not so expensive nice clothes. I'm on it daily,5
11613,My phone sucks so it's taking a grip of time to download.,4
11614,Easy to use,5
11615,Not good quality,1
11616,Love this app,5
11617,"It seemed awesome, until I received my order. They say they have high standards of what they take and resell, but the quality of the items I purchased did not indicate that. Most of my items had holes/tears, no elasticity left, and were just totally worn out. Very disappointing.",2
11618,I absolutely love your ap! Thank you.,5
11619,I have been EXTREMELY happy with everything I have purchased,5
11620,Great thrifting experience. Easy to search and favorite items!,5
11621,Love it more if they lower the ones they want over $100 to $200,5
11622,"The items I bought were so clean and pristine when I received them that they looked like they'd never even been worn before (and I didn't buy anything that was new with tags)! They came neatly packed in a cute box with nice tissue paper. There was nothing second rate about this experience. I'll shop this way again, for sure! Fantastic!!!",5
11623,Love this app Great clothes at great prices,5
11624,"I ordered boot leg Jean's, they sent me skinny legs Jean's , if It says boot leg or you dont know the difference then get someone to show you...",2
11625,"Just love that I can shop gently used (or brand new!) clothes and get high quality brands and save the environment in the process. Plus, I can return whatever doesn't fit!",5
11626,Fabulous Darling!!!,5
11627,I love ThredUP !,5
11628,Love this app!,5
11629,"First issue 1. Size... do not bet on the size to be correct.. I ordered a size 6 petite dress and recieved a 12 tall. Non returnable ofcourse, 2. Brandnames.. i did not recieve the brands i ordered. Do not count on getting the item advertised. 3. Pricing changes based on order status, same item will list at a different price to another buyer. Unfair , bias pricing.",1
11630,Not getting the right discounts,4
11631,So many options and sales!,5
11632,I love thredUP it's my stress reliever & I'm glad prices are low as I think I'm shopping on it daily!,5
11633,Love it! The only problem I'm having is that I want to buy all the things 😩,5
11634,"I love to shop, like most women. This place is awsome! Thank you for ThredUp!!! Being on a buget and this place helps me not get in trouble.",5
11635,it kep tuning blue on my screen like i was copying something,1
11636,I will never shop on this site again i will alert All the people i recommended not to shop! I returned 80.93 worth of items back to you just like you sent to me and you gave me a credit for 13.44 not making Any sense to me! After i get my money and answers i will be deleting this app forever! Fraud!,5
11637,NOT what I'd hoped for,1
11638,Great app; I've had it crash a couple times. It opens right up with no problem.,5
11639,Easy to use. So many brands and the prices are amazing.,5
11640,Everything I've ordered was exactly the was it was pictured an the description. I've order 4 times from them. Luv this app,5
11641,Great quality and great prices!!!,5
11642,Easy to use,5
11643,I tryed i fill my cart but it want let me so i guess i want buy nothing. Good bye,3
11644,Love this app!,5
11645,It's so easy to shop on. They have so many cute things. I for sure recomend this app.,5
11646,Love it but it is a little difficult to search for types of items.,4
11647,High end thrift shopping from home!,5
11648,"New at this. I'll have more to say when I send in a few returns and clothes to sell on-line. I love the shopping, delivery and the professional services.",5
11649,It's a really good app to sell and buy clothes. It really helps the environment to buy second hand clothes. :),5
11650,I found a very cute skirt and a very nice top to match it! thank you thredup!,4
11651,I have been a customer for well over 4 years and I have to tell Everyone who reads this I LOVE THIS STORE!!! There are some really beautiful things like my purses and shirts. I could have never been able to afford if I were to purchase at a department store. It's addicting!! The return policy is wonderful. Like I already said. Love this store.,5
11652,"Unfortunately there are no thrift stores around where I am living, so this app is the bomb. There are always coupons available somewhere so it makes the deals even better. Easy to navigate. The only issue I have is that when I leave the app while on ""my thredup"" and return maybe an hour later the app is stuck on that page and I have to close the whole thing to be able to use it again. A little annoying. But still love it. <3",5
11653,"2017---I love this app!! It is super user friendly and the clothes are always exactly what I ordered..great prices and great quality used..or in most cases BARELY used items!.and in such cute packaging!..life long customer here!!....and now in 2020, They wanted me to review again after over 3 years of buying with them. Never sold anything but still love to buy here!! Still my favorite place to shop online and would definitely (and do often!) reccomend thred up!",5
11654,"Great selection, great quality, returns are easy.",5
11655,You suck nothing for men,1
11656,"It is hard to chat with sales associates, and the chats usually end before you get answers.",4
11657,Love it!,5
11658,"Every time I order something it does not fit like the standard size I wear, it is a hassle to send back, the selling process is an joke and they will give you 5 cents despite selling items far above what thrift clothes should be. Hate it.",1
11659,Always so easy to navigate through!!,5
11660,I really enjoy this app. Second hand shopping with a first rate experience!,5
11661,I enjoy Thred Up,4
11662,Love ThredUP!,5
11663,"Very straightforward. Easy returns. No hassles. Love it, especially in this pandemic. Thanks Thredup!!",5
11664,Great,5
11665,"So far, knocking it out of the park! Happy with my purchases and they arrived very quickly! 😊😊",5
11666,After the bang this clothing thrift store is good with name brands.,5
11667,I love clutch purses and I got a great one on thredUP. Black leather in amazing shape.,5
11668,Love thred up,5
11669,Fun,5
11670,"Best way to buy clothes. The clothes are hardly used, some none at all, for a real low price.",5
11671,The app is very easy to navigate and the fact that my sizes are saved is awesome. Thanks thred up. Love it,5
11672,"This is the worse app for selling clothing that I've ever came across! I sent in over $150 worth of clothing ( including 3 brand new, never worn coats ) and wound up with $17.39 for my trouble. Now I can't even get that because the ""Cash Out"" link doesn't work which I'm beginning to believe is intentional!",1
11673,I love how you have 7 days in the shopping session if you wish. My orders come quickly and the clothing is like new,5
11674,It's like thrift shopping from your phone! A really great app to have during quarantine right now. I only wish they sold mens clothes as well.,5
11675,So much great stuff! Great quality!,5
11676,Love thredUP!,5
11677,Love this shopping experience,5
11678,Got the wrong size and i cant get a hold of anyone to return them,1
11679,Love it!! Clothes always packaged neatly and smell good.,5
11680,It's great. I love my online thrift and vintage app!,5
11681,Easy to use,4
11682,"So much fun to shop this web site. I can't believe how many items are available. So many of my favorite designers, clothing, handbags, shoes and more! You have a loyal client now.",5
11683,"Not sure what's going on but ever since the most recent update, the app won't work. No matter what I click on, it just clocks and nothing ever loads.",3
11684,"Great deals, exciting sales, love the app!!",5
11685,"I love using thredUP! Easy to use, convenient, and such great deals! I shop here for all occasions.",5
11686,"Great clothes, fast shipping and great sales",5
11687,Thank you for letting me raid my grandmother's closet...,1
11688,It a very easy app to use.,5
11689,"I've never had a problem 😊. No matter what I order it fits. I receive everything earlier than the estimated time. It's my ""go to"" place.",5
11690,"I am disabled so someone else buys all my clothes from Walmart for me, needless to say I am thrilled I gave THRED UP a try. First order and very pleased with everything. All look brand new. THANKS THRED UP......If thinking of trying you should.",5
11691,Great clothing options at reasonable prices. I just recieved an outfit I ordered and I wouldn't have known otherwise that it wasn't brand new.,5
11692,The site is so very easy to use.,5
11693,I love this app. They have the best clothes at such good prices.,5
11694,Love it,5
11695,They have tons of nice items I would love to have but some of the items I really think are too high for used clothing.,4
11696,I bought a Vera Wang. Looked new. I dont really know how i receive money from the 2 bags i sent in!?,5
11697,Great prices. Everything in like new condition. This is how I dress myself and my 4 girls!,5
11698,Orders are shipped fast,4
11699,"I found this app very easy to use and very organized. I like to search using filters, and everything works perfectly. Also, I received my first package from thredUP and everything is looking great. I recommend it.",5
11700,Love this app!,5
11701,Great place to shop. Awesome deals On target with the description of acticles A very Happy Thrifty Shopper!!😁😁,5
11702,"Dangerously Awesome. Addictive. I have almost completely replaced my wardrobe for under $500. Quality of each item is stated. Only trouble I've had is that I didn't pay attention to the sizes of the ""similar items"" at the bottom of the product page. The similar items weren't even close to my sizes. It would be very helpful if those items were limited to my sizes like the rest of the app.",5
11703,Very fun app to look for secondhand clothes. All the clothes seem to be good quality and it's nice that there are filters. Also there is a wide variety of sizes and styles which is nice. Been my favorite app for a while!,5
11704,Found great finds at great prices. Great way to be sustainable.,5
11705,Love the app,5
11706,Just joined last week and I love it!,5
11707,"I will never buy from here again. They use fedex smartpost and it's been over a month since I placed my order and the package was ""shipped"". No delivery date at all.",1
11708,Easy to maneuver,4
11709,I think it's a cool way to shop second hand even though it's not the same as going to the thrift store itself.,5
11710,No men's section.,1
11711,Great,5
11712,"Easy searching for exactly what I want, which beats the retail thrift experience by far! What I've purchased has been in very good condition. Anything that didn't fit was easily returnable. I absolutely love ThredUp!",5
11713,"Perfect. Great clothes, great price and fast shipping.",5
11714,Great app to clean out things you no longer wear,5
11715,Not using it,1
11716,"Overall fabulous shopping app for second hand clothing. Great pricing. I wish they would add filters to our 'liked"" items, and the ability to ask questions on items.",5
11717,Love love love,5
11718,Nice and easy and made for me !!!,5
11719,"I really like to go to thrift stores, and since that's not an option right now, I tried ThredUP. WOW! It's awesome! I love that I can use lots of specific filters to really hone in on what I'm looking for and they have TONS of great stuff. I always look for items with tags on them still or that look brand new (a filter). I highly recommend ThredUP!",5
11720,Easy to use,4
11721,"The clothing options and styles are amazing, and the prices are perfect! I love the goody boxes the most, they are perfectly taylord to what I like. it would be awesome though, if a men's department was added so that men can also shop and get goody boxes!!",5
11722,The deals are good if you don't have to return an item. Between the restock fee and the shipping fee it's just not worth it.,3
11723,Waiting to experience,5
11724,"Always loved thred up, and now they are offering monthly or every few months for boxes of stylist chosen clothing. Can't wait to see what is in store for my first box.",5
11725,"Everything I have received so far has been in excellent condition, a few items looked brand new. I'm loving the awesome deals.",5
11726,Fantastic and fun! Love it!,5
11727,"I was a stay at home person even before the quarantine, addicted to online shopping and always looking for a good deal. I needed new clothes and discovered thredUP, and it is perfect for me! A lot of the clothes are ""gently used"", but many are like new or are actually new with tags. Returns are easy and you can get your money back or store credit. Believe me you get more value out of store credit. Did I mention the deals are amazing???",5
11728,"Love the clothes, quick delivery, and very affordable prices. I highly recommend",5
11729,Easy to navigate. Only thing... Please take shots of the inside of wallets and purses/ handbags. It'll make me buy more.,5
11730,"Love shopping on this app. Great photos, descriptions also include the measurements, and the deals are amazing!!!",5
11731,Great place to shop and sale clothes. I love how you earn points and can cash them in.,5
11732,"I love ThredUp, it's the best way to shop during quarantine!",4
11733,I've ordered twice. The first order came slow due to covid but u can't blame that on them. I just ordered the 2nd today so I'll update and let u know about delivery. I had trouble with a pair of jeans. The bottoms was cut off making them to short but as soon as I told them what happened they refunded my money within 2 days and told me to keep the jeans! And u have to really look at the size! Other then the size thing it's a great company!! I've told all my friends and family! Thanks guys!,5
11734,Love shopping here!,5
11735,Wow...,5
11736,"Great app, super idea. You can also find items at any size. So if you are super slim or super full figured, they have something for you.",5
11737,App would not download to my phone and my phone is updated.,1
11738,Best selection and prices above any other company or app.,5
11739,I love this app,5
11740,"At first I thought this was a great app. A thrift store online, and it was! But then it got popular. And the price went up... A LOT. Dont waste your time. You can buy knock offs and look a likes for HALF the price of clothes you'll find on this app. You can go to Goodwill and get the same thing for a QUARTER of the price. ThredUp just isnt worth it anymore and it shames me to say I won't be using it again.",1
11741,Love the App. Love the clothes and all great Deals,5
11742,"Absolutely amazing. My orders arrive on time. Every item fits perfectly. I have never been this happy with an app that sells clothes. I definitely recommend to anyone who wants something affordable, reliable, and clothes that fit properly for once.",5
11743,"Works fine, a little like shopping at thrift store.",4
11744,This is great.,5
11745,"This App is wonderful, so rasy to shop and view the items up close from your phone. Give it s try you will love it!!!",5
11746,"I'm absolutely in love and addicted to this app! Shopping and returning items couldn't be any easier. Not to mention, the prices are amazing! I definitely recommend this app to everyone I know!",5
11747,So easy to use and not a good app for shopaholics lol I love buying through Thredup. Lots of great deals!!!,5
11748,"A few improvements to the search feature, and then the filters would be nice. (Search by desired item instead of company, and then filter by sleeve length or fit.) But overall excellent app.",4
11749,Great way to save money! You can return items when they don't fit. Plenty of information including materials and condition of the item! It would just be easier if there was an option to filter by chest measurement because sizes M/L etc. are very misleading and it takes more time to find perfect fit.,4

11751,THEY STEAL YOUR CLOTHES AND DONT PAY YOU FOR THEM ITS A SCAM!,1
11752,Love buying from thredup! They have reasonable prices and almost always have a promo code to use that gets ya an additional % off!,5
11753,"Love it, cant reach customer service I have sent in messages to change my email and no one has updated my acct or acknowledged my email msg.",3
11754,"Love it! First time buying clothes online. Hard to fit something's just right. But I am learning. Only bad thing is I thought I was buying a jumpsuit and it ended up being a dress, thankfully I still like it!",5
11755,"Since,Everything going on right now. I really feel safer shopping online. The only downfall is not being able to try stuff on first. Other than that. This app and business and their people are awesome. You can get named brand stuff for less then a thrift store. They have all kinds of deals. Be a bargain hunter like me and save that money. Make your money work hard for you.",5
11756,Love this store! Great clothes for a great price!,5
11757,One of my favorite apps to go to on a daily basis.,5
11758,The prices are great and easy to find what you want thanks thredUP,5
11759,Splurge without a guilty conscience!,5
11760,Bought 3 very beautiful tops for amazing prices. Though shipping was slow on 2 of the shirts I understand given the current situation in the world! I will definitely purchase from again in the future!,5
11761,I've completely converted myself into only buying used clothes. This company was a contributor to this lifestyle change. Customer support is a gem! Please support this company!,5
11762,"If you are using this site to complete a Design Home diamond app requirement, don't!!! You'll never get your points! Still fighting with Tapjoy because Thredup said I wasn't a first time buyer! Each site doesn't have anyone to speak to! Thredup said that I could ""chat"" with an agent, but it might take up to 10 days! Save your money! Very disappointed!",1
11763,"Able to look up my fav brands for an awesome price! Secondhand is amazing, thank you thread up!!",5
11764,I love this ap,5
11765,GREAT AND CHEAP.,5
11766,Wonderful experience.,5
11767,"Four of my pants stated size 24, but are a 24 for a child. The rest fit.",3
11768,"Way too expensive, some items cost more than they would cost brand new.",1
11769,App works well and functions like it should. The clothes I've gotten so far were great too!,5
11770,"Used to have issues with the app, but no problems now. I'm hooked once again. They have tens of thousands of items from cheap to designer and luxe. It's not all used. Some still have tags. Desktop site has more functions, but I still like the app better. My only complaint is on sizing. We need to be able to search by chest and waist in inches. It's frustrating when some size 11s are a 28 waist, and other size 11s are a 34 waist, for example.",5
11771,Too expensive,1
11772,"So great! Shopping only in ""my size"" items regardless of label number etc is novel and AWESOME! love love love!",5

11779,"LOVE the app, ease of shopping & quality of clothes!!!!! BEWARE: they use FedEx!!! I have had trouble with half my shipments and 1 is lost in Nashville now!!",5
11780,"Now that I figured out how to filter for size petite, I like it even more. Also discovered the bundle option, which I think allows you to get free shipping.",5
11781,Tread up us a joke I sold three items and they got about 30 dollars off my three items they issued me two dollars and took that tread up is definitely a rip off never again,1
11782,Im so in love! Ecerything i buy is in great condition and fits great! Love the bargain! I can't stop buying lol!😊,5
11783,"I love ThredUp! It's a great way to get nice clothes for a reasonable price. The app is super easy to navigate and use, which is great because I pretty much never use my computer these days. The prices are great, but more like TJMaxx or Marshall's than true thrift store prices. Regardless, I've gotten some great deals.",5
11784,Love it!,5
11785,Good. Only one item sized wrong.,4
11786,Love it,5
11787,Love the clothes,5

11789,I love to shop and this is so eazy.,5
11790,I have ordered several times and been sent the wrong size. One was a child size and the other was a man's pants. Its hard to contact them and expensive to send clothes back. I'm done with them.,1
11791,"I am a huge fan of this site. I have bought many items here and each has arrived in great condition and because they go the extra mile and give measurements when they can, not just the size, each item has fit perfectly. And you just can't beat the prices!",5

11795,"This is supposed to be used clothing so why is it being sold at such a high price? You're selling it like it's new so?? I usually can buy like 15 items for $30 at Goodwill per say, but here it's $30 for ONE item. Nah.",1
11796,"Very nice app, I do wish it had more varieties like purses and shoes however overall I'm pleased. Easy to navigate and know what's what.",5
11797,Great,5
11798,"Affordable, Fun Shopping Always 5-Star Quality",5
11799,Hopefully you don't need to get a hold of customer service or try to cancel an order. I will be deleting my account.,1
11800,"I think thred up is kinda scammy and don't like that they choose the percentage you get based on the price they chose, it should just be a set percentage for all items, but if you're just going to donate your clothes to savers or whatever any way may as well send it to thred up. Definitely not something you should expect to make money on, depop and poshmark are better for that.",2
11801,Always have something I need in my wardrobe in my size and great prices!,5
11802,This is the best thing since sliced bread.,5
11803,LOVE IT! So easy to navigate.,5
11804,"Worst experience ever and I won't repeat it. Sizes weren't even close to the correct size, and additionally, they don't tell you that knee length actually means ""anywhere between the hip and the knee"". Garbage site that only gave me more things to give to charity. So dissapointed!!",1
11805,Love it,5
11806,Wow. I love thredup so so much! I'm addicted. I have spent so much on here. Great deals! Speedy delivery! Great for any clothing need!! 😍,5
11807,"You can scroll mindlessly through clothes forever. I prefer pages on the website. Otherwise an intuitive app, easy to navigate.",4
11808,Not many exceptional clothes. Prices only so-so. Not what I expected. Same clothes kept re-appearing when I was scrolling through. Poor descriptions yet they charge re-stocking fee. Takes long time to load! Hard to change filter. Uninstalling,1
11809,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THREAD UP!!! I love selling, I love buying, I love everything about Thread Up. Amazing customer service and excellent packaging and shipping is super fast. I can't say enough about Thread Up.",5
11810,Awesome,5

11812,Love it,5
11813,"Love ThredUp, love the app! I've always enjoyed shopping second hand and being able to search for a large variety of quality items online is awesome... especially during quarantine! I would love it even more if there was more measurements.... like on kids jeans and a chest size on jackets!",5

11834,Great Prices and Items!!,5
11835,"I love this website! Name brand clothes are cheap! I love the affirm option if you make a big order. The new points you get towards free shipping is really awesome. Shipping is pretty standard. I rated 4 stars due to these few flaws in my shopping experience(s) with this app I have on occassion, 2 times, was shipped the item that was pictured but not as described. I ordered sz8 jeans recieved sz3. They don't have a mens catagory. Returns have restocking fees.",4
11836,Great clothes at great prices.,5
11837,Not for men,1
11838,I love thredup! My fav new addiction!,5
11839,Dangerous app!!! While quarantining online retail therapy has been my go to. This app is awesome and dangerous at the same time. I'm going to need a bigger closet!,5

11841,Just bought a whole new wardrobe for just under $300. I'm a happy girl!,5

11844,Easy shopping experience. Love being able to buy just-like-new and gently used clothing online. Great option for those who don't want to buy fast fashion.,5
11845,Super easy to shop for clothes and returning clothes are just as easy!! So many cute things on this app as well!,5
11846,"Great for those on a real budget! Seriously, for about $400, I got well over what would have retailed for probably $2,800. I mean, where are you going to find quality items that are often luxury brands for less than you'd spend at Target?",5
11847,Easy online shopping great prices!,5
11848,You charged my husband's account and denied the product.,1
11849,Great buys on Designer clothes! It is so much fun and addicting. I buy all my clothes here now! They have new and like new Designer clothes at unbelievable discounts!,5

11853,Great online thrift store!,5
11854,"I've had an awful lot of issues with being kicked out, no access to the outlets and more but I'm willing to put up with it for the stuff this place has!",5
11855,Love that you can use promo codes for ever bigger discounts. Easy to use. I just don't like that some items expire sooner while in my cart makes me feel rushed.,4

11862,Very fast and reliable. The engineer team did a superb job on the app.,5
11863,Thrift shopping at the tip of your fingers...,5
11864,"Lots of options for items. Can find pretty decent prices, though some are a bit much. But overall it's a great place to find discounted items",5
11865,Misleading item quality and outrages return fees. I saw the low cost return fees when purchasing and now see a 8.99 processing fee for returns!,1
11866,Love the clothes and app works great!,5
11867,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE thredUP. This app has been well thought out and is intuitive. Great job. Keep up the good work.",5
11868,Easy. Love the saved searches with push notifications.,5
11869,Love it.,5
11870,The BEST online thrift store shopping. Absolute amazing idea to do an online thrift store. If you ever gone thrift store shopping to stand there and sort through everything is exhausting but this is AMAZING!!!,5

11874,Could not get it to take both rewards,5
11875,App has trouble loading on slower connections,4
11876,Love the variety and prices,5
11877,Good,5
11878,"Very easy to use. People are given a great coupon when first using the app, so I suggest patiently going through the categories to get what you want a at a discount price. The items came as pictured/described :)",5
11879,"Happy overall, but find the sales a little frustrating. You get a great sale notification, then find out it only applies to specific items (not that cute skirt you've been eyeballing).",4
11880,Easy to Use App for a Great Company,5
11881,Found that the selections I made didn't fit although I looked carefully at the description. I also found the quality of many items poor.,1
11882,"Search engine is weak, not enough options how to separate different types of shoes for example. Not enough description. Prices are way too high for used items. Frye boots which are ""hugely discounted"" costs $98!! I bought same boots in a good shape for $38 on Poshmark...",2
11883,I really enjoy this.. It's a lot of fun!,5
11884,"Was excited to get my items and once I opened my package, one of the shirts looked like it had dog or cat hair all over it. I would think you would wash or clean the clothes before sending to clients...",3
11885,I purchased some true religion jeans a while back and the jean material was so rotten. It ripped all over. Then I saw it was non refundable/do not return. You should take these back. I didnt do it!!!!!,2
11886,Love finding just what I want in my size for a fraction of the cost.,5
11887,"great fit, clothes, and shipping time",5
11888,Love them!!,5
11889,"Presentation at opening a box is like the big box stores, neatly wrapped. Choice of products is Fabulous!",5
11890,I have been very happy with my purchases for the last 9 months since I started ordering. I would love if they would start including hip measurements on pants and dresses.,4
11891,Great prices and clothes in excellent condition.,5
11892,The clothes are so ugly,1
11893,Love!! I absolutely love the fact I can flter my search results to narrow the items down to the exact pool of things I'm looking for. Prices and sale discounts are amazing. ThredUp is undeniably the best.,5
11894,My FAVORITE place to shop!! AMAZING😊,5
11895,I really love all of the things I have ordered. I find them to be in good to excellent shape. It's affordable and that's good news for because I'm on a budget.,4
11896,Love this app! Items came quickly and looked exactly like the picture!,5
11897,Excelente ...rapido... igual que las fotos.,5
11898,No name brand logo clothes amd prices too high. I hated it but mecari and letgo are awesome,2
11899,Fun and great selection!,5
11900,Love this place. With all the second hand stores closed this is my place to get jeans .still love this place,5
11901,Fast and quality items,5
11902,I love being able to find excellent quality lightly used clothing. It's so easy to live a greener lifestyle. The app performs as well as any other I've used.,5
11903,"Even with everything going on with covid 19, my order was shipped promptly. The item I bought was in terrific shape. Will definitely be doing more shopping here in the near future",5
11904,"Love the items and prices, so glad i found this app!!!!",5
11905,Easy to use,5
11906,"Last week I had an option to track my order but couldn't track it yet because it was too soon. This week that option is gone and when I tap on My Orders it says I have no orders but they sure took out $24.77 from my account. Now I can't talk to a person. It seems to be a scam, be careful",1
11907,"If you like to shop, or even if you like to browse, it's a fun app. To go too.",5
11908,In love with this site! So affordable and great quality clothing with trusted shipping amd handling.,5
11909,"User friendly, a gazillion different ways to search and nothing quite like the thrill of scoring a New with Tags super cute or fun but still work appropriate top from your fave brand at a fraction of the cost!",5
11910,Tons of brands to choose from!,5
11911,I absolutely love ThredUp! I have loved everything that I have ordered & received! There has not been anything that I didn't like or didn't fit! I love this site so much that I will never buy new from a store ever again! Thank u for what all u employees do! I greatly appreciate all of u!! Have a bless day!,5
11912,"Love this concept! Make sure you sign up for the rewards before your first purchase! Apparently they can't retroactively give you points even if you sign up right after first purchase which I find odd. Other than that, great experience 😊",4
11913,Love this app!!!,5
11914,"Very Bland. Especially being plus size. Love the Cause they are trying but not a lot of items are in my size or worth it. Id have a better time on Mercari, Etsy or Amazon to find good things for less. If you are a size 14 and under this app would work for you then.",1
11915,Love it! Love the clothes for the price!,5
11916,"This app is fantastic ! Every purchase I have made has surpassed expectations and all items reflect the standards of all the well known brands on their labels! The clothing is affordable, adorable, and this app has cemented it's place in my shopping future while illistrating other shopping apps inferiorities. thredup, you are doing a great job with the clothing for sale on your site ! Ty for making the countries S.I.P. orders feel a bit brighter.",2
11917,"I love the my new purses. The only complaint I have is the labeling of my coach wallet. It's more if a check book holder and not a credit card wallet. Although it's in really good conditions, now I just have to figure out how to use it since I don't carry checks.",4
11918,"It's all used items at full or above retail, horrible app and horrible site.",1
11919,"I won't shop anywhere else now. The clothes are all quality and I love that I am buying preowned clothes, which is better for the environment.",5
11920,How far is very useful,5
11921,"Besides all the great prices, they even wrap it with tissue before sending...🥰",5
11922,I just received my first order today and everything I ordered is perfect. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Can't wait to order more. Thank You,5
11923,Great app. Easy to use.,5
11924,Love this app way too much!!,5
11925,Great shopping form you nice day.,5
11926,Love it,5
11927,Contacted company several times never heard back from them. Chat with support. Just an email. Cannot figure out how to talk to a person. I just wanted status on items ordered. Not sure I will buy from them again,1
11928,No MENS CLOTHING!!!!!,1
11929,It is so stupid,1
11930,Payouts aren't very high and it could use some improvements.,2
11931,"Every time I try to get my label from my email the app logs me out and says I'm not entering the right password when I am. If I try to get my label from my account on a computer then it brings me to an error web page and says the label is no longer available. I have reached out to customer service via email and Facebook and no one will help. This is completely ridiculous. Terrible site, terrible app, TERRIBLE COMPANY",1
11932,"Easy, and so many ways to save! A few advantages over using website, too. It can run a little slow from time to time. Always so much fun!",5
11933,I just received my first box of three. Very satisfied. Great way to shop!!! Thank u,5
11934,"I ordered 2 clean out bags. They turned one of them into a DONATION bag.. and refused to help me. Was told there's nothing they could do. NO customer service phone number..only email and chat, if you can get through. No one returns emails or tweets like they promote. DO NOT trust them with your items..it happened to me and can happen to you.",1
11935,"The only reason that this app has any stars is the layout and quantity. But the app itself is super faulty. The notifications are never correct, and the app won't stop crashing every time I try to edit the filters on a search while using my computer. It is incredibly frustrating and crashes a ton",3
11936,"Just got my 1st order in, I bought 3 shirts and 2 shoes. I wish there is a way u can see the item as is, because it was not like the condition in the picture. 1 shirt had so much hair on it and it smells like she just wore it that same day. Another shirt has soooi much fuzz from all the washing, the shoes are very dirty. Its a bit miss leading as far as how they describe the items. I love the concept of what they're trying to do, but the items aren't worth it.",2
11937,There's no men's section What The......,1
11938,"Love this app!! You can find pretty much any clothing item you can think of. The prices are fantastic. The only thing I would change is my clothes came in 4 separate shipments. Idk if they have different distribution centers, I didnt think to look on the boxes, but all 4 came on different days. 1 was a large box with 8 items, 1 box had 3 items, and then 2 bags with 1 shirt each. Just seemed a waste of packing materials if they are coming from the same center. And each item is folded nicely!",5

11940,Always finding the best clothes. I love that the inseam length is listed.,5
11941,"Obsessed with this site! Great products, great sales!",5
11942,"This is the worst online consignment shop. It took 1 month to ship. Another month to process. An additional month to post and now 45 days for a payout of my sold items because they have changed the return process to 45 days. If you have a lifetime to wait this is great for you. For those of us who do not have time to waste, stay away!!!!",1
11943,"I really like this with the idea of reusing and bringing the variety in one place needed to find used clothes and the goody boxes; but I don't understand why the search feature is so weak. Why can't I search for short sleeves dress in knee length. Why can't I used my chest size to find items (it is listed in description). I would appreciate if description would include presence of pocket for dresses and skirts and also the waist/narrowest part of the dress or skirt, not just the chest and length",4
11944,👌🏻,5
11945,Clothes true to size. Quick shipping. Great prices.,5
11946,"Second hand clothes. They call it a thrift store. Go in a thrift store you see $1., 2. Slightly higher. Every item on here is way overpriced! Unistalled pronto.",1
11947,Easy to use and good purchase. I recommand 200%,5
11948,Good,5
11949,"Overall pretty great, descriptions are not always accurate, bought a ""sports bra"" it's a bathing suit top...still enjoy shopping though!",4
11950,Great app,5
11951,I love this app! Easy to use and great items! Some items can be pretty expensive considering they are used but over all I have bought two things and am not disappointed.,5
11952,Love it!,5
11953,Great shopping. My favorite place to get clothes.,5
11954,Best site ever for recycle!,5
11955,Great,5
11956,"Really love this app, finding just what I need for a good price!",4
11957,I absolutely love this app.. And I tell my friends about my ThredUp experience..,5
11958,"Fast shipping, easy checkout, and even easier navigating through the app. Hooked!",5
11959,Today was my first time using this app. I really enjoyed browsing through the clothes and shoes. I just made my order.,5
11960,Best shopping experience ever!!,5
11961,"So great! They donate to charities, they pay for shipping and they help you clean the clutter",5
11962,"Difficult to understand how this site works exactly. Not told u have to order ur buy back for 10.99. I shopped for a sale of 25%-OMG and machine refuses to accept. So what do u do?? Not much support for newbies. I spent several hours seeing what to buy, then just have to it expire. Earned 20% off but this should be when I choose to use or not. Very frustrated. This site sucks. Cannot get help u need. I will not use this site ever again. They sent me back the items I returned. No way to find help",2
11963,Very good business app. Good quality clothes good prices. Fast reliable shipping Even during the Covid pandemic,5
11964,I just received my first purchase and i love everything!! Thank u Thred Up !!!,5
11965,The products are wonderful but if there is a problem with anything you have absolutly NO ONE to help you get it straightened out . There is not a single human being for you to speak with. The customer help line is a freak8ng computer. There is no way to get help because after the computer times you out you have to resort to email . This is an issue for me,2
11966,So far so good!,5
11967,I love this app it has a great selection on clothes,5
11968,"This app makes shopping secondhand online pretty simple! They list the measurements (no more wondering what size you are for each brand) as well as the item condition (like new, some fading/pilling, damaged spots) so you can decide if it is worth the price. I've also sent in items and love getting shop credit for the clothes I don't wear anymore. I recently lost quite a bit of weight, and ThredUp has helped me find affordable clothes that fit without being able to try things on in a store.",5
11969,This app makes shopping more sustainable. Love the quality and selection.,5
11970,Great way to clean out the clothes we no longer wear and make room for the great deals thredup has.,5
11971,"Update: 5/2020. I don't know what has changed, but the sizing of clothes is way off. The last 4 items I purchased were not correct size. It seemed like they were child sizes. I'm done using this app.",1
11972,"I love ThredUp for revamping my wardrobe sustainably. It's great that you can favorite items, save your searches, and earn points to redeem for discounts and to save on shipping. Love, love, love!",5
11973,Easy to use. New arrivals every day.,5
11974,Find nice stuff on here,5
11975,"Items arrive torn or broken in some way with each shipment, app and websites are awful to navigate, customer support doesn't respond, codes don't work sometimes even if you follow the fine print, no place to put in gift card codes, and selling nice things on there only earns you a few pennies if you're lucky. Sending them a manilla folder full of my issues to corporate tomorrow. Hopefully they will listen to me this time.",1
11976,"Luv it. Customizable, programmable search., unbranded to top notch for super 40%, 50%, 65% discounts.. Cant wait to browse and order more.",5
11977,"3 of 5 pieces I received were perfect!!! The other 2 items were completely the wrong size!!! It was not at all what had been described. They are super cute and in great condition just the sizes had been way off. Also, reading the return policy it becomes more of a hassle then just getting rid of the items. I am going to give ThredUp another try, things happen but if I have another order that is completely different then what was described I will not order again just due to the hassle of returns",3
11978,Most favored shopping app,5
11979,Easy to use no stress,5
11980,"Thread Up App is fast and easy to toggle through. The images are on just as fast as I can scroll. Very Well put together. For every few images I see, there will be something for me to have to save in the likes section. The prices are low and they have done a great job.",5
11981,Absoutely love this app. I've found so many amazing items. Highly recommend.,5
11982,Perfect!,5
11983,The app works great most of the time. Sometimes pages refuse to load.,4

11985,imposible to reach customer service,1
11986,Easy to view and the filters are great!!,5
11987,"I think this app is absolutely horrible. I downloaded this app and after doing so I attempted to order a kit. I could put in my name, half of my address and then I was stuck... I don't know?? I've decided to abandon ship. Sadly. I have clothing people would injure themselves to have but because alot of these apps are BS with no firm grounding you waste time loading and unloading apps due to peoples ignorance.",1
11988,"Overall a pretty good shopping app, plus I love TU, the searches are as specific as you can get.",4
11989,Love the variety and prices!!!,5
11990,"I love this, the sizing and products picked for me to search through are perfect! Beautiful clothing to pick through. This site is the GOAT!",5

11994,Awesome clothes love wearing them,5
11995,This app is awesome! I've ordered a couple things now and the prices are amazing! Thank you thred up,5
11996,"Thredup - ""We only accept HIGH QUALITY items."" Me - ( Sees clothes that are LITERALLY from the 1960s searched by Google and Wrinkled/Miscategorized clothes as far as the eye can see ) ( Deletes App )",1
11997,Good quality clothes with good prices. Having trouble with app?? Where is the outlet section?,4

12001,This is my new favorite way to shop!,5
12002,Great app to find different brands of clothing and styles all in one place without having to go to the mall to get such a selection. Plus you don't have to deal with the seller. Just pick what you like.,5
12003,Very satisfying,5
12004,Very easy to find and order great deals and good quality clothing,5
12005,"Love thredUP! The app needs work. It is a bit buggy; I've had trouble entering promos and it seems a lot of items are duplicated as I scroll down through a category. And I get notifications of ""new items"" that match my saved search, but they aren't always really new items.",4
12006,I like that more of your prior cart items are displayed than on the website,5
12007,Fun and green shopping,5

12012,"FAKE CLOTHES.. LISTINGS LIE. Bought a ""100% Leather"" purse and its OBVIOUSLY plastic! Doesnt eveb say ""leather"" on the inside tag! It was also damaged. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE. Im contacting BBB and the NY State attorney general for false advertising.",1
12013,Love this app. Ordered a coat and a pair of shoes. Both were in excellent condition as described. I will definitely be ordering again.,5
12014,"I like this app and the thredUP concept but I am very disappointed with size filtering options. I have to wear Petites especially in tops but also most pants. Why aren't I able to search for only petites? My saved sizes shouldn't ""include"" petites it should be only petites. Or, at the very least, I should be able to save searches for petite tops, pants etc., even if the results pull only one or two items.",3
12015,Awesome app!! Great way to buy clothes from home!,5
12016,Luv to shop on this app!,5
12017,Plus sized dresses,2
12018,"The app is very user friendly. I like being able to use a lot of different filters to zoom in on specific colors, styles, prices. I love seeing the measurements, because one brand's large could be another brand's small. Sizes vary so much!",5
12019,excellent,5
12020,"Nice selection, order takes a while to get delivered though",4
12021,Been the best clothes and proces I've ever found. I have found so many amazing deals.,5
12022,This app constantly freezes up,2
12023,"Great brands, great bargains. No hassle shopping.",5
12024,I think you overcharge for used things.. especially the bags.. I can get a new MK bag/ totes on sale anywhere else for 100-$140 so I'm not paying 100-$170 on your site for something used.. sorry🤷‍♀️,1
12025,Love thredUP!! I literally order every week and its always a great shopping experience with wonderful customer service!,5

12043,"THRIFTY SHOPPER, I love diving through tracks of clothes to find treasures. This I can do from my couch during the quarantine. Get some workout clothes for now & work clothes when we go back to work!",5
12044,This is the best place to do all your shopping for clothes thanks,5
12045,"Love being environmentally conscious and buying used instead of creating more waste, I also love the older or outdated styles, I always get compliments! I have ordered off of this site many times with no issues and received it in a timely manner!",5
12046,This is the most amazing app. I hate going to stores and trying on clothes all day long only to come out empty handed. The prices are awesome.,5
12047,I have been a customer and seller for several years. I have some things from this site that is very much loved and used often.,5
12048,Love a good deal,5
12049,Love they products,5
12050,Always find what I want.,5
12051,I love Thredup? Much fun!,5
12052,So far my experience has been great. Saves my preferences and alerts me when a new item by designer is put on site,5
12053,Great!,5
12054,Great,5
12055,I'm obsessed. This app is extremely user friendly. I love the layout and experience of using it. It's too good. I recommend it to all of my friends and will be a customer for years to come!,5
12056,"I received 1 package out of 4. Okay, let me go back for a min. I had a few $100. All my clothes, all my stuff was stolen in the process of moving. This site said, 1st time buyers get 50% off, it's up to 50% off. 35 items tops in your cart. Ok... i need clothes shoes, you name it! I got my 35 items, saved $300 I got clothing for $3, $4,$5 nothing over $12 except shoes, stuff $30+ 1 package showed upped so far out of 4, tags on some, all looks new. Go for if take a chance! I'm so glad I did!!!!",5
12057,I had fun shopping the new merchandise. Show me more! I have bought a lot of product and it's like new or is new with tags.,5
12058,You guys are the worst you screwed me over for 200$,1
12059,I've ordered 3 times and put of the 3 times I have gotten a very worn or damaged item. I have better luck at a local thriftshop.,3
12060,"This shop is a truly good & environment friendly discovery, my first order arrived early, everything was in great condition (as the descriptions said). I have already made my next order.",4
12061,Love!!,5
12062,Quality clothing for low prices.,5
12063,Love this service,5
12064,"I love the selection on this app! However some of the prices are higher than what I want to pay for used clothes and alot of the sizes are misleading. Example: my child is 6yrs old and wears a size 7, some of the clothes I purchased were actually juniors 7s that were in the childs section. Descriptions are very vague as well.",4
12065,every single thing that I have bought from here has been absolutely phenomenal. I love it!! :-),4
12066,Great,5
12067,Love this app and ThredUp! Window shopping from home and everything I have gotten I adore!,5
12068,"Great app, something for everybody",5
12069,Easy to use,5
12070,"INSANELY good prices, lots of designer options",5
12071,"The app is great but more than half the items I received we're faded but the pics were vibrant & 2 items were covered in cat hair. Thread up consider dry cleaning & sanitizing these items 1st before taking people s hard, earned money.",1
12072,Easy to use app. Excellent for purchasing gently used or new and affordable clothing. Fast delivery. All items were as expected. :),5
12073,Excellent customer service. Amazing deals. So addictive. I do wish I could have reversed and then bundled my order though. They say you must cancel and pick your selections back up. I didnt want to risk it....but with the savings the shipping evened out. Love it!,5
12074,"Really easy shopping, great selection to choose from.",5
12075,I spent 19 plus tax on a cute pair of bootie boots and I got them tonight 5/13/2020 and the sole is glued honorably back on a very worn I WILL BE DELETING THIS APP AND WILL NOT RECOMEND IT!,1
12076,its great but only for the buyer if you want to sell to them they give u hardly nuthin for ur designer duds..and kind of trap u into doing so. Ur better off downloading and going on poshmark or mercari its simple enough to sell ur designer goods and to find deals is also better.just sayin,5
12077,"Most of the clothes I send in end up not being ""sellable"" for some reason...even clothes that have been barely worn. The last 2 bags I sent in were newborn to 3 m.o. baby clothes. A lot of which were never worn! Only about 10 items out of at least 60 were ""sellable."" They'll put a shirt up for sale, but not the pants that went with it & visa versa. I even made sure to fold them together to make sure they'd be sold as a set. So I'm not really sure how they pick what to sell & what to donate.",2
12078,"Love the app but when I want to back out it takes me back to the homepage instead, please fix this issue for 5 stars !!",4
12079,Great prices and selections!,5
12080,"Poor user interface, and price points are never worth it for me. I've browsed ThredUp for years and never made a purchase",1
12081,"The best 2nd hand online retailer ever! I'm absolutely obsessed with Thredup! Every single item I've bought from this app fits perfect, is exactly as described, has the BEST prices, and they come in their signature neatly packaged green and white polkadot box w/matching tissue paper (which I save!) Great for women & kids that want designer items for 80-90% off.",5
12082,I'd love to learn how to use this .,5
12083,"Great, everything just as advertised.",5
12084,Love this app Use it daily,5
12085,I wish we could win free stuff.,5
12086,Picture are better then on most commercial website apps like Kohl's or Bell's. I do wish there were more of a description but for what you get and pay for it is worth it.,4
12087,I always get great clothes and shoes! Great prices and fast shipping!,5
12088,"Love this app, use it often",4
12089,This is my favorite way to thrift shop.,5
12090,Loooove this app! Love the discounts!,5
12091,They suck,1
12092,I don't trust this,2
12093,"Addictive, eco-friendly way to shop. Many items new with tags or like new. Useful filters. Intuitive interface.",5
12094,Plus size women do not shop here why would I pay $66 for a second-hand dress 😂😂😒,1
12095,So Far All Is Good. Prices Are High For Used Stuff But You Are Getting Good High End Clothes For Cheap,5
12096,Love this site it's easy to navigate. I save all my favorites. They run great sales.,5
12097,👌,5
12098,"This app has glitched out to the point where i cant sign back in. Thredup itself has turned more and more disappointing. They do the work for you, but it's honestly not worth it for how much you make. If THEY give users a sale code for their app, the code cuts down the very few dollars or cents you can even make in the first place further down... But you don't get any say in if people can use codes or not on your items. Pretty lame. I'd rather just donate at this point.",1
12099,App crashes a lot or freezes.,2
12100,I had 5 pairs of shoes in my cart no shoe was more than 7.99. You sent one pair and charged me 30$. I will never order from you again and I will let everyone I know this sight is a scam.,1
12101,This is more like a thrift store for the rich. Doubt I'll be buying anything from here. Way above my spending limit. When I go to a thrift store I look for 8.00 to 10 dollar items. Nothing like that in here.,2
12102,Nice,5
12103,"The only thing I would change is to have more search options like sleeve length on dresses, etc. Slow sometimes but otherwise awesome.",4
12104,Little difficult to ck out but finally did.thankyou,5
12105,I enjoy everything about this app the past week of using it except that they dont offer stuff for men and it would be a nice easy way to also order items for the men in my life example my fiancee who hates clothes shipping if they offered mens stuff I could just look in his size show him the screen to see if it's something he'd wear and if so purchase it,4
12106,Ive been using thread up for 2 years and ive never had any issues with sizing. They are completely honest with the condition of the clothes and measurements. I love this company.,5
12107,Lots of fun! I like the filter options,5
12108,"Please Add ""Baby"", I Was Searching For Baby Bibs But I Couldn't Find Any",3

12122,Very easy to navigate site. Designer brands.,5
12123,I love order.. very nice cloth and shoes etc,5
12124,"I downloaded Thred Up thinking it would be a good place to buy USED clothes at decent prices. I was WRONG. Everything on their site is priced at retail prices, some of their stuff cost more than buying it brand new. They have good stuff but its way too high for being used not to mention some of it a couple years old . I was looking to buy some things n it was American Eagle and Aeropastle n I l saw the price on Thred Up n I went to their respective websites n the same things were cheaper there",1
12125,Awesome! The point system is great and they have sales constantly. Items ALWAYS come not damaged and I don't have to worry about pieces having huge problems.,5
12126,Have purchased a lot of products from this site happy with all of them for the most part.,5
12127,I love the convenience and quick delivery,5

I tried to call the number they provided my bank. It doesn't go through. Beware all of you tired of fraudulent practices.",1
12146,Excellent confition swcondhand clothes! Very pkeased so far,5
12147,I live everything I have gotten so far. This is truly a blessing to me.,5
12148,I love shopping here. I only see clothes that are the style & size I need. There is such a large variety to choose from and everything is always on sale! Best thing is I can buy things without leaving the house. It is shipped right away & comes nicely wrapped. It's a terrific customized experience.,5
12149,"Always find AMAZING items at great prices! It is addictive shopping for (hunting for) the tops and pants I find. I cleaned out my closet and sent everything to ThredUp and replaced almost everything shopping at ThredUp. My wardrobe got a big makeover and I couldn't be happier with what I have purchased! The more sale items, the more I seem to load into my cart!",5
12150,Times out too fast!!!,3
12151,"It's a joke. I ordered a box with my size (small) and received clothes that were medium. Did a closet clean out and sent great items, some with tags still on and those items were not accepted. Also beautiful coats as well. I wonder what happened to my clothes that they didn't accept? Save it for themselves to sell with no repayment to me? Ordered a travel bag and received a makeup bag. It is more of a hassle that it's worth. Clothes are overpriced. Should have paid attention to the reviews!",1
12152,Love it. Hate 1hr carts its stressfull,5
12153,The app is not working as I already reviewed this and rated it before. Also filters not as responsive.,4
12154,"Fun site, I've gotten some great tops I can wear to work. Tip, if you find something you love, put it in your cart right away, otherwise someone else may get it. The cart gives you some time to hold it. Then you can go back to shopping.",5

12163,Love everything I have gotten so far! Love the packaging!,5
12164,Biggest downfall was having to reset it back to my saved sizes every single time I searched,3
12165,Love everything on it and it all arrives on time. Plus the packaging is done well. So happy with this app I never have any problems with it. There are even special sales too! Great app recommending to friends and family!,5
12166,Easy to shop. Have created a whole new wardrobe. No complaints.,5
12167,"Love this app! Saves your selected sizes and when you search it only shows you what is in your size. You can filter it for length, color, or what kind of event you want (casual, formal, etc...). Always has some kind of deal on and you can do a closet clean out and your sellable items can be sold and you get profit from it and unsellable items will be sent to a textile factory to be recycled.",5
12168,Can not find what I'm looking for,1
12169,Loce the options,5
12170,Horrible! They sent me a plus size dress well worn and I am 7-8 junior,1
12171,I thought this was supposed to be like a thrift store and when I started checking out clothes for my daughter 6-9 months the prices we ridiculous. They price they wanted for used clothes is more then what stores charge..$12.99 for a onesie that want even name brand..No thank you. ILL BE UNINSTALLING THIS APP TODAY,1

12215,Fabulous!,5
12216,"It's been 2 months since 2 kits arrived to their location and it's STILL not processed. But my wife sent 7 kits to them the same day I sent mine and her kits have been processed a month ago and her things are for sale. I don't understand how we sent our kits the SAME DAY, the wife sent 7 kits and I sent just 2, yet mine hasn't even reached the 'processing' phase. As I learn more about this business the less I want to make them richer. They take way too much money for inexpensive items.",1
12217,I really like the clothes they offer and have only had good experiences with them.,5
12218,Always good stuff.. great prices,5
12219,Love the app its just addicting,5

12232,So far they have all the brands I love and the rewards are a wonderful plus. Thank You Thred Up♡,5
12233,Wonderful!!!! Need better descriptions on some items and show marks and flaws in pics on the clothing and accessories. Other than that I love the items I've bought.,5
12234,"Can find things I need that I can't afford to buy brand new and sometimes I find things that so have there tags. It's really nice cause I have found most of my daughter's athletic pants here too among other things for her, which is wonderful cause she is very rough on clothes and if I don't have to pay full price it makes it all that much better!",5
12235,"I love love thredup this is the only store i buy my clothe from. You get top brands like j brand, paige, coach, michael kors, nine west .... And many more for a steel price . the clothe are second hand but they look like brand new",5
12236,Exceptional shoping! All items are perfectly fit and lovely. I am so very pleased. Thank you!,5
12237,Really easy to use the filters and find exactly what I want. Both items I purchased were like new and fitt great. Super fast shipping. Easy experience.,5
12238,Just received my first order. The croptop was completely mismeasured. Instead of being 24 in in length measuring from the top of the shoulder it is 14 in in length. Much smaller than pictured. I will be returning it.,1
12239,Amazing second hand items!!!,5

12242,Great way to see fashion from everywhere in one location!!!,5
12243,Great prices and lots to choose from,5
12244,At first I was a huge fan of thredup but after my last purchase today they immediately cancelled my order and still took my money. I tried contacting them to ask why they canceled my purchase and no response. This is extremely frustrating and I'm very upset I've made many purchases before and even referred thred up to my friends and family. I'm not shopping here anymore!!! This is such horrible customer service I cannot believe you guys took my money and canceled my order!!!!,1
12245,I've been very haopy with every item I've received! I definitely recommend this app!,5
12246,Love it!,5
12247,"Love the concept and the item I purchased, but the website is confusing to navigate. I was unable to simply enter my preferred brands and sizes and view the items offered.",3
12248,"I rarely write reviews but I really like this app. I can put in my sizes and shop accordingly. I can also shop by brand name, which I really like because I tend to be loyal to certain brands that I know are true to their sizing!! One of the features I absolutely love is to go to my past orders and they show a thumbprint of the item I ordered!! The clothes that I have received have arrived on time and clean. I would highly recommend!!",5
12249,Good quality clothing. Items are not thrift store prices but still a good place to get clothing.,4
12250,Very good!,5
12251,I sent numerous bags of clothes and purses I received a half of bag back I want my money you are a rip offp,1

12278,"I will never shop anywhere again, this app is perfect! Love it!",5
12279,New user but so far I love it!!!,5
12280,Great selection and good prices. Just wish I could refine searches by more design features of the clothes mainly sleeves and pant style.,4
12281,"Love that I'm finding high end fashions like Prada, Gucci and Per Se Carlisle for up to 90% off all while reducing my carbon footprint and helping charities. Often the items are new with tags still attached. Be careful lol, it's addictive.",5
12282,Really good site so far do reccommend to other.,5
12283,"Cool prices, fast shipping, and always a great selection!!",5
12284,Vood.,5
12285,It's ok. Not that special prices are rediculus for used stuff on some of the stuff on there,3
12286,Awesome deals. Shipping even if it seems to take a while it's not due to them. If it is they are always friendly and eager to help rectify any situation and track something if you are concerned.,5
12287,it's ok but clothes are just as expensive as if you go to the mall.,1
12288,I buy so much from ThreadUp im never disappointed. I spend hours looking at clothes,5
12289,"Great choices and prices, unique items",5
12290,"Love the clothes, easy to find what I'm looking for, good prices. So far everything fits only one size up. Definitely my New go-to clothing store!",5
12291,Smooth filtering and order process. Found just what I wanted.,5
12292,"Absolutely love! Especially now during COVID-19, not being able to go to a thrift store, thred up has been my substitute! I've found so many great treasures & I can't wait to find more!!",5
12293,So far shopping on thredUp as been fun. I ordered 2 items. Well see if items are as described and shipping. I will leave feed back on that as well.,5
12294,This is the second time I have gotten something with a hole in it.,1
12295,Good,4
12296,"Great prices nice clean used clothes, and good return policy. I do a lot of shopping on Thedup. But once in a while the app freezes or I would give it five stars.",4
12297,"😔 I was hoping since in quarentine and being ""an online thrift shop"", meaning most of it is used, and with how big they claim to be... that this app would be cheaper than say walmart... Some of the clothes even look cheaper than walmart clothes but are priced way hirer than expected. Really bumbed out about this.",2
12298,"Me gusta mucho porq esta organizada por marcas aparte mantiene los registros q pones como talla , fotos claras en prendas blancas fuera mejor un fondo negro .",5
12299,I LOVE THIS STORE!!! GREAT SELECTIONS!!!!! AWESOME PRICES!!!,5
12300,So easy and quick!,5
12301,Expensive for used but the selection is amazing,4
12302,Perfect,5
12303,Love the variety!,4
12304,Great selection and prices,5
12305,This is the best online resale shop ever! The photos give you a very good idea of the quality of each item...along with a detailed description as well!,5
12306,Great deals. The hour timers can be annoying but I understand that people can't sit on items that way. Very satisfied.,5
12307,Amazing for shopping,5
12308,I love this store,5
12309,"I spent hours and days with my daughters ordering just their favorite things and mine. I kept putting these items in the cart for absolute days to weeks knowing I would buy them as soon as paid. After all that effort and with enough funds in my account, 3 out of 6 orders were cancelled for absolutely no reason. We went to the bank and were told that it was on the Thread up side, there was plenty of funds and that I needed to contact them. Meanwhile my 2 daughters are out their birthday presents",1
12310,"Expensive, when I started looking through the boys section I had to look and make sure these weren't new, thought this was a resale site. Pretty sure this is a resale app but the prices are basically what you'd buy new items for.",1
12311,"My new lock down addiction! Who can afford full price clothes right now?? Not me, but I'm still finding name brand clothes with tags still on them filtered by MY sizes. Introduce yoyr friends and you both get $10 coupons! Yeah Thred Up!!!!",5
12312,I absolutely can't say enough great things about this app!! Love love love!,5
12313,"Great clothing selections Easy to maneuver thru their website Quick response when you need help, when you need answers fast Great company! So if you want awesome clothes that are in decent condition, at a decent price, from an ethical company- Thredup is the place! Try them out, you'll be glad you did 😁, sincerely Suzanna Bateman",5
12314,Everything I have ordered are amazing quality,5
12315,"Ugh....I can't even say what's bad about it bc it was just overall ugh....not really fashionable pieces, largers sizes looked very ill fitting. Smaller sizes look dowdy and old. Not a good experience looking at clothes on mannequins or just hanging. They may need models. Or some kind of something....just no. Man, no",1
12316,Love it,5
12317,App Buggy sometimes. Otherwise fine. Customer service good,3
12318,It has free shipping when you order over 70 dollars it is a great app. Also it has cute outfits,3
12319,"The products are very nice! Make sure you know your size or at least your measurements. Now, Here is my complaint. This site has the worst shipping I have ever seen. I get things shipped from Wish faster than this site. Yet everything is in America, there is no reason for it. You can't talk to anyone about it either. I got 3 packages, One took about 10 days, one about 20, one is now delayed to 24 days. Had they sent them after when I ordered, I wouldn't care, they held onto them for weeks.",4
12320,I have sold several pieces with this app and can apply those sales to future purchases. This is a great service!,5
12321,I literally spend more hours on the ThredUp app looking for amazing bargains on previously owned and brand-new premium brand labels than I do on anything else. Thredup is always amazing and never dissapoints!,5
12322,Phenomenal Love It,5
12323,Cool thrift finds if you're willing to put in the effort,5
12324,So far so good I got a nice purse but I wish the photos of the clothing was better and that the descriptions where more accurate or if you could at least rate your purchase. I got a purse that said the minor defects and that it was almost new. Well the strap was broken and the edges where peeling and definitely more cosmetic damage than was described and it's non returnable. I was told to email you guys and I haven't heard anything at all,1
12325,Love searching on this app.. great deals and the clothes and shoes are always as described if not better,5
12326,"Total fan, they take great pictures which show details and they have great descriptions of the product. They list measurements such as inseams, waist and chest. They also list what the product is made of. It's a win-win and they have weekly specials too.",5
12327,"Very nice clothes, I only had to return one item, due to a tear on the leg.",5
12328,Love it!,5
12329,I have gotten some really cute clothes and shoes from Thredup. It has been a lot of fun,5
12330,I specifically shop for my sizes only and don't browse other sizes. I ordered a short that came to me 4 sizes smaller than what size it said it was.,2
12331,Love this app! They have every name brand you can think of and everything I have ordered either looks brand new or is still brand new with tags. Ships usually within a day! This is my first go to place when I am looking to purchase any type of clothing for either me or my kiddos!,5
12332,"This is such a great company with exemplary customer service. Their app is easy to navigate, and I always find exactly what I want!",5
12333,Gives me the opportunity to get quality clothes at a fraction of the price.,5
12334,Fabulous,5
12335,So easy to shop and great prices,5
12336,Thred up has such a wide variety to choose from that I've been able to find multiple garments. The prices are reasonable and everything I've ordered has been exactly as described.,5
12337,Great place but not always correct on size. Thhey dont post past 41for shoe size on size filter.,2
12338,Ok,2
12339,Lots of buttons in cats,5
12340,"Non-complicated app, easy and fun!",5
12341,I've ordered and received two items already. Fast shipping. Easy shopping. Love my items. They are like new. Just ordered my boots for half price. You have to shop here.,5
12342,"You have this option to send in your unwanted clothing and they'll go through it and list items so you can earn money. They have listed that they'll process your order within 14 days. They've now had my items (3 bags) for 24 days and have yet to even process it. I also messaged them 4 days ago about not processing my items and they have yet to respond. Awesome app for buying, horrible for selling. Also terrible customer service.",2
12343,Very nice merchandise and prices are fantastic,5
12344,"Post office always charges for return of items without proper free return tickets from seller Very happy with my purchases and time delivery of the packages. All in good condition and great closet upgrade, otherwise, thank you Thread Up......",4
12345,The best app,5
12346,Very easy to use and I am happy with the service.,5
12347,"It's a pretty great shopping app overall but it doesn'y have all of the clothing that you want. I was trying to find some new ripped jeans and I couldn't find any. It's also kind of not my style, I found a lot of plain clothing.",3
12348,"Easy, priced for budget, and quality clothes.",5
12349,Love the clothes at amazing prices,5
12350,"Absolutely my favorite place to shop! I can always find something awesome on here. My daughter is a runner, and fund such great Under Armour on here.",5
12351,Great prices and items are as described/as pictured,5
12352,Love it,5
12353,"Sizing is wonky. It's hard to determine if something will actually fit, I wish they'd provide actual measurements like hip or waist rather than just useless ones like the length of a skirt.",4
12354,Always quick and fast delivery. Loveeee this app.,5
12355,"In the beginning I only got this app to sell my clothes, didn't look through the clothes. Later on i decided to check it out and its great! Great clothes for such low prices",5
12356,The Best way to shop for clothing! Hands Down,5
12357,Great option to find quality name brand clothes at decent prices,5
12358,app is easy to use. i love it.,5
12359,Love,5
12360,Loved all my orders!! Great items at great prices!,5
12361,Love this lots of nice reasonable clothes,5
12362,Great Selection. Shipping Sucks and takes forever. Update: Shipping is Worse than Ever. And now they took away expedited shipping.,1
12363,Very easy and nice items,5
12364,Soo is not worth it! The app doesn't pay attention to what you're looking for,1
12365,The quality offered is superb. I thoroughly enjoy this store. Theres so much to choose from. Definitely recomend,5
12366,I love shopping on ThredUp! Soo many awesome finds at such great prices. Thank you soo much! 😊,5
12367,Great!! They do a great job packaging and sending very nice and very fast!! Thank you!!,5
12368,"Love shopping this site, esp. simply vera vera wang tops. I'm never disappointed in the variety of choices and don't have to leave home to shop. I love buying used what I couldn't afford otherwise!",5
12369,Great easy to use app,5
12370,I was immediately addicted,5
12371,I love the unique and sustainable finds on this site. As a seller it is crazy easy as well.,5
12372,Love this app! Love this form of buying experience! Brilliant!,5
12373,Excellent app quality clothing great prices so easy to return !!,5
12374,The clothes are amazing! The prices are amazing!,5
12375,Second time trying to download the app and it won't even open,1
12376,Perdida de tiempo.,1
12377,"Love this app, but would love to see at least one photo of inside of bags and shoes, and more search filters.",4
12378,Good source of quality clothing at reasonable prices.,5
12379,"The sizes are very transparent and I have been very happy with my orders, and they all fit!",5
12380,I really enjoy this. Maybe too much. All im saying is keep the styles coming.,5
12381,Best app I've ever downloaded. Clothes are in great shape and looks good. I'll keep enjoying and ordering from y'all,4
12382,This was a lot of fun!,5
12383,I've ordered a few times in the last 3 months and everything is in excellent like new condition and fits perfectly. Exactly as ordered. I highly recommend this app!!!,5
12384,Great shopping experience,5
12385,Good app,5
12386,"I can't say I am totally impressed. The two blouses I ordered were clean and well wrapped and arrived in a timely manner, but, one had a large hole in the front. The fabric had a busy pattern, so, it might have been missed, but, the item is still unwearable.",2
12387,"Love this app!!! My favorite part is if you are unsatisfied with your purchase, for any reason, you can return for a full refund (in store credit) or a nearly full refund minus a small restocking fee. They pay for shipping and your refund appears as a credit you can apply to your next purchase. You have nothing to lose!! They give you ample time to try the clothes on, decide if you're happy with them and then either mail them back in or add to your closet, forever! I love it!",5
12388,"It's great to shop for brand name items & not have to pay the high price tags in stores. A lot of the items run small, so you have to order a size or two up depending on what the brand name is. Some items are really pricey but you just have to watch what you buy. If your on a budget, I would suggest using this app!! It saves you LOTS of $$!! ThredUP is fast in shipping, so that's a plus!! The only thing I didn't like, was that unless you bundle your items, everything gets shipped separately.",4
12389,Always fast and cheapest prices!,5
12390,"I enjoy having the app on my phone instead of having to visit the website but I do find that it is very slow. I also wish it would suggest brands based off what you have purchased. I love buying from this company but I am done selling things with them, the wait time is far too long and I know some of the items I sent in were new with tags, high end brands that they chose not to list, likely because they were slightly over 5 years old.",3
12391,Excellent Service. Packages lovingly wrapped.,5
12392,Ordering from Thredup has been a great experience! The clothing I have received has been wonderful. I highly recommend this online shopping opportunity. 😄,5
12393,I love shopping on thredup,5
12394,i love to be able to do a something tosave the environment as well as making a few bucks on my gently used items.,5

12397,Great option to purchase clothing especially during quarantine.,4
12398,Excellent!!,5
12399,I can enjoy shopping for things I never would have been able to afford!,5
12400,"I've been using thread up for over a year, great concept and I've gotten some really good pieces so far. I've bought and sold. I wish a little more info was provided on item size and materials, but for the cost, it's worth it.",4
12401,My closet thanks you!,5
12402,I love it soooo much its awsome,5
12403,I like it and the cloths are cute and affordable,5
12404,"A littler confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, it gets easier to navigate. Love what they offer!",4
12405,"Awesome deals, and clothes seem brand new, love thredup 💯💯 HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to at least try, you won't regret it, LARGE SELECTION ON ALL kinds of clothes shoes bags/accessories and they even got kids clothes!",5
12406,Good way to shop,5
12407,"Love this company! Love the app. Search options could be better, especially for jeans. I'd like to search for high rise and navy (instead of just blue, typically jeans are blue). Absolutely crazy about the new feature offered to print a shipping label instead of waiting for a cleanup bag.",5
12408,Really slow on shipping even though I paid extra to have my items delivered sooner.,3
12409,I really enjoy shopping with thredUP... can't beat the quality & price,5
12410,I love thread up app easy to use. Wonderful prices and good quality clothes.,5
12411,Wrong item and wrong size Have been trying to return but site does not respond to customer services Also item was in poor shape Besides not even close to my jeans I wanted The retail new for what they sent me is less than what I paid,2
12412,"Enjoy bargin hunting from home, especially during quarantine...",5
12413,"LOVE, LOVE!!! Amazing selection, unbelievable prices!!!",5
12414,Top notch quality and super east fast and free returns. Love it!,5
12415,Iwhen my order came ididnt get my whole order.and customer service never contacted me back.this was my first time ordering from you and probably my last,1
12416,"I've had a issue with a few items that were supposed to be shipped to me over a week ago. After contacting thredup, I see little resolve to the issue in the minimal communication I've had with a representative.",2
12417,Becoming addicted. Love it,5
12418,Extremely user friendly. Fast and reliable shipping. Excellent customer service. This app is a must have!!,5
12419,Love it!!!!! Cute stuff!!!!,5

12431,Good clothing. Love the Goody Boxes!,5
12432,Everything ive ordered has been as described.,5
12433,Wonderful quality clothes at affordable prices. Great functioning app!,5
12434,I love this app,5
12435,"Love love love, great quality",5
12436,Super easy and fun to use. A great way to get cute clothes on consignment!,5
12437,High quality clothes in my size. Also shoes and handbags. So easy to search. So much fun Im sending some of my things too!,5
12438,Some things are way overpriced for used stuff but when you can use a coupon some other things are worth it.,5
12439,"Decent.. I've ordered a handful of times, I had to send a pair of shoes back because they were stretched out and filthy. Ordered some sandals and flip flops, they were perfect. Ordered a Saks bag, was perfect. Ordered some sports bras, they were nice but seemed dirty, had animal hair on one of them. I think it's a hit miss on what you get. Wish imperfections were specified a little more.",4
12440,"No mens clothing,",1
12441,No i dont have this app,5
12442,"The idea is great and so is the service, but the app is a little wonky. The search function is really bad, unfortunately, and tends to include a lot of items that just don't fit. The interface is a little counterintuitive. But the quality of the clothes I have gotten so far is good!",3
12443,Great,4
12444,"So far, I really love this app.❤",5
12445,Just so much fun!,5
12446,Fatabulous!!! The degree to which you can find items to your specs is Amazing!! I think this will also be the Only place I resale because of the Great Causes and Upcycling!!!,5
12447,I am enjoying shopping a LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH!! Very good prices and love the quality.,5
12448,App will no longer open since last update,1
12449,Such a great and easy way to thrift online. So much better than going to the thrift store and digging through clothes.,5
12450,Great quality items and crazy low prices. My new obsession for online clothing purchasing!,5
12451,Exceptional,5
12452,Always a great shopping experience,5
12453,It's too bad the buyer can't make an offer to the seller. I have found the prices are high for used stuff with no way to negotiate with the seller. For this reason I'm out.,2
12454,My boss turned me onto this site and I love it. Great deals and prices.,5
12455,Prices Ridiculously high. . May as well purchased it new.. Not for me,5

12465,Amazingly cheap?! Would recommend to anyone!?,5
12466,Super easy to use and search! Love thredUP!,5
12467,"I was not able to verify my email. I would receive the email, and once I clicked the link it would start the whole process over again. I have uninstalled and will not recommend this app",1
12468,Great prices. Authentic and reliable. Perfectly packaged and shipped fast,5
12469,Great selection but haven't found anything that fit yet.,4
12470,A nice application to get gently used clothing without leaving home.,5
12471,Great app 👍,5
12472,"Frustrating filters! Selected the wrong size and then unselected, but the filters will not change. I have tried everything even resetting my account sizes. It is super irritating to sift through the wrong size. Wastes my time.",2
12473,"Found great deals, app is a little hard to follow.",4
12474,Me an the llama did not go on it yet,5
12475,"always quick delivery, the correct product, and good condition.",5
12476,Easy to use. Great prices.,5
12477,I love being able to get quality clothing for children and myself at great prices. I've been shopping here for years without any issues until now. A lot of items from my order have arrived not matching the description listed.,5
12478,If you're a guy then this is a horrible app because there's no men's category.,1
12479,No yet but looking forward to trying it out love the concept,5
12480,Order twice first shipment just came in was thrilled with all the items.,5
12481,Really awful selection of clothing it's like the worst leftovers of the 2000's and in a not cute way really hard to find ok stuff,1

12486,I have been a fan of ThredUp for many years!!,5
12487,"I placed an order April 16th and still have not recieved it or been able go on line and find out what happened,",1
12488,Would be 5 stars if the search functioned better. It would be nice to be able to search by keywords or descriptive phrases instead of just brand/style only.,3
12489,Love -em,5
12490,"God awful. I sent all my items in December 2019. They weren't processed until March 2020. You set the price but you only get a fraction of what you set the price to. Honestly, if you want to make any money off your clothes, just sell them on Facebook Market.",2
12491,easy to use and very organized. cant wait to recieve my order. i love thrifting this is a dream come true app.,5
12492,Love this app can find cute clothes in my size. And for affordable prices.,5
12493,So great! I love this online thrift store. This has really scratched the itch for thrift stores while we have to stay home.,5
12494,The app is nice. The store is awful. Same prices for used clothes. Ridiculous.,4
12495,Not only do I love the things I buy the app is easy to navigate (and I am TERRIBLE with electronics) and have never had issues while using (knock on wood cause we know I just jinxed myself),5
12496,Fabulous app,5
12497,Amazing service. Stay at home shopping so far so good...,5
12498,First Order 🤞🤞🤞,5
12499,Affordable clothing and all in perfect condition.,5
12500,This is the best way to buy clothes...period!,5
12501,"The whole app is lagging a lot when I scroll through items which is why the 4 star rating. Other than that, is is good. Would like to see side views and waistline measurements when applicable (like dresses).",4
12502,"Finally Thred's UP; a new virtual store on line! Now here's adventures worthy checken in on. Wow a perfect shopping approach especially while being confined to quarter's, drinking whiskey shots signings my heart out.",5
12503,"Perfect, find exactly what I'm looking for... And then some money left over to buy amazing accessories or a whole nother beautifully chique outfit!!",5
12504,Excellent,5
12505,Great prices. Great finds.,5
12506,Great app! There's is only 1 thing that would make it way better; is if i could refer thru Messenger as well as snapchat. Other than than couldn't be happier,5
12507,Lots and lots of quality items to choose from! Super easy to navigate thru this app! Would really recommend you check it out!,4
12508,"Just got my first order in today and I am so impressed! Everything seemed so brand new! I do have to return one of the items due to fit but thats ok :) I really appreciate that you can return items for free if you choose store credit which I am glad to do, my account with them is new but I already have tons of items favorited. Will definitely be recommending thredUP to all of my friends!",5
12509,Very positive experience so far!,5
12510,Love the app,5
12511,Good im hard to fit,3
12512,LOVE ThredUp and everything this company is about. The only thing I would recommend is enhancing search options for garments.,5
12513,All of the clothing I've purchased is just as described! I love the variety!,5
12514,Love it!! Especially in times like these.,5
12515,UPDATE**GOING ON WEEK #5 NOW I tracked my clean out bags and one still says it's at the post office even though I shipped them together the other one has been received by thredup and still hasn't processed it's been sitting there for a week I understand maybe theyre short-staffed but this is making me think twice. I really love the idea of an online thrift store but would have really liked to have used credit from items i traded in since i just made 2 large purchases from them this week..,2
12516,"Lot of choices, cheep and fast. Excellent app.",5
12517,I don't like being forced to use my email bye,1
12518,"I did not receive 5 of my shirts so far and they're all under one tracking #, so once one shirt is delivered, the others are also marked as delivered! There's absolutely no way to contact the company to find out what happened to one's items. I've concluded that it's all a big scam. I'm very dissatisfied and will no longer shop here. I will also contact the better business bureau. Who runs a company selling used clothes but stealing it from customers. Vile",1
12519,I love this app and store! Awesome experience so far. I will update when I receive my first shipment of clothes.,5
12520,Fun awesome thanks,5

I absolute love this app. it's one of the beat out there can't say enought . I use it every day. in this time when you have to stay home and can't go out shopping thred up app definitely comes through. the returns on the app are easy and amazing as well. sometimes I do make a mistake ordering the wrong size and thred up makes it easy for me to return my item.,5
12523,"Great, easy-to-use Website! Terrific Selections! Fantastic Prices! Fast Shipping! Totally Awesome in all areas! Highly Recommend!",5
12524,"Prices are extremely high. Photos of items are WAY better than actual item in person. Descriptions are vague and really do not describe the item. I've spent over $1,000 on this site and I literally have two items I am keeping! My 4yr old wanted a Paw Patrol hat that's priced at $13. I found the same one at Walmart for $6.95! Do yourself a favor and go to Goodwill instead of wasting all of your hard earned money here like I did!",1
12525,"First time user and buyer, because of a YouTube experience. And I'm in love. Site is very easy to navigate, and sizing listed is helpful and approximate to the experience I've had. Would recommend. Great job guys!",5
12526,Ridiculously expensive. Might as well shop in store.,1
12527,I've really enjoyed shopping on here and finding things with their tags still on them for such a steal.,5
12528,Love ThredUP,5
12529,I absolutely love this store. What a awesome idea! Cant beat the prices and the ease of shopping from home. Whats not to love??,5
12530,easy to use,5
12531,"V. pleasant app, lots of filtering options. Would be better if you could search by measurements, but excellent overall.",5
12532,My me time,5
12533,Love love love,5
12534,Fantastic! I love this app!,5
12535,"I absolutely love this app... I can get pants I haven't seen in years that I love, it's rare for me to find flare jeans in the brands I love, when you go shopping these days, the only option you have are mostly skinny jeans or jeans that don't fit your body type, I will order from this site over and over!! I recommend this to everyone!!",5
12536,This app is stupid high priced..used clothes with such a high price tag..for these prices you should just buy brand new!!!!!....like i said just save your money and buy new or shop on others apps with more affordable pricing...,1
12537,"I love this app. It has such a wide selection with awesome items, and it's green! I will never buy clothes anywhere else again!",5
12538,"I noticed a big change since 2016 with the payouts. I have contacted support 2x and still cannot get to cash out without assistance. I worked on the most sophisticated computer system in the country and when I click cash out, the app goes directly to the ordering bags page which I do not need. I tried from my email, no success unless I have tech support transfer the payment to my bank account. I am tired of calling tech support for the same issue and I am not alone. This is a common complaint.",1
12539,"Useful filters, great product pictures",5
12540,First time I ordered I didn't like the fact that it it didn't all come at the same time. Now waiting for 20 pc's recieved 5 in two sep pkges .would really like the pants and leggings that I spent hr's finding. 6 mths agoI moved into a house infested with clothes moths and carpet beetles & destroyed my wardrobe. Now just to find out after I spent more hours getting all the item #'s still missing it was all for nothing!!!! Now I am still in desperate need . 57 years old and starting all over. I',1
12541,You get all this as donation an charging these. High prices you got the. Ie an the cake thrift store are foor poor people an you could go buy it new you should be a shame,5
12542,ThredUp makes it easy to search for and find good quality clothes with tags or gently worn at great prices!,5
12543,Quick delivery and the clothing I have received has been in good shape. I have ordered three times and have been happy with each experience.,5
12544,So excited to get my 1st shipment,5
12545,"Extremely high prices for used clothes,",1
12546,"Eh my purchase experience was fine, but sent a cleanout bag that was updated as ""received"" over a month ago and haven't heard any updates or anything even after trying to contact customer service",2

12564,Some great finds. Nice to get a few bucks from my gentley used clothes.,5
12565,Good deal,5
12566,"I find myself shopping on this app weekly! I love that I can get a variety of brands at great prices and only pay flat rate shipping. The only thing I would add to this app is filter options on your favorites. I hope the developers take this idea into consideration. I have so many items favorited and I sometimes just want to look at a specific category. Overall, love it!",5
12567,"Didn't accept my brand new clothing. Only wanted the shoes back. Now they're emailing me about some clothing that was ""Supposedly"" in my kit. Would rate half star if could! No thank you thread-up! Taking my clothing and money else where.!",1
12568,I need shoes in size 10 My,5
12569,Reasonable time for shipping. Neatly wrapped when it arrived.,5

12573,My favorite fashion app.,5
12574,Enjoy good quality at a low cost,5
12575,"Terrible company, They automatically remove chosen articles before you are through shopping. Was impossible to complete sale on dress I was Buying. Don't need this stress",2
12576,It was a great experience with a variety of clothes fit for me with their personal sizing option and prices I can handle.,5
12577,"Love it. Cute stuff for low price. Bought clothes for my baby and if it doesn't meet the expectations of quality, they refund me and send it anyways. Love the customer service.",5
12578,I love this app just wish they would have men clothing so I can shop for my hubby as well and not have to look for clothing for him on a different app,5
12579,Awesome app and store. The filter glitches and doesnt have many options but you can put your sizes. Clothes are nice.,4
12580,"App works great! It's easy to keep track of favorites and you'll even get notified if something you love gets ab even better price drop! You can also easily shop by brands, styles, colors. It's almost too easy to shop on here!",5
12581,Love it!,5
12582,"This app is so much better than going online. I can toggle without fail between my cart; my favorites; and can shop, etc. I simply ""put to sleep"" to extend my battery and reopen to pick back up where I left off. I've used thredUP for a few years.",5
12583,Scam! You get like 10% of the selling price and they make it impossible to cash out. They use a service that charges you to cash out on top of that. I'd rather donate to charity.,1

12585,This is my new obsession. I love it!! There are so many great deals.and great quality clothes.,5

12590,Amazing products! I love this app!!,5
12591,"Throws you out when it gets too busy during a massive sale but otherwise, app is awesome",4
12592,"The app is easy to use and easy to purchase clothes on! I also like how you can track your orders, and see the status of any clothes you have listed for sale. One of my favorite apps!!",5
12593,Got a super cute dress on this app! It takes a bit of looking but definitely worth the time.,5
12594,Easy and affordable.,5
12595,You have to give email to look and that's bull. I should not have to give you my email so you can flood it EVERYDAY,1
12596,Great clothes at great prices.,5

12608,"Love thred up. A friend told me about thred up. I've gotten name brand clothes for a deal. I never would have bought my clothes in the retail store.... to expensive. I have loved 95% of what I ordered. I always buy with free shipping and a coupon. Love, Love, Love!",5
12609,Great deals!,5
12610,"I didn't like the selection of clothes, mist of them look like their for older ladies.",1
12611,LOVE this site!,5
12612,I purchased a small bag. It was perfect and it arrived right on time in excellent condition. Thanks.,5
12613,Goody boxes are lots of fun 😀,5
12614,Easy shopping. Thousands of choices and great discounts.,5
12615,Love it! I just need to put myself on a ThredUp budget!,5
12616,Incredible! Good! Fast! Super Cool!!,5
12617,They claim to give you a discount on your first order but all i got was a big dissappointment! They cancelled my order that I spent days collecting and relisted the items at full price 3 days later. I am really upset because i had my hopes up. I will make sure to tell all my friends that I showed the app to what happened to me so that they don't waste their time with this place.,1
12618,I love purses and thred UP has brands I know and love for a fraction of the cost!,5
12619,"Good communication, item was shipped and recieved. Very happy.",5
12620,Great experience with Thred Up. Clothes arrive clean in great condition wrapped in tissue. It is a treat to get your polka dot box!,5
12621,Great🌺,5
12622,Best clothing options for rowdy kids!,5
12623,App works well. Used it a good bit and no problems. Easy to use,5

12626,Awesome selection! Items received quick and all as expected or better. Loved everything! Thought I'd have to return at least one but all were in excellent condition. Would highly recommend ThredUP.,5
12627,So far I get my products in a timely manner. Theyve been of quality and correct size.,5
12628,It would be alot more tempting to purchase your items if you didnt put everything up wrinkled put a steamer to the items that your trying to sell looks unprofessional and with the prices your selling them for it would be alot more professional,1
12629,Love everything I receive from threadUP!! So happy I found a great website with great name brand items at a affordable price! 💗💗💗,5
12630,"Wonderful, quality merchandise",5
12631,I really love that I am shopping from alot of different people but I don't have the expense of individual shipments like other sites,5
12632,Love this site!,5
12633,LOVE!!,5
12634,Fun. Easy.,5
12635,This app is awesome. Thank you,5
12636,"Falsely advertising sizes. Beware of ordering 16 or 18, you'll get Women's not misses.",1
12637,If I could give less I would. I got charged for a goody box that I've never even received. I've contacted usps and fedex written 3 or 4 emails to customer support trying to work out something out with thred up with only one response and then getting charged the full amount of clothes I dont even have possession of. I've ordered goody boxes with them before as well as purchased clothes and this is how they treat a paying customer. Horrible! Use a different clothes shopping app ya'll.,1
12638,"I absolutely hate that thing where you can take items out of somebody's carts. I spend a lot of time coordinating outfits and i resent people wasting my time and effort like that. I also hate the ""carts only last one hour"" sales. That is not fair to people like myself on disability that often don't have the money right away. Also i shut my push notifications off and Thred Up pushes them right back on. Stop doing that!!!!😈 2 stars for affordability other than that minus ten stars.",2
12639,It's ok,2
12640,Works pretty well,4
12641,Great finds so far! I'm hooked!,5
12642,Love this app. I can buy stuff and donate/sell my old stuff? Perfect app and company. I am a VERY thrifty shopper and this is one of my go to apps now.,5
12643,Absolutely love this app.,5
12644,"This is my new ""go-to"" app when I need to quiet my mind. Window shopping from my bed :)",5
12645,"Feels good to shop here, and loads of choices!",5
12646,"Overpriced! For used clothes, they charge too much. You'd expect it to be cheaper, but it makes me feel like they charge TOO MUCH for USED clothes.",2
12647,ABSOLUTELY LUVING IT!!!,5
12648,"Love em! Great idea, great site, great clothes. My only complaint is sizing (which isn't even really their fault): I've only bought several shorts so far and I'm wearing a 4 that fits like a 10. The last pair was so huge I gave em away",5
12649,"Since the late March updates, this app has been incompatible with my phone. On load up, it will sit there for more than 5 min and refuse to load a thing. I have checked my phone's system updates and this app's updates to no avail. Very frustrated.",1
12650,"It's so wonderful to have a thrift store conveniently online. And you get to sort through in the comfort of your home, or on your break at work, or anytime of day/night! And the prices are just as good, if not better than some shops!",5
12651,"The only complaint is not being able to see the condition up close. For the most part, items are in the condition as they say. On rare occasions, some items are more worn than stated in the description.",4
12652,Great deals!,4
12653,Love this site! Very addictive!,5
12654,"They have very good selections! Even clothing with tags still on them! The only downside is that you won't make much selling, though.",4

12659,Great buys on women's clothes. Good variety to choose from. Fast shipping!!!,5
12660,Best parts of thrifting in one place. The filters are useful to find what you're looking for. You can get name brand items at a fraction of the cost.,5
12661,Luv this app! Fun to shop and receive!,5
12662,Shipping is pricey but you feel good about what you're ordering because of the effect secondhand shopping has on the environment. Lots of deals too!,5
12663,Had great experience with first order. Prices are reasonable and I enjoy browsing the site. I also appreciate the coupons!,5
12664,I have bought some really nice items from this site. Love to shop here.,5

12666,Clothes arrived promptly. Looked brand new. Sizes were true. It's my new obsession!❤,5

12681,"Help! Got stuck in an endless loop of attempting to login, having to verify my account through my email, then the provided link sends me to login again, only to have to verify again through another email. After about 6 attempts I just uninstalled. I was excited for some thrifting in quarantine but it's probably just my dumb a** who couldn't make it work.",4
12682,I have loved everything i have got i have not had any problems with any of the clothing i ordered clean and in great shape 👌,5
12683,Great way to purge your closet and pick up a few gently used items.,5

12685,"So far, so good. I only wish i could hold things in my cart a little longer. I put some cute jeans in my cart to buy, and while i was looking for a shirt to go with them, the jeans ran out of time in my cart and i was looking and looking for them and they had gone back to the inventory, and someone else had them in their cart. 😯",5

12690,Not happy about this company bc I had to pay shipping bc I had returns of clothes and I had it put back on my credit card and would have free shipping if I did store credit. I don't want store credit bc I wasn't going to buy anymore clothes.,1
12691,Great consignment buying experience. I've made several purchases with no issues and will continue to use the app and their service.,5
12692,Awesome,5
12693,"Too confusing, not enough brands",1
12694,Very happy with the items that I purchased from thredupI continue to purchase from thredup at this time with the coronavirus going on I am still purchasing items from thredup and I am very satisfied thank u thredup.Naida 😺😼😺♥️❤️❤️,5
12695,"I love this app. It is so much better than fast fashion, and a great way to recycle. I have gotten so many amazing pieces to add to my wardrobe!!",5
12696,"I downloaded this app and made a purchase to complete an offer for another mobile game. It was hard finding anything good to purchase and then they refused to pay out the offer I had redeemed claiming I wasnt a new member, which is a lie. They refused to work with TapJoy in the matter. Worst customer service ever.",1
12697,Great way to get amazing deals! Clothse have always been exactly as described. The amount you make on selling items is not much at all but at least you know that they are not going to become trash.,5
12698,"Easy, fun, affordable ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
12699,Thred up is surprisingly a nice website to get clothing from..I buy clothes from them and they're in great condition and the shipping doesn't take forever. Everything is affordable 😁,5
12700,"It has never worked for me, it just says an error when I try to open the app, and I've had it installed for a week",1
12701,Easy shopping,4
12702,Good 1,5
12703,Very nice experience my first time ordering.,5
12704,Its not that i dont like the app there clothes is just no doable its really not that stylisy and its just my opinion,3
12705,Love this company. Amazing deals!!,5
12706,Addictive,5
12707,Great!,5
12708,I ordered a lot of dresses and went by the size chart that you put on the website and when it came in the mail not one dress fit me only one was too big and the rest was way too small needless to say I was very disappointed your size chart is way off,2
12709,It was super simple to order from here. I highly recommend this app to everyone.,5
12710,Thread Up Rules!,4
12711,AWESOME,5
12712,This app is joke i thought i was going to b happy w this i sent 3 full bag in march still have procress my item i have talk yo sevrrsl people an not solve yet they are really fake people an this app is a joke an fake too,1
12713,Great,5
12714,"Great customer service and return service, so far. Thank you!",5
12715,Having shopped here b4 But months ago browsed through and prices seem alot higher now,3
12716,User friendly and easy to find what you're looking for at a great price!,5
12717,Good items at a decent price an decent delivery time,5
12718,These clothes are beautiful just like brand new just like the photo. Seriously. And the box and packaging are so cute. Very very pleased.,5
12719,"Great clothes, great brands, great selection, great prices & great service! Need I say more!",5
12720,Exspensive,1
12721,So glad I found this app! It's easy to use and let's me shop from home! With maximum discounts!,5
12722,Great,5
12723,"Great, easy to use.",5
12724,Love the clothes & the prices!,5
12725,"For the most part, the items for purchase are reasonably priced & described accurately.",4
12726,"I tried to print a shipping label about ten times and it wouldn't load. I checked my connection and everything, the problem was not on my end. So I email customer service telling them I've been waiting weeks on a selling bag and I can't even print out a label. They tell me they will email me one and of course they didn't. They told me what I wanted to hear instead of actually doing what they said they were going to. I will never waste my time on this app again.",1
12727,"The items on sale aren't bad, BUT if you don't like an item after you get it or it doesn't fit, YOU LOSE MORE MONEY TO RETURN THE STUPID ITEMS. They don't refund the original shipping, make you pay out of pocket to ship back plus cost of a restocking fee. Just don't waste your time. This site isn't worth your money. I just wasted mine.",1
12728,It's easy to use,5
12729,Ive already bought a bunch of stuff. I love this app! ❤❤❤,5
12730,Awesome,5
12731,I'm loving this app so much!Very cute clothes,4
12732,I really enjoy all the gems I can find. I only wish there were more random coupon codes that actually worked for more than just first time buyers,4
12733,"I cannot do anything on this app. All it does is continually ask me to create an account. I have created an account, and I'm trying to access the shipping label sent to my email so I can donate clothes. But all the app does is ask me to create an account. It doesn't matter what link I click on, it always directs me to create an account. Even when I am logged into the account I created, it just continues to request that I create an account. This app is a waste.",1
12734,"I really love shopping with you, also my orders arrive so fast - love it. Thank you for such great service ❤️",5
12735,This app makes it easy for me to do school shopping while stuck at home. No time like the present to prepare for next school year..,5
12736,"Gave 2 stars previously but after a few updates I'm going to 4. I would still like to be able to filter accessories and shop rescue boxes, but there has been tremendous improvement.",4
12737,Ridiculous way to pay using paypal! Cant be like other places using it simplier? Doesnt have my size another downer! POS APP dont waste time dling and looking ladies!,1
12738,The more I shop the better I become at choosing items that I will really like. I love thredUP!,5
12739,This app is AMAZING. The only downside is I can't stop using it for great deals!,5
12740,"Consumer friendly, but beware! Your items in your cart are placed under a 12 mins timer. It resets Everytime you visit your cart but once you leave that timer is ticking.",5
12741,Stupid. Your an established company. Why arent mens stuff on here? Bad business operations,2
12742,Great app. Some of the more popular brands though are way too expensive for secondhand prices. But there are some other really great deals!!!,4
12743,"So far all of my orders fit, look brand new quality, and I look forward to seeing what else great deals I can find!!",5
12744,Never a bad experience with what I have purchased,5
12745,Never used,1
12746,"I just got the cutest sweater from a brand I love and can't find anywhere else, and it's in great condition and super comfy, and was super inexpensive. The package came really fast and the packaging was cute and mainly paper- which is a plus",5
12747,East to access and use. Has all the online capabilities.,5
12748,"I love this app, I just wish that there was more pictures of the clothes",5
12749,"Edited. I gave a bad review before because the customer service I received from a guy named Richard was terrible. But I've changed my review now, my first order came way earlier than I expected and everything was packaged nicely and the clothes were great! I will definitely order more",4
12750,Not sute yet.,2
12751,I love thredUP!!,5
12752,Love it however some sizes are off. Example I ordered a large shirt it was a junior's large and it was a nonreturnable item.,5
12753,AWESOME AMAZING I LOVE THIS SITE,5
12754,"Thred Up is awesome! They sell your clothes, do all the work, give you credit and you get to shop for more great finds. Best of all they handle all the remaining stock in so socially responsible ways.",5
12755,"Everything I buy fits and beautiful, just like the pictures",5
12756,"VERY annoyed. When the app finally installed (stuck at 48% then 98%), it wouldn't open; after much digging it said the app's already associated with another email and directed that I change my PlayStore email account, but PlayStore won't let me. Plus, this app was previously used on a different device! Do I REALLY have to install this on my laptop to even open it? Or is there some way to delete the old account with the bad email and establish a new account? Help me change my rating!",1
12757,Good,5
12758,Higher than buying the items brand new. They call fast instagram fashion unbranded. The seller might get a few cents for each item. Dont give them your clothes and dont give them your money.,1
12759,"It's been good. No problems with customer service, returns or orders.",5
12760,"Photos do not always clearly show item. I find about 30% of items can be purchased cheaper. I have called, left messages, emailed - NEVER has anyone gotten back to me. If you are just doing a little shopping, not real important, then this could be a little time killer and sometimes save a little money!",3
12761,So easy to use. This is but far my favorite thrift store site!! I recently started a new job and was able to get all of my new to me clothing from thredUp.,5
12762,"Clothing somewhat nice, I wish they had more detailed info like Womens /Juniors sizing & more detailed pictures. I feel they would get less returns if they incorporated these changes seeing how they charge a restocking fee off the amount returned, but it's to there advantage. Payout for clothes is horrible, NEVER AGAIN. They claim they donate what they dont keep but Ive seen items they ""didn't keep"" of mine be sold! You pay just as much if you buy new, and your not changed for returns. Uninstall",2
12763,Good,5
12764,Prices too high,1
12765,Love this shop.,5
12766,Have ordered several times. Is always as described. Great selection in all categories. Enjoy looking at the items to see what they have available.,5
12767,I am so in love with this app I can't put it down.. it's very easy to use and amazing I find some wonderful stuff on the app,5
12768,Great choices and prices,5
12769,Great company! Easy app use and unreal deals!,5
12770,Never had a problem with thred up!,5
12771,"Great way to edit items from your closet, while shopping from someone else's closet. I love this app",5
12772,Excellent prices on name brands,5
12773,I just received my first order and I love the clothes 😍. You have a new happy customer.,5
12774,"Doesn't work well, slow. Clothing has mannequin measurements not actual measurements. Impossible to buy most clothing without actual measurements especially something like jean where you need to know how long they are.",2
12775,"You can find so many great deals, new clothes with tags, clothes that are basically brand new, all at unbeatable prices. Clothes shoes,purses,children's clothing .You can also sell your clothes you don't wear anymore. Try it.",5
12776,I love thrift shopping❤ They package everything so beautifully.,5
12777,"Wonderful shopping experience. Buy something when you see it or you will miss out. Also, promo codes expire quickly.",5
12778,Awesome,5
12779,Awesome,5
12780,Easy to use and great prices!,5
12781,"I have loved using this app to update my wardrobe without breaking the bank! I have always been interested in thrifting, but get overwhelmed when I get to the racks in the store and have to shuffle through without really being able to see what some things look like. With Thred Up I can browse anytime I want, save favorites and narrow things down so much more easily! And all of my items have been in great condition! 👌❤",5
12782,This app is super awesome. I love it . Will buy from this place for the rest if my life.. thank you,5
12783,Love this app! Very satisfied with what I have ordered so far!,5
12784,I would like all items i haven't sold returned Sending you my items allowed you to profit while i didnt. I'm not satisfied at all. My items retailed for more then my cash out amount. Please contact me through email for return of my not sold items on your site.,1
12785,Lots of filters to narrow search,5
12786,Love love love my first order aww,5
12787,Not impressed!,1
12788,I enjoyed checking out the different items. Just wish I had more time. There will be plenty of other days.,5
12789,Fun save money,5
12790,"Wish there was a men section , but there isn't , they have boys tho lol but I wish there was men section",2
12791,"Fantastic way to buy & sell clothing and accessories. Pennies on the dollar finds. Great way to shop for kids summer clothes, since they grow so fast. Signature pieces for my wardrobe. Brilliant.",5
12792,Love thredUp! Easy to use. Great deals. No complaints at all.,5
12793,I love the app but recently it hasn't been working properly. Favorites won't update so you lose everything unless you add to cart immediately.,3
12794,Very good for my first time Shopping with you guys,5
12795,"clothes are not spectacular, mostly wrinkly & obviously used. Too expensive to be thrift.",2
12796,Understand that Corona is happening but you'd think after about a month or so my items would be listed to sale and I send it before Corona was happening that's my only issue other then that fast shipping and items always seems to be in good condition.,3
12797,"Like I said before, don't waste your time and money. These Items are wayyy overpriced for being a second hand store/thrift shop, you could probably find New, cheaper at the outlet stores. I uninstalled this app.",1
12798,Easy and affordable.,5
12799,Fantastic app for reused clothing. Use them all the time!,5
12800,Amazing!!!,5
12801,Excellent,5
12802,I love the fact that I can get great clothes for a good price but I really feel like when you sell them your stuff you should get 50% of the selling piece instead of what they do pay you it's not right that they pay you 27 cents when it is being sold for $6 that is not right at all I really hope that they will see that this is wrong and make it right for everyone,3
12803,Love love love!!! Obsessed,5
12804,Just downloaded this app today and its not letting me sign up. It keeps resetting every time I try.,1
12805,I really like this app !,5
12806,Have enjoyed my shopping experience with thredup. Have received some nice clothes.,5
12807,"Good selection, excellent prices!!!",5
12808,Great,4
12809,"when I select a group of items only one row will show.. 'i am very pleased with items i have purchased, but seeing them is a frustrating experience",4
12810,Love shopping on thredup,5
12811,All the tediousness of a thrift store for 3x the price. Need a wrinkly old yellow blouse?,1
12812,I have always receive great quality items at good prices! I love that it helps reduce waste and I can feel stylish in the items I buy.,5
12813,Its got great stuff. But it said i would get 50% off my order for ordering for the first time. I had about $83 worth of stuff and it didnt even take off $6.,2
12814,I loved the selection and quality of the clothing but the shipping was $6 on 1 pair of shorts and it took 10 days to get here. Would love Tred Up if it had free shipping. Guess I'm spoiled to Amazon Prime's 2 day shipping.,4
12815,I do enjoy shopping from this thrift store. I often have to hold back from going overboard. My only main issue is the inconsistent filter options. For example I can look for short sleeve blouses but for some reason the sleeve filter is missing on other top types like sweaters. It's a little maddening. I've also had great experience with customer service so far.,4
12816,"Great app and great customer service. A good alternative for thrifting in person, due to current restrictions.",5
12817,"Know your measurements and only get ""new with tags"" or ""like new"" unless you can sew. You can get some great deals but there is the risk that you have never seen the item and if you try to return it, there's a fee.",5
12818,Good,5
12819,My experience with this app has been nothing but awesome,5
12820,I love this app!!,5
12821,I've been buying from ThredUp for my grandchildren fir several years and have always been very satisfied with mu purchases. My oldest grandson will soon be out of childrens sizes and I wonder how I will find the clothes he likes at a price I can afford. It's okay because the other grandchildren should be ThredUp sizes for a while.,5
12822,Great deals! Can always recreate my pinterest boards.,4
12823,Best experience ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
12824,I love this app! The concept is great & I have yet to recieve anything that isn't of great quality.,5
12825,My items arrived and they were awesome. The packaging was beautifully done and every item was in great condition.,5
12826,Great,5
12827,All of the items are priced high. You can get brand new from the store.,1
12828,App is easy to use. I shop a bit too much on it Love this company!,5
12829,It is way to expensive to be 2nd hand I mean really come on I can go to Goodwill for less and better and cheaper the shoes are way overpriced I was not happy at all with it no way I'm paying that,1
12830,"Usually everything is exactly how the description is described. But I did buy a purse that was said to be in excellent condition and could be mistaken as brand new, which on the outside it was but the inside lining was covered with stains..",2
12831,So much fun!,5
12832,"I have yet to find fault with this company, everything I have bought from them is exactly as described. Awesome prices and good sales!!! There are a few things with the app that could be improved but overall a good experience.",5
12833,Great place to get a variety of kids clothes.,5
12834,Easy to use and love the concept of this!,5
12835,Love shopping,5
12836,No mens clothes,1
12837,Fast and easy,5
12838,App shuts down for no reason. Frustrating!,2
12839,Easy to use. Gets better all the time.,5
12840,My favorite way to shop! The app is easy and the company awesome.,5
12841,I love it,5
12842,Lovely,5
12843,I have ordered many items. Love them all! Saves a lot of $.,5
12844,This is the BEST place to buy from!,5
12845,Love it,5
12846,You can dress your best at a fraction of the cost! The items have always been as described I absolutely recommend this site if you like to look your best at a NICE PRICE!!! Way too go thredUP,5
12847,Great,5
12848,Not very forthcoming about hidden fees...items never add up to correct math so I assume there must be hidden fees,4
12849,"This app is a hit or miss. Worked perfectly fine all day yesterday, but not loading today. I open the app and it just spins and spins. I cleared the cache, restarted my phone, there's no recent pending update.... Why isn't it loading? It's really frustrating. I much prefer to use the app over the website, but that seems to be my only solution when the app isn't functioning. I'd love to update my review if this is resolved.",1
12850,It's nice to be able to get the things I want without spending a fortune.,5
12851,Very user friendly!,5
12852,"1.Half of my ordered items did not arrive. 2.I couldn't log in to check on the status of my purchases. I even reset my password, and I still couldn't log in. After 15 min. Gave up. 3.I will uninstall after this post. It was my 1st experience, and my last.",1
12853,Have really enjoyed this app and service,4
12854,"Having this app is like having the biggest, bestest, thrift store around in your phone! There's always great sales, you can create really specific searches and save them, and lastly they have the BEST customer service I've ever experienced. Ex.- I bought a really nice sweater and it was listed as perfect condition but when I got it I noticed a fixable hole. I contacted Thredup and they immediately gave me some credit and apologized. This company is a really awesome one. I highly recommend.",5
12855,"I have liked every purchase so far. The fit is true to size, the items are in very good shape, and the packaging is nice, too. I really like that the shoes are already broken in! I recommend ThredUp to all of my friends.",5
12856,Good app.,5
12857,"App Crashes constantly, or wont even open.",1
12858,Off season garage sale fix... I love it,5
12859,"Love this app and what this company is about. You can find some amazing clothes that are easy on the wallet. My only complaint is that it does take a while to sift through the countless amounts of clothing. Luckily there are many categories you can search clothing. I wish there a feature to browse all of the brands available on the site (rather than just the trending brands). But other than that, I would recommend anyone to buy from ThredUp.",4
12860,"Everything I have gotten I have absolutely loved!!! I just wish it would come ironed & laundered....the only negative is the ""jean"" sizes are not true to size, on 3 separate orders the waste size is not correct. Returns are long and drawn out, to the point it's not worth the hassle...overall, very satisfied. Thanks for your reply. However, that is something candid you say to smooth things over. Why don't you email me or call me? Now that would be ""real"" customer service....or fixing the issue.",5
12861,A very easy website to shop on and have fun!,5
12862,Very Sick just love it!!!,5
12863,My favorite place to shop from my phone The app isn't perfect-perfect but I can pretty much do everything I want to do. I've also had good experiences with their customer service. Highly recommend.,5
12864,"Terrible tried to filter wouldn't update filters. Prices are too high for used clothing, this is worse than goodwill.",1
12865,Easy to use,5
12866,Always a great experience; from ordering to fast shipping & great prices for products!,5
12867,Love this app!,5
12868,Its so easy to find things you love And very easy to use web site love threadup,5
12869,Easy to use site and filters. Great quality items for a fraction of the price!,5
12870,I love this place and tell everyone to check it out,5
12871,Fun and easy,5
12872,First time I didn't get the discount but I was very happy with my purchase. Second time extremely happy with my purchases and did get the discounts. I'm very impressed that it feels like a family-type business there's personal notes from the people fulfilling the orders. I'm telling everybody I know how great it is,5
12873,THIS IS NOT THIFT STORE PRICES AT ALL waste of my time !!!,1
12874,Easy to navigate by phone!,5
12875,"Since about 2013, Ive been able to find and buy exactly what Im looking for . EVERY time. And, At the very best possible prices! Best online shopping EVER!",5
12876,Absolutely the best place to shop online!!,5
12877,Love threadUP,5
12878,App is super clunky and the search is junk. Will pull up random things completely unrelated to what is searched.,1
12879,I've ordered several different times and I've had nothing but great experiences! My packages always come in super quick and it's way better quality stuff than I've gotten from other thrift stores. I'm very satisfied and will do the majority of my shopping with thredup from now on.,5
12880,"Buy, Sell, Return...everything is so easy! Clothing arrives exactly as described, and I really love that youre donated items can go toward a good cause (Feed The People!) Customer service also very helpful. I recommend to all my friends! LOVE THREDUP! 😍",5
12881,Love thredup the only app i use to buy clothes online!,5
12882,I haven't bought anything yet so I will give one star for now. I will be back to update my review. By the looks of the app I am sure I will be changing it to 5 Stars.,1
12883,"An impressive array of clothes; on occasion i have a little trouble understanding exactly what the item looks like just from the picture, but overall I've been ecstatic with my purchases. Sizing is no more finicky than with any other online shopping. The clothes smell really nice when you receive them, too! How long you can have an item on hold in your cart seems a little inconsistent, though.",5
12884,So easy to use and order the cutest clothes for my kids and myself without breaking the bank! I've had an issue recently and customer service solved the problem to my satisfaction very swiftly. I adore this company and cheer their continued sucess!!,5
12885,Fabulous! Functionality and navigation is great. Support is responsive. Orders are shipped in a timely manner and accurate to their online portrayal. This app has helped me refresh my wardrobe and kill countless hours during quarentine.,5
12886,Great experience and service every time.,5
12887,I am grateful for the conscientious shopping and great quality and prices.,5

12894,Easy and affordable products are excellent.,5
12895,Best place to buy clothes !,5
12896,Better than the website but it does crash kind of often :/,4
12897,Very impressive,5
12898,"A great way to find beautiful clothes, but you have to be careful. It can look great in picture and you get it and the waist band is trashed or there's a whole seam out. Or it is nothing like what you thought it was. I wish there was a way to ask questions about a piece or that there were more pictures or descriptions. Something to make it a little less scary. I wont send stuff in to sell anymore since I can't seem to gauge what is good or bad on that.",4
12899,Sizes are irregular. Normal size is 16 18 mostly large sometimes xl xl was too tight and sleeves long. Then I find out there is a fee to return. I felt like I was ripped off.,2
12900,Ok,5
12901,Great,5
12902,Easy to use. Scrolling is easier!!,5
12903,Love it,5
12904,Much easier to use than whatever beta nonsense they're testing with the site,5
12905,Great bargains on awesome brands! Got a discount and free shipping on my first order.,5
12906,"They have some great deals. My only reason for not giving them 5 stars is a size 4X chest size can be from a 28 to 60+. It would help considerably and save a lot of time, if we could search by chest size.",4
12907,A great place to shop. Try it out!,5
12908,Nice variety,5
12909,The one star is me being polite did like them but refuse to use their fraudulent site now STOP canceling orders!!! Also I paid more than 7.99 for those boots!!!! Worst customer service,1

12912,Love this app. So easy to use.,5
12913,Love the clothes and the cost,5
12914,Love the deals! Thredup is also awesome for taking unwanted clothes also.,5
12915,Keeps saying my email & password are incorrect. Just let me out I will shop elsewhere.,1

12924,I love it! They tailor to exactly what I'm looking for. Thank you.,5
12925,I have received 5 different shipments from thred up and every single item was in perfect condition and packaged in such a way that it's like getting a fantastic birthday present. Love love love thred up!!,5
12926,"I am so disappointed in this company. They place and sell your items for a great price but don't share the profits. They only give you maybe 5% or less of each sale. So for 20.00 you might see 1.27 . Then they send you notification that your items are going to expire, but there is no where to adjust the price that I can find, there adjust button leads you on a goose chase. They won't return your clothes unless you pay for shipping.on each item. Say goodbye to your clothes and to making any $.",1
12927,I love that it has filters so you can change it to your size,5
12928,The pants fit perfect. Size was accurate.,5
12929,Addicting without buyers remorse,5
12930,I bought two pairs of leggings and not that good,1
12931,"Easy to use, and lots of optiona for clothing.",5
12932,Lies.,3
12933,I saved over $600 on 4 pairs of designer jeans. Nuff said.,5
12934,"I have been shopping on Thredup since my 11 year old was 2 (I believe). This was way before people really knew about it. As the site grew, you were able to grow along and you continue to have great pieces for myself and my family! I will continue to shop Thredup!!!",5
12935,Love it! Economical and great quality.,5
12936,Online thrift store ? I would think a thrift store would be cheaper. I found some of the same items brand new for cheaper on other sites. $18.99 for a child's t-shirt I've never spent over $5 for a growing child's shirt. Ridiculous.,1
12937,It's been pretty nice. I bought a cute jumpsuit,5
12938,I absolutely love this store!!!!,5
12939,"I have made many purchases and unfortunately not all my purchases have been great due to lack of photos not showing complete features of the item. Photos never capture the inside of items (bags, purses, or wallets) or to the side (leggings or dresses will have a side design, however it's never visible). Most items are overpriced as well. Customer service is also poorly managed. It took 5 days of emailing & reexplaining for my request to be completed. I like this app, but it's not the best.",3
12940,😍 love it!!!,5
12941,"Easy to use, great products at a fair price!!",5
12942,Easy to use.,5
12943,"Said to apply code, when I did it did not show up on submitted payment even when I typed in the VALID code!! Frustrating!!",2
12944,Didnt like,1
12945,Great,5
12946,"I ordered $130.00 worthof clothes from thredup. They were accidentally sent to the wrong address. So i had to have them returnedto sender, which sucked! Then (I'm currently in a nursing home) i was told that there was a possibility that i would be moving closer to home. So i asked thredup to jyst refund my money until i got to where i was going. Just in case i did move. (Unfortunately, i did not move). Now the clothes were never touched by me!! And the entire time that the packages were out ther",3
12947,It's cool clothes at a low cost. What's not to love?,5
12948,"It's a great way to change up your wardrobe every season without spending alot. I have never been disappointed, I love getting my polka dot boxes.",5
12949,"Fun, easy, fast with great prices",5
12950,"Love this site, so many items 😍",5
12951,Love the choices and discount prices!,5
12952,I got very good quality and prices on my clothes. Very satisfied.,5
12953,"Been buying from Thredup for two years. Great prices, great service, amazing, constantly changing selections. Only place I buy shoes and jackets.",5
12954,Fun and awesome!!,5
12955,I like this program,3
12956,"I've gotten a couple pairs of shoes from here and it's awesome! I love how the pictures and descriptions are clear. And I'm all about sustainability so I love that everything is second hand. I love the prices, and the quick beautiful shipping.",5
12957,Great!,4
12958,So far so good. Super saver app for used clothes.,5
12959,Nice website. Prices a little high for used clothing. But most of time lower than purchasing brand new. I like Threadup being picky with what they sell on line.,5
12960,"Just wish you could narrow things down more, but it's a good app!",4
12961,Is all good except I didnt receive an item that I purchased,4
12962,"The ""view similar"" feature no longer shows you items in your sizes, as the website does, rendering it virtually useless. I really enjoyed it when it worked properly.",4
12963,It is an amazing shopping site. Love the brand new second hand stuff with tags on it!!! Best shopping site I have found.,5
12964,You got some ugly ass clothes I'm not 70,1
12965,"I've ordered so many clothes off here already!! I love this app great clothes at a fair price, every piece of clothing i got is in great shape and fits great!! I'm very happy i found this app I'll def be doing all my shopping right on Thred Up!!!!!",5
12966,"Absolutely loving thredUP!! Great merch, great people, helping the planet. Thanks so much for what you do!",5
12967,Love all the options! Could spend hours shopping!,5
12968,Love love love♥️♥️♥️,5
12969,App is easier to use than the website. It only took me a few clicks to reclaim my selling item. I had to go through so many steps on the web.,5
12970,Easy,5
12971,"I love this app! ThredUp is amazing for thrifting. A lot of the time I can't find anything I like at traditional thrift stores, so this gives me a much broader selection of gently used clothes to choose from! I've bought many things from their site and I've even tried one of their tailored boxes and they got my style perfectly! I love being able to thrift and not even have to leave my couch! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves thrifting!",5
12972,Love shopping on this app!,5
12973,I think this app is a really good idea except when I checked for sizes what about us plus sized ladies? Until you have some plus-size clothes for us beautiful ladies also I will not be a customer of yours. Thank you,1
12974,"App provides me with a good selection of filters to view clothes. Wish that it had a filter for different fabrics and materials. I enjoy the ""favorites"" section.",4
12975,"AMAZING!! Easy to use, incredible deals for incredible, top name brands, and it helps reduce waste to purchase used clothing. Everything I have purchased, (which is quite a bit) looks brand new! I have recommended this to everyone I know.",5
12976,I really enjoy shopping on thred up. The clothes Ive gotten are in great shape and so much cheaper. I love it!!!❤,5
12977,Great clothes great price fast delivery,5
12978,Easy to use and very reliable. I love it!!,5
12979,"I like the app. Shipping and tax adds quite a bit to the price of things, so you have to get several items to make it worth it.",4
12980,Five stars may seem like a lot but I think it's a great app. A thrift store through the phone. I have a very hard time finding clothes for my size and I was able to find some pretty nice quality brands in my sizes for great prices. Highly recommend if you're a fan of online shopping and thrifting.,5
12981,Great experience,5
12982,I absolutly love this app. It saves me so much time and money everything that comes is sooo cute fits great!!! Shipping is pretty quick.,5
12983,"Great website, easy to navigate",4
12984,Fun and easy to use!,5

12988,Awesome deals. Fun to find great deals.,5
12989,Wish you could bid from the app.,4
12990,"Love it, my online thrifting addiction!!!",5
12991,"So fun! It's like shopping in all different stores on one site. Love some of my purchases so much I feel sorry for the person that gave them up, because surely they must be regretting it!",5
12992,Always really happy with my purchase!,5
12993,"It wasn't fun because Everytime I put my debit card in it kept coming up the thing stop working do it again,so I stopped, because I did this 3 three times . So not fun ...!!!",3
12994,Hard to get around on the app and some of the pictures aren't easy to see the cloths,2
12995,I always find what i need and more i wants than any where else at amazing prices,5
12996,Great prices and easy to use fast app. Love browsing for clothes from my couch!,5
12997,Great finds but act quick. The good ones go fast!,5
12998,Love the website; app is pretty good too.,4
12999,Good,5
13000,Easy to use and great clothes!,5
13001,I love all the sales and the verity of products,5
13002,I purchased $50.00 worth of merchandise and had the 50 percent code..couldnt find where to put it on the page when I checked out...then the app closed my purchase with out my code. This was my first time.,2
13003,Thank you for responding so quickly! I was able to create an account using my gmail login. I'm loving the app so far!,5
13004,I really like this app,5
13005,I sent two bags of clothes in. All very nice clothes and yet I've heard anything from the place,1
13006,"Pretty lame. Looks like thrift store clothes except way too expensive. $30 for a wrinkled old shirt? Pass. Its all cheap polyester too, no vintage or high quality clothing. Not worth it.",1
13007,The only thrift shopping I do,5
13008,Love Threadup!! Nice clothes and shoes!!,5
13009,They look old fashion,2
13010,I love to shop sustainable and this makes it easy and convenient.,5
13011,Great experience,5
13012,Bought quite a few items and were very happy with them.,5
13013,I love it!,5
13014,Love it!!!,5
13015,Great,5
13016,Like the app but the company its self is the worst to do business with. Lies and excuses.,1
13017,I'm addicted to thredup very easy to order love it,5
13018,Love this app! Completely recommend.,5
13019,Love to bargin shop and this place is great,5
13020,Good,5
13021,Ok!🐼,5
13022,"Horrible. I've purchased around 20 items from thredup, out of those 20, 17 have had unmentioned rips, stains, or strong pet smells and covered in hair. when you contact customer service they basically offer to have you pay almost $10 to ship it back to them for a site credit(if they reply at all), which means you lose the money in shipping to you and back to them so they end up keeping most of your money. Would not recommend.",1
13023,Have not try yet,4
13024,They continue to update the app and understanding user friendliness. It's great!,5
13025,Didnt care for it,1
13026,Great buys! Rare finds,5
13027,Awesome sales and clothes are like brand new,5
13028,This is a fun app and a real cool way to buy clothes. You only have to see exactly what you want to see and everything I've bought is in brand new condition.,5
13029,"Better then ebay. Sales and special offers are confusing. App a bit weird at first, but it gets easier to navigate. Shipping was fast.",4
13030,Doesn't give that much back,2
13031,Cool,5
13032,Is a very good app,4
13033,"So far, I love everything I've gotten from thredUP You will love it too!",5
13034,I love this app! I love thrift stores and this is the best app for thrifty shopping!,5
13035,"🙄 brick and mortar is better and much cheaper. I have found that the descriptions are wrong and vague. The app is set up so that if you make a purchase, even if you return something, you lose...if you don't accept a credit towards future purchases, you end up paying them to send it back 🤷🏽‍♀️. Makes me think they size wrong and describe wrong on purpose. Nothing good to say.",1
13036,Easy to order but impossible to reach seller or company,2
13037,Love thread up. Great deals.,5
13038,"Totally LOVE this app!! I could spend hours (and I have) looking at clothing, shoes and more. The prices are very reasonable, orders arrive in a timely manner, and items are just as pictured. The only criticism I have is that measurements are not given in the sweater and coats departments. It's just as important to know the measurements of these items as it is jeans or tops. Thanks Thread Up for developing this app! Reduce, reuse, recycle. Help save our planet!! ❤",5
13039,Cant find anything with specific searches. It's very hard to navigate without looking at absolutely everything. Cant narrow down a search. I put in Sun dresses and 3 came up.,1
13040,Excellent,4
13041,"Great experience! You get so much more for your money at Thred Up, and clothes get a second life rather than taking up space in a land fill.",5
13042,I did a no shipping bundle and was wanting to see what I had already bundled but couldnt find it. I had to just guess what I already had in my my bundle,4
13043,I can shop without guilt about my consumerism. ☺️,5
13044,"Fun and easy to navigate through the site. Good deals, discounts and clothing variety.",5
13045,Good,5
13046,Fashionably affordable,4
13047,I received a box of clothes from threadUP.. I'm very pleased with my designer pick.. I love color!! A couple blouses and a sweater just really put a big smile on my face thank you thredUP,5
13048,Amazing,5
13049,Can always find anything your looking for. Comes fast delivery. Clothes are perfect.,5
13050,It's only specific types of items,1
13051,LOVE this app.,5
13052,"The only criticism I have is that the app often stops working. Other than that, I love three up.",4
13053,Love the selection. I am looking forward to trying more options on the app.,5
13054,The app rarely functions properly. Can never look at my favorite searches or it defaults to some random search. This app is still very glitchy. Most of the time when I click on a notification of a new item the app doesn't load at all.,2
13055,Love the app but mostly love thred up bc of prices!,5
13056,"Great app! Pretty streamlined; occasionally there are weird hiccups primarily when using the filter, but nothing terrible.",4
13057,Almost everything I have received from thredUP has been excellent!!,5
13058,"I will never use this again, kept my clothes...and sold it. Never got paid. The worst",1
13059,"Great prices, an abundance of choices and shipping is easy and fast.",5
13060,"Ideal I originally gave it a try to get a box stylized and set to me. The experience went perfect! Shopping on the app is easy, wishlist is nice, pictures of the clothing could be better. A package can get shipped to you so you can get rid of your own clothes if quality is good. All around an ideal experience",5
13061,Amazin never use any other app !!! U wont regret it trust me,5
13062,What a great store and to get nice name brands so reasonably!!,5
13063,Easy app to navigate... excellent selection of clothing...,5
13064,Having use the app yet,1
13065,"Im sick of my orders getting cancelled spontaneously for no reason. I never know when they're going to cancel an order, and they never say WHY they cancelled it in the first place. I basically have to cross my fingers every time I place an order. It's getting really old and caused me to almost stop using the app entirely.",1
13066,Wonderful and helpful,5
13067,My favorite. Great selection.,5
13068,Nice quality clothes at great prices!,5
13069,I love this app! It makes shopping for second hand clothes very easy. You can accumulate points towards things like free shipping & a percentages off. I highly recommend you give it a try.,5
13070,"Best shopping experience ever! Not only do you get fantastic deals on your favorite brands, but you can feel good about helping to give otherwise discarded clothing a new life. You can have an amazing wardrobe at a fraction of the cost.",5
13071,I've purchased so much and all of the items have been great quality and in perfect shape. Returns are very easy and hassle free. I'm addicted to thredUP!,5
13072,Always great prices! Exceptional delivery time! Ive never had a problem with thredup im highly satisfied with this company and highly recommend it to any women looking for great well taken care of clothing.,5
13073,LOVE THIS APP!,5
13074,Kind of addictive,5
13075,Great,5
13076,It is difficult finding trendy plus size clothing - PERIOD I DON'T HAVE THAT ISSUE WITH Thred Up. Makes me want to take even more care with my appearance. You've helped my confidence.,5
13077,Love this web site.,5
13078,What a business concept...serving our clothing needs while conserving our resources by recycling! The items I have bought at very reasonable prices from Thred Up have been excellent purchases and have been exactly as described on their site. Loving this company.,5
13079,Great variety. Items exactly as described. Easy hassle free returns. Great prices too!,5
13080,It was a bit difficult getting around the site. A lot of the clothes are similar. It can be a bit difficult to see the details of the clothing despite the ability to zoom in. I think it is because the clothes just hang there. Not having models saves money I guess. I still need to search other categories. I intend to donate some clothes. But I prefer to donate closer to home usually. I really like the premise of this site though.,3
13081,"Love the selection and the plus sizes. So much to choose from. Never have to return, always in almost perfect condition and great price.",5
13082,Easy to use. Great way to shop.,5
13083,Have ordered several items and have been very happy with all of them. I sent in several to sell and quickly sold all but one of the accepted pieces!,5
13084,Higher prices than Poshmark. Not good selections. Hated the app.,1
13085,Shopping Therapy. I love it. Great names and great prices.,5
13086,"The selection is great, it's easy to search and narrow down by size and style, and returns are really easy.",5
13087,Search and filter system leave a lot to be desired.,3
13088,"If you're trying to shop sustainably but still get the full shop by app experience, thredUP is great!",5
13089,Really like thredUP,5
13090,"Easy, fun, better than Ross or TJs!",5
13091,"I truly don't know why this site isn't EVERYONE'S first choice for shopping.! I've had 5+ orders and am continuing to experience excellent buys, options on NEW clothes, reliable shipping. I have outfitted myself with 20+ pieces for Spring and spent less than $200. Did I mention the brands are Anne Taylor, GAP, Levi's, Vince Camuto, Steve Madden, Sketchers, Kenzie, etc! And most are new with tags. You will NOT be disappointed. Plus, you are doing your part of your part in being eco friendly🤗",5
13092,It sucks and has nothing for men I feel this is a chauvinist stick at and that Yala prejudice towards men Your Men haters,1
13093,"Love this app! It's essential a designer Goodwill that I can browse on my phone. I give it a 4 because the filtering abilities are wanting. If you put multiple search criteria, for example color ""gray"" and size ""10,"" it will bring up all items tagged with either of those, not items tagged with both of those. Beyond that relatively small inconvenience it is a great app that aids in reducing textile waste. Would recommend.",4
13094,"love thredUP,",5
13095,LOVE...LOVE...LOVE!!! Chi Miigwetch Nj,5
13096,"Thank you. Error fixed, I love this app!",5
13097,Lots of great deals and all items that I've received are like new and I love how they're packaged,5

13099,The best shopping ever! Great prices great clothes and best customer service 👍,5
13100,Love the products that i orders.,5
13101,No mens options.,1
13102,There is no option for men.,1

13106,Only receive donation bags?????,3
13107,Easy to use. Fasr service. Amazing deals on great clothes!,5
13108,I love this app,5
13109,"For the life of me, I can not get the Amazon sign in to work. It works fine through the website, just not the app.",1
13110,Very exciting to find such decent and inexpensive fashion. The used clothes in excellent condition are a steal! Always a great experience,5
13111,"I've spent the last 20 mins after installing the app trying to log in as it keeps saying user email not found. I try to create a new acct, it says user already had one. Can not even find a contact area on the website. Help!!",1
13112,Excellent I love this site!!!,5
13113,"It was my first time trying out ThredUp. I saw this app when I was playing my Candy Crush game & to get another life as we know u got to watch the adds & this one pop up download it next thing I know. I was ordering! Good price for use clothing shoe as well all sizes are available, they even have new with tags too. I am happy with my purchase I just received today it was shipped earlier by seller but with this pandemic goin on its the Post office delayed. All fits good! Will order again soon.",4
13114,Fun to find clothes from the past.,5
13115,Love this app. Lost alot of weight and this app saved me lots of money. Also earned money on my clothes that were too big.,5
13116,Good Very very nice,4
13117,Everything was exceptional!,5
13118,Ease of use and great selection with quality products and real descriptions of products...,5
13119,So far so good except for one order I paid for the 1 to 3 day delivery and all but one package has showed up 4 days later after I had paid not complaining just giving heads up pay attention to the time of the shipments,4
13120,"Payouts are RIDICULOUS!!! smh but the clothes are super cute and reasonably priced *RESPONSE * I understand about being more ""convenient""than ""BIG"" payouts, but if ppl wanted to have their items basically stolen or given away when trying to MAKE money, we would continue to put up with the hassle of doing it all ourselves and reply to every useless messages offering $2 for $40 item...the only difference is that we can actually say NO to those modern day online thieves",3
13121,"Pretty good plus size section. It could be improved by being able to filter searches by more criteria. For example, it's really annoying and time consuming to have to go through thousands of tshirts because you can't select for a particular neckline. It's even more difficult to narrow down shoe searches.",4
13122,Love to look at all the clothes and what's new. I can usually find something really neat to wear. Thanks.!!!!,5
13123,So fun,5
13124,Great clothes at great prices,5
13125,Love the app but I got confused on finding my size,4
13126,Well priced clothes .prices vary ..,5
13127,"Great place! I just wish they would bring down the free shipping price.not everyone has 80$ to get for free shipping and it's too expensive to buy just one thing because of that. Let's quit making the postal system rich!!!!! I do love how they showcase the clothes,its very easy to look at different styles in ur size.",5
13128,DO NOT SELLER TO THRED UP EVER,1
13129,Perfect 👍,5
13130,The prices are crazy for a uses flat shoes that are like $12.99 at Walmart they're like $30 at thredUP. People please be careful when you buy things from these thrift stores. It's freaking ridiculous and in their advertising video it shows things for two $3 or even $8 a piece and that's okay but $45 for a shirt that I can buy at the store for like $12 it's f****** insane,1
13131,"This app is wonderful! The only thing that would make it better (why I gave only 4 stars) is they only show the front and back pictures of wallets. I want to see that, as well as the inside! I like a certain type but never know what the inside looks like. Other than that its amazing. Everything is priced reasonably and comes pretty fast! Thank you!",4
13132,"Super happy with this company, their app, and their service!",5

13160,It was really confusing and difficult to comprehend .,2
13161,Love this app!,5
13162,10⭐😊. Omg....love this app!!!,5
13163,"Fake prices steered me clear. It had things up for 'final sale' at prices I agreed with for a thrift shop. Once they were in my cart they were full price, so I thought maybe I'd enter the discount code and that's not when the price listed was shown either. It took off the discount, but it was still more expensive than the price that led me to put it in my cart. Dont need tricked or lied to. Moving on.",1
13164,Hey talking bout great clothing at affordable prices...,5
13165,"If you're lucky like me, you'll find great pieces. App, easy to use.",5
13166,"I am blown away by this app. I have been disappointed with other apps that were similar..the clothes are high quality and I am happy with my first and second order, this is my third order and I plan to order all my clothing on this app for the coming seasons. Love this app..really!!",5

13178,"Ordered the amount needed for free shipping, was still charged $5.99 shipping??? The clothing looks great, but I why was shipping added, when my order was above the required amount??? Disappointed!! 😟",1
13179,It's clear and simple. Easy to navigate.... What's not to love?,5
13180,Don't really know what the flaws may be. Have not ordered anything from them.,2
13181,Love the deals,5
13182,Pretty good! Only complaint is that is crashes occasionally and you can see more things on the website (out of the app),4
13183,"Easy to buy, usually satisfied.",4
13184,"Major flaws in fabrics of sweaters that were labeled ""like new"". My last shipment smelled bad and pant size was incorrect 😥",1
13185,Fun!! And great values,5
13186,Just started using this app. Will rate again when I use it. So far so good,3
13187,I buy and sell and I love this app,5
13188,"I like that you can send your clothes to thred up and forget about it. The goal was to donate these clothes, and if I made a profit, awesome, and if if I didn't, well I was going to donate them for free anyway.",4
13189,"Cute stuff, good prices",5
13190,Awesome in every way!,5
13191,Easy to use.,5
13192,"ThredUp takes forever to update your balance. And people are so slow at purchasing your items. I've been waiting almost 3 weeks for it to go up so I can cash out. Haven't moved! From now on I'll sell on Poshmark. Hopefully, things are faster with them.",2
13193,I love thredUP! My kids grow so fast and I just cannot justify paying ridiculous amounts for clothing when I have options like this. I bought my oldest daughter and middle son all of their school clothes on here and saved myself $500 and a trip to the mall.,5
13194,Love this app.. makes selling and buying clothes so easy,5
13195,Cool,5
13196,Great app. Just wish could see inside of purses and totes.,5
13197,Love this. I have found so many cute things here. Highly recommended! I'd give more stars if I could.,5
13198,I absolutely love this site! I find me and my daughter our favorite name brands cheap!,5
13199,"The app is good. However, you can remove items from a bundle or change payment once started. That point wasn't made clear.",4
13200,"Had a problem, they fixed it, got my order and clothes were perfect! Thank you!",5
13201,"Please cancel all orders financial problems. Thank you, Irene Burckel",1
13202,Very fun site. I'm enjoying it looking at. And figuring out what I have to add to the site.,5
13203,"While the prices seem reasonable for me, I still need more information...",4
13204,"It's such a pleasure to browse through the website. I can choose pants, tops, my size, and it's all shown very quickly. Prices are outstanding! And shipping is really fast.",5
13205,love it,5
13206,"Super easy to navigate and really love how often the clothing selection updates. I've committed to not buying brand new clothes, but I shop when I'm stressed - so this is a great tool for that.",5
13207,This shop sucks!. Lucky I'm limited to 500 words because I could write a whole damn biography on how crooked this thing is ran.,1
13208,Discounts and free shipping for first time orders were not given. I want this order cancelled.,1
13209,I've bought alot of good items for a fraction of the price. Used items are also in good condition!,5
13210,Literally none of the clothes I got were the correct size. I'm a L to XL but I got everything on the XL side and they were all too small. Whatever they use to determine sizes in the app is wrong.,1
13211,Very nice,5
13212,😁😁,5
13213,"I love this app for buying clothes - thrifting is the only way I buy now. There are tons of high quality items and it's easy to find exactly what I'm looking for every time. It's not great for selling, however, as I received only 33¢ for selling about 3 tops. I know, it's more than I would get for donating, but still, 33¢! While they are transparent about payout prices, the fact that the payout amounts are miniscule and de-incentivise selling through this app remains.",4
13214,Is like finding little treasures.,5
13215,"I LOVE thredup! I highly recommend shopping here - great clothes, great prices, easy to navigate the website, and just a great experience in general!",5
13216,I love this app. Best clothing app ever!!!,5
13217,Easy peasy,5
13218,There is ZERO customer service!,3
13219,Why can't men buy stuff 😞 👉 👈,1
13220,Nice deals. My first outfit defenitely didn't break the bank.,5
13221,"I love a lot of things about thredup. Price, potential quality, the effort in putting textiles in proper recycling channels, and the ability to make some cash when selling things. Sometimes there is a real rush in getting finda on their website with that credit too. Their customer service has also always been off the charts responsive. However I find it very difficult to trust their website sizing. Just got two blazers women's size 16, and one is definitely a boy's. The one, perfect. The other..",3
13222,I really enjoy shopping on the site. Some of the prices are a little bit high for second hand some look outdated. But all in all I do like the website. My packages arrive on time. I wish the shipping was free.,4
13223,Loving it!,5
13224,"Didn't buy a damn thing,because these are far from being Thrift Store Prices.On the better name brands ok I can see the price being a little high.But regular off brand stuff...I don't think so!!!",1
13225,I love Thred Up. I find exactly what I'm looking for and I send items in. It's so much fun.,5
13226,This app is amazing. I love it. I love shopping secondhand but hate the crowd.,5
13227,"UI is amazing, easy to shop, alerts are easy to set. The clothing options are amazing and returns are easy. Love!",5
13228,Cant wait to start shopping,5
13229,Yay saving money while getting well made clothes!,5
13230,"Easy way to get new clothes. Best thing to do is know your key measurements (chest, torso length, etc) and buy items that fit or are bigger than your measurements. I'm obsessed with scrolling through it and finding good deals! Did use customer service on one return but I gave them some time and my credit was applied no problem. Then immediately bought three new items 😁 Highly recomend to use for a fresh new look when you don't have time to physically shop",4
13231,"Seriously love this company!! Just got a large order yesterday, and I loved everything!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Need men's clothes though, my husband is jealous",5
13232,"I like shopping for second hand clothes online but I feel functions are missing. Such as I will be searching for a jacket without the blazer style selected,yet several ""jackets"" are actually blazers. I also think there should be an option to select a material that I don't want because I'm allergic to wool so I wish I could say no wool.",4
13233,"My orders were returned due to my new mail carrier because I was hospitalized. So, I lost out on some of my items because of them being returned. It was part of my first order and I lost out on my discounted price. I was very disappointed. They have a young lady Jennifer, who helped to locate the items. I thought that something happened to them. Jennifer did a great job and was professional with her duty; and I wanted to say thank you soooooo much again to Jennifer.",4
13234,There's so many items over priced for used stuff Iv bought stuff much cheaper on sale brand new,1
13235,"I LOVE having stylist currate boxes for me and have just about tried them all. So when i found out thred up does them too was sooo excited!! UNTIL it took what seemed like forever at least 3 weeks for stylist to even start on my ""trendy"" box. Then when it arrives i was suprised to find clothes best described as garage sale rejects!! Im not oppsed to 2nd hand at all but figured since clothes i see listed are cute fashionable and on trend for most part. Best piece was the faded black jeans.",2
13236,"Confused! Im trying to sell. I dont feel like explaining myself. (Password problems, caused by ThredUp).",1
13237,Not good at all my pay out was very little for amount of clothes I send many were new with tags. Then when I tried to get paid thru my pay pal I was unable to complete the process. They were to send me a code to finish. I never got the code I tried several time. There is a number you can call it gives you very few options. Not able to speak to live person. Not pleased with this company at all.,1
13238,I like that they have a lot of filters so you can find what your looking for easily.,5
13239,"You REALLY have to check it the sellers!!! Ordered my size, yeah right, and to say they didn't fit is an understatement!! Cannot rate sellers or let them know how unsatisfied you are with THEIR product. I'm damn sure not paying to return my item! Not worth the hassle or money. Might as well use Wish, they're not much better!",2
13240,Love this app.,5
13241,Got just what I needed fast.,4
13242,App is very easy to use. Just did my first order and we will see if the items are what they claim to be,4
13243,Very easy site to navigate and use,5
13244,Very addicting trying to find hidden gems,5
13245,Found everything I was looking for and more,5
13246,Love this shopping experience! The clothes are great quality and perfect fit.,5
13247,Always great prices and fast delivery great app easy to use,5
13248,"Wonderful experience! Great quality, Excellent service, Fast shipping, just absolutely wonderful. I had my doubts like all of you reading this but this exceeded my expectations to the fullest. It was so easy to order and there are deals everywhere, all the time. Cant get enough of this app. Thank you to whoever created this amazing shopping experience opportunity 🙏🙏❤",5
13249,Great app. Very user friendly.,4
13250,So far so good,5
13251,"Fun, Fast Shipping, amazing quality clothes at a fraction of the price. App easy enough to shop from while on the treadmill 😀",5
13252,"Lame ap. Installed, and did a search for levis....got women's shirts...uninstalled.....",1
13253,This app is easy to use and I love shopping.,5
13254,Like the clothes. Almost new!,5
13255,I now have an even bigger thrift shop problem than before! THX,5
13256,So easy!,5
13257,I have gotten so many nice clothes from Thred up. I was excited to see they were in Phoenix when I moved here in October..,5
13258,"Easy to use app, great selection and outstanding deals!",5
13259,"Everything I got is great, love the many choices a plus size woman can ask for.",5
13260,Very user friendly. I love shopping with them and when I encountered an issue with an order they fixed it promptly. Great customer service. Would definitely recommend. The app has made it so much easier to shop.,5
13261,Super easy to use!,5
13262,"I love the concept of thred up. For me it's like being ""fed up"" with clothes filling up landfills. Thred up means upgrade your closet. Shop hard shop smart!",5
13263,Love the clothes! Love the prices!,5
13264,So in love with this app it's a must have i promise!!!😍😇🤗😊😋😉😁😆😙😄,5
13265,It's wonderful to see such a thriving consignment community. Two observations which resulted in a star being deducted: 1. There is SO much stuff on this site. Additional filters or some AI to change the order in which items are showed based on what I select would be much appreciated. 2. The pages often freeze up when you change your filter selections. I have to return to home and start over.,4
13266,Prices are good but shipping info is always wrong and hardly ever on time!!!,3
13267,Their customer service sucks.,2
13268,I used to use other consignment apps and was always disappointed by their outdated selection and 'bargain' prices. ThredUP is amazing! I just bought 20 nee pieces for this summer!! I've never had so much fun shopping online!,5
13269,I truly love looking at all the different catagories. Its tickles me to see and enjoy seeing new exciting things.,4
13270,I love how easy this app has been to navigate. No problems with anything.,5
13271,"Wish you could pick your shipping options. They apparently use FedEx which is the reason I'll probably never buy from ThredUp again only because of that. FedEx, and UPS are the worst when it comes to delivery exceptions, in other words don't count on getting your deliveries on the earlier delivery date that is given, or that you pay/paid extra for.",2
13272,"Totally addicted to this app. I find everything in the threadup app, that I would not even think of until I type in my interest info and BAM, there are so many things to choose from with their clothing selection. And don't get me started on the low low prices because there is not enough room to type about them. So long story short get this app ASAP and get nice clothes for a very great price.",5
13273,Would like more color choices in the plus sizes.,4
13274,"Great clothes, bring em on! 🤗",5
13275,"Thredup gets 5 stars. It's the only way I'll shop. But rating the app alone, it's pretty good, but hard to filter so there's a ton you need to go through. The desktop site probably has the best experience but same issues with the filters.",4
13276,Great options! Even better prices! Not to mention it beats a landfill every time!,5
13277,"Selling- 1 wk to get your bag, 1 wk for items to get to them, over 3 wks for them to process. Never ""up to 2 wks"" as they claim. Updated my bag as received 3 days after it was delivered. Now won't get paid until items sell + wait 1 wk for delivery another 2 wks in case return. They got rid of the early payout option and you don't get paid if your item doesn't sell! So basically need to wait AT LEAST 2 months before you see a penny. They cheat you every way possible. Must improve speed!",3
13278,Won't let me sign in with my Amazon user name and password on the App,1
13279,Koooooooooooool app,5
13280,Great idea but definitely not thrift store prices. Way too expensive. I uninstalled the app,3
13281,Love it so far. Great for starting a new job and needing new clothes for it quickly and cheaply. It would be nice if everything shipped relatively at the same time but it all comes fairly quickly regardless.,5
13282,"Poor Customer Service. I knew the $10 deposit went towards your purchases. I knew it was nonrefundable, so I better buy something or I'd loose it. I received a box with all wrong sizes that were not in profile. I returned it. I assumed they would redo it for free. Nope. Don't Assume. Lesson learned.",1
13283,Cant even get in. There is no way to create an account on the app or on their website.,1
13284,"Fantastic prices! Read the description and check sizes, you will love what you purchase!",5
13285,No mens clothes? Really?!,1
13286,I can't believe it's real!! Love this site and it's crew! Strangers who style you for 1/4 price.... that's love!,5
13287,"I always find fun, unique clothes that I love.",5
13288,"Thred up is the greatest, it's the only place I shop anymore. So many items at such great prices.",5
13289,So addicted to this app. I love it. I can get some of my favorite brands at prices that I can afford. Look on here daily as more and more items are added every day.,5
13290,"Prices are way too high, even with introductory discount! $25.99 for a used shirt from Old Navy??! No thank you!",2
13291,"Great clothes! Great prices! Great selection, especially when you don't live anywhere near a fashionable clothing store!",5
13292,Love love love it!! Happy with everything I buy from here !!!,5
13293,Love it!,5
13294,Love it !,5
13295,Gucci maine,5
13296,Love the deals! But they need work on the return turnaround!,5
13297,Online consignment that is sooo convenient!,5
13298,Easy to use and great variety. Wish some of the clothes would be placed on models or at least mannequins to see how the clothing lays.,4
13299,Amazing service from quick delivery to ease of returns to immediate credit. Makes shopping anxiety-free.,5
13300,Fun,5
13301,"Fun to get goody boxes, love that I can clothe my son, great quality, meets descriptions & actually affordable!",5
13302,"I love thrift shopping for sustainability and this app is amazing!! Everything is high quality, really discounted, and easy to use. 10/10 recommend!!",5
13303,"fun. easy. great deals. addicting! my only issue is alot of items do not have measurements. one companies large, can vary greatly from another's large.",4
13304,I had a blast! I would recommend this app to my family and friends. Thank you and have a good day.....Phyllis,5
13305,Easy to use and well organized,5
13306,Love it!,5
13307,"Great app, very easy.",5
13308,"I recently bought a $70 pair of Express slacks new with tags for $10, yes $10!!! 💃😄",5
13309,Sex,5
13310,Great mission & lots of variety. I wish they would consistently include measurements,4
13311,I love this app! It's user friendly and have amazing products. Everything I have ordered looks looks brand new. Great experience so far.,5
13312,Easy to use! I love it!,5
13313,Great place to shop,5
13314,I love the variety of items available. Items are shipped in a timely fashion!,5
13315,Perfect,5
13316,Okay,2
13317,"At first, I found it really annoying that you had to have an account to view items. But overall the diversity, quality, and affordibility of the items can't be beat. I'd recommend everyone check this out, and I can't wait until they offer men's clothing! Choose sustainable clothing!",5
13318,Fabulous website and app. Bith exceed all expectations. I'm obsessed with the ease and variety.,5
13319,Excelent experience. I always find the coolest clothes on this app!,5
13320,Excellent finds. On time deliverys. Good products.,5
13321,Luv it,5
13322,Good app. But really bad place to send stuff onto. It has taken them a month to get my bags shipped back to them. Then it's taken several weeks for them to even touch them and do anything. For all I know my bags I sent back are lost in space.,5
13323,Love how easy it is to use and find things by what you're searching for.,5
13324,Addicting,5
13325,"More scrolling, less paging",5
13326,The concept is pretty cool but I did think that the prices were pretty close to normal retail price if not more expensive at times for used clothes. I can't speak on purchasing or selling experience since I decided not to buy anything because of the prices.,2
13327,"The app gets stuck a lot but when it works, it is very easy to navigate!",2
13328,"I've been having a great experience, so far",5
13329,"Just received my first Order! So excited, everything was BETTER than in the pics. And, I received my order very quickly! You really need to check it out, if you don't find a great deal today - check back tomorrow!! Luv, luv, luv it!",5
13330,I bought a lot of close everything is like brand new they have tons of I could look at this app all day long the only thing is it is a resale shop the price is could be a little lower,5
13331,I can't find the mens clothing. There is a boys section but no mens.,2
13332,I love thredUP.I always buy secondhand.Every item is in perfect condition.I never shop in department stores anymore.I won't buy from any other place. I am a customer for life!,5
13333,I've got such cute clothes from here! Most of which were brand new with tags but half the price. What a fantastic way to get good quality clothing ! Thank you.,5
13334,So easy to use and I love being able to shop thrift online!,5
13335,Wonderful,4
13336,I really like ThreadUp. I find myself checking the app for something first before going somewhere else.,5
13337,Easy to navigate!,5
13338,"Great design for an app and a wonderful concept, but where's the men's section? Very disappointed 😞",1
13339,Good But it was my first buy and i did not got my 50% off,4
13340,I've wanted this app but kept forgetting to download it I'm excited!! I want to learn how to sell too!!,5
13341,It is always loading!,1
13342,Really cheap prices. Make sure to really view details about stuff because some things look like a certain material but arent what they seem in the picture. Overall tho happy with my bargain finds!,4
13343,Awesome quality for a great price.,5
13344,The site is nice for browsing. Unfortunately the quality of the clothes were not true to picture or were faded. I am highly disappointed as this was my first time purchasing. I sent in a bag months ago with quality clothes received nothing!,2
13345,Love this app,5
13346,Great want this,5
13347,I love this app nice clothes that u don't pay an arm and leg for.,5
13348,App will not let me log in without redirecting to Amazon. Incredibly frustrating. I'll have to use the site until fixed.,1
13349,"excellent quality. shipping is prompt. Like the brands and good selections. Only wish there was more time for returns. Can not always get to post office for returns, therefore had to keep the item. Will return with my clean up bag.",4
13350,"Why only female clothing, why not ADD Male clothing as well it's already set up for it.?",4
13351,I love it,5
13352,"I can't express how much I LOVE thredUP!!! 90% of my wardrope is from threadUP! EVERY SINGLE ITEM I have purchased, from thredUP, has been nothing less, than SUPERIOR QUALITY! I can afford to look expensive with a limited budget! THANK YOU thredUP!!! 💜 Liz",5
13353,Obsessed with this online thrift store. So many amazing finds!,5
13354,love this app...alot of nice clothes to select from...i have been happy with each purchase I have made,5
13355,Great selections in app. Easy to Navigate.,5
13356,"I love ThredUp! So happy to know there's a great place like this to shop with a huge selection and good prices. You can find almost anything. Plus for me, it feels great helping the environment and giving items a second chance to thrive and avoid landfills.",5
13357,Love the prices! And I can send bags of clothes that I'm not wearing and get credit for the ones that sell,5
13358,Horrible!,1
13359,"I am so in love with ThredUp, I am constantly looking for new things and love all the great brands at affordable prices.",5
13360,Too expensive for being second hand clothing,1
13361,"I give 2 stars because thredup has quite a few issues. Any items that are returned are refunded with a credit...they do not refund your money. A lot of the items are non-returnable, i also noticed they raise the prices on some items after a few weeks, there are onky 2 pics for each item (front & back)no side photos. Many items dont have much detail and they often have wrong information on the items & customers are unable to cancel an order unless you contact customer service threw email exc.",2
13362,I was very disappointed with this site. It's a trip off!,1
13363,"Enjoying the list of filters, they narrow down the inventory to exactly what I want. Also the measurements are very useful to see if the item will fit me well.",5
13364,Great,4
13365,I just had to contact customer service. The fault was all mine. But I talked to Vera and she was kindness itself. Everything was resolved more than fairly. I am more than pleased with this interaction.,5
13366,"Great customer service. Once you enter your fave brand and sizes, just wait to be notified that your treasures are there!",5
13367,"Read review after review on different sites from frustrated consumers who sent in their clothes and got almost nothing for it. Also heard their customer service is email only. I had been eager to buy, but after researching your business practices I'll be uninstalling the app.",1
13368,Great deals,5
13369,I order a goody box every month. I am never disappointed. Such fun! It's like Christmas every month. Beautiful quality pieces at great prices! I love love love thread up!!!!!,5
13370,Love! Love! Love!,5
13371,"Over all I'd say thread up has been a pretty good experience. It would be nice if they categorized based on the actual size measurements, not the tag. They have really raked in on re-stocking fees from my returns bc the sizes we're off. Lots of great brands and all clothing has been in pretty good condition.",3
13372,Love it! The clothes I got were new with tags and they fit just right. It also came very quickly in the mail! I'm very impressed with the packaging and speed of delivery. I will probably be ordering again!,5
13373,"Love this app ! Very easy to navigate, prices are extremely reasonable and overall appearance/quality is wonderful. Absolutely an app for every woman to shop affordable clothing that's been recycled !",5
13374,Never disappointed. Great clothes for a great price!,5
13375,BS that their is no mens clothes. Thanks for alienating.,1
13376,Cashing out is very difficult,1
13377,Amazing! Easy to find specific items!,5
13378,"Sorting by most recent doesn't work, making it impossible to find the new items the app pops notifications up for",3
13379,Great deals,5
13380,You can go to a store and get brand new stuff for what this place charges way to high for used stuff,1
13381,Great,5
13382,"There are some useful filter options that are available on the full website that are not available through the app, which can make it difficult to find what I'm looking for. Overall, I managed to find some good items, but I would love the additional options. Also, can you make dresses searchable by sleeve length?",3
13383,Love love love!!!,5
13384,"I really havent tried it yet, but often want something for an occasion, for a short time..nor dont want over filled closets full of things I dont wear. This is a great answer without paying huge costs as most we dont wear clothes beyond seasons. Unless it a great timeless piece.",3
13385,So for good,5
13386,"So So.. ordered 2 items 1 was perfect and as described. The 2nd was awful.. stated barely used, was so stretched out and poor quality ended up returning to them",3
13387,Pretty cool app must say!,5
13388,Love this app! The clothes are like new!,5
13389,Great way to find quality used clothing to help reduce the impact of clothing on the environment.,5
13390,"NO *Men's* Category...?!? Then (perhaps consider that) *FedUp/thredUP* should 'Market' 'Advertise' 'Promote' or *Label* this 'App' ""for Women (only)""...?!? [Makes sense to me, just to 'avoid' *feedback* from people who would otherwise appreciate such an App (for 'MEN')... JestSayin'... *THINK!!!* (Edit: ooppss... it is 'hidden' (by being later) in the Description Headline ""Shop&Sell Women's and Kid's Clothing""...

13391,So much fun because I'm not breaking the bank!,5
13392,"I literally love this app, it sounds bad but I spend more money on here than I do on my groceries, best consignment shop app I have ever decided to download",5
13393,This is only for women and children. Smh,1
13394,I can get these same prices on brand new merchandise during sales with no shipping. Why would I pay the same amount for used clothes. For references I'm shopping sizes 1X/20. Uninstalling.,1
13395,"Great service! ... Shopping is easy, lots of filters and searching is simple. My first order came quickly and the items were just as described and pictured. Love threadUp and the app.",5

13400,Did not see any merchandise.,1
13401,"Great, super easy",5
13402,Awesome!,5
13403,The first time i ordered i was able to return in time. The second time i was not fast enough to return. It was still in the same month. They need to extend return time. Some of the cloths were a lot thinner material than it looked like pictured....sometimes the internet is not the best place to buy cloths.😒,2
13404,"I love the filter options that allow me to find just what I want as well as the notification feature that let's me know my favorite or saved sesrch items are available! Also, the bundle option so I can save on shipping costs 😁",5
13405,Just downloaded and tried my first search....around and around and around for 5 minutes! Useless!!,1
13406,Really easy to use!,5
13407,"I had a style 15 code that it would not let me use, not good sending flyers if I can not get to use them",5
13408,Love shopping at Thredup There are so many beautiful items at a discounted price. I can find all my favorite brand for a fraction of what I would pay at the store. Best of all is the quality ; if you don't want to go wrong choose you items like new condition or with tags. Receiving the package feels like Christmas!,5
13409,I am trying to enter my credit card info and it freezes up on me. I'm not going to be ordering anything from your company ever...,1
13410,luv it,5
13411,Don't have enough big girl clothes,3
13412,"It's a very nice app: a lot of choices and very detailed, but pay attention to the measurements (a little smaller than you expect). I also like that are choices for new products.",4
13413,Prices are too high. It thought it was like a thrift store but it's like walking in the stores and paying full price. Other apps have name brand for a lot lower!!!,3
13414,"Awesome! I love checking out what is here, but I warn you, it's addicting lol! So many awesome items at great prices!",5
13415,The app did not want to process the order to begin with. I had to keep working with it. Close the app and start again.,4
13416,"This is the best app/company for second-hand apparel. Great prices! No membership or fees to use! If you have returns, they pay the postage! This is by far my favorite online store😍👍!!",5
13417,"I like the concept and I like the site But a few things: 1.Good for browsing clothes, but I've noticed that the filters miss a lot of stuff, so that's not helpfu, if you're looking for something specific 2. Slow shipping, slow returns (took a week to process my return order) and I think they check your feedback to see what you kept, rather than checking your return box because I was charged for a sweater I didn't keep. I'll be buying once more to pick up some stuff I loved, but after that? No",3
13418,I like it a lot. Sometimes the descriptions are not that accurate but maybe I'm picky. Overall I like shopping second had clothes makes me less guilty of buying fast fashion.,4
13419,Easy to shop and browse,5
13420,I can always find what I'm looking for.,5
13421,"I always find exactly what I'm looking for, they describe the quality of the clothes very well. I have never received something that I didn't like or thought it was too used to look good! I also love that the shipping is always on time and easy to track.",5
13422,I downloaded the app just to see what all they had and prices and it's a no for me. I can go to the Thrift stores and pay less for some of the same brands. And still save on gas. Prices are to high.,1
13423,It's really easy to use. I wish searching for something specific was a little easier. Not great filter options.,4
13424,Very nice.,5
13425,Just cause I'm a guy doesn't mean I don't like clothes. Too bad.,2
13426,Love using thred up! Always find great items that ship quickly to my door!,5
13427,Loving this app!,5
13428,I have fallen in love with thredUP! I have always tried to buy resale and now i have quality products at my fingertips!,5
13429,"The app is fine However, the purse I purchased was described as being like new. That was not accurate at all!. The vinyl was peeling terribly when I received it and after a few weeks the pursel needs to be thrown away! I wish I hadn't wasted my money",2
13430,I love this..easy shopping,5
13431,Easy to navigate and lots of affordable options.,5
13432,Very hard to use. Everytime I try to purchase something it freezes and close our the app. I Dont reccomend.,1
13433,Customer service is very hard to get in touch with. I've been trying to cancel an order since about 10 mins after placing the order. Of course I never got an answer from customer service for about 14 hours and by then the answer was I'm sorry your order has already been processed.,1
13434,Great app,5
13435,Easy to order. Excellent choices in clothing.,5
13436,First time shopper.,5
13437,"I just bought clothing from ThredUp for the first time. Buying new clothing is one of the most environmentally unfriendly things you can do, so I LOVE recycled clothing. The clothing I received is in perfect condition, and matches the description and photos exactly. Super high quality stuff for cheap! Amazing selection too. I never find this much variety in a store, especially in my size (petite).",5
13438,"Addictive! I have made so many purchases from ThredUp, and I'm never disappointed. I've even received new items with the tags still attached. The brands are top-of-the-line, and the discounts are amazing. I've managed to put together a fabulous work wardrobe for very little money. My biggest score was a $240 blazer that I got for $20! I don't like to shill for companies, but I'm a huge ThredUp fan.",5
13439,Great selection!,5
13440,never have I spent more on clothing and accessories in m'life,5
13441,Exelent app,5
13442,Should of read the subtitle first. They do not sell men's stuff which sucks.,1
13443,"Update: prices have gone up noticeably. First use. Shopped according to the measurements listed instead of relying on size. Got a lot of cute stuff, and it all fit perfectly and was in the shape described! Shipping didn't take too long. This is going to become an addiction!",3
13444,Thread up Shop & Sell good things.,5
13445,"Absolutely Garbage, I'm going to trash them everywhere I can, it's insane in 2020,we have startups that exclude men, reverse sexism is not OK, if there were a startup company that excluded women, it would be crucified and drug through the mud everywhere, but it's supposed to be A OK to exclude men?",1
13446,So much fun to scan thru!,5
13447,It amazing,5
13448,Why is there not a men's clothing?,1
13449,"Just download and app won't load. Tried everything listed below, I have a new phone and 5g wifi and still nothing. Uninstalled and will go back to my usual other 3 resale apps. Fix this Thredup!",1
13450,"I have always had a phenomenal experience with the thred UP. I did hesitate with sizing; however, they size them so perfectly I have never been disappointed. I love the wide varieties and at a reasonable price. This place is my favorite place to shop. P.S Shipping is fast; I like the packaging. I keep those tissue paper so I can reuse it.",5
13451,Love!,5
13452,"App Constantly crashes on my android phone. The products are frequently mislabeled (size 42 shoes ARE NOT size 12) and labeling is sometimes inconsistent (denim). 3 stars for offering large size shoes and options to shop by size and color. Would like to see searching by category within favorites. Comparable more with consignment stores than thrift. Option to return a plus. Easy to request a kit. Also when selling, selling price can be adjusted. Purchased items can be tracked. Easy returns.",3
13453,"Quality checking appears honest. Thoughts are way overpriced for pre-owned and nothing about seems relavent to me,including the more accurately priced items that I feel are overpticed, just less of",4
13454,Easy to shop,5
13455,Excellent!!!,5
13456,"Love all the outfits , it's like playing dressup al over and over💚💜",5
13457,Has become my favorite place to shop,5
13458,Beautiful 😍,5
13459,Great app - love that it will auto filter the sizes you set!,5
13460,Great online service,4
13461,Clothes are worn and not worth the money.,2
13462,Great site .. ♥️💙,5
13463,Fun and very easy to use.,5
13464,"I like getting my clothes at thrift stores and this is a better option. I like the small nod to this being environmentally friendlier than new clothes without being upfront about it, like the mint logo. And i like the variety",5
13465,No mens,1
13466,"Im having to download your app.tha makes any thing i need to look up screens need for medical ,foods ,news turn to window i need alike slower , so have not had no experince with your app. But in time if i keep your app.i've found bargains , im can go to wal -mart buy out of season items for 2 or 3.00 , not for resale . I need to nohow to open the window to sign up to make pictures of items i buy to resale for a profit",1
13467,"I really wish measurements for clothing was provided! Otherwise, my positive experiences are buying not one but two genuine leather jackets for drastically less than they would be brand new--this Leather Femme is very pleased.",3
13468,My first package I got I loved it can't wait for the others to come in thank you i just ordered again i love it,5
13469,Unfortunate you don't have Men's clothing,1
13470,Awesome,4
13471,"I am obsessed. Cute, good quality clothes with brands I love! Returns are easy peasy and their mission/values inspire me! Love love love ThredUp!",5
13472,I absolutely love this app!,5
13473,Every order fits great! Love the brands,5
13474,"Great to have access to such variety of discount clothing. The packing is thoughtful and the extra care for a discount clothing shop shows the company is invested in their work and in their customers. The clean out bag feature is excellent! The thing that could use some attention is the searching, sorting, and filter functions; can be hard to find something specific and the start page could use some finessing.",4
13475,Y'all don't have a spot for me this is trash,1
13476,"First, the good, which is that they often have coupons for free shipping and have reasonable prices. However, have two major issues that make me nervous to keep using this app. It can be hard to find what you're looking for, and items are sometimes not as described. I ordered a jumpsuit that they claimed had ""minimal fading"", but came with a huge hole in the waistband. They refunded the purchase price, but don't refund shipping, so I basically paid $6 to get something I can't even wear.",3
13477,"Good finds, happy shopping",5
13478,Never did get my Easter dress. FedEx says it's on ThredUp and can't contact ThredUp to file a claim. Buy your damn clothes somewhere else.,1
13479,Good,4
13480,Always a good experience!!,4
13481,Great,5
13482,Women clothes only what the hell?? What about us men? Boo,1
13483,I really like thredup and the app works great I've had no issues. I don't love how little you get paid for things you sell or the fee you end up paying for any returns or exchanges for items that don't work out.,4
13484,Love it found exactly what I wanted,5
13485,Best way to shop hands down!,5
13486,This store is amazing and amazingly cheap.they have anything u want pretty much ..and its like brand new...,5
13487,it's taking forever to get anything back on the clothes I sold,3
13488,Looking through these items online makes me want to go to the real shop. I liked the sales & markdowns as well as the incentives! Great marketing strategies! Hopefully after a couple purchases I will be able to focus on more stars!,3
13489,"Good selection on mostly plain, some wild clothing. Interesting.",4
13490,"Everything I love about great thrift finds but with filters that help me find what's on my list So. Much. Faster. vs in person shopping... Returns are easy, prices are great (better than eBay). And quality of items is good and straight forward. If you know your sizes, you're in business Only gripe is that the coloring in photos is a little muted. You need to read the description to know what color something is, even though photos appear really well lit. Be careful about that one thing.🌞",5
13491,Great site,5
13492,I love thredUP! With all of the filters they have to pinpoint my searches it makes shopping so easy! Best online clothing store I've ever used!,5
13493,Hard to locate the custom goody box and rewards dont show up,4
13494,Easy to order and easy to return things.,4
13495,"I love the wide selection of clothing, but unless you qualify for free shipping, your total can add up fast.",4
13496,I like this app. Its easy to use. I havent had any issues with it. Its fun to see what brands of clothes people are selling!,5
13497,Excellent options great prices,5
13498,"Downloaded 4× & the app will not open at all. The page says ""Thredup"" but won't go past the title screen to shop.",1
13499,Exceptional!,5
13500,Easy and well organized design,5
13501,Not my kind of secondhand prices and unknown brands..,1
13502,No Mens Tab?,1
13503,Great source of brand name clothing for a fraction of the price,5
13504,App is getting better and better.,5
13505,"Best way to buy clothes. Probably better for the environment too some how... I love this app I have saved well over $300 so far. People treat me different, now that im wearing name brand activewear 😂😂.. Guess I was a bum before! HA! Bum in walmart good will clothes ... Again #1 app for single moms who want to look expensive 😂😂 okay im done. It's 2:30am... lol",5
13506,Great! Absolutely Love! Fabulous selection and quality,5
13507,Fabulous!,5
13508,Good app wish search was better,4
13509,I got 2 dresses from here amazing except 1small rip in dress 2 anyways amazing🙂😃,4
13510,I love finding my favorite brands for less. Such a great way to vamp up my wardrobe.,5
13511,This app gives you the run around when trying to transfer money from the app to a bank account.,1
13512,Good,5
13513,Ok,5
13514,Great way to find used clothes! I haven't gotten anything that was in poor shape.,5
13515,"Great styles, great prices, fast delivery, great customer service!!!!💖",4
13516,Love using the app! ThredUp even ships to fpo/apo super fast!,5
13517,Easy peasy 😄,5
13518,I have bought 3 tops from this site and was very pleased. I will definitely be buying other things....,5
13519,"Great app! I had issues with the first installation, but they worked with me one-on-one and got everything running smoothly, so I came back here to edit this review.",4
13520,Love shopping thredup...would like to see improved clothing description; minimizing steps; faster connectivity; have also experienced not being able to use discount codes- this is frustrating. I will continue shopping 2nd hand!,4
13521,I love this app! Great clothes without breaking the bank!,5
13522,Easy to find things,5
13523,Only place I can find bootcut Jean's anymore...at a great price! Love it.,5
13524,Got charged 3 times for the same item tried to talk to a customer service and they told me that the items were denied I have it showing so customer service for this company sucks,1
13525,No problems as of yet!! Love this app and platform!!,5
13526,Very easy to use. Very good quality and fast delivery. I recommend 200%,5
13527,"I love this app and have ordered a lot of clothing at excellent prices!! Especially Roxy, Hurley, and Billabong. Also on Aeropostale jeans. Half the price I would pay in the store and always in great shape!! My only complaint is the filter Queries still need some work. I.e. searching size 4 in kids also brings back 4T which is a totally different size and smaller than a kids 4. I emailed the dev email so it'd be great if this can be worked on! Once that's fixed it will be 5 stars for sure.",4
13528,It's a good app but.... For some odd reason the Amazon log in/ sign up isn't working. Please fix this.,2
13529,So far. No problem. I'm new.,5
13530,Clothes weren't that great and no cheaper than buying new ones on sale,1
13531,Looks good,4
13532,"Doesn't really make sense that there isn't a men's portion in the app. If the app is based on users sending in clothes, why couldn't men's clothes be accepted and sold as well? I understand that there probably wouldn't be many men sending in clothes, which would make for a pretty smell men's section, but that doesn't mean it should be completely non-existent.",3
13533,Good for updates on orders or quick buys.,4
13534,This experience sucks.,1
13535,"I hate shopping and avoid trips to the clothing store like the plague - the majority of my clothes are at least 10 years old... This app makes shopping really fun between the hunt for unique items and the almost game-like aspect of snagging that special blouse before somebody else pops it into their cart... then lurking in hope that their cart will expire before they buy it... 🙃🤫😬 Please add chest measure for jackets/cardigans, a filter for waistline type, and waist measure for skirts 🙏🏾",5
13536,Great place,5
13537,"Great stuff, very addicting!",5
13538,It's a pretty great way to buy used clothing.,4
13539,"I really love this site, being able to sell and clean out my closet in a sustainable way AND purchasing sustainably is awesome!",5
13540,Easy to use,5
13541,Awesome!,5
13542,"Loved everything sent but few items were to big ,one cute blouse had spot on it looking forward to next box !! Sooo happy thank you !! Brandie",5
13543,"Thred is the only store I shop online at anymore. It's easy, awesome and environmentally right on.",5
13544,"I love this app! Great finds at great prices! I could not find a specific color in the stores to go with a sweater, but I found it on Thred Up! Satisfied Customer!",5
13545,The app is very easy to navigate. I love that you can set you filters so that you only see your sizes and even perferred brands. I've ordered well over 10x likely over 30 items a d have only once recieved something with a defect of any kind. I love this!,5
13546,Total rip off...never gave me my clothes or money. Reporting to bbb. Dont do it!,1
13547,Good service I like they way it works however I'd probably get more money if they wouldnt put a timer on the sales which takes my products out of the purchasing area. Kind of also wish I could get a bit larger percentage out of my sales but I understand they need money for all of the shipping costs and people they have to pay sooo... 🤷‍♀️,4
13548,"Endless affordable shopping, awesome customer service, fast and free returns",5
13549,I'm going to be in debt because this app is addictive and amazing!,5
13550,Great prices and cute clothes. All my 6 items I received within a week all gently used not worn out or fading. I will be ordering again!,5
13551,"I love this app! I have always been a thrifter, I hate spending retail on myself.",5
13552,Greatest Thrift Shop....,5
13553,Easy to use. Easy to search for just what I wanted.,5
13554,"I love being able to thrift shop online but I *really* wish I could filter out jeans/trousers by inseam. It's so exhausting having to open each item to find out the length, since 35"" is so hard to find as it is. It would save loads of time as well to be able to search by bust measurement. The filtering capability is already there, and measurements often are as well -- please add a few more measurement options to the filter! I would definitely shop here more frequently if the tool was improved :)",3
13555,It's only for girls,1
13556,Not very good customer service.,2
13557,Great way to shop for clothes! Only slight downside is that it sometimes crashes when you go back but it's not super frequent. Love it!,5
13558,"I'VE PURCHASED NAME BRAND BRAND ITEM'S,BEFORE AND HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE THE ITEM'S I'VE ORDERED. I LOVE THE QUALITY OF THE CLOTHING AND PURSES &BOOTS!THRED UP IS FABULOUS TO SHOP!THANK YOU!",5
13559,"I dislike store shopping, thred up enables me to shop at home no matter the time or weather.",5
13560,"I love all the deals that I find on clothes that are either brand new with tags or in excellent, like new new.",5
13561,Amazing! Love the many options! Shipping is a little high though. But it's worth it,5
13562,"Fast, affordable and fits.",5
13563,"Disappointed you can search by style or detail i.e. burnout t-shirt, sheer, align leggings, woven. A ton of brands are not searchable because they instead use ""various brands"". Material details are also 90% of the time not available which matters if your looking for spandex or cotton %. In addition style of jeans are not listed.... Not a fan at all.",1
13564,"The app randomly signed me out and won't let me sign back in with my Amazon acct. The message I keep getting is ""Sorry, Amazon sign up did not work. Please try again."" First of all, I'm not trying to sign UP, I'm trying to sign IN. I've tried updating and reinstalling the app. Nothing works. It seems the only way to sign in with my Amazon acct. is by using the actual web browser, which I'm not going to keep doing. Completely defeats the purpose of the convenience of the app. Uninstalled.",1
13565,"Easy to use app, great service. Love all the great deals + the extra cash I make when I clean out my closet!!!",5
13566,I have found a lot of brand name clothing with the tags still on. I've gone outside of my comfort zone clothing wise because I didn't feel as guilty buying them. Highly recommend.,5
13567,Amazing!! So easy to use.,5
13568,Love this app,5
13569,Love how easy it is to shop so much product!,5
13570,I open the app but its just the loading screen,2
13571,I really enjoy this app. It has good prices and nice clothes too.,5
13572,App failed four times.,1
13573,Lot of sales for my grandchildren's clothing they grow so fast love thredup great prices and selections,5
13574,Great!!,5
13575,Why no men's clothing?,1
13576,"Insane pricing. It's a great idea and if the pricing was better, it would be great. They want too much money for the items so the merchandise will not move fast enough. I uninstalled the ap.",1
13577,Searching for things is hard. Just looking for bunny motifs or frozen things doesn't work. You can only search by brand. And the prices are high for some of the items. Also the pictures look like they the clothes were crumbled in a ball then photographed. A quick steam would make it look easy better. Note appealing for purchase.,3
13578,Mostly spot on. Sometimes need to return,4
13579,Best clothing app for kids!!!!,5
13580,Very easy to use. Love the items,4
13581,Can u fix your app it keeps saying Y'all having difficulties please try again and then I will change my stars,2
13582,"Every single day i have to uninstall and reinstall this app . it freezes on the homescreen. Still..,Feb 16 now...just not working. Keeps saying, oops were having trouble loading the app right now. Over and over. I cant buy anything! All my stuff came out of my cart and i cant get back in! What is wrong with you ??? Do you realize what a pain this is? I have noticed a pattern. Your app cant handle the traffic created when you have a sale. Im done with the frustration. Youll not get my$ anymore",1
13583,"App will not let me log in with anything. Facebook, email, Google, etc. It just sits there loading.",1
13584,The app was working great until today can't get it so tried uninstalling and now it won't let me install it. Very frustrating since I have items that I am selling and also have credit that I would like to use,2
13585,Enjoyable,5
13586,"Update is horrible. It's very slow, if it works at all. I loved this app and the concept but have uninstalled for now since I can't go back yo the previous version.",1
13587,"I want to love the app because I love the ideas but it is SO DANG SLOW! It took me 10 minutes alone to create an account because it was loading so long and finally when I created it, it took another 10 minutes of loading the front page for me to even view clothes! The waiting for loading is just too much.",2
13588,I just received my first order from Thred Up . Everything is great and just as described!! Definitely recommend!,5
13589,Makes it so easy to buy used. Literally the only place I shop.,5
13590,I've always liked second hand stores that have the brands I love at a reasonable price!,5
13591,Awesome!,5
13592,Great app and easy to navigate! Love this website! Wish they showed side views of the clothing. Also wish there was a way to ask a question about the item to receive more details. Otherwise I absolutely love this app!,5
13593,Not for men,1
13594,Can find any men stuffs. Can't even search for them. Just described it as the largest women and kids online thrift store instead.,1
13595,Easy to use,5
13596,"I LOVE IT! I had a few pieces that didn't fit right on my first few orders. Very important to know your measurements!! Lol. I know how to sew, so I was able to make make quick adjustments. You can't beat the prices! I LOVE to thrift!! I wear mostly dresses or skirts and it can get expensive depending were you shop. I have gotten coats, boots and shoes everything fit!",5
13597,Great experience! Everything came in a timely manner as stated.,5
13598,Love the variety!!,5
13599,Because I know my size + fit in my favorite brands it's easy for me to sort and filter to find great clothing at super-low prices on ThredUp. Their diligence in providing accurate measurements for each item helps me refine my choices to items that fit my body perfectly. I have been able to upgrade my wardrobe within a few months on HALF of my monthly clothing budget. One other benefit of searching through their online inventory is the range of styles& designers represented--so much more variety!,5
13600,Some good things about this service but I feel like items i sent in a clean out bag were not evaluated fairly. I have gotten things from this site that were in worse shape than the items i sent in and since I presumed my things would be accepted and posted I elected to let them do whatever with the items not accepted. As a result I am very put off by how this turned out.,1
13601,Really good,4
13602,"Description are sketchy, but that'd what the return policy is for. Lot's of beautiful things so I don't have to spend as much time in stores. You can't tell that ""like new"" items have been worn before.",4
13603,I love the filters. I love the variety. And I love the deals!,5
13604,My favorite shopping experience is thredUP after several years and many orders!,5
13605,"I love thredUP! I love everything about the app! Being able to heart favorites, it sorts what's still available, my sizes are stored so I dont have to continuously put it in, I can save searches, and it usually has extra % off. It's perfect! ❤",5
13606,I am obsessed 😍 My new addiction 👍,5
13607,Love it,5
13608,Very good,5
13609,Best online thrift store,5
13610,"I've literally never had a problem with this app, one time I thought there was something wrong with it because it wouldn't let me order anything with my card and turned out I had my internet transactions disabiled cause I'm a tard.. anyway, I love this app.",5
13611,"Love Thred Up. Great quality items and very fair pricing. Love a company that cuts back on clothing waste. One comment- it would be super helpful to be able to search by item type rather than just brands. For example, if i type ""embroidered denim shirt"" random things show up. Just a thought!",5
13612,So easy to use!,5
13613,Great deals; most items are in great shape.,5
13614,"Easy easy easy,",5
13615,Wash dry and fold,5
13616,Have a great time on this app,5
13617,"For used clothing, you charge way too much",1
13618,"I LOVE this company!! I have bought gently used forever and this company has found the right way to do it. Additionally, I live in a remote part of TX and have no access to this type of clothing. Now I DO with ThredUp!! Debbe",5
13619,Good,5
13620,Meh,5
13621,Shipping is fast but it should be since you pay full price for it unless you spend 75 the clothes are highly priced to be second hand I think I would only spend under ten for regular used items and the only thing I see for 899 is scarf s. I did find a few tops o order and a few kid shirts but I'd rather go to aero and Hollister tbh and same price get brand new clothes just my thought if it would have been at least free shipping would have made me feel little better but the idea is great,2
13622,A lot of nice and pretty stuff at a very reasonable price. My girls are going to look even more adorable and precious.,5
13623,Awesome,5
13624,Love Thred Up! Recycle!,5
13625,Exceptional,5
13626,I've ordered several times from here and had a good experience each time.,5
13627,Unfortunately for the no of items sold and return for items it just is not worth it. Sent a no of items with tags still on and didn't even make $20. I believe I sent at least one dozen items.h Have been trying to get my cash posted to PayPal have been trying for over half an hour and my security code keeps changi g and I want it sent to my PayPal a.c. but customer service chat line is not available again this is the 2nd day I have tried so can someone please put my cash over to my PayPal or not.,2
13628,"I love the filters, although they should have one for type of sleeves. What I dislike is that you cannot save a search sorted by ""lowest to highest"". The lowest to highest sorting will default to ""newest"". Each time you click into an item then back out again to your saved search defaults to newest. 😠",3
13629,Love it...,4
13630,I love thredup!! thrifty shopping at your finger tips!!,5
13631,"Love it! My new addiction, amazing clothes at crazy low prices!",5
13632,I placed an order after thoroughly reviewing each item I purchased. Not only reading the descriptions but closely looking at each picture. To my surprise 4 of the items were not as described. The Calvin Klein dress has spots all over 1 side of it. The Greylin dress was being held together with safety pins in several areas. The black Zara top with sequins on the shoulders had several missing and several lose. The H&M pink pants were dirty as if someone had just worn them. Disappointing items.,3
13633,I just love the fact that i can come back to my shopping cart after hours and items still waiting for me. They give you 24 hours with items in your cart before the item is removed. Its easy to use. And i love theres a ton of selections to chose from,5
13634,Love the quality and prices of some of my favorite styles!,5
13635,I love thedUP! The app is very easy to use. I found out about this company through YouTube channels I frequent and I'm so glad. I've used the thredUP app to purchase clothes and order the bag to sell my unused clothes. Very easy for both and arrives in a timely manner.,5
13636,Love this app. Gives me every option without going to the store. The measurements for each item if you scroll down are very accurate! Great app!!!,5
13637,Love everything at great cost,5
13638,I give Thread up 5stars. My shopping experience was fun and easy!,5
13639,"Great stuff to buy! Also very easy to sell the items you clean out. Love the Goody Boxes, too!",5
13640,Love this app. I think the limit for free shipping should be lowered and they Jack up the price a bit on items compared to how much they payout consignment and they shouldn't charge a restocking fee for returns. But I love the items I get I would just order a lot more if free shipping limit was lowered.,3
13641,Very easy to narrow search Lots of choices.,5
13642,"False advertising. Showing photos far different than reality. Wasting my time and money, now I have useless clothes taking up space!",1
13643,"Love shopping at Thread Up! I find the greatest deals and unusual items that I'd never find anywhere else. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that they (Whoever 'they' are), think that 'Tall' inseams start at 32"". To me that's a capri. Any inseam shorter than a 35"" is a high water or ankle length. I do have to say that they measure each pant, even if their measurements dont match the tag, they tell you what it really is. I really appreciate that. Thanks Thred Up! Great customer service!",4
13644,Love it!,5
13645,"I want to keep it a secret. It's the best of new, second hand, and Amazon. It's like Zappos but with a much lower prices. You can get so many new with tags items on here for a steal. Their customer service and their perks are amazing.",5
13646,Great....,5
13647,"ThredUp is a fantastic site, and the app has be very easy to use.",5
13648,Cant sell your self no thanks,1
13649,Love it,5
13650,I'm so very pleased with every item I've purchased loving thedUP...,5
13651,I love shopping for clothes on Thred Up. I've gotten incredible deals and beautiful clothes and shoes!,5
13652,"I have not been disappointed, quality goods have ordered several times still not disappointed",5
13653,Niceqq,5
13654,Love it,5
13655,Sucky customer service.. Someone used my email and I'm trying to get them to unsubscribe my email and they take forever to get an answer,1
13656,Little pricey,2
13657,So easy with great items,5
13658,"Shopping was really straightforward, clothes arrived in cute tissue packaging and really excellent condition. I'd highly recommend. Also warm fuzzies for reusing clothing, reducing waste, saving money. What's not to love?",5
13659,Thank you for customer rep Dario for helping me resolve issues I brought up recently. I give him a 2 thumbs up for a job well done. I'm soo pleased with the quick response and actions taken to straighten up the problems I had. I highly recommend the the site for shoppers who loves to buy high end items for a fraction of a cost. I love shopping at Thred up.,5
13660,Everything works great,5
13661,Love this@,5
13662,AWESOME!!!!,5
13663,Great app and great service with incredibly affordable prices for nice quality clothes.,5
13664,I love shopping again 💗💗,5
13665,Pretty easy good discounts,5
13666,Very dissatisfied with my purse purchase and will not purchase again,1
13667,Good,4
13668,LOVE everything I've purchased.,5
13669,Great! Really enjoy the shopping experience.,5
13670,Easy app to use. You can shop by your size. And use the filter to narrow down your search. And you are alerted when items you favorites go on sale.,5
13671,I love this ap.....the items I've purchased are nicer than I expected & very sure to size. I've purchased women's and girls!,5
13672,"I have been shopping for years with Thread Up now, many changes have happened and they are listening. A few great things, a few not so great. they used to have waist measurements on skirts, they don't anymore. I have not bought as many skirts as a result. Sizes mean nothing, measurements mean everything! Consistent and correct measurements are best. I have found many items on sale in stores much cheaper than on Thread Up, sometimes it is a matter of need more than anything!",5
13673,"I am addicted to this app/experience! I've always believed in the whole Reduce, Reuse, Recycle culture, but I admit to not always living it fully. I'm also a person who LOVES to window shop & browse. ThredUp fulfills both! My only ""complaint"", and it's small & probably petty: below the item you are looking at, you get ""you may also like"" suggestions, but most of the items are not within my chosen preferences, so I feel that the suggestions are borderline useless. But that's just me :)",5
13674,Sounds 2be a great app...but ive actually never opend up the app yet👍🤝💯🙏🤪☺😄,5
13675,Always a great shopping experience,5
13676,I spend a lot of money on thredup and the experience is pretty good so far. . Quite a few times their sizing is off in the women's Department. . I've received size large items that would only fit a 10 year old girl. And I've had to make many returns.,5
13677,Good,5
13678,Love the convenience of shopping good quality 2nd hand clothes at great prices for very very reasonable prices. Sure beats having to dig through racks and racks to find that deal,5
13679,Great app,5
13680,Wow! I am wearing such expensive and Chic clothes because of this app! This is everything! I wish they did men's clothes,5
13681,"Bought a Jacket that looked nice ,it was rated as like new.. Well after receiving the Jacket it had a really bad smell so I had it Dry cleaned and it still has a bad smell and not only that it looks bad .. I basically just threw money away..Never buy from thredUP!",1
13682,I enjoy this way of shopping thred up makes it easy.,5
13683,Honestly thrift stores are alot cheaper... I can go buy brand new kids clothes for the prices they sell on here. I wont be buying off this app.,2
13684,Love it,5
13685,Responsible shopping at it's best!,5
13686,"Love love the app. So easy to use, love tagging my favorites, easy to see front and back and searching is perfect. Love that my preferences are always saved. Just wish we could work on getting points towards free shipping!! Ive placed SO many orders!!",5
13687,Love the app,5
13688,Incredible!!,5
13689,BEST buying/selling app out there! Great concept! Win win for everyone!,5
13690,"I am on my 4th order over the last 6 months or so, and I'm satisfied. All products were delivered in a timely manner, no having to wait for sellers to ship items. The packaging is cute and items carefully packaged so no damage items as of to date. I haven't had to return anything yet so I can't speak for or give an opinion on that service.",5
13691,"Clothing comes clean, folded lovely, wrapped in beautiful tissue paper, and arrives in such a cute polka dotted box... I enjoy the purchasing and the products♡",5
13692,Loving thrifting on this site eikkkk,5
13693,Always quality items and service,5
13694,I have enjoyed this app. So far everything has been just as described.,5
13695,Love this shopping app. Has great quality used clothing and brand names.,5
13696,"Love it, shipping was fast and clothes like brand new!",5
13697,This is a great app and the prices are great also.,5
13698,I just enjoy shopping with thredup one of my favorite place to shop I do not even got to my 2nd hand stores in my town any more y should I I get alot more Variety shopping with thredup I'm so very excited that I found this company and yes I was a little scared to order but I'm so glad I did when my stuff comes I'm so excited and can't wait to open it up. Thank you so much thredup for making life so ez for us middle class people that don't have much in there pocket to afford clothes like thes,5
13699,Great selection and fun to browse.,5
13700,App will not download at all I was trying to sell clothes,1
13701,Always quality used clothes. Packaged beautiful..easy returns....love Thread Up!❤️,5
13702,Always good quality 👍,5
13703,Awesomeness!!,5
13704,"I liked them, but then I realized they are thieves when it comes to returns. And the only reason I got SOME money back is because I wrote to the company REMINDING THEM that they had not refunded my money. SAD!",1
13705,Super fun and easy to shop through this app!,5
13706,I buy almost all of my clothes from ThredUp. I am able to find unique outfits at very low prices and feel good about choosing used clothes rather than new ones. My purchases are always nicely wrapped and clean. ThredUp combines the effectiveness of shopping online with the adventure of thrifting.,5
13707,I'm hooked!,5
13708,Love love how easy this is,5
13709,"Buying from here is a much better experience than selling. It's hard to make ""fair"" money back on consignment items from my closet. Bummer.",3
13710,Just got my first order. Everything fit perfectly and I absolutely love it!!,5
13711,"Love my first dress, can't wait to see the rest. Perfect condition. Arrived quick. Will shop with them again.",5
13712,Excellent,5
13713,Great items at GREAT prices!!! The customer service is extremely understanding and helpful!!,5
13714,The picture of the purse was alot better than the product.. Im deleting..,1
13715,Just made my third purchase from this app! I am HOOKED!,5
13716,Amazing!!!! My 12 year old daughter needs jeans all the time. She plays hard. Getting 3 pair of name brand Jean's for under 40 dollars?!?! Wooo hooo!!!!!!!,5
13717,very useful,5
13718,Excellent! Love the 70's,5
13719,"PROS: Good quality, everything I've ordered has met or exceeded my expectations. Good variety of styles and sizes! CONS: Filtering features (when searching) don't always work. Takes too long to receive products.",4
13720,Love it.,5
13721,Simple shopping at your fingertips and affordable items for everyday use. So glad I found them. Keep the styles coming.,5
13722,To hight for used clothes,1
13723,Very convenient and love how i can send clothes i do not wear anymore and buy what is on trend for me.,5
13724,Awesome,5
13725,Love this app. Very easy to navigate.,5
13726,"Absolutely awesome ,love it",5
13727,Absolutely hooked!,5
13728,Clothes in good condition.,5
13729,Excellent experience,5
13730,Alot to choose from I just wanted it all.,5
13731,Ok,5
13732,Stuff is priced expensive to be second hand,1
13733,Shopped for toddler girl which had a huge variety of such adorable clothes,5
13734,"I literally went to login and it kept popping up for me to log in with Amazon. I never logged in that way,always used Google. It refused to let me log in any other way and then kept saying it couldn't log me in. I'll just stick to the website because that was extremely annoying.",3
13735,Only for women......,2
13736,Great deals!,5
13737,"Great deals, good feels-- I really appreciate the ability to refresh my closet without the guilt of ravaging the environment or breaking the bank.",4
13738,"I am extremely satisfied with my first order! I splurged a clothing shopping spree on myself and for my first order everything was around 2 to 7 dollars a piece. I was unsure on my sizes but I'm in the weird in between sizes phase where I've gained a little weight but still want to lose a few pounds, so I'm in between M and L and coding sizes was so hard as I can't try them on before buying...luckily everything I selected fit me with perfection!! Also happy with the variety of items I chose.",4
13739,"Love this app, there r so many options!!",5
13740,Dint like clothing presentation,1
13741,"Can't finish my order,want to check out",5
13742,I love it!,5
13743,"Excellent App! Easy to navigate & find what you like, saving favorites to look at later.",5
13744,Awesome,5
13745,This is for women and children only. No men's clothing. It's in the same of your app but not in your advertising that led me here. Wouldn't have this if you didn't use bait and switch in advertising.,1
13746,Item arrived as expected. Well packed and in excellent condition. Will purchase again.,5
13747,"An online thrift store but better! Continuing to shop as they keep getting more items to buy. I've kept almost all, but those that didn't fit well were easy to return with their prepaid shipping label where the fee is subtracted from your refund - super simple! My closet is filling as I lose more weight - 80+ so far!",5
13748,I will never buy new clothes again,5
13749,"Buying shirts is a breeze but pants are another matter. I bought two size 8 work pants, on fits but the other was something only a child could fit. As soon as I took it out of the package I laughed knowing that what I was looking at was definitely not a size 8 in women's. It took me awhile to get up the courage to buy pants from this site because I was so weary of the fit issue, turns out I was correct in my assumptions. Will still be using this site for tops though.",3
13750,Excellent selections at fair prices.,5
13751,"As a new member to thredUp, i chose 2 pair of booties and 1 pair of shoes as my first time order. Was excited to use the first time user code of NEW (50% off) until it didnt work. Said my order does not qualify. Too bad. I could have spent ALOT of money on this site. Now I'm concerned now that they have all my billing info, it will be misused. Uninstalling....",1
13752,"Good, but addicting.",5
13753,"Love threadup! I've found so many good deals for myself and my daughter! I love the fact that there's such a wide array of items to choose from, different from what all the local stores are carrying, and good prices. I also really like how if something doesn't fit I can return it for store credit and only have to pay $ 1.99 reshelving fee, much better than other online shopping return policies!!",5
13754,Love the app! Can't stop shopping.,5
13755,Prices to high,1
13756,Love it,4
13757,Great experience had exactly what I wanted,5
13758,"Meh.... Looks like a garage sale with not-so-great clothes that have seen their better day. I present my clothes better when I sell them on eBay than what I'm seeing in this app. And quite frankly, I see better deals at Macy's for brand new clothes that are on sale than what's listed on this site. Uninstalled immediately, definitely not for me.",2
13759,"Love this! Everything I have ordered so far has fit perfectly! I only had one problem with a top I ordered. It fit perfectly but was shorter than I expected, which is something I couldn't tell from the pics. Other than that this has been great!!",5
13760,Love selection and price. Easy to use,5
13761,"Love, love, love it",5
13762,"Awesome app, love it",5
13763,Everything I've ordered is in excellent condition. My orders arrived quickly. I was a bit hesitant about buying second hand sight unseen however the descriptions have been completely accurate. I am able to stretch my clothing budget. Will continue to purchase items as needed and when they become available.,5
13764,Allows to set up size preferences and shop by designer options. Fairly easy to navigate.,5
13765,"I got the cutest dress from this shop and it was a very easy app to follow. Some of the prices I think are kinda high for used clothes, but they do have a wide selection.",4
13766,It's pretty great looking through clothes without having to scan racks in a store. Find exactly what you want,5
13767,This app is a great way to find a lot of really cool and comfortable items for great prices! It's so much easier to find what I'm looking for on this app than trying to go to a thrift store. The saved search function has helped me a lot since it notifies me whenever an item matching a search I save becomes available. And it also notifies me when any of the items I favorited have dropped in price. Great app to have for any shopper!,5
13768,Great app for people who love thrift shops. Easy to navigate site.,5
13769,Love it! The quality you get for the price has never been a disappointment.,5
13770,Everything I have received from my stylest and the things I have ordered have been great I love this app I even let go of stich fix because thay couldn't get me and on the other hand thredup got me on my first order I love love love you all thank you from a very satisfied customer. Rhonda,5
13771,Easy and painlessly,5
13772,Love it!,5
13773,Excellent user interface. A bit more product description & more visibility of the products (360 view?) would improve the already highly enjoyable experience. I like how the main feed is targeted to the customer's size. I just made my first purchase & I am very excited! Thumbs up!!,4
13774,Exceptional! Save the planet and buy second hand!,5
13775,"Fun, easy to use!!!!",4
13776,Just received my first goody box and i must say i love every piece. I have tried the more expensive companies and almost always sent everything back. Seems the stylists pay a bit more attention to the styles you like.,5
13777,Easy to shop!!,4
13778,Searched & searched. Never found anything.,1
13779,"Really easy to shop, and save favorites.",5
13780,"So far I love this app. Amazing finds, reasonable prices, super satisfied. Absolutely recommend.",5
13781,Great deals and unique clothing if you take the time to shop for brands you know.,5
13782,"They have everything u could ever want , in every color, shape n size, n it could not b easier . The deliveries arrive in a timely fashion n the clothes r in perfect shape. I love shopping with ThreadUP !!!",5
13783,"I think it's a good idea, but the app itself isn't user friendly unless you are searching by brand. You can't even search for a long sleeve pocket tee.",2
13784,great prices,5
13785,"Great service, all the clothes I have gotten have been of great quality. Returns are painless. Lots of good deals can be found. I give four stars rather than 5 for the app because browsing on a computer is much easier.",4
13786,I have gotten sooo many good deals!,5
13787,"Love my new dress, so affordable, so awesome, love thredup!!!",5
13788,"Best shopping experience in years. If youre stationed overseas in the military, just contact customer service and they will change your location to your APO zipcode so you can make purchases!",5
13789,Easy and fun,5
13790,I can't get it,5
13791,LOVE THIS APP!! AMAZING DEALS!! GREAT ITEMS!!,5
13792,Love this app!!!,5
13793,"I ordered plus size and got 2x from normal size clothing not plus size clothing so the clothes that I ordered did not fit. Very misleading. I was very disappointed, will not recommend, and will not use again!",1
13794,I do not care for your adding items to my cart that I did not put there. I am not sure if I will be able to.continue shopping on your site,2
13795,Excellent merch....broad assortment...excellent prices.,5
13796,Very slow delivery,3
13797,"Not a good app at all!! I was very disappointed. I sent 4 boxes of name brand clothing, purses, etc. I heard nothing. I got notifications of a couple buys, there were several transactions saying sent to me????? I never received a word. They are not good at informing you exactly how they work . So I basically just gave away 4 boxes of clothing, that I needed to replace with some new clothes. That's not happening!!!! I'm uninstalling this app ASAP",1
13798,Love it!,4
13799,"Cool idea, but WAY to pricey. You could go buy something new for the same price if not cheaper on most stuff.",2
13800,For a thrift store app they are ridiculously expensive. You would be better off going to a real thrift store or second hand store.,1
13801,Love it,5
13802,My whole cart and favorites have disappeared 😭 wtw!!!,1
13803,Still love thred up.,5
13804,Really like the wide variety of brands. Also great prices and quality. Relatively easy to use.,4
13805,Nice concept!,5
13806,The delivery date changed 3 times for two items I ordered and arrived too late for when needed. Customer service is slow in responding and the website is difficult to maneuver. This was my first and last experience with ThredUp.,2
13807,"I do enjoy this site, but it's annoying when they show you something in an email and it doesn't show up when you click on it.",4
13808,Easy,5
13809,"Continuing to find wonderful buys. Everything I ordered on my 1st try has arrived, and all are as described and delightful.",5
13810,"Please bring to me, as I cannot walk. I need, please, stretch slacks, 3X, quarter sleeves scrub tops 3-4X. Debary Health and Rehabilitation Center. Marcia Drewry, #409A. THANK YOU.",5
13811,I'm having so much fun shopping. I love the app!,5
13812,I've learned how things fit on the mannequins to know what will fit me. It's great buying brand name clothes at much lower prices then department stores.,5
13813,Easy to find what you are looking for,5
13814,I love that I'm spending less money ♡ and that I'm not wasting time clothes shopping. I would definitely rather try things on at home than in a store. I would have spent hours shopping and trying things on. I was able to accomplish this purchase in minutes not hours . So convenient having it shipped right to my door. I love this service it's cost effective and I never feel guilty shopping on this site $$,5
13815,"App no longer works. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. No answers, even when I reached out.",1
13816,I love the reuse concept,5
13817,cute dresses and winter hats,5
13818,I have ordered everything but clothes. I am a purses person. The Jimmy Choo and Kate Spade bags where in really good condition.,5
13819,Affordable and great way to buy amazing clothes. I just love this site.,5
13820,good app but need more pictures,4
13821,Very quick and helpful customer service!,5
13822,"As I was looking through these clothes, I noticed that a lot of them have in store prices. A second hand store is just that. No need to pay new prices for previously worn clothes.",2
13823,This site is a pure rip off they give you pennies for your clothing then when it comes time to cash out u have to go through a Merry go round and you still dont get your cash and when you return an item they NEVER credit you the funds and customer service is the worst as they never respond back. Save yourself a headache and dont install this site....,1
13824,Easy to use.,5
13825,"In a previous review I gave this app 3 stars because it was difficult to sort for tall sizes. I now see specialty size options at the bottom of the women's clothing main page that easily allows shoppers to sort tall, petite, maternity, plus, and juniors. I dont know if this is new or if i just didnt see it before. I'm upgrading my review to a 5. Thank you ThredUp!",5
13826,Awesome,5
13827,This a great place to find deals for purchase. But they off very little back when you decide to sell.,2
13828,Love it,5
13829,The app won't even open. Just sits on the white title page.,1
13830,Easy to navigate.,5
13831,Awesome deals,5
13832,Was real easy to find what I wanted plus everything a way below the og price,5
13833,Great way to shop! I love the filters and favorites options.,5
13834,Love this app. So many wonderful items at great prices.,5
13835,"Great selection on gently used name brand clothing. All style, sizes, seasons. Brand name clothing at discount prices.",5
13836,Great place to get amazing deals.,5
13837,"Watch out, it's addictive!",5
13838,Prices can be better but good app.,3
13839,I enjoy the website very much. I am hooked One thing though. I don't know if it is me or the website. When you sort for a specific item you do get the requested item. However you can not then filter from low to high on your specific sort. Thank you Vickie K Wells,4
13840,It has stopped working. It closes as soon as it opens. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled. Not working.,1
13841,"Love ThredUp in general and the website is great. The app is ok, but filtering is a little clunky and it's difficult to find subcategories once you're in a category (example: hard to find only sneakers listed under shoes--easy to do on the website though). I still use this app all the time though bc I love ThredUp so much!",3
13842,Love love love this app,5
13843,I found my Fix! I love shopping here!,5
13844,My favorite place to shop and sell!,5
13845,"My first stop for ""new"" clothes. I never buy from the store anymore!",5
13846,Worst place to sell clothes. All my clothes (2 bags) taken from me when it stated that the assurance automatically comes with my shipment. Then offered me 3.60 for 5 name branded items. Thredup has good quality used clothes but to sell to them is a complete rip off. They make more profit than the customers giving them the clothes,1
13847,I love Thredup!,4
13848,ThredUp is a great app. Great clothes for a great deal.,5
13849,Excellent,5
13850,"Lots of good quality products, easy purchasing experience, well organized, and fast delivery. Love Thred-Up!",5
13851,It has minor search glitches and unrelated catagory annoyances that are the employees' fault not the app's.,4
13852,Easy to use with helpful filters to search their incredible selection of stuff.,5
13853,Always very pleased. Easy and items good quality.,5
13854,"Easy to use, great clothes. Eco friendly",4
13855,Easy to shop! Quality clothing and lots of options for any budget.,5
13856,Really? No mens stuff?,2
13857,I always find great clothing in excellent condition and at great prices. I love Thredup.,5
13858,Awesome,5
13859,"Love this app, always ""upping"" my threads.",5
13860,Unfortunately never worked for me,1
13861,The Best Way to Shop,5
13862,"HORRIBLE! DEFINITELY deceiving,i Totally thought i was going to find nice clothes , at an affordable price ,for people on a budget , BS, AND , its DEFINITELY NOT user friendly ,i couldnt navigate around worth a Sht, aaaaand set my filters...This app SUCKS!!!!!😠",1
13863,Couldn't find any mens clothes,1
13864,Love,5
13865,"I have not been able to successfully open this app for two days now. Never had an issue before. Just now, I decided to uninstall and reinstall to see if that helped but it still won't open. It just sits on the white title page.",1
13866,Love the app - it's so easy to use. I already loved ThredUp. I haven't enjoyed clothes shopping in years and now I can't stop. The quality of the clothes is excellent. The prices are amazing!,5
13867,"Thredup would be an amazing site to shop from if the women of today would wear panties under their pants, that's disgusting and it makes me not want to buy used pants or shorts anymore.",1
13868,"There is SO much to choose from on thredUP! I got the CUTEST boots, a nice shirt, and a truly beautiful skirt for like $40. All of it arrived when it said it would and there were no problems... The only problem I can think of is that I have a hard time figuring out which outfit to buy next :/",5
13869,I absolutely live thredUP! This app is great.,5
13870,"I resale as my side job, and I constantly have enormous amounts of items that I won't have time to sell or aren't in my style selection. I used to just toss them in donation... however, as a mom of two...having the option to send clothes some where that someone ELSE will do the hard work AND they will donate the items they didn't want for me is a win win! I love popping into the app and seeing another item of mine sold.",5
13871,Really nice clothing at really great prices.,5
13872,Excellent shipping app! Love it!,5
13873,So easy to find great deals on quality items to fit your aesthetic,5
13874,Great clothing,4
13875,No mens wear,1
13876,"Seems like a great deal, but if clothes don't fit or you don't like how it fits, you pay $2 ""restock"" and then no matter how you choose to return the items you pay around $9. So, the $20 steal turns into a flop. You decide to keep something you won't wear just because it practically costs you more to return it. It's too much of a risk. Just go to a thrift store.",2
13877,"I've found lots of cute tops on here! When I average the total price with how many items, my price is around $5 per top 🤯👍😃",5
13878,i love this app but the only problem is that when i tap on a notification that an item i favorited had been reduced in price it never takes me directly to that item. instead it takes me straight to the app and i have to try to find the item i was notified about on my own,5
13879,Great deals!,5
13880,No customer service. And 5days going on 6. With moore than 50 trys to cash out. Every one need to beware. No customer help. And there is not a real person that can call you. Very very sad. All most 700 bucks out there. Not sure if ill ever get my money,1
13881,Great design on app,5
13882,So far I've had a wonderful experience the customer service is very prompt!,5
13883,Love it,5
13884,"Very easy to use and change my preferences as much as I like. I also like I can choose 👎👍 for randomly selected styles on their app everyday. I can set my own budget but have found that if I receive something that I absolutely love but it's out of budget, I can apply my already debited $20 processing fee to my total! I have kept at least 1-2 items one every box!",4
13885,Fun and easy to shop,5
13886,Addictive,5
13887,Amazing!! Love it!! Definitely can't wait for the goody boxes!! 😍😍,5
13888,"The app works great, I've never had a problem with it on my Android.",5
13889,I have nothing but good things to say about ThredUp. Ill be using them ALOT.,5
13890,Wonderful time shopping...,5
13891,It's all good ! Good prices. Good selection. Good value. It's all GOOD!,5
13892,"TO EACH ITS OWN! I think is crazy that these people are selling used clothe for these prices. It does not matter if it cost $1,000 , ITS used. At those prices I can buy beautiful brand new clothes and shoes and still have money to spare. It was a waste of time to even download the app. Good luck with that🤣✌️rip off. Just my opinion.",1
13893,Used to love it. Then they took back 35 dollars I had earned selling. I contacted them. No reply. Now they won't even supply bag,1
13894,Pretty good. The thing I like the most about it is the fact that when you put an item in your cart that it holds it for a certain amount of time so you don't have to scramble to buy it right away.,4
13895,I've had great experience with this app and made wonderful purchase,5
13896,"Wish the bags i send in were a bit more organized so i can tell exactly what thredup is buying directly; if it applies. Whats on consignment id like to see what u r value on each piece is; before its listed for sale. I wish the customer service or an allgerythmn was created to allow us to see this info to make sure we know how much we are making, along with how much you are making. And to have some way for u all to recognize mulitiple purchases spanning over 5-7 days. Would have saved 20 bucs.",5
13897,moment and,5
13898,"Not sure how this app got such high ratings when they are only mostly bad reviews. One dev response actually says ""you won't make much money with us.... but we save you time"" ---- THAT IS the point of SELLING clothes right - To make more than the 24¢ and 2$ that people report they got for an entire bag of clothing? Because if I want to save time, Purple Heart, Goodwill, etc pick up my donations at my door, without insulting you by keeping 9/10 of what they make off your items. #SHIFT+DEL lol",1
13899,I love this concept and the app. My only but of feedback is that it would be fantastic to have a filter for pockets. Leggings with pockets and dresses with pockets are very important. Thanks!,4
13900,Excellent,4
13901,Such a great app for a great company. I've been a loyal user for more than one year. I love how easy it is to search and find thousands of top-notch options at amazing prices.,5
13902,Fun and easy!,5
13903,"Love Thred Up! The app makes using Thred Up, super simple!",5
13904,Have stuff to sell,2
13905,"Easy, user friendly, no hidden fees or texts or spam emails, cheap clothes, great customer service... What more could you want?",5
13906,Great thnku,4
13907,Easy to use. Great search tools. Great quality.,5
13908,Wonderful,4
13909,I love this app,5
13910,This has been a nightmare. Been trying since March 2019 to find out what happened to items I sent. Nothing returned as I asked or no money ever seen. Cant get any help. Only chat sites and young around in circles. Martha Winn,1
13911,On what I see.,4
13912,"My order arrived in 4 shipments, all on the same day. Every item looked brand new. Shopping was easy and fun. Shipping was quick and trackable. I am very impressed. I will be using thredUp as my go to store!",5
13913,"Truly enjoy this app as well as sending thredup my newish but used clothes. Pretty nice getting credit for the items that sell. Just went to my ""favorites"" and used my credits. Browsing is always fun. So far, I've not been disappointed with my purchases.",5
13914,Orders on time or early and true to size.,5
13915,Easy to use & quality products,5
13916,"I love the clothes, and the accesories.The description of the items are clear & accurate",5
13917,"Love love love. Purchased so many name brand items on the cheap that were like new. Feels good to not ""buy new"" and instead use what's been made. Quick shipping, excellent descriptions, awesome filter options.",5
13918,Fantasic. Safe me a trip to recycle store.,5
13919,I'm in love with this app!!! I'm so happy I decided to try it out. The prices are great and I can't believe how fast my orders were delievered:),5
13920,Sometimes the app works and sometimes it doesn't,2
13921,"Sometimes great sometimes not. I've had dirty and incorrect items sent, but also discovered new favorites. The restock fee is over the top considering we pay shipping. But it's a good concept for resale and reducing your footprint. I hope it continues to improve.",3
13922,"App is a good idea but, search filter do not work! You have to search through lots of wrong sizes before getting your size.",2
13923,Clothes are wrinkled and ugly.,1
13924,Love clothes shopping while sitting on my couch!,4
13925,I have loved the items!,5
13926,Want to join! Sounds great for me.,5
13927,Seamless with great items and great bargains,5
13928,Very good clothes and you recieved them fast.,5
13929,East to use.,5
13930,I love it ! I'm addicted !,5
13931,"I have purchased off of ThreadUP using the app a few times. The app is nice! It is organized well, and it's easy to use. I love being able to browse on it easily.",5
13932,LOVEEEEE THIS APP! SO EASY TO USE!,5
13933,Great!,5
13934,I absolutely LOVE shopping on this site. I have always loved thrifting and I love doing it online just as much as I do in person.,5
13935,Love it,5
13936,The clothes were perfect,5
13937,Easy to use,5
13938,Meh,3
13939,"Love it! I have been a thrift store shopper for years, but this is sooo much easier!",5
13940,Love,5
13941,Best biz product service - fabuloso!,5
13942,Great clothes at a great price!! Know exactly what you're getting instead of spending hours in a second hand store. Some clothes even new!!,5
13943,I am happy so far it has been an enjoyable shopping experience,5
13944,Paid for faster shipment ...don't....took to long for 1 item...,1
13945,"I have bought many times and I love it! Haven't had to return anything just yet because I follow the measurements posted. Shipping is about a week, but doesn't bother me. Searching is easy and everything is so unique! I've been a huge thrifty shopper for a long time and it takes a lot of patience. But now! I love that I can shop on my spare time. Lol Prices are pretty awesome, but that depends on the brands and promocodes are great! Shoes sales have not let me down in terms of wear either! ♥️",5
13946,"Poor design... for example. I get notifications that pop up on my phone showing new items in the category I marked to watch. When I click on that notice, because the item looks nice, it NEVER brings me to that specific item. It beings me to a list of items and the one I wanted to see is buried in there. I often don't find it. This app is NOT as easy to use as eBay, Poshmark or Mercari, which are all much better and easier to use overall. It's disappointing!",1
13947,I have fun shopping. Stay home and shop.,5
13948,"Fun! I have gotten several fabulous pieces, and I've sold some too!",5
13949,Easy to use and browse!,5
13950,I love thredUP. I've used it on several occasions and they have always been accurate at describing the condition of the clothing. Well priced too! Plus their polka dot bags are super cute!,5
13951,Excellent! So easy to find what your looking for 👌,5
13952,"My experience has been great so far even the I did recieve two items, which was stated they where like new but shown some staining and discoloration. One item I was able to remove staining but the other there was nothing that can be done. Overall satisfied",4
13953,Crashes constantly,1
13954,"I love it so far, I have no complaints. The clothes that I have gotten we're as described or better",5
13955,An excellent store to shope for name brand clothes.,5
13956,I truly loved the few items I saw in my box. I am on a tight budget since my husband needs surgery and will be out of work. I will let you know when I can order and possibly keep most of hhe items I receive. So keep up the good work in selecting the best of the best items for me. Thank you,5
13957,"Great store, great app!",5
13958,Easy to use,5
13959,"I love this environmentally friendly, cheaper option for stylish clothes!",5
13960,I love the low prices for name brands. I have gotten some really good deals. Just one thing I would suggest. A way to categorize or group your likes. It would make it easier to find what you are looking for instead of scrolling all the way through. And if your likes are sold then they should be deleted from your likes. Even if they are in the unavailable section. Thank you,4
13961,Awesome,5
13962,Easy and fun!,5
13963,"The best way to shop, easy, fun and quick. Customer Service is outstanding!",5
13964,They paid you basically 5-10% for the items you bring in ... SUCKS !!!,1
13965,Always so easy to use.,5
13966,"I've only used it to buy maternity clothes so far but everything has been is great condition and for very reasonable prices. I have since bought shoes, dresses and shirts and am very happy with everything!",5
13967,💲,5
13968,Inspirational and fantastic,5
13969,"I love this app but I recently got my first order and one of my items did not come in the condition stated. The app told me it was in excellent condition and that you might mistake it for new. However when I received this item, it had pulls in the fabric, multiple threads, and most definitely looked worn. Thankfully my other items in the package were perfectly fine. I have mixed feelings about this app and just wanted to be honest.",3
13970,"My only complain would be how the shipping address is handled. It'd be easier if there were a way to select my exact location within some sort of map, since I really don't understand how the app wants my address to be presented.",4
13971,"It's basically theft, they return such a small amount of the sale to you. I would not recommend this, you'll probably get more money back on your taxes by donating your stuff.",1
13972,Ordered 3 times. Love every item. All arrived in short order and quickly.,5
13973,Very good,5
13974,"If you send your items in, they charge you $11 to have your items they don't want returned to you. If they list your item and it does not sell- they charge you AGAIN to claim it back once it has expired from their shop.. They also pay little to nothing for items and turn around and sell them for much higher- for example, I sent them a Michael kors watch, still in the box, they gave me $23 for it and turned around and sold it for $225.00. I should have just sold everything myself online.",1
13975,"Everything I ordered came in looking brand new. I ordered a Michael Kors tote, came in excellent condition and five pairs of name brand jeans for my 9 year old. The jeans were between $2 and $4 a pair and also looked brand new. Very pleased.",5
13976,Odd,1
13977,Love shopping and selling on Thredup!,5
13978,Good,4
13979,"My new favorite and not expensive hobby. Great clothes, amazing prices, and it's helping the planet. I can also sell things I don't wear anymore. Love this!",5
13980,"Everything that I've purchased so far (almost a year of purchases) I've got exactly what I saw in the picture! I couldn't be happier with trying Thredup! I hate going to department stores! I can now comfortably shop in the comfort of my own home and know I'm going to get exactly the right thing, What an amazing experience!",5
13981,Only thing wrong was that my order that my size was for a skinny person not a plus size lol. Size 26 it said and it was on in the plus size area SMH and now I can't return it but love the sandles I got from there....,5
13982,Ex cellant quality and packaging of items purchased.,5
13983,love this,5
13984,Love the merchandise!,5
13985,Love it!!,5
13986,"Love getting exactly what I ordered, and the great, wrapped, green box. Always easy returns, also.",5
13987,Mostly good but you need to look at the stuff closely because the stuff that says final sale means no return. Im stuck with a 50 dollar cheap knock off purse that probably cost 5 dollars to make.,4
13988,Awesome,5
13989,Cannot use the search,1
13990,I didnt really find the appeal of shopping for wrinkled clothing. Update from response: My review is not altered. I feel if you are going to take the time to take pictures and display the clothing you need to at least make them presentable. If you guys dont even take pride in your business or how you represent yourselves then that does not give me much faith in purchasing through you. You do not have strict quality standards if you can't properly display the clothing to begin with.,1
13991,I just order this Katie Spade purse been looking for finely find one yeah so happy,5
13992,"It'll cost you $17 plus shipping if you want to return a garment. Non-returnable shipping cost of $5.99 plus $1.99 restocking fee plus $8.99 'processing fee', in addition to cost of sending the garment back. What?! That's waaaay too many extra fees. Uninstalling.",1
13993,This is my new favorite way to shop. I love that there are so many brands in the same location. It is great to have so much variety so that I never have the same outfit as someone else. All items I have purchased have been clean and in excellent condition. Take the time to measure yourself and pay attention to the actual measurements and not the size the brand claims. You will have better luck. Women's sizes are definitely not standardized.,5
13994,"Awesome! I love this app, and have found some great quality name brand clothes for a fraction of the price, and I like that I can return items as well as get rid of unwanted clothes using their clean out bags.",5
13995,Items delivered are exactly as expected. I like the option to search for new with tags items.,5
13996,I love thredUP!! Fashionable clothes and shoes at great prices!!,5
13997,"I wanted to give 5 stars because the app is laid out beautifully, nothing distracting, very professional and pleasant to use. However, I would improve a few things: being able to search for an item by the name of what it is rather than just its brand name (if you can, I haven't figured it out yet), also... categories and such are confusing...if I want to buy a hat, I have found them under 'jewelry'. There is no category for baby onesies....? You just scroll through All the baby clothes. Thx!!",4
13998,Nice to find items I can afford,5
13999,"ThredUp is my favorite clothes shopping app. It is also the sustainable way to buy clothes. Everything marked ""like new"" has really been like new. I also used the personal shop service and 75% of the pieces have become my fave go to outfits.",5
14000,There are a few glitches when trying to search for specific items but over all great app.,4
14001,They suck they didn't give me ally credit for my cloths I emailed the plus they didn't even have all my cloths I sent for sale a two items where the same and they sold one pair but didn't is show the other and then want me to pay to get the clothes back,1
14002,"For the most part, this is a very convenient service. I have sent in bags of used clothing and have been satisfied with the appraisal of the clothing. However, more recently, it appears that several of my items for resale that I know were of the highest quality because I had not worn them since my husband's death, do not appear to be listed for resale. I'm not sure of the processing procedure, but not all of my quality items were listed for resale. Questions of honest business dealings remain.",3
14003,Cute app''-!###😘🎇🆒🎁🎁,5
14004,"If you don't have high end, expensive, trending brands then you will get next to no cash back, plus they charge a cash out. Just donate your clothes if they aren't prefect high end, or try Poshmark. Poshmark is more effort on your end but you can make a lot more money.",2
14005,Love finding the perfect purse <3 and im not a purse person ;),5
14006,🖤💙💜💚💛❤,5
14007,"I found exactly one blouse that maybe I would purchase at a garage sale. I shopped pages and pages of items and I must say that the styles were very bland, I found nothing interesting at all.",1
14008,I love thredup! It's the only place I will buy clothes from. Also selling my old clothes is so easy and I get a fair price for stuff I don't wear anymore.,5
14009,"Most of clothes for sale are extremely dated, and if you try to sell more up to date items they do not get accepted, they sell them to third party sellers and you do not get any compensation for your clothing. I have found a few great blazers and jeans on there, but I have found a lot more poor quality/outdated items that is then a nightmare to return as you only get in-store credit. It makes me scared to buy things because I have I feel no matter what I do buy/sell I feel I am just losing money",2
14010,Good- the app has issues using promo codes and that's very annoying!!,5
14011,"I love the site, the idea of sustainable clothing however cant give you 5 starts as the app isnt giving me either my new account discount OR my free shipping for over $79!!! What up thredup? Help!",3
14012,My wardrobe has been upgraded on a budget with this app. I now own much better quality clothing.,4
14013,Great functionality but it's super hard to see any detail in very light or dark items,4
14014,Good,4
14015,Instant addiction! Great app 👍,5
14016,"Love it! ThreadUP makes shopping used easy! It takes a lot of time to find good stuff at my local thrift store, but with this app I don't even have to leave my house. My only complaint is that it can be hard to search for a type of clothing instead of by brand sometimes. The search tab will autocorrect to whatever brand name is closest most of the time. Ex. I can't search just for a shawl because it always autocorrects to the brand 'Shawlsmith'.",4
14017,No men's anything!,1
14018,It alright,4
14019,Use only to shop or you will lose money!!!!,1
14020,Love it,5
14021,Awesomeness,5
14022,"On two different occasions I have sent very expensive items to be sold and I never saw them again. They were never listed in with my items to be sold. I never received any communication about these items. When this company first started , all was well. I felt that the compensation for my items were fair. Within the last year and a half I have sent probably 200 lbs of clothing to this company. Something has changed with this company & I will never use them again, nor will I recommend them.",1
14023,Love this app!! Great clothes for so cheap! I can finally afford to buy my kids quality clothes without spending a fortune!,5
14024,I love the app and the shopping! Reuse! You will find amazing deals and the quality is always great!,5
14025,I saw site advertised on tv. I luv vintage clothes. And who doesnt want a great deal. Also got several dresses for Trinity my 5 yr old grandaughter.,5
14026,Wonderful shopping adventure.,5
14027,Love browsing for deals and cute items!!,5
14028,"I order from here all the time, easy returns, clothing as described. Will continue to use for the foreseeable future!",5
14029,"This is a wonderful concept, in theory. Unfortunately, people who thrift shop usually tend to be looking for cheap, legitimate vintage items that are lightly used. They're not trying to look like everyone else in Banana Republic and Loft attire. Everything that's on this app can be found at an America's Thrift for a fraction of the cost. Also, the sizing is all wrong. Every dress I ordered said 30"" waist and 36"" bust. They're all too big on me. Save your money and have some fun at a thrift store",2
14030,I love *u .. *u are fitted 4 this Queen*Carla😇💕😇,5
14031,A really great way to shop with Affirm payments making everything so affordable.,5
14032,So easy to be sustainable and great prices!,5
14033,"Originally I gave this 5 stars. I love the products, everything arrives exactly like its described. But the shipping is WACK. That's the only word I know to use. Takes about 10 days to receive an item after its shipped. I can ship things in the mail halfway across the country and they arrive faster than that.",3
14034,I keep coming back. Quality products. Great customer service. A great place to find unusual pieces.,5
14035,HAve lot of fun,5
14036,I love it! Everything I have ordered is exactly what is described!,5
14037,Customer Service is GOAT. Very happy :),5
14038,"Nice and easy way to change up my closet from my no-longer-needed/wanted with something new and/or different. A fun way to get ""happy"" mail.",5
14039,I always find wat im looking for,5
14040,Love this app!!!,5
14041,I LOVE this app. I praise it whenever I can. You can search your fav brands and get them for GREAT prices.,5
14042,Love the easy to use app. Great job!,5
14043,"This is the worst online seller of all. Dont buy anything because they make you pay to return everything and they shipped me $600 of items I did not order. They drained my bank account of all my money and their solution is for me to go to my bank. My bank did not steal my money, they did. Read every single word for the whole program so you know how they scam you.",1
14044,"I have to say, the app, the search features, and the shipping have all improved dramatically over the last few months. Thank you for your hard work on this! I've been very impressed with the quality of all the clothes I've purchased. When they say ""This item could be mistaken for brand new"" they mean it! Thank you for a gorgeous new spring wardrobe at a fraction of the retail price... and I feel good about where my money is going!",4
14045,Sent in a never before carried Patricia Nash purse. Wanted it back if it did not sell. Did not want it to sell for under 200.00. Have yet to get it back or get a straight answer back about it.,1
14046,"Filled a bag with brand new dress shoes dress shirts and much more, tags and all. And I got nothing in return. Not a penny. Any chance I get to trash this app I will take it. The people at ThredUP are theives!",1
14047,This app is easy as can be to use! I have ordered over a dozen things from them and have never had an issue with a single item! Accurate descriptions and thoughtful packaging make this app my #1 pick for online thrift shopping! Will remain a faithful customer in the future! 😊,5
14048,Love this site!,5
14049,They could have a better return policy. The window for returning is too narrow. The app makes it easy to shop though.,3
14050,Best app ever!!!,5
14051,Love this app. Totally addicting. It's nice to find clothes for myself and kids without going anywhere! Plus a great place to donate to!,5
14052,"I'm obsessed with this site! This is how I felt using facebook 15 years ago. I love the 30 outfits I've gotten for work since Thanksgiving for under $250. Everything was in great like- new shape & no smell Couple of things I think could be improved though. I would like to be able to exclude sizes (XL does not mean 32"" chest measurement in my world lol) or inseam detail in a saved search, and indication whether pants have side, front or no zip. That is difficult to tell on dark clothing. THANKS!",4
14053,Awesome,5
14054,"I love buying quality, name brand second hand clothes from thredUP. The app is convenient and the prices can't be beat.",5
14055,"Easy to navigate, search and checkout.",5
14056,"love this app, I buy brand new name brand clothing with tags still on at a fraction of the cost and in turn send them my name brand clothes, shoes and jewelry that I don't use anymore for either cash or credit towards new stuff. I love it! Take a look, they will give you $10 to start out and have adorable children's clothes too. Be sure to use their filters to weed out what you're not interested in! I've purchased thousands worth of clothing for a couple of hundred dollars ....",5
14057,"Makes buying used fun and easy! I have purchased several boxes and never been disappointed with either quality or cleanliness of the garments, shoes, or handbags. Love the bundling feature as well to further reduce shipping waste. If you're looking to reduce your carbon footprint while staying stylish, look no further!",5
14058,Love love love,5
14059,Easy consignment shopping. Ability to set alert for new items under specific searches. Extensive filters. Easy access to order information.,5
14060,Great. But sometimes freezes.,4
14061,"I am giving this app a one star just so I can comment. The app says I already have an account (which I don't think I do) however, my password is wrong (since I don't remember signing up I obviously don't remember my password. The app won't allow me to get a new password, I have tried everything. I'm not happy!",1
14062,"I really really like thred up because you get great deals on name brand clothes, however, they take FOREVER to ship. It gets really frustrating when the delivery date constantly changes...so just keep that in mind when you order it takes a bit to get your orders.",5
14063,Love this app cant wait to see the new clothing I purchased! Easy to use and cute stuff!,4
14064,Very cool! Thank you!,5
14065,Pretty good but a little glitchy!,3
14066,Rated four stars because everything was good and prices weren't dad but. Did not have my style or things I liked,4
14067,I've bought a few things with the app and every item was in very good condition. I would like more pictures of some of the items besides just images from the front and back.,5
14068,Easy app to navigate through,5
14069,Just received my shoes rescue box. I am do happy. Thank you so much . You made my day. I cant to order my next one.,5
14070,"I love ThredUp. The App is extremely easy to use and to view the beautiful clothing. I love the ""favorites"" feature as you can mark them for the future. Enjoy! I know I do!",5
14071,I love getting stylish clothes and accessories at it's than half the price. The best part is that is delivered right to me.,5
14072,"Clothing is often compromised (ie: misrepresented size info; loose/missing buttons, zippers,belts, etc.) > ""Customer Service"" is an abysmal joke & purchase returns are not processed or refunded.",1
14073,Great!,5
14074,Great looking clothes,3
14075,Generally good. Response a little slow.,4
14076,"Easy shopping, perfect fit, VERY reasonable prices! I'm loving it!!😊",5
14077,"I loved this app, my last purchase however was very disappointing . I feel the descriptions of items were misleading. Faux leather should look and feel like pleather, not shiny denim or just on the front. And returning w/stocking fee, deleting this app.🤔",2
14078,Tricky,2
14079,"I love thred up! The processing & Shipping is really fast depending on the state the clothes are coming from.Lets put it this way..i had placed an order, got 1 of 4 items in 3 days & fell in love with the store.Next thing u know it was 2 days later & i spent more $ be4 the rest even came & plan to spend more soon. Im officially obsessed, thank you thredup! I love the packaging it came in..adorable! The little card was cute & the letter topped it off!",5
14080,"Whoever came up with this whole concept is a genius!! It's so fun to shop, save, sell, and of course, BUY! Lots of goodies on here to choose from! Site is easy to navigate (I'm still pretty new here, but so far it's pretty great!). I have an obsession with purses, shoes, and wallets. I just wish there were pics of the inside of these items. Happy shopping everyone!",5
14081,Fun,5
14082,Wonderful,5
14083,So addicting! Find so many good deals for all the things I need!,5
14084,"I love shopping here the clothing is wonderful but I have any awful experience selling clothes. I chose the opinion to have my unchosen clothes sent back to me, and that never happened. After I seen they when though my bags I messaged customer support to see when the clothes would be sent back. Customer service never got back to me and they don't have a customer service number where you can call. Just read the fine print!",3
14085,Awesome inventory and service. Love the caring that goes into the packaging to make you feel special and recycling helps the planet. Thank you all,5
14086,I just became a new member and I placed an order and I was supposed to get 50% off my first order and it wouldn't allow me to put the word new in as a promo code and I did not get my 50% off as a new customer I don't appreciate that I don't like that I don't I feel like that you guys are taking my money I would not use you guys again,1
14087,Feels good to get nice clothes with the luxury of ordering at home with the knowledge that I'm helping the environment from not buying from a store.,5
14088,Deliveries take a long time. Clothes always?smell dirty and musty,4
14089,"Galaxy S9+ phone. Easy to navigate app. Links from emails open app instead of website and never take me to the correct content, but otherwise I've never had issues browsing, purchasing or returning items through the app.",4
14090,"Fees are ridiculous better off going to a thrift store. Either they need to hire more people or get organized, because they dont tell you when theyll be shipping your purchase. Maybe in a few years ill give it another try. In the mean time its a one and done situation.",2
14091,Awesome,5
14092,Akways Great for ME ***** NO Stress *****,5
14093,I bought two items and they both were in very good condition and fit well. I am sure I will use in the future.,5
14094,Works well easy interface,5
14095,"Why weren't there online thrift stores before? This is amazing, ill never shop retail again! thredUP has instyle trending clothing in great condition for a great price! I guarantee you will find something you have to have, even tho I want this app to myself...you have to check it out! You can personalize your shopping account to your sizes and styles and it will only show you your personal styles so you dont have to weed out all the unwanted and unfit! So cheap too!!",5
14096,I like the app better than the website. I found the website was incredibly slow loading and the app was much faster.,4
14097,"So many choices! They have so many cute clothes, shoes, and accessories right at your finger tips! The quality of their pre-loved items is great!",5
14098,"I've found a whole new wardrobe using Thredup! I love the ease of shopping, returns, and also the great clean out bag. However, the selling part is not particularly great. They take a huge percentage of what you could potentially make. So you end up getting chump change. Not worth it. I'd rather donate it directly to another cause.",3
14099,Awsome,5
14100,Great way to clean out your closet! Plus selling gives you credit on used finds! Love how it combats fast fashion.,5
14101,So much fun,5
14102,I have really enjoyed my buying and selling experience with Thredup. I have found some really good deals and sending my items in for consignment are really easy. Sometimes you make very little on things but other times I get more than I expected to. I will continue using and highly recommend this app to anyone looking to save or make money!,5
14103,I like being able to find styles I haven't never seen before in a store,4
14104,Love the deals and easy ordering.,5
14105,Best thing Ever! I hate to shop so this is perfect for me😎💋,5
14106,always glad to shop here. never disappointed,4
14107,"I cannot say enough good things about this app. It's easy, affordable, has quality clothes and helps me clean out my wardrobe and make money while doing it..love thredUP",5
14108,"I have shopped using the ThredUp app numerous times and it is always very easy and user-friendly. Site is easy to navigate. You can use filters to shop more easily, and save your favorite items. The only thing I'd change is that the promotional codes going on at the time would automatically be applied at checkout. I have missed out on a discount a few times because of this.",4
14109,"Great prices. Overall cheaper than Poshmark, but have not tried any other preowned shopping sites. Satisfied with seller responses and accuracy of posted info.",5
14110,"Love it! So incredibly well thought-through. Right when you say ""I wish"" you find out that they have already have integrated that capability/experience.",5
14111,Love ThredUp!!!,5
14112,Love most of the clothes I have bought. The only downside is that if you need to send them back its 8.99 which is alot since youve already paid 5.99 to have them shipped out. I have just been donating the ones that dont fit. This also restricts me from purchased anything I am not sure will fit.,4
14113,Absolutely love this app. It has reasonable prices for high quality items. I have made a number of purchases and have yet to be disappointed.,5
14114,Really well done!! Save your favorites!! Great deals and coupons!!,5
14115,"I love this ap. The selection is huge. I thought with so many items the exact thing I'm looking for might be hard to find. The search feature is very advanced, making so I can find just what I want. This is terrific as I'm very short and finding the right pants can be tough, even when I'm in the store. They make it easy.",5
14116,Great things for cheep,5
14117,"Would get a higher rating if the filters actually worked. I ordered a pair of pants and was shocked that they was not my size. I am looking for maternity clothes for my daughter-in-law and once again the filters don't work. My advice, read the directions and details before ordering. However, the clothes are of good quality. Thank you",3
14118,Great,5
14119,From your closet to mine thredUp is a good time,5
14120,"A online thrift store...full of more UGLY clothes..than CUTE! And for the price..ha ha! You do better, just going to the thrift store on your own. Lol",1
14121,"Great prices, good shipping, and items received have been perfect. Great customer service when I had received an item sized incorrectly. Full refund, and no need to send back the product. They were fast and courteous. ♥️ I've made 5 to 6 separate orders so far, and plan to use them for more thrifting purchases.",5
14122,This is dangerous. In a good way.,5
14123,Horrible clothes sent to me ready for the trash not even good enough to give to Goodwill. Don't waste your money or time.,1
14124,Absolutely LOVE thredUP!! I buy (to much...lol) & highly recommend y'all to everyone!!,5
14125,Search can be overwhelming but overall the app is much easier to use than the website (desktop or mobile web). Wish you could sort by # of likes but I can see why they wouldn't want to do that. Probably the best shopping experience out right now!,4
14126,Not acceptable clothing! ThredUp won't delete my email. They make it hard. No customer service. Obnoxious. .,1
14127,I appreciate the quality and vastness of their options as everything is second hand and name brands. Great for my growing daughter and myself. Very happy.,5
14128,Dangerously easy to use!,5
14129,Great optional for sustainable shopping,5
14130,"Love this app, so easy to use.",5
14131,Love thredup,5
14132,Love buying from Thredup. Perfect to try out a variety of looks and brands you might not normally choose. Great prices.,5
14133,No mens options.,1
14134,All I can say is Wow. I am a thrifter and this could not be more convenient. Please offer more promotions to frequent shoppers.,5
14135,"Great app with a great layout, handy for when I'm looking for specific pieces on the go or when I'm just not near my computer.",5
14136,It's always always nice to pass good clothing along.,5
14137,"I sent in multiple luxury items to sell. They did not so I reclaimed them. I sent a pair of gucci shoes, brand new in its box and with dust bag. I received it with no box or dust bag. I also sent a brand new valentino bag with its dust bag, returned with no dust bag.",1
14138,The jeans I purchased have all been in excellent condition! Very pleased.,5
14139,"I liked this app a lot but now when I try to search for something specific it auto fills my request no matter what I type into the search box. What the heck, thredUP? EDIT: It auto fills based on the suggestions from thredUP popular searches. No matter what I type, the top most suggested search is what the app actually pulls up for me.",1
14140,"Was supposed to get 50% off first order. Didn't do it, so I canceled. Really wanted to order.",1
14141,"Love the idea of this app... But some items are WAY over priced. For example, they have these little girls dresses from H&M for $9.99 but at H&M the same dress goes for $4.99. Better research guys!",3
14142,I love ThredUp! Support sustainable fashion while getting some great deals!,5
14143,I am in love with this app! Has been very useful for me and family!,5
14144,Easy to use,5

14154,Great deals!,5
14155,Yes yes yes !!!!! I have loved EVERYTHING I have gotten from them !!!! NEVER PAY FULL PRICE AGAIN !!! & YOU WILL BE RECYLING AT THE SAME TIME!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!,5
14156,I 💖 dis app,5
14157,"Love this app! Easy to use, vast selection, reasonable prices. One downside, shipping takes a week or so.",4
14158,I just found a pair of boots I've had for 10 years and trying to buy again. App is easy to navigate. The search button makes it incredibly simple.,5
14159,Love love love this app,5
14160,Able to search for exactly what you want in your sizes. only negative is measurement details are incorrect often enough. hope they can get this corrected.,4
14161,Great items at a decent price.,5
14162,Love this app.,5
14163,❣❣I Love this store❣❣,5
14164,I have found so many great clothes! Love to shop this way.,5

14170,So far items are as described. Easy to use app.,5
14171,"Things are delivered fast, and they are right on with the sizes. It is actually quite fun.",5
14172,"I downloaded this app and immediately deleted it. I will NOT be ""forced"" to give you my email in order to navigate your app. Get rid of that stipulation and I might be tempted to try again.",1
14173,I love the entire shopping experience with Thread Up. I just never know what I will find!,5
14174,I have loved everything I have purchased from thredup!,5
14175,"I've always liked thrift shopping, being able to do so from home is great. I've gotten some great products at great prices. I also love the measurements being listed. My clothes/shoes arrived quickly and well packaged. Will continue to shop here from now on.",5
14176,"Selling review: I sent in gently used Michael Kor shoes, MK clothes, and other great brand items that are still in style and in perfect condition. ThredUp accepted my walmart and cheap brand clothing and none of my name brand stuff. Before ""clearing your closet"" they give you an option to pay for shipping on your items they dont accept. I was confident that most of my items (MK) would have been selected but nope! Now those items are just gone? Never will I send my stuff again.",1
14177,Wonderful!,5
14178,It would not let me log in to my account,4
14179,"great deals, easy to use",5
14180,Wonderful way to treat myself to nice clothes without breaking the bank.,5
14181,"Overall great, just have had difficulty updating to my new email for over a year. 😔",4
14182,Easy to find great clothes! Filters let you narrow your search by sizes and the selection is huge!,5
14183,"Great app, easy shopping. There are a lot of filters you can apply to your search which are very helpful. It also allows you to save certain variables, like your clothing and shoe sizes so you don't have to enter them every time. It allows you to favorite things, and the info stays consistent from web browser to app, so you can shop online, then continue on your phone or other mobile device without frustration.",5
14184,Awesome,5
14185,Easy & accurate info,5
14186,I've been pleased with my other purchases...even told some of my friends about this app.,5
14187,Convenient to use.,5
14188,Love shopping at Thred up,5
14189,Love this app!!,5
14190,I found alot of things in my size.,5
14191,Love this app. So easy to use and well thought out.,5
14192,Clothes were not as described. Photos did not show enough detail. So nothing was what it sounded like in app. Very disappointed.,1
14193,Great idea. Great experience. Pretty good app,5
14194,"Ive wondering how do you changed the sizes for shoes and tops. It has an easier way there and that. And took sooo much time looking. that i just gave away clothes, might way have been alot bigger.",4
14195,"Slow, won't let me cash out, the same pop-up every time I try to click anything on the site ""Request a Closet Clear Out"", no thanks.",1
14196,"Love this app. I have sent off lots of my clothing to them and it has madw my closet look so much cleaner. Did earn some money from sending them clothing ( not alot around a dollor and have sent 3 bags) , but now i have room to look for one really nice clothing and add their discounts to it. I just got 3 really nice sresses for 14 bucks with shipping. Beat that in a store.",5
14197,Its not giving me my discounts and how is something that is supposed to be 3.50 at checkout 10.00 when you go to checkout? Bunch of liars,1
14198,"I love how easy it is to search/filter, and it's nice being able to save searches when I'm looking for something specific.",5
14199,The photos are limited with poor resolution. One to two photos on a mannequin is not helpful. I never know the quality or details of the item. The descriptions are insufficient in explanation. I have ordered a few times being hopeful i will like the items. They are never what's expected. Sometimes this is a positive. Unfortunately about half of what I ordered is getting redonated. I gave it 3 stars for their prices being decent.,3
14200,Need more search categories. It takes too long to search through ALL the shoes to find a specific style of shoe such as boots or wedges OR open toed or sandels.,3
14201,Great way to shop!,5
14202,No men's clothing!,1
14203,Love the company & the app works great!,5
14204,Awesome finds. They arrive looking new.,5
14205,"Hands down best second had clothes AND brand new clothes too!!!! Best deep discounts, no one can beat ThedUp",5
14206,Ive ordered several things several times and im alwayd happy,5
14207,Need to change somethings,1
14208,I love shopping 2nd hand but edpecially online!! This is genius.,5
14209,"The ease of using this app was mindblowing! I set the filters to the category, sizes, styles, and even sale percentages! And up pops whatever matches what I chose! As a stay at home mom, this is MUCH better right now than bundling up the kids, driving 20 miles, sorting through endless racks of clothes while my kids ask for every toy in the building! I couldn't be more thrilled!",5
14210,"They don't send out the ""bags"" for sending items to them. No communication 10/28/19 Very sad, Finally did receive the bag after almost 2 weeks. Then it takes 2 weeks for them to get the bag back. Then almost 2 weeks to process the bag. 12/24/19 They make you buy back your things that don't sell. If you dont buy back your things they keep to sell for themselves...a joke!!",1
14211,"I love this app! Set your sizes and only see what fits you, save searches and get notified, and set the dozens of filters to find exactly what you're looking for. I've already ordered a bunch of clothes and saved a bunch of full retail $. You can bundle packages to get free shipping if you don't want to order $79 of stuff at once. And you can even pay on a payment plan if over $50. Which reminds me, there are some truly amazing high end finds here as well. So glad I discovered this app!!",5
14212,I am so impressed with this company! I received my order quickly and the items I purchased were in almost brand new condition. I can't believe I just now found out about this. I will definitely be a repeat customer!,5
14213,I have found some amazing finds and restocked my closet with a beautiful wardrobe.,5
14214,I basically get all my clothes on here now. I love this site.,5
14215,"This app is great! I would like to see a few more variables when I search for specific items, but it's generally an awesome way to shop for amazingly nice used clothes.",4
14216,I've purchased some of the nicest pieces in my wardrobe from this app. Threadup is the best thrifting app I've used so far. I hope the app will continue to make useful improvements without sacrificing the amazing bargains or unique selections. I plan on being a life long customer!,5
14217,"Great prices.however have to watch your cart,sometimes item get in there without personally putting them in the cart",4
14218,"I sent in 2 brand new items both with original tags attached never worn no pets no flaws. They denied the items as unclean or stained. I have pictures of these items proving not a mark was on them. I believe since there's no accountability for items they choose not to sell their workers can keep my item or resell. I'm asking for my items back both totaling $180. They compensated without my agreement to it, $15. I've requested they use that $15 and ship me back my denied 2 items. We'll see.",1
14219,Really like using app and Thread Up in general!,4
14220,I wished that yall could justed show one size that you picked,5
14221,I absolutely love thredUP! The app is super easy to use and the products are fantastic. The clothes are always in great shape! I have yet to have a bad experience. Thank you!,5
14222,"App is great & easy to use, but often closes & has to be reopened",4
14223,Similar to their website & easy to use.,5
14224,Hard to download and your sell kit.,2
14225,We sent in over 20 designer items and only four are listed. All the shirts from one designer were never worn. None of them were recorded listed but if I do a search for them they show up for sale! Not happy. :'(,2
14226,"Decent clothes, reasonable shipping time and prices, accurate descriptions of what you're getting",5
14227,Fast and easy,4
14228,Love it!,5
14229,Great for work wardrobe! I like having lots of pieces to mix and match for work and ThredUp lets me fill my closet and swap seasonal wear much more easily than shopping retail. My only suggestion for the app would be an easy way to see if the item you found is also listed in a different size.,4
14230,Obsessed with ThredUp thrifting made easy. I've sold tons of stuff and turned around and spent all the credit I earned on a beautiful wardrobe from brands I love and know will fit. It's quality thrifting and tons of affordable clothes that are still like new. And there's always sales plus the outlet section oh the savings I highly recommend it :),5
14231,Cool store. I like how i can shop my size. I wish there was better casual and work shoes. I wish there was a men's department and better manaquin photos. Some clothes have side details that can not be seen with just front/back pics. Like this overall.,4
14232,I can always find something awesome here! The clothes are in good shape when they get to me as well!,5
14233,I have trouble with their app and they sell my clothes for pennies. Not worth it.,1
14234,Horrible company took my clothes and I never heard from them again regarding my payout. I couldn't log into the account or anything.,1
14235,I bought a shirt last week and was impressed at how quickly I received it. I really love this site.,5
14236,Very user friendly!,5
14237,"Great deals, easy to navigate, fast shipping",5
14238,Every reasonable,5
14239,Love,5
14240,"Got one of their subscription boxes hoping to replace my expensive and not eco friendly stitch fix and was pretty disappointed. I was transported back to early 2000s fashion and all of the items were very worn, thin, and overall low quality. The one shirt I kept to not lose my $10 has a button ripped off so it's not even wearable. Definitely not for someone looking to be trendy or fashionable. Also very overpriced for the quality and style of what's being offered. Sad because I was excited.",1
14241,Its addicting.,5
14242,I love this app!! Its hard for me to go anywhere because if im not at work im busy or sleeping and this app allows me to shop from home an the clothes are Very Affordable!!!! It also arrives fairly quickly even without the Expressed shipping. I tell my friends about this app ALL THE TIME!! The ONLY thing I dont like is that every time they give me a promo code to take a % off it does not allow me to use it. Other than that this app is Absolutely Amazing!!!!!,5
14243,Horrible customer service Deleted the app... Sketchy company with horrible customer service...,1
14244,"Thredup is such a revolutionary platform. If you're looking for great deals, great variety, and a way to more sustainably purchase clothes this is the place to do it.",5
14245,Excellent name brand clothing for a fraction of the price!,5
14246,Bought all my business attire from thredUP. Love this app. Recommend to all my friends!!!,5
14247,"Love the app! So many clothes for good prices. Shipping is alittle expensive. On top, they ad tax that is also alittle over but I cant get enough of then!",5
14248,I get EXACTLY what I am looking for...many options and styles,4
14249,"Really like the app. Prices seem pretty high for second-hand clothes but I do purchase a lot of clothes from Thredup for the really unique finds which are worth it. I have donated clothes to Thredup a couple of times but the clothes are resold at such a high price, I prefer donating to organizations that resell at thrift prices so people in need can truly afford them.",4
14250,I absolutely love this site!!! Everything I've purchased has been in excellent condition and at a great price!!!!,5
14251,Awesome,5
14252,ThredUp is awesome. But I really wish they would consider getting rid of FedEx as their shipping partner. Everytime I order from ThredUp I am reminded why I dislike FedEx so much.,4
14253,Love this app and live the store.it is wonderful place to shop online. You can find everything u need there goody boxes tock so plz try it you wont regret.,5
14254,Do easy to shop. Item description accurate and easy return in anything that I don't like it doesn't fit.,4
14255,Horrible dont do it.,1
14256,Everything I have gotten is high quality and looks brand new!,5
14257,This is a great place to shop.,5
14258,Great,5
14259,"Love love LOVE this app 😁💞💖.... I may be a bit addicted at this point but honestly, if a Thrift store app has become my biggest issue in life im doing ok 👌😂😳LOL.... My only suggestion would be to have the ability to ""rank"" your favorites. Personally, I would find it helpful to organize certain items I like more than others and avoid everything getting thrown into the same folder.",5
14260,Luv it this my first bundle an save we shall see other wise always been pleased Luv luv luv thread up,5
14261,love second hand shopping,5
14262,Dont do it biggest mistake i ever made. I sent in my clothing. Andcwhat didnit sell i wanted back. I didnt get paid for anything and never got my clothing back . i contacted customer service several times with no diffinative answer and then suddenly when i ship the app looking for my things .. You havr nothibg and any catagory that is my size not from size 6 bluejean to s size/ large top nor shoes how can that be... I contacted customer service again and they said sorry . inventory low Fraud.,1
14263,App cannot calculate bundle prices for free shipping correctly.,2
14264,The best money spent and the greatest clothes ! I love picking out new used clothes . I have more options then I would ever have in a store and it comes to my door in a super cute package. I love that I can send in my and my children's clothes and get money in return and what Thread Up does not use get donated to people in need. I could not be more proud or happy with a company. Thank you for all you do. I can wait to see my next order.,5
14265,"I absolutely love Thred Up! Fantastic selection, superior quality, and all at prices that are affordable. I highly recommend using this company for all of your wardrobe needs! Buyer ⚠️ #highlyaddictive",5
14266,"Clothes could be better described and pictured ( i.e. missing drawstring, clothes shrunken, etc.) I recommend only buying items in at least like new condtion or you may be disappointed and end up with items you wouldn't pay a $1 for at a garage sale. I did reach out and it was resolved much better than I ever expected so 'Thank You!' This was part of my first order. I have already placed others and do expect them to go well.",4
14267,easy to navigate,5
14268,"I really love this app and the idea of a more earth conscious shopping experience BUT over the past year their prices have become significantly higher; almost to the point where their prices are pretty close to what the Fast Fashion market prices their new items. I love thrift shopping and this site makes it so much easier to find more quality pieces, I just wish they would reevaluate their prices and offer more perks/coupons to their loyal customers",5
14269,I love this app. My only wish is that I could sort my favorites list like I can sort search results.,5
14270,Not a half bad app but poshmark is a scam thredup is alittle bit better.:),4
14271,"Very disappointed! I purchased few good items from Thredup and was very satisfied with there packaging of the items. Very very disappointed with my items sold to them. I sent 15 kids shirts to them, all items we're name brand and in very good condition. The stated they only sold 3 items and gave me $1.12 in credits. None of the other items sold nor did the avertis to be sold.",1
14272,"Addicting AF Great app and shopping experience. I love how they're trying to minimize our environmental impact by consigning. The biggest downside is how long it takes to ship. I've ordered items and received them 3 weeks later, which is not what I'm used to in this ""Prime"" world.",5
14273,"This is not a good company. Shipments are done 2 party and if you have a package that did not reach you, they will do everything in there power not to make it right. Run around, won't issue refunds, as they put it ( it is not on them the product didn't get there). I won't recommend to any one, matter of fact I will make people aware of the shady practice. It's not the money or object, it's the point of customer service.",1
14274,"I was able to find brand, style and size of Jeans with great prices/ discounts.",5
14275,No men's clothing only women an kids garb neither of which I have any use for so app was basically useless to me. Be very nice if ya would include such important details like this in your commercials an ads bc your ad on TV basically shows it's an online clothing sales where 1 can purchase clothes in good shape for considerably less than retail which would lead 1 (myself as man) to think 1 stocks all categories of clothing but I couldn't find any men's clothing at all ! 🖓🤔,1
14276,No men's yet. Hopefully soon because it looks like a great app.,4
14277,Hearted items need to be sortable by price and category.,4
14278,I am a HUGE FAN! This is the absoleute best place to shop for the best quality and name brands in brand new conditions for very cheap. And coming from me when i say cheap i really mean cheap. Prices are low enough that a student or people who work 4 minimum wage can afford.,5
14279,"Nice quality, great styles, and it ships fast. Love how I can bundle up and save in shipping.",5
14280,Great Clothes,5
14281,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE everything about ThredUp, and the app makes it SO easy to use. I shop while I'm vegging out in front of the TV!",5

14284,Very easy to use the app,5
14285,"LOVE ThredUp! I have ordered several times already, everything has been in excellent condition, fast shipping! Love the notifications for specific searched items becoming available. Great for impulse buying 😂",5
14286,Handy way to browse when time is short.,5
14287,These people are ripping people off in my opinion. I have used it and they make a killing off our clothes and give us change,1
14288,Excellent prices for gently used clothing! Highly recommend!,5
14289,"Update 12/15/19: Still my favorite place to shop for clothes. Returns are super easy. I recommend ThredUp to everyone, especially when I get compliments on my cute outfits.* ThredUp is my new favorite store, online or otherwise. I love how convenient it is and the clothes are in great condition. The app is super user friendly as well.",5
14290,"The clothes are amazing, very good condition.",5
14291,Great I have bought several items from thred UP and I have not ever had a problem. 5++,5
14292,I luv this! It's such a great way to look fabulous on a budget!,5
14293,Amazing! Love Thread Up! Recommend to everyone.,5
14294,Wish you could filter by bust size,4
14295,"Good deals on used clothes. Fairly easy to navigate, limits bargain hunting(will not show all clothing deals in one shot, still have to scroll)",5
14296,Easy to use and fast,4
14297,Easy,5
14298,I am confused about why it breaks up the payments of my purhcases ove 3 months.,2
14299,"Let me just say I like ThredUp and will absolutely keep using the website. I only had the app for a day. I had to delete it because it sent SO MANY push notifications. I turned off the notifications in the app but 30 seconds later, my phone is vibrating like crazy and it's all from this app! Went back into the settings and NONE of my notification settings had been saved. I did that three times and then deleted the app. Very frustrating.",1
14300,Love it!,5
14301,Great prices good quality,5
14302,"Great on my phone, crashes sometimes on my tablet. Addicted to buying the clothes. :)",4
14303,Easy shopping. Great discounts and prices,5
14304,Great deals fast shipping,5
14305,"Doesn't open - uninstalled and reinstalled, updated app. Says server can't be found for over a month now.",1
14306,"Cool clothes, nice app, no apparent issues... BUT... Lately, I've been getting 15+ notifications per day. Excessive! Keeping the app, but had to turn notifications off.",4
14307,This app makes it so easy to shop for gently used clothing. Highly recommend!,5
14308,"After fees you will get cents for an item. Example Ralph Lauren child's dress bought for $39 on sale. They listed for $5.99 and after fees I made $0.19. Be sure to pay for return assurance or they just keep your items and pay you nothing at all. Better to sell in garage sale or privately. I sent over 60 name brand items, Old Navy, Carter's, Ralph Lauren, Oshkosh and they claimed to only take 20 and kept the rest without returning them. I am estimated only a $9 payout. What a complete rip off!!",1
14309,"I am loving this app and website. I have always had a great experience! Even when something goes wrong, customer service goes above and beyond go resolve the matter. Seriously, they go out of their way. I love the Buy & Bundle option. It has saved me so much money and is officially the only way I really shop for clothes",5
14310,"The clothing filters are great! But sometimes I get the feeling the number of likes (hearts) on an item are not accurate, but are instead a gimmick to get me worried that someone else is interested. The cart will often say you are still some amount away from free shipping even if you have already reached the free shipping threshold. If you ignore this message you still get free shipping at checkout so it's not too big of a deal. Just confusing. Over all though great experience!",4
14311,So there's no section for men 😒😠😡🤬,1
14312,It was actually good experience and had a really good 😊 quotes,5
14313,Is it a good app and it is up and running 95% of time ! I love the Upcycled fashion!,5
14314,"The app is easy to use and I love the bargains. I'm also enjoying the Goody Box service. I would love to see more filter options for searches, and to increase the accuracy of search results.",4
14315,Easy to use. Great notifications on sales!,5
14316,"I usually manage to totally renew grand daughters wardrobe each winter for $80-$100 including a coat. If you're thorough like me & check every items condition there are many ""like new"" tops & bottoms for around $3!! I always qualify for free shipping & my order arrives promptly. I love Thredup!!!!!!",5
14317,"This app is great for anyone who loves fashion and doesn't want to spend too much money, or contribute to the fast fashion industry. It has the convenience and ease of shopping as other clothing apps, but without the harmful side effects to the environment, animals, humans (labor), or your wallet. I am sending in clothes I don't like and spending the money I earn on creating a whole new wardrobe, giving myself a complete makeover using only this app. ❤",5
14318,I love this site! It has completely changed how I shop for clothing and I get the satisfaction of knowing that I am helping the environment.,5
14319,"This app works very well, and great prices on clothes. I love thredUP! *edit The app keeps asking me to review it, a little annoying but not really a big deal.",5
14320,Great finds...if you don't mind waiting.,4
14321,Awesome!,5
14322,I love all the amazing prices and styles!!,5
14323,I love it...l can shop without the long lines and busy stores.,5
14324,Love this app. Feels good to save money and reuse rather than buying new :),5
14325,Love!!!,5
14326,I love it too much. Its dangerous for my bank account lol,5
14327,"Loved what I recieved, the items were in perfect condition!",5
14328,"Love this app! I'm able to find clothes that actually fit me, are cute and not expensive!",5
14329,Best second hand clothes shopping experience ever!,5
14330,Easy to use!,5
14331,"Very nice, great prices",5
14332,"This is easy to navigate. Amazon should take some lessons from Thread Up web page developers. Thread Up however should not limit the item totals in your cart. I do LOVE the Buy & Bundle! Shop all week and get free shipping if you spend $79 bucks. I bougjt 18 items like shirts, skirts and dresses all for less then $80 bucks. Great site to buy from, I'll be a customer for life. Thank you ThredUP.",5
14333,"Crashing problem was fixed! Love it, the only store/app I use to shop for clothes now :)",5
14334,Love the website for good deals,5

14343,Love it! Gorgeous clothes and shoes. Great size options.,5
14344,"I been a client since the beginning and I love it. Now, my feelings towards the app is different due to the increase in price.",3
14345,My fav company so far!! App could def be improved- the search engine is pretty much obsolete..,5
14346,Love it. Thanks,5
14347,Best online shopping site for used clothing and to sell your old clothes.,5
14348,Fun!,5
14349,"There ""tinkering around updates"" have made thredup unusable since December.",1
14350,Very poor with selling ny stuff I put about 40 things in one bag in only 2 things got listed very disappointed,1
14351,Very easy to shop thru! And some good finds!,5
14352,"I've downloaded this app 3x and every time decided the search design is terrible for shopping. I like the ability to bundle but as ex. Is it dry clean only? Can they at least tell you the style type for pants or have a photo of the label so you can figure out? Why can't you search based on petite sizing or inseam? Edit: to respond, dry clean only is inconsistently labeled at best and I want to search by petite only, not include it. And the lack of info would be ok if prices weren't so high!",2
14353,"They have good clothes but this is not a true thrift store, their prices are ridiculously high to be a thrift store, I even ordered some ""clean out"" bags from them expecting to make a good profit for my clothes, don't do it! You only get pennys on the dollar if your item does sale . Also ,the taxes and shipping and handling tacks on another $8-10 dollars in addition to what your purchasing😮 Why ThreadUp!? Why!!? I have a lil credit with them,once I use it up I don't ever plan to use them again",2
14354,All clothes that I have purchased looked brand new or still had the tags on it....I'm addicted to the site already!,5
14355,I am in love with this app,5
14356,Love shopping with money I made from my closet!,5
14357,Lovely,5
14358,"A really easy way to spend time and money looking at fun, ecofriendly fashion.",5
14359,Too many notifications,2
14360,Love this app!,5
14361,"I just started using Thredup, and I'm absolutely addicted. The selection is HUUUGE, the prices are SUPER reasonable, as are the shipping rates (I'm looking at you, Poshmark). I especially love that if I put something in my cart, no one else can purchase it for 24 hours! I see myself spending a LOT of money with Thredup!",5
14362,"Haven't received the clothing yet, but the ordering was easy and like the multiple filter options. Waiting to see if express shipping is really 1-3 days.....",4
14363,Excellent quality. I have been very happy with the items I have purchased at Thredup.,5
14364,"Absolutely amazing! Plato's closet online! Always nicely packaged, clean and next to new!",5
14365,"I am Absolelutely in love with ThreadUp!!! I get the best clothes always in the best condition usually new. I get clothes that would cost anyone top dollar retail prices on threadup for deals you wont find anywhere else. I always tell people who ask where i got my outfit, I thrifted it.",5
14366,Absolutely love it! Thrifting from the comfort of my home is pretty cool. And they're always having some kind of percentage off deal which is awesome!!,5
14367,Wish there is free shipping,5
14368,Good deals,5
14369,Love this app! I spend all my money here lol 😂,5
14370,Best,5

14372,"My only complaint is customer service. It barely exists. I moved and forgot to update my address in the profile. I couldn't get ahold of anyone in a timely manner to change the address on the package before it shipped. Luckily the buyer of our house was kind and got my order to me. So far so good in terms of use, ordering clean out kits, processing kits, buying. Everything I have purchased has been wonderful.",4
14373,First time buyer (wife)..Bought two tops..looked brand new. Worried bout the shipping time cause needed them for party they came in a week early. Price was reasonable. So far I'm happy,5
14374,Not worth your time. Might as well have a garage sale - probably would make more money. And so far I've been unable to cash out my measly earnings.,1
14375,These people will try and steal your clothes. If you don't have to mess with DON'T. I WOUKD GIVE THEM A ZERO BUT COURSE THEY DON'T GIVE YOU OPTION. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF METLARCHY.,1
14376,"Some good finds, but you'll have to search a while.",4
14377,Received 3 pairs of dress pants. I'm very tall and was excited to find pants long enough to fit. Well they were long because they were men's pants. They button and zip backwards the way men's do. Now I want my money back and don't think I should have to pay to send them back!!,1
14378,Love this app. I buy from here all the time Will continue shopping with tredup!,5
14379,"I sent in a bag of clothes that was worth roughly $400+. My ""potential payout"" was $31. 4 things sold and I have nothing. I had multiple brand new items of clothes for $30-40 each and recieved between 26 cents and $2.06 for each. Not even worth putting these clothes in a bag and driving to UPS. Post your stuff on Poshmark or Ebay instead. This screws you out of sooo much money.",1
14380,Fantastic options at amazing prices!,5
14381,Always a great experience with getting clothes from here! Always as described.,5
14382,Love it!,5
14383,"Filtering doesn't actually do anything 85% of the time. Even if you refresh, reapply filters, restart the app, you still are suggested size S or XS or basically every other size all thrown in together. Only place for feedback and suggestions is here in the Play Store instead of in the app at the bottom of the screen or top corner. Maybe consider making a place to submit feed back a thing... Also make the promo bubble not just collapsible but let us actually exit it.",2
14384,Love ThredUp!,5
14385,I have ordered 2 coach mule and one is too small. I have emailed number of times but can't get the right answer. I need to return an item but no help at all from customer support. This is so dissapointing that you cannot get in touch with nobody. I will not shop in this store again.,1
14386,Easy to use. Love that it stores my size preferences--saves so much time!,5
14387,Good shopping and selling experience. Shipping takes a long time and returns are awful.,3
14388,Love this app! Easy to use & I have found some fantastic deals!,5
14389,"I love this app. Great vintage and new clothes at great prices, everything is like brand new!",5
14390,Can't get enough,5

14392,I love shopping with thredup its very easy and arrives very quick.,5
14393,Love this sight.,5
14394,Very easy to buy quality clothing!,5
14395,I'm so in love with thredup's prices and great quality of name brand clothes!!! Have been thrilled with every purchase ☺️🤗,5
14396,"No men, one star. Ok let me be honest. Only one star because my wife is having all the fun finding stuff. So I'll let her do her review.",1
14397,I wish I could filter my favorites and filter by location.,5
14398,"App and online stopped working. It keep bouncing me back to a log in and wont let me look at any close. I have $18 to cash out or spend and I cant do either because it directs me back to ordering a clean out bag, not cash out. And then I can't even do that because it won't let me doing anything without logging in. I can't even hit contact us without it bouncing me right back to a login. Very annoying that I can't buy anything from the site and its holding money.",1
14399,"Such good styles, cheap as hell too",5
14400,Excellent! Lots of great clothes for great prices! I've made 6 orders so far and I've loved every single item from each. High recommend!!,5
14401,"Tons to choose from, almost too much to sort through. Thorough descriptions. Great prices.",4
14402,I love all the hand bags,5
14403,"ThredUp is a very professional company with which to do business. I enjoy every level of their process. Each step makes sense and adds value to the experience. Not only do they explain each decision along the way, there is built-in flexibility. ThredUp's customer's feel free to be as involved as they choose to be. No pressure, but all support one needs to establish a second income stream. They are clever people. You want to sell here.",5
14404,"Horrible‼the worst experience on the reselling marketplace... steer away please‼ I am -$.84 after selling so many brand names items. I did not make any money on top of everything I owe them money for insurance to ship back items. I regret immensely selling to them, I will never ever sell here again. It's a scam, they make so much money. You get such a lil cut, 48 cents for certain brands. It's horrible.",1
14405,I normally wear an extra large and none of the items I received fit. Anybody ordering from the site should I order a size larger. And then they Mark items with no refunds which is not fair because of people shrink the items before they resell them is wrong that does not make them the items the size they are marked. Therefore all items should be refundable and returnable.,1
14406,Confusing,1
14407,"I used to love shopping for clothes on this site, but not anymore. What kind of thrift store has a restocking fee for worn attire? Or in my case, I find what they say is ""flare cut"" but when I receive the item it says on the actual label, clear as day, ""bootcut"". Evidently reading is hard! So because of their own stupid mistake, if I want to return something that's not what it says it is, I have to pay a restocking fee AND my own shipping to return if I don't want store credit? Yeah, GOODBYE!",2
14408,Really like it,5
14409,"I'm really enjoying buying recycled clothing. I like being able limit my search to new with tags and like new. I've already received several items, and they are all exactly as pictured. I tried poshmark, but it was too much like Facebook.",5
14410,Worse app ever .it takes forever load a new page and the search is all messed up ...took out after trying for 20 mins to shop .,1
14411,I sent 7 bags. They sold 50 dollar items. I got less tgan $1. What a mustake. I went to poshmark. They pay for shipping. I keep my items. Wheb thredup sent some and i some of my items back i got someone elses i am still missing quite a bit. Stat away,1
14412,I always find my style,5
14413,"Great variety, great deals, great folks.",5
14414,Horrible I sent clothes in with tags on them so not but a bunch that I know should of sold and they never got posted to sell or sent back lost alot of money,1
14415,Love the clothes but easier to shop on laptop. I don't seem to have all of the same search options and filters using my S9 that I do when on my laptop. I love all the clothes I've purchased though!,4
14416,Thread Up is awesome. Quality items and speedy delivery.,5
14417,Awesome concept and the app works great!,5
14418,Easy and fun!,5
14419,Love it!,5
14420,Great merch. Great company,5
14421,I love this store,5
14422,Great deals and the app is very User friendly,5
14423,Uninstalled it because I wanted to browse for clothing for different family members and it will only let you do one size at a time. I wanted to look at everything,1
14424,"Questionable ethics and flagrant for-profit business practices. Their strike-through comparison pricing can be quite misleading. ThredUP also has an eBay account, which often sells the same item listed on their website but with inconsistencies in pricing. I came across on their eBay website for the exact same bag I had purchased off their website, but realized I had paid about 200% more. They wouldn't price match me and took the eBay listening down, lol. Do your own research before buying!",3
14425,Love this app!,5
14426,Love shopping 2nd hand from my bed!! I wish the search was more specific like having a long sleeve option in the activewear section.,4
14427,"I am amazed at the savings that I'm scoring on thredUP! I bought a barely worn pair of gorgeous Ferragamo ankle boots that go for $860 and I paid less than $70! Now awaiting delivery of a New with Tags Cole Hahn shoulder bag worth around $220 for which I paid $57, and those are just a couple of examples. I LOVE this app!!",5
14428,"LOVE ThredUp. Guilt free shopping, great quality at insanely low prices, fuss free returns",5
14429,I love all the clothes I order.. I'm never disappointed when they arrive!,5
14430,Love thredUP...best way to shop!,5
14431,"Easy to filter items by size, brand, etc. All of my preferences are saved and are easy to change if needed. The quality of the items is top notch and it is even easy to sell items with ThredUp. I love this company!",5
14432,not comparable to goodwill or salvation army prices but the cyber monday discounts are great. i got a lot of good stuff that i can't wait to try on.,4
14433,It was better before the last 2 updates. I don't like having to open the picture to add to my cart. Also when having a sale make so the cart stays longer then 1 hour. It's highly annoying,3
14434,"Search function not working at all since yesterday. Everything else is functioning but it will not display any items from any search criteria now at all. Update:. Handbag filter is pretty useless. Example:. Choose ""tote"" and app displays clutches, wallets, wristlets, etc. Along with any and all other styles. Wading through all styles is time consuming and annoying if one is looking for something specific. Still needs work.",1
14435,Great way to clean out and while updating your wardrobe...love it,5
14436,I love the quality of items available on this site and the ability to sell my items with ease.,5
14437,DON'T SELL THROUGH THEM... They give you pennies for your items no matter what brand! Don't even bother!,1
14438,Great app I always find something I like,5
14439,"Super easy to use, and so fun to thrift shop from home!",5
14440,"I love shopping and thredup is one place I love to do online shopping cause you can get affordable clothes and good brands that I love like aeropostle, Victoria secret and much much more and they have my size which I have a hard time finding cause I'm little and some what short. So I would recommend this place to anyone I'm very happy with thredup.",5
14441,Thred up has great clothing and deals! They always have sales as well!,5
14442,Love this store!,5
14443,The deals are fantastic and the app is very easy to use.,5
14444,"I love the deals and the convenience, but I wish the app was a little more user friendly",4
14445,Love it. Ordered several times. I shop thredup for jeans. Good quality.,5
14446,It's exciting searching for the brands and clothing I love at low prices. There are lots of filtering portions making the shopping experience even faster.,5
14447,Love it!!!,5
14448,"Love the selection, prices, and what the companies mission statement.",5
14449,I love the multiple choices of your beautiful handbags and wallets. Also each item is shipped nicely wrapped and just brings joy to my eyes.,5
14450,"Great app, decent selection. I wish I could ask questions about individual items.",4
14451,Obviously not a thrift store.. obviously just another ploy to draw more people to the site. About the prices. Well the prices are not thrift store prices. Might as well search for new items. Granted. Cheeper than department store. Not cheeper that online prices. Not even new. Uninstalling the app. Ill use my own search engine and get what i really want. And probably cheeper. And new,1
14452,Love this app. I bought a Coach bag for 30$ I'm so happy,5
14453,"Awesome, I send clothes I don't wear earn money and can find great deals on clothes!",5
14454,"The app is great! A double edged sword. This is my new addiction. I love clothes and shopping. I'm buying current trend, like new or new with tags apparel for a fraction of the cost. Anything can be returned for a minimal processing fee. You can't go wrong. Plus I've sent some of my old clothes to consign. Whatever I get is a bonus. They would have gone in the donation bin in a parking lot.",5
14455,Amazing finds at great prices!!,5
14456,I love the deals and browsing through the thousands of items and all the new stuff added daily! Great app- love this!,5
14457,"Good prices, fast shipping,",5
14458,Love this app! I had weight loss surgery and this is a great way to get clothes that fit for a reasonable price and get rid of clothes that are too big now,5
14459,"Very satisfied - everything I've bought from Thredup looks brand new (or very, very gently used). It's great to get new clothes for a low price while avoiding buying brand new.",5
14460,❣❣❣❣❣,5
14461,Customer service is not very helpful. Zero,1
14462,I've found some nice things at great prices.,5
14463,All items received as described. Completely satisfied. I tell all friends.,5
14464,"Off the bat, will not even log me in after 100 attempts. Waste of app version.",1
14465,I have had this app for so long and it has had it's ups and downs but it was a growing company and they have definitely listened to feedback and grew from it. I'll continue to shop with thred up because it's awesome. I have even donated old clothes of mine and my sons. They make it easy and they ship pretty fast. Even returns are easy if you dont end up liking something. All in all I'm pretty happy. I wouldnt continue to use it if I didnt like it.,5
14466,Love this app! Great clothes at great prices. I have ordered 3 times. Completely satisfied each time.,5
14467,Easy to use and navigate. More comfortable than the website on a mobile.,5
14468,"I hate clothes shopping, especially at thrift stores. This app is so easy, fun, and awesome!",5
14469,No customer service and items not adequately described or measured.,1
14470,thredUP is AWESOME! I send in not only all of MY unwanted clothes...but all of my daughters clothes that she's grown out of! They take women's clothes and they take children's both boy and girl clothes! After I've earned some money I either cash out straight into my bank account or shop thredUP for super cute clothes for my daughter and I. It doesn't get much better than this.,5
14471,"I'm new to the ThredUP app & not only have I found wonderful outfits, I can't wait to sent some stuff to sell as well.",5
14472,I guess my last comment on this app was deleted. Anywho don't bother with this app you will not make much money from it.,1
14473,awful. App is not easy to use,1
14474,I love the active wear at reasonable prices.,5
14475,"Wish the descriptions offered more. One thing I'm not sure they list is whether or not an item, specifically dress items are lined. Overall, a good app.",4
14476,The absolute easiest and best place to shop for clothes!,5
14477,"The app won't open on my phone. The company is great, but the app won't open on my phone. I've reinstalled, looked for updates, nothing. Bummed because I keep seeing coupons and missing the chance to use them.",1
14478,I order from ThredUp for my kids and for myself and i'm always happy with my items.,5
14479,"So easy to use. I love the option to browse the expansive selections or to search for specific brands, items, etc.",5
14480,"Good experience so far! I ordered kids clothes and womens clothes, they were all great quality at a good price.",4
14481,This blows Stitch Fix out of the water. Love the Goodie box and random weekend shopping. Let's you bundle your choices to save on shipping. 5 out of 5!!,5
14482,Great selection & great prices!,5
14483,Everything I have ordered has be delivered on a timely basis and wrapped very nice. The quality it very nice and described correctly. Love the convenience.,5
14484,Love it. Better than heroin.,5
14485,Excellent,5
14486,"Before threadup, I wasn't very into clothes shopping because I could never find anything I liked or it was too expensive. Since I found this app, I have been addicted to clothes shopping. There are so many options and the prices are great. The app is easy to use, items are as described, and returns are simple. It would be great if men's clothes were sold on here too. Also, whenever I press the ""notify me"" button for items in people's carts, I never get notified.",5
14487,Checkout / Cart was a little funky and I had to close then open the app a few times but then it worked.,4
14488,My new way of shopping.,5
14489,Great,5
14490,"I don't usually shop on my phone, but tried it out for thredup! This app was probably the best online shopping app I've browsed (and bought from). The app was fast and responsive and extremely used friendly, even more so than I've found the usual thredup website to be.",5
14491,"I love this store! I can never find pants that fit when I go shopping in person. This app allows me to see the actual measurements of the inseam, rise, and waist. Brand variance insisting is less of an issue this way. Plus, I am so happy with the quality of everything I have received. I've placed 6 orders this year and plan to make more. It is now my preferred way to shop. AND I love that I am helping reuse clothing!",5
14492,I was amazed at the selection of high end items for really reasonable prices. I actually bought a purse as Christmas present for one of my dear friends.,5
14493,"Excellence,i love the products that i get.",5
14494,I have been so impressed with ThredUp! Everything I have bought has been high quality. It really makes shopping second hand and being environmentally friendly easy!,5
14495,Awesome! Online consignment shopping is addictive. Order your favorite brands without leaving your home. I shopped by brands that I'm sure of the sizing. I haven't been disappointed.,5
14496,This company is wonderful and they have great clothes at awesome prices! I sent a package to the wrong address and even it being my fault they still helped me out and took care of me in a very timely manner. I would recommend this place to anyone.,5
14497,"Bought a coat, sweater, skirt, and a bathing suit. There was a pill (for ibs, as it turns out) in the coat, food stuck to the sweater out of the package, and the process of return is going to make it so I get nearly nothing back from the returns. Wonderful clothes, but they obviously don't clean them...",1
14498,Awesome,5
14499,The app works great.,5
14500,Great app and company!,5
14501,"I love using the ThredUP app, but sometimes the notifications lag. The newest upgrade to the website with the bidding is not on the app yet, which I would love. Other than that, it's a great app, love shopping ThredUP.",5
14502,Fun and frugal,5
14503,Great app.,5
14504,Thredup is a wonderful way to freshen your wardrobe in a sustainable way without breaking the bank! Mark things you like as favorites. Then when a sale happens you can use the app to take advantage of great deals.,5
14505,I im addicted to this app u can find so many things that are in great condition from work wear to night out with the girls dress. Shop at your own RISK 🤗,5
14506,I love Tread Up. It makes shopping secondhand easy. The app is very user friendly.,5
14507,"Great items, descriptions are very accurate!",5
14508,The cart is continuously updating which means you can never add a promo code or chamge items in your cart.,1
14509,Great discounts,5
14510,I love it!,5
14511,Love it,5
14512,"First of all I love thredup, and I think their app is great too! Some times there are app only deals, rhey make it easy to check out and you can het notifications for your saved searches. Only downside is I don't believe you can access bids on the app yet",5
14513,Great shopping and nice easy to use app! Love it!!,5
14514,"Love, love,love!!!!",5
14515,Obsessed,5
14516,"This place is a total scam. I shipped name brand items to this company (brands that they state they accept) and they refused to accept them or return them to me so I can sell them on my own. None of the items I sent in had stains or rips, etc. Most of the items I did send in still had new tags on them. Shame on you ThredUp for taking my name brand items new w/ tags. One Item cost $40 (tag states it) it is being sold on thred up for approx $20 and you are paying me 48 cents! Terrible!!!",1
14517,Love shopping here,5
14518,"Great finds at great prices! It's easy to use, you can save your sizes, your searches and filters.",5
14519,Cannot apply as many filters as you can on the website,3
14520,"There's New and used clothing. and pretty good shipping time. Just like a thrift store you have to dig to find something special, but with the ease of filters it's so much easier.",4
14521,"I absolutely love it!!! The clothes are amazing & it doesn't take forever to get to you. I've had no bad experiences with the clothes I've bought, I can't praise thread up enough. I will continue to shop here its my favourite place to shop",5
14522,"No ""Men's"" selections. Fail.",1
14523,Awesome enjoy every stuff....,5
14524,Awesome!,5
14525,I was really excited about this until I learned there are no clothes for men ☹️,3
14526,Love it,5
14527,"Love this store, buy from it all the time",5
14528,Love the jeans I ordered from Thred Up. The price is outstanding. Super fast shipping in a cute bag. The app is easy to use and service so far is excellent.,5
14529,"Spams you with emails of ""discount codes"" when they never work or ""don't apply."" That and a limited selection, no options to offer or bid on a item makes Mercari my go to app for consignment",2
14530,"Overall I love shopping here. 1. However the search bar could be improved. You cannot change or edit a search entry or correct spelling. It makes you enter the whole thing again!! A bit annoying. 2. It has no option to allow you to save favorites or items in self named categories. Ie.) ""Dresses"", ""workout clothes"", "" boots"", etc....currently favorites is in one big category. Makes it really hard for me to go back, find it and add to my cart!!",4
14531,"Great! But could use a few more filters like, sales.",4
14532,"I think its ridiculous there is a time limit on your cart especially when you want to look through stuff and now i have lost SEVERAL items that I've wanted to this. First come first serve. My cart first my item first. If I dont end up buying so be it, then they will be notified. Also the app keeps kicking me out it will just shut out for no reason and I have a galaxy s9 it's not an old phone.",2
14533,Super easy to maneuver and very organized!!,5
14534,"Dont normally leave reviews, i was skeptical at first that the clothing wasnt gonna look the same as the pics. But this website really couldnt be anymore helpful. Easy to navigate app, broken down catagories, great coupon discounts on top of the already amazing discounts, and the clothes are worth the wait. I recieved all of my products, in great shape, at the prices they were listed for. No hidden charges, they actually help you save MORE, when you check out. GET THIS APP!",5
14535,Best experience ever!!,5
14536,Great app and great concept for a store.,5
14537,❤️,5
14538,"Love the value and the products are in great shape, having lots of fun seeking, shopping, and styling. Thanks Thread up",5
14539,Very satisfied with Thred Up. Update 11-27: used the app several times for both buying and selling and still very satisfied with how thredup works. Selling takes a little bit of time but is definitely worth it. They always have tons of promo codes for buying.,5
14540,"I have ordered from this Company, about five times in the last 12 months, everything I've received from them has been better-than-expected, at a price that is so below the real value. I could not be more impressed, even two of the items I ordered that work very low price point , we're listed as barely used condition one of them said slight wear damage. That was the only mistake I have found because that I don't look like it had never been worn, it was in absolutely perfect condition .",5
14541,I can’t download the app from Canada. Is this general?,4
14542,Excellent,5
14543,Very easy to use Addictive,5
14544,I really like being able to pick out what I want from the huge listing. I was finally able to make my purchase today with the help of customer service.,5
14545,I was totally happy until you lost an item I ordered and also sent me something I didn't order. Their communication and customer service sucks.,3
14546,I haven't got my oderd yet but i love looking at the items on your app i will be shopping again,4
14547,"If i could leave a negative review, i would THREDUP IS A SCAM i ordered 2 size 24 WOMENS jeans i got 2 pairs of jeans that MIGHT fit a malnourished, starving 7-11 year old this cost me 17.00+ repeat, just shop in person you will get what you're expecting that way *******THIS SITE SCAMS PEOPLE*******",1
14548,"I love this app, now that I understand how to navigate through it. Initially it is difficult to figure out where to start. But now I am on their daily looking for something. Otherwise I would have given it five stars if the initial process has been smoother.",4
14549,Very user-friendly.,5
14550,"Since last update, app won't load past opening screen.",1
14551,Worst customer service ever! I do not recommend selling to them and I definitely wouldn't buy from them.,1
14552,Great products. Fast and easy service.,5
14553,No mens clothing,1
14554,Issue: links from ThredUp emails never open properly in the app. Always just opens to the home page. Also wish there was better search for clothing features to make it easier to sift through the huge selection.,4
14555,"Not a very intuitive app. You can't just look up something like ""t shirt dress"" or ""toiletry bag"" you have to comb through their large categories of dresses or hand bags. Not easy to use or understand. It's a great idea and I want it to work, but apps like poshmark or mercari are much easier to use to buy second hand online.",2
14556,Good so far,5
14557,Great,5
14558,Quick and easy way to find a bargain,5
14559,I sent in my first clean out bag and had a great time stuffing it full. I was totally excited when you accepted more than the average amount. I love my experience so far and will be shopping frequently and sending more clean out bags .Thank you KM,5
14560,Like Thredup app but prefer the online version better. Do like that all clothes measurements are listed which means I barely send anything back due to fit.,4
14561,"I sent in a bag with tags on stuff ,name brand , and it was a huge bag and got paid 40 cents for it don't even waste your time , I'm highly upset!",1
14562,"Excellent. Definitely the way to shop! Amazing prices, amazing finds. I love it!",5
14563,Love,5
14564,"Great app, and great deals!!",5
14565,"Great finds, great prices. Fast shipping. Clear communication",5
14566,"I love Thred Up.Every item they sell is so incredibly reasonably priced for a budget conscious person who can only buy second hand..Every item is clean,no holes or anything.I recommend Thred Up to everyone.",5
14567,I really like thredup.,5
14568,"I love this, it's super convenient",5
14569,"Easy site to navigate. Great prices with fast shipping! Love the ease of shopping from my home without fighting the crowds, always able to find the items I'm looking for.",5
14570,Excellent ! I am in the process of buying me some more outfits and the clothes I have bought are nice for the price and the fit perfectly. Love shopping on this website,5
14571,Everything on here is used and the prices are like it's brand new. No thanks. I don't want to spend $20.00 on one shirt. The add on tv makes it seem like everything is super cheap and it's not.,1
14572,I havent been able to log in on the website for months (repeatedly log in only for it to send me straight back to the login page) now i have just put in a $200 order and cannot log in to the app either!,1
14573,Loved my first order. I got a georgous White House Black Market dress for $4.50!! The prices are incredible,5
14574,I love thredup,5
14575,It's amazing! I can't believe it took me this long to use this app. Highly recommended!,5
14576,I had a good experience they have a lot to offer for every size from purses to coats to clothes for anyone. The only reason I gave them four stars rather than five is because it is a bit difficult to put in your filters cuz I put them in and then they still give me different sizes on the clothes.,4
14577,This app is very horrible and I don't recommend it for nobodythey make it to where it sounds all good at first it looks all good but it's horrible do not waste your time effort our money on this app they will rob you blind I put some hardworking to sending them top quality clothes and they want to pay me $0.67 that's some b*******don't trust them.,1
14578,Love shopping here!,5
14579,My favorite on-line shopping for used clothing!,5
14580,Awesome!!,5
14581,"I absolutely love thredUP! I love thrifting because it's fun and it's good for the environment. Most of the time when you're thrifting you're limited to what's physically near you, but not with thredUP! They make it super easy and convenient to thrift clothes. Not everything is used, you can find some NWT items as well. They currently only carry Women's, Girl's, and Boy's clothes. So the only con is that they don't offer Men's clothes. Though who knows, that may change in the future!",5
14582,Hard to navigate. Doesn't remember my sizes if shopping different categories,3
14583,Look ov gain some weight an i wore a size 18 but now i need a size 20 with a lot of stretch a. I need beautiful Xmas sweaters size 2x an i need several leather coats size 20sn of course boots ugg short an tall xwide 7 different colors an shearling I side i had everything i had stolen so Iv been getting clothrz ftom neighbors an friends i went through a bad depression an thatz why I gained weight please help,5
14584,Great! Lots of great items with great prices!!,5
14585,"Love it. Backing out of the cart in the app is sometimes annoying. It often takes me back to the home page rather than whatever I was looking at. Otherwise, love everything about this.",4
14586,There is no real discount you add everything up they mark it up it looks like you're getting a discount you're not even saving anything it's not worth it. I'm about to cancel my order because I don't like how they did this and yeah I read the fine print but you don't save anyting I added my total which was the regular price there was no 20% discount and all those fees that you checked back on made it look like you're getting a discount I appreciate your candor please don't insult my intelligence,1
14587,Best clothing app out there!,5
14588,"Comfortable to use , great prices , great selection to choice from . Thank you",5
14589,"So disappointed. This is the second time I've ordered what I thought was a regular medium and received a PETITE medium. Nowhere in the item description was the word petite mentioned. My daughter, for whom I bought the clothes, is 6 feet tall so the garment is useless.",2
14590,The BEST place for shopping...👍❤,5
14591,Very nice,5
14592,"Very, very, very slow to process and ship orders.",1
14593,"I LOVE THIS ONLINE STORE!!! I always get really nice things & several brand new ones, plus they give back to Teachers, so it's a win, win shopping experience. Tina W. (Tx) - *Sadly their prices are very high now, like new.😥",5
14594,"I have a curvy body, thick legs slim waist and a large bust. I cannot just choose a size from S-L or 0-14 - I need measurements... I can go from one store and be a medium and another I'll be an XL. I really think you guys should offer or re think how you choose size ESPECIALLY since there's a restocking fee, basically I'll be paying a fee just to try clothes on. No thanks!",1
14595,Fantastic. Clothes are great. Returns are zero hassle. This is better than even goodwill,5
14596,Idea of it all is great but after their fees and the fee they charge you to get the rest of your belongings back Im actually at a negative balance with them now. THATS AFTER selling 6 items! And I have to pay for shipping to get the rest of my things back. You know thats not even right.,2
14597,So far so good,5
14598,Love the variety of clothes!,5
14599,"Take photos of the heels of shoes, please. The link to click on the ""update app"", Does not work. Take better photos please of black clothing, seriously you'll get photos of shoes, coats, jackets, and dresses that you can't see if it's a zipper, buttons or pull over your head! You have some expensive leather pieces on here that are in need of a shoemaker, still not top designer names, priced too much based on the cost of repair. I have bought several items on here that are older than 10yrs. They are in good quality, condition, however, your stringent 12 checks for items are a bit"" selective"", based on the name of the designer. So clarification is required b4 I even think to start selling my wardrobe pieces on here. Etsy, eBay buyers have everything in front of them. Transparency is paramount for good customer relations for buyer, seller and you being coordinator/middleman. Thanks.",3
14600,Love this app! Although it can be somewhat addicting. I'm very pleased with the quality of the items I have received. Returns are easy. Customer service is great. They are very quick to respond when questions arise.,5
14601,Awesome deals on here sizing us accurate,5
14602,Great app and great prices,5
14603,Ok,1
14604,I love the items that I purchased and when I had to return an item it was very convenient for me to return it.,5
14605,I was to get the fall goodie box and what i found was a bunch of super worn summer clothes. Wouldn't be seen in public with these clothes. And summer? Really? I understand they are second hand but my box looked like 4th or 5th hand. Will never order again.,1
14606,I've only purchased and returned items through this app but it's been an easy experience. Love most of the clothes I've received.,4
14607,Return shipping is a NIGHTMARE. You have to pay a $1.99 restocking fee PER ITEM and then it still costs $8.99 to send them back if you want to be refunded the same way you paid. It took 12 days to be refunded from my first order. My 2nd order- 1 box is 3 days late and I've had to contact them via text like 3 times to return stuff. There is NO customer support number to call. And the text support is only available till like 5:30pm. I've never had to pay to try on clothes anywhere else.,1
14608,"Perfect for people who dont have time to shop stores, brings a lot of brands in one place and items are all great and in great shape. Love fact able to set size profile and shop from it. Super great app. I would suggest it to everyone. Give it a try, you will love it.",5
14609,I didn't get 50% off my first order,5
14610,Prices are resonable. So many different styles. I love it!!!,5
14611,Purchasing from thredUP is fine. I WILL NEVER SELL TO thredUP AGAIN!!!! They don't contact when you contact them. The took things I sent in and didn't credit me for them then I saw them for sale later but not for me. They are a total ripoff to sell to!!!!!!!!,1
14612,Wanted to try it but couldn't get passed the log in screen. Its just stuck on that screen so uninstalled it since I can't use it.,1
14613,"Not being able to filter shoes based on type (boots, wedges, flats, etc.) Is about to make me throw my phone out the window on the freeway. PLEASE FIX THIS. I dont WANT to be forced to scroll through 2481 pairs of pink shoes when I am looking for pink booties, of which there are probably only 2 choices.",5
14614,"It's easy to use. Makes shopping online enjoyable. Sometimes, though, I wish for more detailed images/descriptions of the items. Overall, great app!",4
14615,Great experience! I dont have to leave my house. The clothes are excitingly nice. Will continue being a customer.,4
14616,"I absolutely love the clothes I have recieved with the exception of the leggings. I just handed them down. They look like teen legginge not adult leggings. I am tall and have some leggings already. I ordered the size I need not realizing the size did not match up. Otherwise the shipping is fast, clothes are beautiful, and amazing.",5
14617,No good,1
14618,This app is over priced used clothes they are not new so why would I spend 10 or 15 dollars on kid pants and tops when they cost that much in the store. You would have better looked just hitting the clearance rack in any of those stores,1
14619,"Arrived promptly, as described. Very satisfied.",5
14620,Just as good as Amazon!!,5
14621,Generally good items. I read the reviews to make my decisions on clothing or such so that may have something to do with it. My biggest complaint is the shipping sucks. It's takes almost two weeks for shipping and that sucks. I've sent stuff in but they didn't accept very much and I got less than $2 in credit.,3
14622,"WARNING!!! This company will claim your getting a great deal but your prices are actually raised compared to other people! The prices you see from a different account are not the same! If there is a discount your price is actually MORE so they can make it LOOK like its discounted! Ive emailed and its just generic responses. They said fees based on shipping but its a lie, prices are different when shipped to the same place! EDIT: $8.99 vs $21.99 IS NOT $3! Lies! Please people, dont fall for this!",1
14623,easy shopping. great prices,5
14624,Love this app,5
14625,"I seriously love thred up, and their app works great! I usually just shop on the app. Super easy and I can access everything I usually do on the website.",5
14626,"ThredUP has great clothes, reasonably priced. I'm loving it.",5
14627,"Got a designer cocktail dress new for a price I can afford, Thanks",5
14628,"Since the update you're not able to add items to cart from your favorites, you have to click into each item. When you remove items from cart they dont always go into the ""recently removed section"", in fact most don't. Also there should be a way to remove items from there that were added accidentally.",3
14629,Great place to shop & save! All the best brands at very good prices. The clothes look like brand new!,5
14630,"This is one of the better shopping apps. There is a filter for just anything you can think of. Favorite brands, colors, sizes, new or gently used, even inseam!",5
14631,Awesome!,5
14632,The items sold are as described by seller and better by my experience. They come like brand new.,5
14633,Nice way to try new brands you are unsure of or dont want to spend full retail on,5
14634,First order was immediately cancelled within minutes of placing it,2
14635,"First time order Huge selection of what I was looking for! Great first time discount, thank you!",5
14636,I love this site! So many options 👍,5
14637,Super duper,5
14638,"Need more"" in style"" fashions for heavy set women. Need shirts with bell sleeves and bell bottom pants.",4
14639,Some things aren't available on the app that are available when you go to the website,4
14640,"Easy to use. I like being able to have the ability to afford better brands which generally fit better, quality is better...thank you!!!",5
14641,"Excellent merch, excellent app.",5
14642,Love this app! Amazing deals on clothing!,5
14643,I absolutely love this whole shopping experience!!! I order items at least monthly!! Great experience!!,5
14644,Sorry but i use to love this app it was good but now that they r so much popular they have put those prices up like crazy for that i buy it brand new at the store i use to buy all the time for me n my 3 kids but its been 1 year or more that i dont cause its been cheaper for me to get the sales at the store. I am about to call it quits with this app so is my friends n family n they use to have better clothes now its not that good,2
14645,"This app sucks. The idea is good. I have sent four bags in, with wildly different success. My first bag, they accepted about half of what I sent, which I thought was decent. I ordered three more bags after. They took three weeks to get to me. The app barely updates where they are at in the process. They didn't accept much from 2 bags and the third bag was delivered two days ago and it still hasn't updated saying it has even been received. Needs work for sure. Plus barely got paid anything 🤷",1
14646,Great concept! I have enjoyed everything I have purchased.,5
14647,"**update** I am disappointed to downgrade my original review from a 5 to a 3 but the app will not connect to network (wifi or data) when I have perfect service. I love Thredup as a whole but the app needs some glitches fixed. Original post- Easy to use, saves so much by buying secondhand! They are very honest on the item description and quality so that you know what to expect.",3
14648,"I love this site! I just lost 48 lbs. and have 20 more to go so I am trying to be frugal when I shop. ThredUp is amazing, the quality is exactly what they say, the prices are fabulous, the coupons are generous and the site is SO easy to navigate. Definately addicting!",5
14649,"No mens clothes, seems sexists",1
14650,Best place to buy work appropriate clothing and not spending a fortune. Torrid is my favorite so far but have also found great finds from other big names. I have even did a clean out bag and to my surprise almost everything has sold within a month. I look at the app multiple times a day. Great app! Hope it never goes away!,5
14651,"I love thread up, but I wish there was a men's section. I wanted to get something for my brother and realized they had no men's clothing available to purchase.",4
14652,cant make an account submit button not working after password is entered,1
14653,Excellent so far ! Love the prices and 50% off the NEW account.,5
14654,Everything is like new very few things i sent back.,5
14655,"It's a lot of fun! I love the save feature so I can ""Window Shop"" and not be too impulsive!",4
14656,Love the deals and Discounts I like to say at home in the comfort of my own home.,5
14657,An easy way to shop my favorite thrift store,5
14658,Love the simplicity!,5
14659,Sometimes the application on items needs more information. But overall a great experience.,5
14660,Like using the app but can you please be just a little more specific about what is in your updates? Thank you,4
14661,A bit hard,4
14662,Great UX,5
14663,Love this app. Great buys. Very convenient .,5
14664,I love threadup! Neva had a bad experience!,5
14665,"Easy to use, great app for a great site!",5
14666,The 2 sweaters I got for my grandson looked brand new and I loved them. Only problem even tho the grey sweater was sized on tag it was much to short on him. I'm thinking it was washed and shrunk. To bad because it was very nice. But donated it to Salvation Army store hopefully some little boy will fit it good. Other than that do like the app and the clothing.,4
14667,Love the options and the fact that you can sell your own clothes.,5
14668,"Incredible options, incredible prices. I've been nervous about ordering clothes online with such bad experiences at Amazon and Kohl's, but this is a great experience all around.",5
14669,"Super clothing, small price",5
14670,"Easy to use - one thing I wish is that you could search by pants inseam. It's hard to tell if pants are regular length, tall, or short/ankle.",5
14671,Easy to use...maybe too easy!,5
14672,So far so good! Im pretty addicted to this app at this point. I've had to return a pair of boots and it was very simple and I got to ship them back for free if I put the refund back on my account. The descriptions and pictures of the clothes are very accurate The only thing I would recommend is to include special care instructions (like if the clothes need to be dry cleaned only or handwash only).,4
14673,"The advertisements and Google Play listing for this app are very misleading about price range and what brands are actually available. Most items on the app are Walmart or other cheapest of the cheap brands for ridiculous prices, higher than if you would buy brand new. Name brand items are ludicrously priced for a so called ""thrift shop."" Searching by size doesn't work either. I can search for small and get bunches of plus sizes coming up.",1
14674,Great deals and reduces carbon footprint,5
14675,"Fantastic. Would love to be able to filter even more options out. For example, I'll never buy see-through material, and I want only petite tops, but I can't look for only those items atm. Otherwise, it's a wonderful service.",4
14676,Not a good place to shop I got 3 things and its not true to size and one had a snag and it said it was in excellent condition...wouldnt use again,2
14677,Wonderful!! Quality products and easy returns,5
14678,"Love ThredUp shop here a lot. Great service and returns are easy also. So much to choose. Save $$, buy 2nd hand!!",5
14679,"App works flawlessly with nice shopping extras like saves, loves, retrieve previously deleted items, etc. Also great filters to narrow down what your looking for. Prices are amazing and returns are easy with minimum restock fee. Haven't tried selling yet but I will soon! Just wish there were more pics or that I could enlarge to see details.",5
14680,Absolutely love this app and the clothes. Everything I have purchased has been top notch and dirt cheap! How can you beat that!,5
14681,Love it!!,5
14682,"App works fine. My only complaint is that, for closet clean out kits, you can't pick to print your own label. The only option is to have them mail you a label and bag.",5
14683,Love love love,5
14684,"I can't get it to stay open,.... keeps saying app not responding....",5
14685,"You get quality things with affordable prices. Please come and try it for yourself, you will never regret.",5
14686,Great prices even with shipping added,5
14687,Easy to navigate!,5
14688,Love this app!!,5
14689,Amazing selection,5
14690,I was enjoying this app and loving the prices. But when i went to sign up to get a goody box. When i got to the last page. I pressed on the checkout button and nothing happened. Its like its broken,2
14691,"I have found so many cute things, AND I love that they are trying to be ecofriendly!",5
14692,My app works again. Thanks!!,5
14693,Clothes came in abd are wonferful. Easy shopping lots of variety,5
14694,"I L.O.V.E. thredup! They ROCK! Fashionable clothes, unique finds at great prices and easy return policies. You can't lose with Thredup! Just try it already!!",5
14695,"3 years ago (2016) I have found great pieces. 5 stars Update: Nov 2019 Terrible payouts , So low for clothes you paid a lot. They sell for $50 and give you $4. When you donate a big bag they only donate $5 instead of all. You keep what wasn't given to you. This is fraud. No excuse 1 star because I can't rate -10. Don't donate here. Call the veterans or red cross instead.",1
14696,Love this site worth the look on nice used close some times its brand new never worn,4
14697,"Love this app, easy to navigate and never any problems with it.",5
14698,Tried this and was pleasantly surprised.Descriptions and reviews about fit and sizing really help.,4
14699,"Easy platform to use. Lots of search options, good prices and good items",5
14700,Terrible rate of return and they accept very little of what you send! I will never send anything ever again to sell. I had very nice name brand clothing that they did not accept. Very disappointing!,1
14701,"I totally say ,Give them a try💯",5
14702,There's only been one time where I didn't like what I got but that was my own fault. I love this app!,5
14703,"Easy to use and nice features like saved searches, easy to view favorites, and the ability to auto-purchase an item when its hold expires from someone else's cart! Their Goody Bag service is top notch! Also LOVE how fast and easy returns are!",5
14704,"Terrible payout. Literally got .24 cents for a skirt that was new with tags. Almost laughable. Plus unless you want to pay 10.99 for returning the items they dont want, they will ""keep them"".",1
14705,"Love. Items represented accurately, shipped promptly, well packaged. Returns are easy",5
14706,Thing but bad. I sent you 10 shoes you only posted 6. 2 or 3 sold and i never got the money. And when i tried to get a hold of anyone by email no one every got back to me. Plus when i sent the 20 shoes to you i made labels on each one thst write if no dold send then back. I rate you a 0 and will be posted my experance to facebook,1
14707,Overpriced,1
14708,Good app,4
14709,"I love the goody boxes! It's a little bit or miss, but you have the option to return the misses with the provided prepaid return label. Can't wait to see what I will find next. 🕴️",5
14710,I love thredup. I am happy with my purchases. I love their packaging. A lot of clothing is new with tags and affordable prices. Thank you.,5
14711,"I love thredup and have purchased many items. My complaints are few, including: color is often difficult to discern in their photos and if its more than one color they describe only one of the colors, ie a striped jacket says white but not the other color. Additionally shipping often takes long and your unsure when it will arrive which is not a big deal unless you travel for work and its rains. The packaging is not water proof. If its out in the rain, your items get soaked/damaged/mildrew.",4
14712,Nice way to buy quality clothing for a very affordable price..!,5
14713,It was very well but wished you had a payment method for bad credit people to pay over time,5
14714,Overall I think the app and company idea is great! Sometimes my app glitches and I have to shut it down. It's nothing bad but mostly a bit annoying when trying to go between pages or place an order.,4
14715,Love it,5
14716,I told them I wear a x large and all they kept showing me was a large then a dateing site popped up that not fòr me also have restocking fees for a return,3
14717,"It's awesome. Works very well for kids clothes, thats all I've used it for so far..but I find everything I'm looking for regardless 😊",5
14718,I love thredUP! I was looking for a way to not only find nice clothing but also help the environment by buying secondhand. This app is very easy to use and I can always trust thredUP with my purchases for high quality.,5
14719,Great way to clean out your closet while getting a little something in return. Cute clothing options for purchase of all sizes. Shipping a little slow on a clean out kit but it's free!,4
14720,"SLOOOOWWWW SHIPPING. I ordered on 11/7/19. It is now, 11/11/19 and still says processing. You have had my money for several days. I wrote you an email and you have yet to reply. At this point, I am definitely getting the dress I ordered to go with these shoes before I get the shoes and I ordered it 11/10/19....YESTERDAY! It has already shipped. On top of that measurements are WAY, WAY OFF on dresses. This my LAST purchase from ThredUp!",1
14721,I like shopping with thredUp,5
14722,"Great on line site , and good value !",5
14723,Love this app! Its difficult for me to buy clothes my size but I can find anything here so easily! I love that it saves my preferences so I don't have to keep logging it in every time I browse!,5
14724,Great experiences,5
14725,This is an awesome app they send you a big bag postage paid so you can send them a bunch of clothes which they will sell for you and you can either have the cash or you can spend it on their site it's like trading all the clothes you don't like for ones you do like,5
14726,Shopped for a swimsuit bottom and found one in the unusual color I wanted. I couldn't find that on any other site I searched. And it was a great price on an expensive brand.,5
14727,Shopping made easy!,5
14728,I've had really good luck with my purchases.....,5
14729,Love shopping on this site. Great prices.,5
14730,Love this app,5
14731,Great 2nd hand clothing app,4
14732,I love the bargains. So much fun to shop.,4
14733,It's very convenient. The items are good quality.,5
14734,Fun shopping,5
14735,Ugly clothes,1
14736,"I love the idea of th his site. The reason im giving a 2 is because of the optics. The presentation is horrible. Should not matter if its thrift clothes, you still supposed to make them look presentable. Ya'll could have at least ironed the clothes. Its ridiculous that they look dirty because of the presentation. It makes me not even want to buy clothes.. thredup, this Is a fail for me. Change this asap.",2
14737,Love decluttering with their bags! So easy!!,5
14738,Good option to experiment with styles and brands without burning a hole in your pocket. I have found some really lovely pieces out at Threadup. I also like the environmental and communal initiatives the company is making.,5
14739,I am replacing my entire wardrobe,5
14740,Love it.,5
14741,I love this app! Obsessed!,5
14742,"Unsure so far... is the app supposed to redirect me to a webpage every single time? I thought I would be shopping in the app itself? I keep selecting to sign up with FB, but then nothing, no Submit button or anything, not sure what I'm missing here...",2
14743,"Can't get labels to print, keep sayjng null when i try to print a new label",1
14744,"Great, is to use and fun to search for fashions",5
14745,High quality clothes pet amazing prices! Shipping was fast the clothes were in great condition and really beautiful. So happy with my experience!,5
14746,"Prices are very, very reasonable! I ordered 4 handbags and saved more than $800.00 over retail.",5
14747,"A little more expensive than traditional thrift stores, but it's nice to shop from home and not sort through racks for hours to not find anything. Only down fall is you can't try it on before buying. I'd definitely recommend measuring your current clothes prior to purchasing to select the right size.",5
14748,Love it! Super e easy user friendly and sooo much good stuff. I get stuck way to long looking st all the stuff.,5
14749,The fact that there is no Men's category is very upsetting. If you want to gather the attention of the male shoppers add a men's category,1
14750,The whole order process to receiving my items was very easy to do and an exceptional quality of clothing.,5
14751,Great finds hp,5
14752,"Great app, I love threadup",5
14753,Love this app! So much to choose from. Just placed my first order. Can't wait to get it.,5
14754,"Emails suggest certain sales or collections; but when you click on the ""shop"" it never takes you to that section. When shopping, there may be 5 or 6 listing for the dame piece with different prices even.",3
14755,"Great, quick shipping, great sale prices",5
14756,This app is a total scam they sold beautiful barely worn maternity tops that cost well over 30 dollars each and I only saw $2 profit from both. It's a F*****G SCAM. I understand if you're short on time and you have clothes you need to get rid of but DO NOT LOOK INTO THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO PROFIT.,1
14757,Love this app. Great prices and great clothing,5
14758,"I was very sceptical in the beginning to install and use this app in the beginning (like I am with all apps). I have since been very happy/delighted with my purchases and have not been decieved at all. All items have been received and ARE as they were described in the post. I have tried to encourage others to install this app to save money and our mother earth. TRY IT, I KNOW THAT YOU WILL ALSO LIKE IT AND BE AS HAPPY AS I AM!",5
14759,Disappointing,1
14760,I love this app!!!,5
14761,love finding clothes on thread up....always happy with my purchases!!!,5
14762,Love it!❤,5
14763,Great thrift shopping app,4
14764,Love this app that gives you a chance to pick what your body type fits & lets you add & take away,5
14765,"Grreat company, great clothes, great prices!",5
14766,Design er,5
14767,Great! A lot faster and more efficient for me than the website.,5
14768,Wont shop here again and will definitely remove the app. I got a kids purse for $30. And a tank top that a plus size person can't even wear. Very disappointed!!,1
14769,"Easy to browse website by size, color or brand names. Try it, you'll l like it!",5
14770,Excellent items at amazing prices!,5
14771,I'm really tickled to have a very cool thrift shop online. With mostly the option to keep the things I order or not. But truly I've kept everything. Real pleased... Thank you,5
14772,I hardly shop any other way than thredup.,5
14773,They have some good stuff you just got to browse....what you see is what you get...each piece is described...so you know exactly what your buying.,5
14774,"Great App, very detailed, large selection of women and children. Easy to shop!",5
14775,"Wow, I found a treasure trove of nice clothes. The app is easy to navigate and you can shop by price, brand, and you can even save your clothing preferences. Love it!",5
14776,"Hardly any name brands listed. No Tommy Hilfiger, No Victoria's Secret, No Adidas, No Montana West, No Mossy Oak, No Miss Me Jeans, none! Hardly any selections of clothing for kids. All out dated of 10 years ago clothing. This app isn't worth your time.",1
14777,"Fast, easy and no crowds or waiting in line!",5
14778,Ordering is easy. I love they always have my size in great clothes and condition.,5
14779,Its great and cheap. My new favorite store!,5
14780,Very expensive used clothes,1
14781,Lots of fun! Beautiful clothes!!!,5
14782,I enjoy shopping with thredup,5
14783,Bought a pea coat love it,5
14784,"A good concept but the point of thrift stores is to find something good that you want at a cheap price. Most of these used items have retail prices. Also the ""NEW"" promo code advertised to me doesnt work, I tried to apply it and it said it isnt compatible with anything in my cart although it says on my first order it would be applied? Yeah... good concept, horrible execution.",1
14785,"Each time I've shopped on threedUP. It has been a peaceful, relaxing shopping experience.",5
14786,Been browsing for my entire family! Including maternity clothes! Just bought a bunch of clothes! So excited! I'll let u know how delivery goes!,5
14787,"Great online shopping, great prices, easy to use filters, and fantastic clothes!",5
14788,Not impressed,1
14789,Wonderful,5
14790,I love to buy my chothes from you. Thanks I am wondering about some itens that was returned. How it is work? Do you do refund I hope.so. let me know please. Thanks and God bless you all.,5
14791,Awesome selection and prices!,5
14792,"Easy to search/filter, quick checkout, able to save favorites - all-around great and user-friendly app!",5
14793,Great clothes! Great prices! You can even sell your own clothes!,5
14794,It's hard to see some of the clothing that's white because the background is white,4
14795,"I don't like the sizing feature. I don't understand the numbers! why can't you just put shoe sizes as 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 & 8.5 etc. Instead you put numbers 40. what the hell does that mean? That's why I uninstalled this app. I would not recommend this site either. And your prices are kind of high as well. If you're trying to pull people in to buy your products for you should have free shipping and handling! And you should not have to spend almost $100 just to get free shipping that's ridiculous.",1
14796,"I absolutely love your app I first heard of you off a YouTuber was gonna check you out but for whatever reason didnt then one of my friends mentioned you and I have been getting myself in trouble since , love your company.",5
14797,I love this cite!!! I have a 3 year old who makes shopping with impossible so having the app on my phone is a life saver. Also. They only show you clothes in your size!!,5
14798,"The app is simple, and works well. It doesn't crash, or freeze up. My only complaint is the photos for purses and wallets don't show the inside. How a wallet or purse is configured on the inside is a major consideration. As a result, I don't buy them from ThreadUp **** Thank you for the reply! The photos of the inside aren't about the quality of the item, but the usefulness. Whether there are pockets, what kind and how many? Is there a zippered compartment. Does the wallet fit a cell phone?",4
14799,"Overall great app, can get awesome items for less than on other resale apps/websites often. There isn't a lot of info on each item though (condition is listed but vague, no style name, key words, etc). This also makes it difficult to search for a specific piece as about the most you can narrow it down is, for example, ""coat"" by ""brand"" in ""size"". Better set up for browsing than coming on with something specific in mind.",4
14800,"This place sells USED clothing for HIGHER than retail. Maybe not adult clothing, but definitely infant clothing. Downloaded it to buy some clothes for my granddaughter. What a joke. I would give it negative stars if I could. Deleted after two deep searches TRYING to find a reason to justify the phone space. Just...nope. Nordstrom Rack and Marshalls have WAY better prices for NEW items.",1
14801,"This is now the only place I buy my clothes. I love the app, but the desktop website has more features (clicking on the brand name of an item takes you to a listing of all items from that brand). I hope to get some money for items I've sent to them, but time will tell. I would've donated them otherwise, so it's no big loss. I do wish that every item had chest and waist sizes, but it seems like a lot of items are missing that info.",5
14802,"This is the worst place to sell your clothes. You can send in brand new, on trend items and they will give you cents in return while selling your clothes for $10, $20. You'd make more money selling your stuff for $1 each at a garage sale. Once my remaining items are returned, I will be deleting my account.",1
14803,"App has some problems with pages not loading correctly, but other than that, it's great!",4
14804,"I dont like the percentage the company makes verses the percentage the seller makes on here.I dont get how this site has champagne taste when it comes to what they sell on their page, but when it comes to paying the seller, the payout is slim to none.For imstance, one of my items says it sold and all im getting for profit is $4.38, how much sense does this make?I will tell you, none.Now it makes me very regretful of using this site.All i can say is proceed with extra caution.Dont let Ad full you",1
14805,"I have found an amazing range of choices on all of my searches! Everything I have ordered has met my expectations and sometimes surpassed! The descriptions are fairly detailed and accurate. As well, the app notifications are timely.",5
14806,"What a great store! Searching can be glitchy, but otherwise my shopping experiences have been fruitful, especially for kids clothing.",4
14807,The variety and quality are exceptional,5
14808,Great filters!,5
14809,Love it! Everything came fast and in great quality!,4
14810,"EVERYTHING I HAVE BOUGHT HAS BEEN GREAT, AS DESCRIBED, AND ON TIME. IT SURE BEATS GOING TO ALL THE RESALE SHOPS. I CAN FIND THE BRANDS AND STYLES I WANT. I CANT DRIVE ANYMORE SINCE I HAVE BECOME DISABLED BUT NOW I WONT RELY ON MY HUBBY OR MOM TO GET MY CLOTHES. Thanks thredUP!",5
14811,Love this store!!,5
14812,They have Great stuff!!!,5
14813,So simple to shop and order!,5
14814,I love this app! Thrift and Consignment store shopping without all the hassle! I also love how it only shows me items that are my size and preference. Makes a huge difference from sifting through hundreds of clothing items at the store. Love you ThredUp!,5
14815,"So far, so good. I love the selection of clothes, coats, purses, and belts. So fun to shop for less. Can't wait to get my first order!",5
14816,Very good experience. Good quality clothes,5
14817,Love this app.,5
14818,LOVE IT!!!😄😄😄😄😄,5
14819,I have used the app several times and all goes well except now that I want to purchase a goody box I can't check out. I go through all the stylist questions but once I get to the last with the checkout nothing happens. Very disappointing. It may be a sign for me not to do it :),3
14820,Not really impressed they don't have enough stuff their dress category is lacking The Cardigans lacking it's just not for me maybe for somebody who likes to dress kind of shabby but no I'm going to have to pass,1
14821,Cute stuff at great prices,5
14822,Fabulous,5
14823,Nice clothing at reasonable prices. Rostock fee is ridiculous!!!! Nice that I can send my smaller clothes the them to sell.,5
14824,"Intuitive, it works the way you want it to!",5
14825,No way am I paying $30-75 for a used garment I never tried on.,1
14826,Beautiful items at great prices. App works perfect makes for easy shopping.,5
14827,I love this app.,5
14828,"I had items in my cart and both times I tried to checkout my card was charged, but it said there was an error and they couldn't complete my order.",1
14829,Easy to move around through the app. Direction clear.,5
14830,Awesome. So easy to navigate.,5
14831,Ordered 3 pairs os shoes and received them in excellent time and in good shape.,5
14832,I love the app but it's slow. Perhaps a server upgrade?,4
14833,Can't cash out my account. I have tried for a week to transfer my money. Everytime I try I get a new code number but it doesn't work. I have countless emails and all but nothing works Very aggravating and feels like this is a scam.,1
14834,Easy shopping experience. Most clothing is sized properly. I have been shopping thredup for over a year and only a couple of returns. The return process is simple. The clean out kitsch are an excellent way to clean your closet and get shopping credit. Love this sight.,5
14835,"Unfortunate lack of accountability. I bought a rescue box off of the website (one of many I've ordered), 7 PAIRS of shoes, all supposed to be a size 7. They sent out one pair that was a mismatched size, one sz 7 the other sz 8. Emailed their support and was ignored for 2 weeks, after installing this app to chat with someone I got a response that they would not replace or refund the shoes, stating that it was a ""cosmetic flaw"". Lost a customer for poor customer service/ incorrect advertisement.",1
14836,Haven't used this app yet,5
14837,Love it!,5
14838,Sent 6 bags of stuff alot still with tags in first bag they kept 12 of my items and i made $13 are you kidding me !!!! NOT HAPPY AT ALL. I would have rather of givin this stuff to one of my friends who actually needed it rather than be made a fool of with great stuff and the company getting 90% and me 10%. RIDICULOUS,1
14839,"Very nice clothing for great prices. You can save your searches, and receive a notification when an item matching your search has been added. High fashion items, such as Chanel and Balenciaga, are also available.",5
14840,I love how everything is in categories. Good quality easy to order. I only wish the clothes were on people.,4
14841,Fun & $Ave. Love it!,5
14842,Great deals and quick shipments.,5
14843,I just downloaded this app and it will not accept my address to have a kit sent to. Thats not the bad part. I cannot locate a point of contact for this company to get that straightened out. 2 mins in and frustrated. Thredup can you send me contact info?,2
14844,"I recieved my first part of my order from thredup and I am over the moon excited about cleaning them and putting them in my collection. I was very hesitant about this whole idea, I don't like buying things b4 I try them on because I am so tall that most times they are too short or say their real but aren't quite talk enough, but every item so far is perfect. I can't wait to get the rest of my order!",4
14845,"Better quality, selection, and prices than most thrift and consignment shops! I love the piece of mind knowing that I can choose the quality of items, even new with tags!",5
14846,"Love the app easy to maneuver, very convenient, I would recommend this app to everyone, you will not be disappointed",5
14847,A fan of thredup and now the app!,5
14848,"There is no customer service and no way to actually track your order. It does NOT take 7 to 10 days for you to get an email about your shipment or even the product itself, however the site says other wise.",1
14849,"Great Prices, Good Apparel! Enjoying seasonal shopping on a budget.",5
14850,Awesome way to shop,5
14851,Amazing,5
14852,Always great 👍 and very helpful if I need assistance! Highly recommend ❣️❣️❣️,5
14853,I love my new top! It was clean and packaged very nice! Will be shopping again!,5
14854,Im so addictive!!,5
14855,Easy!!! Nice items. Great prices. Less waste. It's hard to get much better than that!,5
14856,"Easy to return items. Products for ""new"" and ""like new"" not disappointed. I would prefer paying on what I kept instead of paying upfront and then getting a credit plus paying 8.99 to ship returns using their label. Still trying it out!",5
14857,Awsome app! Easy to use. Great prices.,5
14858,I love this app!!!,5
14859,It's a great site. But it needs better pics of clothers,5
14860,Love this app! So easy!,5
14861,Awesome,5
14862,"Love it, so easy and convenient. 🤠🤠🐾🐾",5
14863,I just got the app you have not used it yet asking for rating before I even use it 😒,1
14864,Love shopping this site & getting awesome deals,4
14865,I love this app. I buy for several people and they all love the gifts. I've made a few returns when an item didn't fit and it was easy.,4
14866,"I always have a good experience with thredup. If i don't like what i have ordered or something doesn't fit, it is very easy to return. I also like the clean out bags!",5
14867,I love the convenience of shopping my favorite brands from home.,5
14868,Love it! The app is so easy to use. Best secondhand online store ever! They always have sales and you can score big name brand clothing for minimal costs.,5
14869,"Can't beat the prices compared to clothing companies. Please consider adding the waist size to the measurements. Sometimes the color listed differs from the picture. Hopefully, this can be improved. Overall, I am happy with my purchases.",4
14870,"They still have new prices, but the items look worn. You're better off going to a REAL thrift store for REAL SAVINGS. Absolutely NOT worth my money or phone space.",1
14871,Excellent!,5
14872,Love it !,5
14873,"Online thrift store my tush! These are ridiculously expensive ""thrift"" items and they aren't even that cute.",2
14874,Never received but 1 of several items paid for,1
14875,Great deals! Love the payment options!,5
14876,I. Love. The. Clothes. And. You can. Save. Alot. Of. Money,5
14877,Absolutely love it. Just lost 80 lbs and didn't want to pay full price if I keep losing. GREAT CONCEPT!! Selling side could be better.,5
14878,"Great but the favorites is rough. If yall could make it to where we could sort through our favorites, it would make life 1000% easier. And when sorting price the discount price should be acknowledged instead of regular price. Other than that, app is great.",3
14879,Great consignment store. Only drawback is that you get store credit for returns. I wish I could get refund. I would probably use it more.,4
14880,Absolutely awesome 👍👍👍,5
14881,I really wanted to try this app out but i couldn't get it to go past the opening page. It said i was logged in but i had no options on the page....so i tried to enter my email address and it said it wasnt the right format,2
14882,thredUP is a great app. I get most of my clothes from them. Love free clean out bags. Send them your gently used good quality clothes and get credit for a future purchase.,5
14883,Great product,4
14884,Fun! Kind of addicting! Great value!,5
14885,"Love it, get your orders super fast!",5
14886,Love the search function! So many good deals!,5
14887,Great,5
14888,I love this app. What a fantastic idea🌈,5
14889,Loving each piece !,5
14890,Fun to look for new clothes. Be very cautious about sending in your clothes for them to sell more times then not you get change for each item even if they are a really expensive clothing brand.,3
14891,Great site for those of us who love nice things but can't afford the really good stuff new.,5
14892,Only complaint is that they should not have the restocking fee.,4
14893,"Excellent way to purchase affordable, quality clothes.",5
14894,I did not feel I received that much money from my items a item you list for 15 dollars you get around 3 bucks for maybe and then if an item doesn't sell you then have to pay to have your clothes returned to you on top of the fee you already payed for return assurance. I will not be using this again. A waste of time and now I am going to just be spending money getting some of my clothes back. Good idea for the company but terrible execution.,2
14895,I'm OBSESSED. What a great way to thrift shop from the convenience of your own home. So easy to use. Love this company.,5
14896,"Ok so I gave this a one, simply because it had nothing for men! I was super excited for this app, because I get most of my clothes second hand. But on the the other side of things. If you are a women or looking for kids items. Then on those grounds I'd give it a higher rating.",1
14897,Great clothes - easy to order - affordable way to swiitch up your wardrobe!!!,5
14898,Awesome,5
14899,"I love this app! I find myself using it more than any other app I have. Searching is easy. There's definitely something for everybody and every style. The options are endless. In most cases the pricing is fair. I've sold on here twice before and had no issues. Not all of my items were chosen and I was okay with that. I understand they base their selection on certain styles and what will sell. Overall, I'll recommend thredup and the app.",5
14900,Love this,5
14901,"WAS a great app but buggy, slow, and doesn't display as much as the website. Uninstalled and use the mobile site now.",2
14902,Very ready to navigate and make purchases. I'm obsessed!,5
14903,More Speed from page to page,5
14904,Love,5
14905,Over priced I just rather go to a second hand store near me in Ventura,1
14906,It's nice way to shop..,5
14907,Overall my experience has been great! Awesome selection of used clothes!,5
14908,Love this app,5
14909,"Easy, fast, and a great selection",5
14910,I've found great clothes in this app. Their return leaves much to be desired however.,5
14911,I like this app. It's great stuff 95% of the time.,4
14912,I'm very happy with all.,5
14913,This app is addictive! It's so fun to get the notification that there are new items that match my saved searches. I've found such good deals on my favorite brands. And they reject all but the best quality items so I can have confidence that I'll be happy with my purchase.,5
14914,Awsome,5
14915,"I've had 1 good and 1 bad experience. The bad first - package got lost, and their customer service was really hard to access (chat only, sometimes they don't respond to chat and they have to follow up over email, no phone number). They issued a full refund, so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars. The good - easy interface, really good prices, and an ethical concept. The orders that went well arrived and the clothes were great.",3
14916,Great way to browse and shop!!,5
14917,(Update thread up responce is inaccurate & unhelpful. I STILL haven't gotten m$!)I'm appalled. The new company thread up is using to cash out its sellers (stripe) is a sorry excuse for a money transfering service that charges you both a percentage AND a transfer fee only to hold your money for days (so they can earn interest on it like PayPal does) it's very disappointing that a company like thread up would sign contracts with a company that will even further bleed their customers! Disgusting!,1
14918,"This is an awsome site, however the clothes ate a bit pricey, my last box of worn clothes cost my over 260.00$",5
14919,Excellent experience,5
14920,"Love thredUP, quality merchandise at a reasonable cost.",5
14921,"Shopping and selling with this app is exceptionally slow. Customer service takes days to reply, and then the response is a generic copy and paste from the FAQ that doesn't answer the question asked. Orders take several days to ship, and then are shipped using the slowest shipping possible. Potential consignment payouts are very low and calculated on a price that is lower than the listing price, though none of the information on the site explains why.",1
14922,Love shopping second hand! Love this app...easy to navigate,5
14923,Grrrreat! Fun to shop here.,5
14924,Amazing deals and amazing quality 😍 I'm obsessed now. I love you guys. I didn't even have to wait too long to get my pants in the mail. And they're so prettyyyyy,5
14925,Easy to categorize your searches and filters! Having a blast with the options and waiting to experience the selling of some of my clothes!,5
14926,Great experience!,5
14927,Shipping takes 3 weeks ! I used to order from thred up 2 years ago . Things have changed since then . Prices are higher and quality of packaging and shipping times are extremely lacking in care !,1
14928,I would recommend buying from thredUP but selling is done at your own risk. They only take a few pieces and they send back the rest; they keep your clothes on the site for 60 days and if not sold they send them back to you I believe you have to pay for shipping both times.,2
14929,I'll definitely shop here again..,5
14930,"Great!!! I was skeptical of the process at first, afraid I was mailing all my clothes to a far away black hole - totally not the case. It's validating to see all of the clothes I send, prepared on mannequins and fairly priced for everybody. Looking forward to my next order (on the way!).",5
14931,"Filters are a little clunky, but love this app.",4
14932,Love it!,5
14933,ADDICTED,5
14934,Love that I can have quality name brand 4 affo6le pricees.,5
14935,Addictive!!,5
14936,"Takes some dedication to filter through their seriously massive selection, but you will not be disappointed! Great prices and great quality. I have been happy with most purchases but the few returns I've had to make due to sizing were easy and hassle-free.",5
14937,"Bargain deals on brand name clothing! Large selection, many with tags still attached! Love shopping on thredup!",5
14938,"I can't see any pictures! My internet speed is fine, my device is tuned up, this app is broken",1
14939,Great I LOVE IT !!!,5
14940,Everything I have purchased so far(n I've spent almost 500 already) is in great condition! Love the affirm option which splits total for you if didnt have it all at once!(great for back to school shopping etc),5
14941,Love the clothes and this app!!,5
14942,"I do not recommend them for selling. I am still waiting for my money & they shifted the blame onto other ""partners"" instead of just owning up to it. Do not sell with Thredup unless you love dealing with tone deaf customer service reps & nagging Thredup for the money they owe you. I thought this was an actual business, but why did I have to remind Thredup they owe me money? Next time they decide 2 ignore the date to send out sellers' money they should at least notify people about the problem.",1
14943,Prices are expensive. You would do better at Ross or Marshall's. Items I did not select show up in my cart. Not trusting this app and sm deleting it now.,1
14944,Great shopping experience,5
14945,"Best Online Store for Thrifting Clothes! Super easy to navigate & browse for thrifted clothes, shoes & bags! As well as accessories & children's clothes. I only wish it offered men's clothes, along with having an even more detailed search option.",5
14946,"Only half the clothes and shoes were advertised.I want to know where the rest of my things are.Maroon clogs from shoes for crews ,blue Columbia jacket,2 pairs of Izod golf shorts,Blue sequined dress with jacket.I have sent numerous messages about these items.I have had no reply.",1
14947,Favorite app ever! Who doesn't like to shop? Returns are easy... With the credits you can keep shopping...win win!,5
14948,Love this app. Great quality clothes without spending tons of money,5
14949,"A bit over priced for used clothing, in my opinion. Sometimes I have seen the same clothing that they're selling on sale at the actual store (brand new) for less than what Thredup is asking for used. And a few too many products look overly used. They're wrinkled and not presented well, which is kind of a turn off. Presentation is key.",3
14950,Teribble if you're selling to them. They give you pennies for the items of clothes you send them to resell. And charge dollars for those same items.(you end up getting jipped) Its ok priced if you're just buying from them. I DO NOT RECOMMEND SELLING TO THEM! ONLY BUYING. You're better off donating to salvation army. You'll feel better about the whole experience.,1
14951,I love thredup!Great customer service!,5
14952,Great items at affordable prices,5
14953,Easy peasy,5
14954,"If you haven't tried this yet, then you should! Such a wide selection & at great prices & quality! Only downfall is that they don't offer a men's section.",5
14955,Great shopping,4
14956,Great App. Wish There Was A Men's Section,3
14957,"First order didn't fit, got a credit so I figured I'd try it again. I've received half of my second order, and so far I've found holes in 2 shirts that were listed s excellent condition.",2
14958,"I sure do not think that selling items with thredUP is all it is cracked up to be. Yes...you send a bag to send items to you postage paid! After that you wait and wait to see your clothes go up for next to nothing! I should not have washed and ironed everthing l sent...wasted soap, electricity and time. Should have put them in the curb for what they sold for....your company is a joke!!",1
14959,Always good quality clothing,5
14960,Overall pretty good. It would be nice if there were a function that could split screen to pair the items you're considering and also include your history so you can coordinate your outfits.,4
14961,Clothing too much $ for used.,2
14962,Havent tried it will when i free up some space.,5
14963,Always kind and helpful people. I been with then for over 5 years. Things get here boxed beautiful and if I don't want the piece of clothing it's easy peasy to return I give them 10!,5
14964,Can't wait to open my box!,5
14965,Love everything about this app,5
14966,Great,5
14967,"Although I made my first purchase with thredUp a few days ago, I love that I'm able to purchase quality items at an affordable price. I love the fact that I can bargain shop online without leaving my home. thredUp let's you know which items may have a tiny flaw and which items are like new. ThredUp knows their customers wants and needs. This site is great! Thank you thredUp! UPDATE: It's October 20, 2019 and thredUp has not failed me! I love the great deals and their honesty! 👍🏼😊",5
14968,Love shopping with the app.,5
14969,Love my new boots!,5
14970,"Lots of great deals, very easy to use.",5
14971,"This has been a great shopping experience everything i have got has been just perfect, i have no complaints read the description and you'll have a great shopping experience",5
14972,Easy to use! Love the app and really enjoying the clothes I have found.,5
14973,Great app. Very easy to navigate,5
14974,"My wardrobe is on point! I would struggle to shop before due to retail prices but ThredUp makes it so easy to save money and get amazing clothes, accessories and shoes. I'm running out of space to put everything. ThredUp please consider selling men's clothes as well because my hubby is jealous of all the deals I get.",5
14975,"It was easy, great",5
14976,Love Thred Up!,5
14977,Love it!! You can find amazing deals on new and like new clothes. I have never been disappointed and have been shopping with ThredUp for years. I highly recommend to everyone!!,5
14978,I love this app!,5
14979,This is easy and fun,5
14980,Love being able to send my items in for free an I love it when one sells! Then I can buy more,5
14981,Live the filter criteria. Allows me to find exactly what I want.,5
14982,I've had great finds through this app and have been happy with almost all my purchases. Returns are easy. My only complaint was that I reached out with a question to confirm shipping labels and never received a response.,4
14983,Not very good for the plus size women,3
14984,"Very good clothing app, has a different styles of clothing and very easy to use.",4
14985,Selection of clothes are terrible completely worthless,1
14986,I have purchased multiple pieces from ThredUp and I am so excited! There app is super easy to use and has great features to save your style searches! I highly recommend!,5
14987,I am so happy with my purchases. I love the experience,5
14988,Clothes are in good quality but shipping takes too long. 3 stars only for the shipping,3
14989,Love it!,5
14990,"Great app! Wish there were more pictures on items like purses, wallets, etc so we could see the interior (pockets, etc). Otherwise, wonderful, affordable, shopping experience!",4
14991,"I really like the ThredUp business model, have bad success both selking and buying items. The app works; i like the filtering capability when searching and the ability to save searches. Have had some difficulty filtering to two or more categories and when trying to edit searches it is a little buggy and doesn't always save edits. I do wish the zoom capability was better and the products had more detailed descriptions, but that is feedback for the service, not the app itself. Overall recommend!",4
14992,Prices are high for kids cloths. Brand shoes are on sale new at the store are the same price. I am a bargain hunter.,1
14993,Slow shipping.,4
14994,Love it..easy to find favorite brand's,5
14995,awesome.,5
14996,First I LOVE shopping resale items. I am truly addicted!! I had heard of ThredUP but never tried. Came up on my feed and I thought what the heck!? OMG I love it!! I found two cocktail dresses and two evening clutches for UNBELIEVABLE prices! I have NEVER purchased a named brand purse EVER!! Well I just did on thredUP!!! MY VERY FIRST COACH PURSE EVER!! Thank you to the thredUP family!!! Love love ❤️,5
14997,Love being able to buy slightly used or new clothes. I have always been a thrift store shopper so this is perfect for me. Now I just need to stop looking everyday before I spend way too much money. Lol,5
14998,Great app for secondhand clothing!,5
14999,Love it!,5
15000,Love this! It's easy to use and a great way to get rid of old clothes and help to afford to buy new ones!,5
15001,"It's really helpful that it shows what came out of your cart as I often go back and buy it! Also the like feature. I love how you can sort by brands and filter. This is really helpful. Love that you can sort not only by size, but color, embellishment ect. Also, the app makes it super easy to find out where your shipment is. I showed it to 2 friends and they were really impressed by the app too. I would like if in the 'suggestions based on what's in you cart' were size appropriate.",5
15002,"Love it. I do wish I could rearrange my favorites or filter them, but overall very happy.",5
15003,Never used it,5
15004,"This makes thrifting super easy, especially when it comes to brands and sizes you're familiar with. My only gripe is that sometimes it's hard to see how the clothes actually look on the forms, and it leaves a lot of items looking drab or bulky or lanky.",4
15005,GOOD PRICES,5
15006,"Addicted! This app is so easy to use! Handy search functions, easy back and forth navigation, makes it too easy to shop!!!",5
15007,"I just received a ton of polka dot boxes and bags yesterday! It was so fun going through everything I ordered!! Almost everything was true-to-size. A few were brands I wasn't familiar with, and their idea of plus size is obviously askew. My advice, stick with the brands you're familiar with and check the measurements in the description!!! One major complaint is hyper wrinkly photos. Please steam out those wrinkles to make your photos look more appealing. Search engine can be a bit wonky.",4
15008,Clothes are in great condition! Great price,5
15009,Thredup is a scam. They give you pennies for brand new clothes then turn around and sell them for at least 5x what they gave you. Save yourself the pain and have a garage sale or sell on Facebook.,1
15010,Great clothes and discounts on name brands!,5
15011,Love it! Great clothes. Great prices!,5
15012,Can't really even give you one star. No customer service and no order being shipped after 10 business days! Nope! I'm done before I even got started!!,4
15013,Makes shopping easy and fun,5
15014,Love to sell my high end stuff and het something new its like a sister hood of the traveling wardrobe lol,4
15015,Only app I shop from. Never been disappointed with my purchases.,5
15016,"So much fun, so little time.",5
15017,Great app! Lots of items to chose from and great prices,5
15018,"Great Clothing App! You can buy woman and kids new with tags , like new, gently worn or signs of wear. Great deals. My favorite is the goody box! If u want name brand designer(Kate Spade, Michael kors, Marc Jacobs, Versace, etc. And cheaper brands like American Eagle, Hollister, etc.) Clothes shoes handbags accessories go to this app or website. You won't be dissapointed. Best clothing app ever!",5
15019,Love this app its where all my extra money goes keep up the great work will always shop here,5
15020,"App issue resolved quickly after I posted about the problem. I'd like to see more filter options to help with the overwhelming amount of clothing. Sleeve length on dresses would be helpful, for instance.",4
15021,Everything I have ordered I loved..Service delivery is fast..I love thredup,5
15022,"Love that I can shop for my specific brand sizes, save money, and feel envionmentally aware by buying second hand! The app is easy to use and saves me to much time.",5
15023,I literally cant stay off this app! Its dangerously so good 🥰🥰,5
15024,Easy to use with a great filter to help you search for exactly what you are looking for.,4
15025,As a reseller this app is by far the easiest outlet to get rid of the excess clothing i cant sell. Good way to still get something (money) out of otherwise donated(no money) clothing.,5
15026,"My thredUP FAVS: High quality supreme condition used & new clothes, 24 hr cart holds so no hogging items, an exhausting amount of clothes, accessories + more to shop, fun deals and discounts, hastle free returns, top trendy styles, easy to shop - for ex: My most favorite thing about the app & online is the amazing ability to scroll your cursor over the item you like & it will flash you the backside of the clothing/item without having to click anything & go back! WOW! Recomend! #1stChoice2ndHand",5
15027,I Would Like to Try It.,4
15028,Very Easy to Use App Great Prices...,5
15029,App is great. Never have any problems. This is my go to store for clothing!,5
15030,"Never disappointed. So easy to navigate, ships on time and great bargins!",5
15031,Things arent listed correctly! The shipping takes forever. I got a pair if jeans that were labeled wrong. I contacted the company VIA email. Never got a respose from anyone!!!!,2
15032,Love the site and the app makes shopping with them so convenient! ♡,5
15033,Good!!!!,4
15034,"Super fun, really easy. Makes me feel a little better about those unnecessary shopping sprees.",5
15035,"Can't get past the opening page, I've tried everything!",1
15036,I love it! Easy to use and they have incredible stuff at great prices!,5
15037,Very easy and enjoyable,5
15038,Very user friendly. Easy to use - makes if fun to shop.,5
15039,Very fun. Challenging sometimes but so many rarities.,5
15040,"Environmental morality, great service, excellent quality, and CHEAP.",4
15041,Great!,5
15042,I bought stuff from here i had to send it back. It was very.. old.. smelly..pricey..then they gave me partial refund of what they promised me and will not speak to me anymore . I will never buy from these people again. I was a good customer..,1
15043,I love this place gently used items with name brand as well.,5
15044,App keeps stopping. Can not search anything.,5
15045,I think this prices are over rated for second hand clouthes. You can go to a therft store buy a whole bag of clouthes for five dollars an plus pick your own stuff new or old alot a people who dont have enough money an work hard look online to find things not out there range i would change the prices bc i just by new clouthes with those prices,1
15046,Reliable and excellent quality every time I've ordered.,5
15047,This app works super well and Thredup has great quality items. I have been bery happy with all my orders.,5
15048,Thredup is a favorite place for me to shop. I enjoy the great prices and being able to make a positive impact on the enviroment.,5
15049,awesome,5
15050,"I love the convenience of thrifting online. There is such a large quantity of items to look through. Therefore this app could be improved if there was a search function to remove what you're not looking for. Ie: no polyester, no sleeveless",4
15051,"I love to wear graphic tees but there are absolutely none on this app, on top of that there's NO MEN SECTION, I like wearing men's tees and this hurts me.",1
15052,"Would you guys PLEASE fix this damn app so that when you get an email of saved searches and click on a specific item in the email, that it actually goes to that item in the app? So sick of missing out on items cause I don't have access to a desktop computer. And yes, I have tried long pressing and telling it to open in the browser and it still won't go there when I'm on my phone.",1
15053,"Edit 10/14/19: Recently no items will load! Disappointing bugs in the updates. ... I love the sorting options that helps me know the condition of the items I'm buying. I've made three purchases, and so far all of the listing information has been accurate. I really appreciate that it tells you the material and care needs of the items as well.",2
15054,"Awesome App and Store. Easy navigation 💞 Purchasing was easy and quick. The quality of the clothes are superb, many items I brought were like NEW for the fraction of the cost. All name brand items with over 50% savings on each item.",5
15055,I love threadUP and the app is easy to use.,5
15056,"The store is great and there is a broad selection of sizes and styles. The app is a huge disappointment. The search feature basically doesn't work. Similarly neither does the filter feature. It can be extremely difficult to look for something even slightly specific like a type of fabric or denim. For example selecting maternity, searching ""jeans"", and filtering for a single brand returns all jeans of that brand not just maternity jeans.",2
15057,I had great luck selling my unused name brand clothing and have been pleased with the items I bought,4
15058,Love your site and your purpose. Great selection. I'm addicted. 💜💜,5
15059,Excelente!!!!!,5
15060,"App is great, no issues. Wish all the items had measutements.",4
15061,"Good, but needs to allow for more specific searches.",4
15062,Love this app!,5
15063,Convenient and pretty good stuff for sale,5
15064,Great website!,5
15065,Overall pretty consistent. It is not at good as their website but still good for browsing. Too bad you can't order a clean out kit. The clean out kits were not available for my home warehouse for months. So... No... They couldn't be ordered through the app or websitec(5/2019-8/2019) The app doesn't always work. Recently (10/2019) it wouldn't show search results. Use the website if you want it to work everytime.,3
15066,Easy and convenient way to buy second hand. I can always find unique items I could never find in the small town I live in.,5
15067,"I'm hooked. I don't ever want to pay full price again, and with Thredup I don't have to.",5
15068,Every order that arrives is on time and beautifully packaged It feels like Christmas every time a box arrives!,5
15069,No men's clothing options.,1
15070,Wonderful customer service and fast shipping.,5
15071,Great prices and I love being able to customize my search. I just wish they would show more than 2 angles sometimes.,4
15072,Great price for quality clothes,5
15073,Best place to shop!,5
15074,Having a lot of issues with the app. I uninstalled it twice and still can't see anything other than favorites. I guess that's a sign I was spending too much.,2
15075,Very user friendly and easy to navigate. Love the favorites feature as well.,5
15076,Fabulous! I'm able to grab what I see quickly especially with highly sought out items!,5
15077,"Items are in great condition, and ship promptly.",5
15078,Excellent shopping!!,5
15079,Putting a time limit of one hour on the items is crazy. Especially when the customer isually shops for what they specifically want or waiting on am item to time out for a chance to get it from another.,2
15080,Love it. It's great.,5
15081,Love this app it has helped me add to my closet without breaking the bank although all too conviently lol,5
15082,"More choices than you need. Very good quality. 1st order- 12 pair of jeans. All fit. I wear all 12 12 shirts. I didn't like 5. All 24 items total cost $62. At $2.50 an item it's ok I took a risk on the shirts. 2nd order- 4 jackets, 8 coats, 1 pair of Dr.Scholl shoes. Love it all! Cost $124./ $9.53 average per item! 3 and 4 order. 5 star store. Very happy shopper. 🏜️🌌🇺🇸😊👏",5

15099,y0u need more merchandice,2
15100,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! Im truly addicted at this point! All the pictures and descriptions are reliable, the clothes are high end but low price, and all the styles are unique since they are secondhand! I love all my clothes that I have gotten and they make the return process as easy and simple as possible! Couldn't ask for more from a company!!",5
15101,"Amazing website & Now I downloaded the app to make it easier! I actually found out about this website through a YouTuber ""JesssFam"", She religiously orders from you guys & She had gotten a code , So I was like why not!? I'll take a look. And I ended up snagging the cutest thigh high boots in great condition, I'm super satisfied with it & They came in the mail relatively quick. About a week. I love them. #ObsessedWithTheBoots and #ThredUp ❤️💯",5
15102,Wonderful first time experience and now a new customer.,5
15103,New update make every unavailable as if nothing is in stock. From specific searches to just selecting activewear under womens. Nothing. Please fix,1

15109,Great products and easy returns,5
15110,Save on your wardrobe with gentle used items. Things you want that you cant find in stores.,5
15111,I love this app great finds and Affirm makes it so easy.,5
15112,"I received my first goody box, and was pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, I'm only keeping one item, which is a scarf, not because I didn't like the items chosen, but because they were I was happy with colors and styles chosen.",5
15113,great buy,5
15114,Flawless online shopping experience!,5
15115,I mean thrift shopping is forever changed for the better with thredup I adore this app,5
15116,Its ok!,4
15117,"The app filters dont work. Ex 1: I was looking for jackets and unchecked 'blazer' and 'denim jacket' from the styles option. I got 8000 results, many of which were blazers and denim jackets! Ex 2: when using the filters to find a green long-sleeved a top,, sometimes i get results for long sleeved tops, long sleeved green tops, and green tops. Other times I might actually get results for what I'm looking for. Get it together, guys. Also, the photo quality is awful. You can't see any details!",2
15118,Love shopping here wait for the packages daily.😆,5
15119,They find a way to keep all your money. Sent full bag of pretty much brand new clothing and they kept a few out of it and my payour is between $.27 cents to $2.00 when they are selling something for almost $20. Not worth sending clothing sale on facebook yourself. If you want to get somw mkney out of good clothing,1
15120,Poor quality.,1
15121,Their clothes are wonderful to be second hand. The items look brand new and there are no smells. I've sent the send $10 get$10 to all my family and friends. I just ordered a red leather coach wristlet... can't wait🤗,5
15122,I'll never shop for clothes any place else...,5
15123,Best shopping app I have found in a while,5
15124,"I love thredup and the app is usually way easier and faster to navigate than just using the browser, but I've noticed that the app doesn't let you filter shoes by style. Idk if this is just a problem for me but the only way for me to look at specific types of shoes is by going into the browser because the app is just tedious.please fix the shoe search!",4
15125,"Good way to shop. I just wish they gave you credit for the items you sent them. They demand new or like new ""donations.""",5
15126,I love thredUP! It's really easy to navigate and shop the app. They ship quickly and everything is packaged so nicely.,5
15127,I have great success with this site! I highly recommend it!!,5
15128,Easy and fun to search for clothes,5
15129,Great,5
15130,Really wish you could get more pictures and ask seller questions,4
15131,"Descriptions not always thorough, some clothes badly wrinkled. Could show the inside of purses & wallets, spread out scarves to show the pattern. Sizes not always accurate. But overall a fun shopping experience & good return policy.",4
15132,"Watch what you buy, just received a sweater that said excellent condition, that had several snags and two actual holes! Stuff now arrives crushed in a bag instead of boxes. At times the description is inaccurate. This site is going down hill 😡",2
15133,Fun,5
15134,"Great prices, easy to use and navigate, love it!",5
15135,"Love this app, some things are a little pricey but it's fun to shop.",5
15136,"Customer Service via Chat typically answers after an hour (feels like there is no one anyway). Shipping is slow, from the time you purchased your item took about 2-3 weeks before you receive you it. Item is not really cheap as you can find some other good deals (like Ebay or Amazon) for the same price.",2
15137,Excellent place to buy clothes new and used clothing.,5
15138,Most the clothes I'm seeing i can get on sale with my coupons at the store for a lower Price than on thred up. I don't think I'll be purchasing any time soon.,2
15139,No problems. Everything is as described!! Love it.,5
15140,"Cannot cashout, cannot reset pw unless you uninstall app",1
15141,"My first two purchases went great so I recently made a third of dress pants. It was sent from three different states. Two of the three packages arrived with the pants covered in dog hair. I'm not sure why they were accepted to sell in the first place. It was disgusting. The measurements of all three are wrong on the length. They need to state short, regular, or long in the description. Also one pair stated shortest in the listing of all was actually the longest. I am extremely disappointed.",1
15142,I just received the 1st shipment from my 1st order. I couldn't be happier with the items I've received & their condition. I plan on continuing to purchase from ThredUp. I also invited my friends to try it.,5
15143,Love it♥️♥️,5
15144,Yes the payback is low. But they do all the work.,5
15145,"Amazing! I have been able to donate clothes, sell clothes,& find great deals at fractions of what it would normally cost. Love it!",5
15146,Love it! Great service,5
15147,Luxury Consignment = Absolute Fabulousness,5
15148,I love thred UP. They have fair prices and great deals. I will shop here often.,5
15149,Love second hand,5
15150,Easy use! Sold several items that I would have probably donated. Website is easy to navigate as a seller and as a buyer!,5
15151,Love it,5
15152,"I sent a clean out bag with clothes that were never worn or worn once. They accepted 11 items and I only got 8 dollars, when I probably spent 100. I get you gotta make a profit but that's ridiculous. Seriously don't use the clean out bags unless your donating clothes.",1
15153,LOVE this app!!!,5
15154,"If something doesnt fit, you are gonna be out half of what you paid. I gave 58.00 for 2 dresses that didnt fit. Not even close to being the size stated, and they only refund 30. They charged for restocking, shipping, and didnt refund taxes or something. Better off buying from a store that offers free returns and exchanges.",1
15155,Awesome! I don't know why I waited so long to try this app! Very pleased with the prices and the quality of the clothing!,5
15156,Love this app! My only reccomendation is i hope the search functions can become more nuanced and specific. Like rompers and jumpsuits are similar but I dont want to look at rompers if im only looking at jumpsuits. Additionally backless and strapless should be a filter option,4
15157,Amazing first experience! Fast shipping Great products,5
15158,"App does not apply filters I have set to my searches. Cannot search key words to find styles or genres of clothing, making it difficult to navigate through all the grandma clothing to find something worthwhile.",2
15159,"It won't even let me view the site without requiring an email or Amazon profile. Why would I give my personal information away and open myself to be spammed without even seeing how good their services are first? You lost my business instantly. If you're going to refuse me access except with conditions, I'll just delete the app immediately.",1
15160,Great,5

15181,"I like how the app is laid out and it looks nice. However, I think the search tool needs a little improvement.",4
15182,"First order. Items look nice in app, hope they look the same when shipped. Will follow up after receiving items.",5
15183,I waited for a couple purchases before writing a review. I am very impressed with everything I have purchased. Prices are good. I have never had to contact anyone because of not getting a item or having a wrong item. I have made 4 purchases so far and as long as nothing changes I will be making more.,5
15184,Nice clothes,5
15185,Love to shop on ThredUp. It's easy and the shipping has been fast!!,5

15187,App is great for searching.,5

15190,Love this app,5
15191,Nice stuff and cheep..love it,5
15192,"Great app! Good prices, great quality & selection.",5
15193,I sent a huge bag of clothes and shoes that was at least worth 200.00 and i get 3.00 for cash out REALLY! I understand you guys have to come up on some $$ but give the seller at least a 3rd of the value of the clothes they sent you. Then in return you sell the item for 3xs the amount,1
15194,I've always loved thredUP! Great app! Easy to use & GREAT customer support!!!,5
15195,This app is amazing. I'm on it everyday!,5

15198,"Very friendly user interface!! Navigating through the website to find exactly what I need was very easy, made my shopping experience that much better. Geat app 👍🏽",5
15199,"I have been set against online clothes shopping because a lot of things just don't fit me right and I always had to try clothes on before buying. However, with this app I am learning the exact material, brands, and dimensions that work best for me and if I make a mistake, they make it really simple to return. I also like that they make it very clear when you are looking at clothes that are not returnable. I'm hooked! My one suggestion is to make dimensions like inseam or length filter able.",5
15200,❤❤❤,5
15201,I hate this app had money supposedly to buy clothes but You have to spend more money on the check out,1
15202,Lots of good finds. Some really great prices.,5
15203,Fun to shop. Easy to use filters but haven't found a way to save filters other than sizes. LOTS of clothing options and appreciate putting them in your cart for up to 24 hours to save them.,5
15204,"Great items, no waste! As clothing is one of the most toxic items which end up in land fills all over the world, you'll feel good about your purchase!",5
15205,Can. Not. Beat. It.,5
15206,I love thredUP it's a great way to make money and clean out your closet.,5
15207,No men's section???? Ridiculous!,1
15208,I love using thread up,5
15209,"Love thredUP, it's been here for 10 years, but I just discovered it. 10 years should tell anyone it's great, but I can help with that. I've placed 2 orders so far. Everything I've gotten has fit perfectly & was exactly what it said it was.I like that you can go through, put items as your favorite, in the end you can go through the stuff you've chosen & see what you have.Also you can filter price, color, etc. If you haven't shopped yet give it a chance I have a feeling you'll be happy you did",5
15210,Love that building a better wardrobe can be done in an eco-responsible way.,5
15211,I love shopping here ❤❤❤,5
15212,Love this site. I reccomend it to my friends!,5
15213,"Lots of styles and prices. Items have all details, colors, sizes, and manufacture. Can't wait to see my first order !!!",5
15214,Got a lot of nice things for a nice price. It's fashion on a budget.,5
15215,The app is okay but it's very buggy. I wish you could use the feature to see items in other people's carts like you can online.,3
15216,It has all that you want and it is just seeing what is new,5
15217,Giving 5 ... Best shopping app ever..!!,5
15218,"Good experience so far, excellent prices and quality is great.",4
15219,Things stay in carts tooo long!,5
15220,"My daughters and I love ThredUp. Great clothes, even better prices!",5
15221,"Love thred up, but it's hard to search for things. Maternity clothes in particular.",3
15222,"Really? Is it me, or is it not possible to set up an account on this app or the website? I'm asked to enter an email address. Then I see down below the option to sign up, but there aren't any fields for me to set up a password, etc. Not a good first impression. How can I set up a login.",1
15223,So far have been pleased!,5
15224,"Generally good but the ""use clothing"" can be ratty",3
15225,Love it! Saving money and keeping in fashion.,5
15226,Good fashions,5
15227,"Wish it had better sorting, hard to find what I'm looking for!",3
15228,So addicted im a daily looker,5
15229,Can't believe this is such a rip off i actually saw a item that almost $300 are you really kidding me I'm going to buy anything from this place all the prices for the clothes I like in my size a full price what I would get at a regular store Sweatshop here I wish I can get it at under a star by half a store or less,1
15230,ThredUP has changed my life!!! I absolutely Love shopping with this company 😍,5
15231,Incredible experience shopping with thredup!,5
15232,Love it,5
15233,I love thrift shopping and ThredUp makes it easy to find EXACTLY what I'm looking for at the best possible price. Every time I get the cut little polka dot box in the mail it feels like Christmas. They've helped me find almost half my closet over the years!,5
15234,Excellent! Bear in mind you are buying used most of the time and read the descriptions carefully but there are really great deals to be had. Just bought a $350 Etienne Aignier bag in perfect condition for $45. Can't beat that!,5
15235,LOVE!,5
15236,"Well, I learned my lesson and will never sell my clothes here again. I sent them probably $700 -$1000 of stuff, most of it still with tags. I knew that I was going to take a serious loss since some of my clothes were used, and they are all being sold at a discounted cost but I didn't realize what ThreadUP was going to take as their cut!! For the clothes that I sent them, I was only going to receive between 6% and 37%, that means that they were going to keep between 94% and 63%.",1
15237,The amount of merchandise can be very overwhelming at first! I love that there is a section devoted to Juniors' sized clothing. And that they have such a large inventory made it so easy to find my size and inseam! For shirts and dresses it's also very helpful that they list measurements along with the sizes.,5
15238,"Not just the app but thredUP in general is a very cool way to shop affordable good quality clothes. And I have to say, I fin it easier to navigate here in the app than in the webpage.",5
15239,Friendly search,5
15240,Love this app. Could do a little better with filters but definitely improved and easy to use!,5
15241,"Thredup is fine to purchase from, just watch their pricing, sometimes you can get the item they are selling for cheaper elsewhere. You can get some pretty cool stuff on final sale pricing. I do not recommend sending your stuff to them to sell, the payout percentage is basically pennies on the dollar, of course they get a huge cut for you sending stuff for free to them for example a 15.99 jacket listed to sell you'll get only 1.92 you're better off selling it yourself.",3
15242,So far size of clothing purchased has been inaccurate !!,2
15243,Wonderful found a fall shirt for 3.99 free shipping,5
15244,Tired of places not catering to mens clothes seems sexiest not fair and the fact that they have a boys selection but no mens are men not relivant in todays society,1
15245,Xoxo,5
15246,Easy app to navigate,5
15247,Love this app! It's insane!!,5
15248,Found an assortment of clothes in my size and price. Love it.,5
15249,This place is a Rip off....... It suppose to be like a second store were you can fine us thing for less and the only thing I saw was regular price that you can fine with brand new clothes And good items 👎.......not worth to spend my money..,1
15250,Aersome,5
15251,Loveeeeee,5
15252,Fantastic selections and quality clothes.,5
15253,love the concept and getting better all the time,4
15254,Great.,5
15255,So far so good,4
15256,I love this app and company! So much so that I wrote a blog about it: redheadinlove dot com,5
15257,A wonderful site with beautiful clothes that are affordable.,5
15258,"Enjoy thrifting designer brands for pennies on the dollar....so far, everything I've purchased has been in excellent condition!",5
15259,"The app works really well, I've never had a problem with it. I wish it were searchable by waist size (for bottoms) but that's a small issue. This is my favorite used-clothes app.",4
15260,Love it. both ways!,5
15261,Great options for kids!,5
15262,"I'd love to have more narrowing seech options. And be able to browse shoe categories. Currently the app does not have subcategories for shoes, also does not have any subcategories like cardigans, blazers, jumpsuits, etc.",4
15263,Easy to use,5
15264,Only for women!,1
15265,I've now ordered twice from Thredup and loving this company. Website works pretty well. Search chooks use some important but not terrible. Easy returns. Great pricing seems all the clothes have been in really great condition.,4
15266,"Women? Check! Boys? Check! Girls? Check! Men! SOL! Could someone please tell the owners that they left out a small demographic, ummm maybe men??",1
15267,Always interesting - clothes forsale have all been in good condition.,5
15268,I wish we could hold our items in our carts for 24 hrs instead of 12 and some prices are a little high. I haven't received my first order yet but it's on the way. Otherwise I do enjoy shopping secondhand here. It's a user friendly app with plenty of perameters to narrow down your search so you can find exactly what you're looking for. There is a vast selection to choose from and just about every category to do with shopping for ourselves.,5
15269,Really enjoying shopping for new or excellent condition name brand work items at a fraction of the cost! Everything I received has been awesome. Highly recommend.,5
15270,Great App!!!,5
15271,I enjoyed the app,5
15272,Best Thrift Shop Ever!! Always finding Gems!!,5
15273,Great app,5
15274,"Extremely disappointed in the selling process... brand new clothes and my pay out is less than a dollar on most items? Only ""accepted"" 8 items out of a full bag of nice clothes. NOT WORTH IT. I would much rather give to a local clothing drop off for those that need them and will do so in the future.",1
15275,ThreadUPhas adorable clothing i want to shop for ladies petite,4
15276,"SHOP LOCAL... Everything is priced a bit too high, I mean really, a forever21 dress for full price?? Hmmm no thank you, I can probably find it on clearance inside the store. WASTE OF TIME EVEN DOWNLOADING",1
15277,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!! Lots of great high-end items that are really reasonably priced! Easy app to use and problem free!!!",5
15278,"I was overcharged my very order, dissatisfied that you would take from me when I'm trying to give to you.",1
15279,I was very pleased with selection and prices.,5
15280,soo many items to choose from my favorite brands easy check out,5
15281,Great filter capability and selection! The site's search capacity isn't great and sometimes the cart function doesn't work.,4
15282,"It just kept forcing me to sign into Amazon. I tried closing the browser, and it would re-open the sign in page. I would have rather chose a different option for a login, but it would never let me select what I want. I caved eventually and attempted to enter my sign-in information and it would not allow me past the permission page. It would redirect back to the app and immediately open the permission page again in an endless loop. I gave up and uninstalled it.",1
15283,I like the idea. No men's clothes tho?,2
15284,Sale prices never seem to reflect when purchasing. Frustrated buyer.,1
15285,Love it!!,5
15286,Its easy to use. Fun to shop.,5
15287,"I love thredUP, & I'm definitely a loyal shopper. I'm usually very happy with my items, & if not, I return them for credit & try something else instead! I've gotten some amazing bargains & some one-of-a-kind items as well as great wardrobe basics. I've had a few small issues recently- I ordered a cami listed as black but arrived navy- actually had 2 small items in that order ship a different color than listed. Both items were final sale but very inexpensive and good quality so not a big deal.",5
15288,I love thredUP. High quality & good prices. I buy 75% of my clothes on this site now.,5

15302,Very easy to use app. I'm also very satisfied with my purchases.,5
15303,"I love second hand stores, and hate shopping. This app makes purchasing clothing so easy, carefree, and keeps me out of stores. This is the greatest app/idea ever!",5
15304,My friends always envy my outfits even more so when I tell them how much I got them for lol,5
15305,"It's a convenient way to get rid of clothes, but if you're trying to make a quick buck this is not the place. They give you the smallest percentage of what your item sells for, which they dont even keep up for that long and if your items don't sell you have to buy them back.",2
15306,Love my second hand clothes,5
15307,Accurate descriptions of quality and size measurements. Will definitely be checking back often. Great packaging too.,5
15308,I love thredup and the app is super user friendly. It allows me to stay up-to-date on new promo codes.,5
15309,"I submitted 2 pairs of almost brand new Polo Jean's and never got confirmation that they were recieved, listed or even sold. I deleted the app and gave up. This site is a scam. They will steal your stuff, sell it and keep the money. You have no way of proving that they even recieved it.",1
15310,Love this idea,5
15311,Love love love this site!!,5
15312,"You can't get accurate search results. You put in what sizes you wear and select an item and the size description is entirely different. To the reply: thanks for replying, when I shop on line in stead of a n&m I'm there to buy and not be listed away I know some people wander not 1000 things of what you don't want is over marketing if you don't understand brands and sizing then just about profit not customer Thank you. I ?? Why couldn't I reply without changing my rating????",2
15313,Thread up has great stuff and they can be excellent. When they get busy it can be a challenge to get questions answered all in all so good for the planet,4
15314,Very good!,5
15315,Awesome quality for even better prices,4
15316,So easy to use and great notifications.,5
15317,"Nothing for men, can you say- Instant Delete!",1
15318,"I have only heard bout Thred Up App about 2 months ago, but it is truly amazing! Everything that I have purchased has been great to excellent quality. I had 1 issue arise and the only negative thing is, there isnt a ""live"" person you can actually talk to about a possible ""stressful"" issue! There are chats and emails.They specifically say there isnt a phone number to call in and speak with someone. They do however, return emails within a 24 hour window in most cases. I would definitely recommend!",4
15319,Choose used!,5
15320,Great way to clean out your closet!,5
15321,Beautiful like new items,5
15322,Love thredup and everything about it. App is easy to use. Products are great. Just wish shipping were always free and faster. But overall love this store!,5
15323,Awesome shopping experience I've found alot of unique and really good items on this website for really affordable prices. I've also cleaned out my closet by ordering a Clean Out Kit which they have bought several of my items as well. I really enjoy this website I am so fortunate to have found it.. Check it out you won't be disappointed my husband wishes they had stuff for men maybe in the future,5
15324,Love the selection!,5
15325,Awesome,5
15326,Excellent,5
15327,Easy and fun shopping!! Love my favorite brands at great prices. Great online thrifting!,5
15328,Pretty easy to navigate. Just wish there were more search options.,4
15329,It's super easy to shop!,5
15330,"I absolutely love thredUP & I'm recommending it to everyone! They have an extensive assortment of clothes & accessories, from casual to designer. They're specific about flaw descriptions items have (if any) & there's lots brand new inventory too. I've had a couple of issues but their customer service is fabulous! My only critique- slow app that closes at times, some mislabeled items & the metadata (which is great) doesn't necessarily stay in your size. But I give it 5 stars for sure! Love it!",5
15331,Nice shopping app😀,5
15332,Fantastic buys!,5
15333,Everything was as described or even better. Items were packaged well and neatly folded. Sizes were accurate. I will be ordering again.,5
15334,My favorite thing about the app is that even if I buy from different sellers it's still one shipping fee!,5
15335,"I was skeptical at first, but now this has become one of my got-to sites! I look forward to see what kind of new things I can find as their inventory is always changing.",5
15336,Good,5
15337,Awesome deal high quality,5
15338,Im still on the fence. I enjoy buying for my kids but i sent a huge amount of new clothes in and have o ly made $3.00. These were $90.00 dresses with tags. I may not be seeling anythong through them again.,1
15339,I love this app! I love their mission to help others.,5
15340,This app is amazing. ThredUp has really helped me to find one-of-a-kind pieces with great prices. The items always arrive in better quality than anticipated and the return policy is great. I have also been able to clean my own closet and know I am giving to an organization that recycles.,5
15341,I just love this app. I have no idea what I would do without it,5
15342,Great deals! Nice stuff. Love it! 😊,5
15343,If I could give this 0 stars I would! Products listed as in excellent condition and come with holes. Of course something that can't be returned.,1
15344,"Excellent idea for recycling, prices can be a bit high for used clothing but, overall a very worthwhile endeavor and value",4
15345,Love the clothing measurements included. Would be nice to be able to interact with the seller more or have more details included. Otherwise a great experience.,4
15346,Great App and cheap way to buy brands. Purchased lots from the app and they have coupons regularly to save even more!,5
15347,I love there clothes and I love it how u can order and make goody boxes,5
15348,The only improvements I would suggest are a back button from cart to previous screen & sometimes descriptions are not as good as others on the item. Some will have details of color & accuracy in measurements & fabric details and others don't. Processing takes too long.I have recommended this app to lots of people because I love it! I love the ability to buy quality clothing with plenty of options at price points in my budget. Thrifting at its best online. I would like to see a loyalty program.,4
15349,This app works well. I wish the descriptions were more specific when possible and I would like to know how many results I'm searching through without scrolling back to the top. I am satisfied and usually find what I'm looking for.,4
15350,Ok hard to find your size,4
15351,Great app!!,5
15352,"Every time I order, the website is fast and easy to use. Orders arrive in a timely manner. And it feels like Christmas when I open the boxes, all wrapped in polka dot tissue paper. Thanks Thredup.",5
15353,This just the best app! I love it because u can get thrifted items without having to leave my home!,5
15354,"Easy to use app, fast delivery with easy returns",5
15355,No mens clothes..,1
15356,Clothes are in great condition. Fast shipping.,5
15357,"I order ""closet clean-out"" bags 2-3 times a year to keep my wardrobe manageable. Then, I use my ThredUp credits for guilt-free shipping. Love it!",5
15358,Love the prices and the clothes. Have bought for myself and my daughters and have not been disappointed. Returns are super easy too!,5
15359,Great prices and I'm glad to be a part of a process that keeps items from ending up in a landfill.,5
15360,To many ads.you have a hard time getting it off the screen ⁰⁹,3
15361,"Good qaulity products, easy returns. Love all the discounts. Helps environment!!",5
15362,Excellent,5
15363,Shipping took 12 days on an item that was 2 hrs away. Then it was returned for unknown reason. Never again!! I'd rather go to TJMAXX or Nordstrom Rack for discounts.,1
15364,"Love this app, so helpful with little ones, I love being able to clothe everyone at affordable prices and not have to drag everyone out shopping all day",5
15365,Easy and such cute items at just the right price. The system holds your size and preferences so you don't have to keep putting them in.,5
15366,Love the hand bags!,5
15367,Easy convenient way to shop second hand!,5
15368,Very easy to navigate and I can quickly check my sales and shop all in the same app. Love ThredUp!,5
15369,Love shopping used- great prices and better for the environment! The app makes it so easy to do!,5
15370,"Love this app, and all the personalized clothing options",5
15371,So far I am very pleased with the items is have purchased. I ordered four things. First one I would rate 2 outta 5. 2nd one 3 out of 5 and the last two 5 out of 5 stars so I am pretty pleased so far.,5
15372,"Love the app and the clothes. I just think it should just have ""some"" cheaper brands and cheaper prices as well considering the clothes are used and your helping the environment.",4
15373,"I love love love this website. I have never been disappointed with an item or the quality of the clothes. They are always in excellent condition and this site allows me to dress my 5 year old grand daughter like she's 5 instead of 15. Thank you. Update, THREDUP IS GREAT, this app never works for me!! Please fix, it s been saying the update is pending for a month. thx",2
15374,I love cause when they showed it on tv...,4
15375,Bought a dress and shoes for my Birthday...came quick... reasonably priced...will definitely order again,5
15376,Awesome prices and very different type of selection. Can't wait to receive my order.,5
15377,This app is amazing,5
15378,Great prices,5
15379,I LOVE this website. I've loved everything I've purchased. It's to the point that I don't even enjoy going shopping for new clothes anymore.,5
15380,Really good quality at super prices. The filters for searching are the most useful I've seen. I'm a huge fan.,5
15381,I hate shopping. I hate Amazon quality. I love thredup.,5
15382,Awesome!,4
15383,I have sent several bags to thred up and they were nice nearly new things clean and name brand and they only sold a few things i sent but i saw some items for sale that i sent and didnt get credited for and then i bought a pair of shorts that orignal price was 11.99 i bought onsale for 4.99 but still got charged full price,1
15384,Makes shopping really easy and fun!,5
15385,I love this app,5
15386,Lots to choose from. Organized. Great prices.,5
15387,NICE,5
15388,"If I receive a package that has 8 things usually only 3 things fit and the rest goes to donation. I think it's a good concept, but I wish they would give more detail on their clothes. Like it would be nice to know that the Old Navy pants I received had zippers on the side of the hips which I can't wear because my hips are too big. Or that the xhilaration shirt I recieved had arm holes made for a toddler. Overall waste of money for the most part.",1
15389,Total rip off. I lost money. Scam.,1
15390,Great,5
15391,I love this app!! I have changed my whole wardrobr!!,5
15392,I wish you guys would steam the clothes once they're on the mannequins and make them look a little more presentable. But good prices and cute clothes. Thanks.,5
15393,I love everything about ThredUp! So glad you got an app. It makes buying and selling so easy! 💖,5
15394,"Beautiful clothing, most are new, complete with tags. The quality of the cliothing is excellent, like something you would find in an expensive botique. My orders had discount codes that were attached at the end of the simple ordering process. That saved me a lot of money! Thank you! Sincerely, Robin E.",5
15395,I was supposed to get 50% off my first order. I put in the promo code but it didn't take it off......... I should have read the fine print. I will update after I receive my items.,3
15396,"Its s pretty good app, my only comment is it's hard to find the bid option",5
15397,"I am seriously obsessed with this app and company!!! I get great pieces at a great price, and it's better for the environment than buying new. What's not to love?",5
15398,There is no way you will not find something you love on ThredUp. The inventory is so vast that you should definitely use the filters as much as possible to narrow down your search. As a buyer the price points are fair and there is almost always an additional discount available. And I'm all about the recycling of clothes.,5
15399,Great Quality! Great Prices!!!,5
15400,"While I enjoy shopping there, the Clean Out bags are a joke. I sent in several in-style, never worn items (SPANX leggings being one of them) along with a few others. They only processed 3 items, the already worn, cheaper ones, but the nicer stuff is just gone. I feel jipped.",1
15401,I've brought a couple of clothes on here. The first package came fast. The clothes were like brand new!,5
15402,Not Goth friendly at all,1
15403,Variety and style at your fingertips.,5
15404,So AWESOME. BEST DEALS! DESIGNER BRANDS AT SUPER DISCOUNT PRICES,5
15405,"You sell our stuff cheap, all item I brought from your store at your price and you give me 1/3 back ,THAT SUCK.,..but you have a picture of all and when I sent them back I got Nothing in cash back Thread up is a fake and a lie a lot of people figured out this won't last long",2
15406,Love it!!!,5
15407,Love that it brings up my sizes,5
15408,"You guys have the worst customer service. Not a available on weekends, I am trying to delete a saved credit card and I can find no way to do it. I set a purchase up with affirm. Then I choose place order. Nothing happens so I do it again and it then charges to a saved card",1
15409,"I buy all of my work wardrobe and some casual on Thred Up and oh my goodness! I get endless compliments and my wardrobe really feels like ""me"". Unique, and no one else has my same exact pieces. Plus, I am all about ethical fasbipn and textile recycling. LOVE.",5
15410,Awesome site!,5
15411,Love how easy and affordable this is,5
15412,Awesome!,5
15413,I was leary to shop second hand online but my experience made me a ThredUP lover! The app is very user friendly. The deliver was shockingly fast and my box showed up looking very professional. My tops were wrapped in tissue paper and folded neatly. The quality of them was top notch!! Thank you ThredUP!,5
15414,Amazing deals on designer clothing!,5

15420,I've found many great values using thredUp. App is good overall.,4
15421,"Love Thredup, but the search feature is a little goofy. But maybe it's just my phone!",4
15422,Easy to use and great finds!!,5
15423,they have nice things and i am very impress we need this store here at Campcreek Pkwy @ 285 south Atlanta Ga 😀🙂. I love you guy!!!!!🤣😅🤩i am so happy,5
15424,"I loved the variety of name brands. Look forward to getting my new things. Yeah, this was fun",5
15425,Only thing I would say about the app is I get random messages that item is not available but it really is...,5
15426,"Thred Up is a fantastic place to find clothes without having to go shopping, especially if you know what size you wear in what brands",5
15427,Love this store! Great clothes and great customer service!,5
15428,Good,5
15429,Love this app...makes buying a bunch of clothes way too easy though 😂...only downfall is if I want to pay a different way other than paypal it won't let me switch it. I have to buy on my desktop to make that happen.,5
15430,Best place for used clothing,5
15431,Still the best experience! Im in love with the stuff I get and grateful for the return options when i need them!,5
15432,I love the quality of the items and you cannot beat the prices!,5

15437,Just supporting,5
15438,Love the app and the service. There's a lot of merchandise that I buy from thredUP that I wouldn't allow my self to purchase at regular prices. Great service and great bargains! I recommend to friends all the time!,5

15462,Great experience; bag is beautiful; Thank you,5
15463,"Buy only!!!! Do NOT sell! I got a whopping 2.53 for 2 items, 1 brand new, had a brand new pair of Adidas shoes completed rejected. Otherwise my buying experience was good. 5 stars for buying 0 stars for selling average it out rounded up to 3 to be fair I guess.",3
15464,Love this business! I've found so many great items. Couldn't be happier with the quality and pricing. It's now my go to before shopping anywhere else.,5
15465,Order on the 2nd of the month with an now arrival date of the 17th that's ridiculous and I wont shop here again,1
15466,Wonderful and easy to use!,5
15467,Do not use this app if you are wanting to make any money on your clothes...its pennies on the dollar and honestly not even worth wasting my time...I should have just brought it to good will.,2
15468,Addictive 😍,5
15469,"Absolutely the WORST. I had sent in brand new with tags Abercrombie and Fitch clothing size 6. 8 pieces brand new with tags. Paid over $145 for all them, they estimated my total payout $5 for all that. But they're asking $64 for them. Had sent 2 full bags of kids clothing, mostly brand new without tags and never worn, and out of 150+ items, 20 items were accepted. This is a rip off. Never sell clothing to them.",1
15470,I have purchased both women's and kid's clothes from the app and everything has been in great condition! Fun to browse and find new brands I can't buy where I live.,5
15471,"Love designer clothes for the fraction of the price, great service",5
15472,"HUGE rip off if you're trying to make money. I could've gotten much more for my items on Mercari. Also, the expited bag fee is $16.00. The bag still takes over a month to get to you . I guess tbis site is okay if you're just donating, although I wouldn't trust them with that either. They are extremely misleading about telling you that its only consignment. Never again.",1
15473,Great products at discounted prices! Got lots of compliments on the items I've purchased off their website. Love the sales and promo codes too!,5
15474,Wont open,1
15475,Love this site and the prices are cheap n great service.,5
15476,Love thred up!!! Some say im addicted lol,5
15477,"Site was great in the beginning. But now many items have no measurements and it's a chance to order. But then when they don't fit, refund for credit is $1.99 per item. They need to improve.",4
15478,Awesome app,5
15479,Whether new or used they all are in good condition. Look nice & fit great. They are delivered fast which is a plus 😁,5
15480,Where is my 50 percent off 1st order,1
15481,Makes it SO easy to be thrifty!,5
15482,Not men friendly. Boo boo,1
15483,"Always have Huge selection! Everything i have purchased has been better than i amagine!!! They always have a coupon, Everytime i get on app! Love Thred Up!!!!",5
15484,Fun place to shop without going broke!,5
15485,I bought a jumpsuit from Thred Up and when it arrived the button loop on the back was torn off and it has belt loops but it didn't come with a belt. There was no information provided that it was in this condition. Order with caution,1
15486,Love thred up been using it for years never disappointed,5
15487,Love love love thredup,5
15488,It was nice to get some accessories that didnt cost me alot for my up coming events. Thank you,5
15489,I wil Not Recommend this site to know . I can't believe that i only got $4.65 for over 28 idems that were brand new with tags on them if i had known i was getting that little for them you would have never gotten them,1
15490,Found two skirts I have looking for years. Thabk you,5
15491,"Your pay out is a joke, insulting. Bad publicity from me, every chance I get.",1
15492,Found really nice items for work and casual.,5
15493,Hooked I love the app great way to refresh my closet!,5
15494,Only womans clothing whack,1
15495,Fantastic clothes. Top brands at great prices. EZ use website.,5
15496,No men's option,1
15497,Ap is great. Filters good. Good photos. Major problem with Thred Up is that it is overpriced for 2nd hand clothes. Not shopping here anymore.,2
15498,Addicting !!!,5
15499,Love how easy it is to shop,5
15500,Pretty easy to use. I love it.,5
15501,Love it 😍,5
15502,I love Thread up. Great styles for plus size.,5
15503,I can't live without this app,5
15504,"User friendly, wide variety, easy return process!",4
15505,Ordered 4 blouse's and they're perfect!!! Everything came loving packed and on time. Will definitely be a loyal customer!,5
15506,Always good!,5
15507,"Great service, great clothing finds, money saved! Why yes, I am pleased & enjoying thredUP !",5
15508,The app is fine and tbe clothes are fine however their customer service left a lot to be desired and their use of FedEx to ship is the most infuriating thing I've experienced. An order I've placed with them has done nothing but go back and forth between two of their distribution centers.,1
15509,"All you people are getting Ripped Off! The SAME items NEW, Not Used, scuffed etc. You can buy Buy New clothes, same brand, but LESS $$! I finally went downloaded it to see if I could save anything. You guys charge way too Much!",1
15510,Easy to use and upfront about what the is offered,5
15511,"I get to add interest , flare & style to my wardrobe. Thred up is the best thing thats happened since the California closet! In my opinion.",5
15512,Not worth your time. They claim to have standards but reject items with tags and keep stained clothing. I tested this by sending in an item with issues and they listed it but rejected several brand new pieces. The payouts are pennies but the fees for everything stack up. They falsely describe items to bring down the price and effect your chances of selling items. Should you be lucky enough to get a hold of customer support they'll stop responding if you ask too many questions. Or end the chat,1
15513,I enjoy the options of clothes and designers that they have!,4
15514,Love the clothes and accessories I get. They fit just right,5
15515,I tried to give clothes to them but I have to wait for the bag. The shipping panel was created 8-12 and it is now 9-5. I'm over the waiting and I'll just give my old clothes to goodwill.,1
15516,"Horrible site. I sent in a full bag, over 40 items and what they did sell they gave me .16-.20 cents for items.....At the end of it all they said I owe them $4.00......lol Every other site ive used I listed maybe 10 items and actually made from $18.00 to $125.00 off my clothes. Why would anyone use this app/site.",1
15517,Overpriced. You can get better deals on new items shopping the actual store sites online. Also don't make anything when they sell your stuff. Not worth it.,2
15518,Love this store,5
15519,Ordered many items from Thredup. Returned a few. Hassle free. There is a restocking fee but worth it to make me satisfied. So far I am very happy with Thredup after roughly 15 shipments!,5
15520,"I love being able to buy nice brands secondhand that are actually wearable. I love even more that I can return anything. I will say that you have to apply every filter to avoid having to go through 900+ items to find what you're looking for, but they make that easy, too.",5
15521,There an outstanding company. Great prices and amazing Condition,5
15522,Great place to shop cheap,5
15523,To expensive for hemi downs. Some of the shoes are ruined and even tho they are name brand not worth the money,1
15524,I love this app i recommand it,5
15525,Love thred up! There are so many choices.,5
15526,Love it,5
15527,So many great options!,5
15528,Love thread up!,5
15529,Great! Super easy to use and great prices.,5
15530,Was kinda scared to order from the site of course because other sites say excellent condition on items only for you to receive it looking like its 10 years old. But I gave it a try and WOW ! Ordered a Vera Bradley purse and it was in absolutely perfect condition! You would seriously think it was brand new. Came within a day of when it said it would. So my first but not last experience with thredup was wonderful! I recommend this site to anyone who loves great things at a great price. Thanks !,5
15531,"I love shopping with thredUP, they have a vast collection of clothing for everyone's style and taste for reasonable prices:)! I buy a lot of my daughter's clothes on thredUP and save a great deal of money! The quality is exceptional as well:)!!",5
15532,"I have ordered once. Handbag was delivered on August 27th but missing the long over shoulder or crossbody strap. I have emailed support and sent a chat and have heard nothing for several days. The item was advertised as non-returnable; however, as I did not get the item pictured in its entirety, I believe an adjustment should be made or allow me to return for refund. Very disappointed. UPDATE...Received response from customer service and return authorized. Hope refund comes through. Will post.",2
15533,My first 2 bags I got a good price.. BUT my next 2 bags one was under $10.00 and they last was 0.00 So yes I want be using them anymore..,1
15534,"I sent in a huge bag of great items and got 8.00 for all of it. Then they charge quite a bit for used clothing, only two pictures of the item and sometimes a very poor description of the item. Then you have to pay shipping. You will also wait a while for it to get to you. I just donate my clothes now and am better off at the goodwill.",2
15535,"Love Thred up! Great selections in plus size. Great prices, great quality!",5
15536,Advertised on Words with Friends bought new with tags and almost new. Open app and it's used clothes.,1
15537,Awesome,5
15538,Great idea I just don't like the way things are set up.,2
15539,"I like the reduced pricing on name brand items and the goody boxes are awesome! However, I did the clean out kit and it was the worst experience. I sent in probably 15 items, and they accepted 6. Of the 6, my expected payout on consignment was $9.55. However, if the person that buys the item uses a discount or coupon code, your earnings on the item is reduced. So 4 out of 6 have sold and I'm getting 80 cents. Some of the items were even brand new with tags. Very disappointed in this.",3
15540,"I get popups from this app that won't go away even after uninstalling. I don't like this app, I don't want their popups",1
15541,"Love this, so much fun and great stuff!!",5
15542,I might lower this when I recieve my order. But it took them 2 days to pack 1/3 of my order. Who knows how long it will take them to pack the rest. Maybe they are selling stuff that they dont have??,2
15543,Love ThredUp!,5
15544,Love it! Only wish I got paid more for my items that I've sold.,5
15545,I love everything that I purchused. Most were true to size except one outfit. Lovely items.,5
15546,"I really appreciate that now when returning to shop more, I am returned to the spot where I left, instead of back to the beginning. Would've been a 5 star review, but there are still many items that are missing actual sizes in inches, ie: 38"" bust. Sizes in so many brands vary greatly! Without the actual size I have to pass on many items ( I hate the hassle of returning!).",4
15547,Fun easy to navigate,5
15548,I highly don't recommend sending any items to them. This company is horrible and a scam. You send them clothes and they make you think you will make some money but you won't. Your profit is almost nothing. Your profit will be about 5%. You would be better of donating your items to a charity.,1
15549,"No Customer Service. I used to love them. Until i placed an order and IMMEDIATELY realized its shipping to an old address in another state. I have no way to update the address. No way to change it. I called, automated message told me i HAVE to email. I emailed. Automated message told me they wont get to my email for a week. I understand this is how they keep prices low. But i just wasted $40. They dont even have the ability for me to cancel the order while its still in processing.",1
15550,The clothes i habe ordered actually fot me very good. Its amazimg. Check it out,5
15551,Found gorgeous dresses so cheap. Went to buy 1 but checked out with 5. Im so happy,5
15552,Absolutely love Thredup I am always satisfied with my box,5
15553,Great deals and user friendly!,5
15554,The checkout process is terrible. Not one but 2 orders that I have placed had issues with the discount not being applied even though I had entered it prior to clicking the submit button. Their policy is that they cannot retroactively apply the discount. Now I wait for my refund. My time is too precious to mess with this app anymore. Hopefully they will fix the problem so the next person doesnt waste their time. I will delete my account and uninstall this app.,1
15555,"Get great, brand name shoes, clothing aaaaand more for pennies on the dollar. On the flip side, if you're looking to sell your clothing, shoes, etc., and you want big bucks for your stuff, then you might want to use another app first and try to sell it there. I've sold stuff on ThredUp, more so just to earn a credit (you'll get more that way) and make room in my closet. Thank you Thred Up for helping to save the planet! ♻️🌎♻️",5
15556,"prices arent great, some are more than retail. if you plan to ship clothes to them know that it will take a LONG time to get there. i shipped a bag and it took 3 WEEKS to get there, ridiculous. your payout is gonna be insanely low. most of mine were maybe 50 cents, quite a rip off for what they actually sell your piece of clothing for. then if you have your unselled clothes returned, it magically takes only 3 to 4 days. i will stick to poshmark over this. horrible consignment.",1
15557,Awesome 👍 thrift store 👍,5
15558,Great app. Very convenient. Works well.,5
15559,I received my first order and was very excited to see my top perfectly fit. I will continue to shop with high expectations,5
15560,"It's better than the plain site, faster. The search engine can use some work, and the info provided on clothing needs to be more consistent. I'd like to see basic measurements for every article of clothing, and side pictures of garments.",4
15561,Great new option for clothes.,5
15562,I just love them! I shop it every month!,5
15563,Awesome,5
15564,"I love this app so much. I dont always buy stuff, sometimes i just enjoy scrolling through and looking for great finds. It's the thrill of looking through a thrift store without dealing with crowded racks and other questionable things (from my experience). There are a LOT of high end items too! So stoked to use this :) and as someone who is trying to live more sustainably, I've been buying all my cute clothes second hand, thanks to thredUP!",5
15565,Awesome app,5
15566,Not for me not much in my sizes,1
15567,"I love everything about thredup. I joined on the advice of my mom and i am so glad i did. I recently lost weight and i am using this to supplement my wardrobe as i continue to lose. Cute clothes, excellent options for shipping and bundling. Found the purse of my dreams for about a quarter of what it retails for.",5
15568,"ThredUp has great clothes for great prices. Most are even returnable if necessary. However some clothes do not fit the sizing they are given, and it can be challenging to find during course every time.",4
15569,"More pictures are needed for items because prices are high and I want to know what I am buying, now you have restocking fee??? Do better with pictures and try to get wrinkles out of clothes xpecially if you want 50 bucks for it. Handbags need inside pic. No way I'm buying a purse without seeing inside!!+",3
15570,you won. I'm dead,5
15571,Not enough info in clothing descriptions. Otherwise it's mostly all right.,3
15572,Excellent,5
15573,"Fun to check out all the items and looking for mark downs, promotions and special prices. Great way to clean out your closet.",5
15574,Love it,5
15575,"Great to sell, and awesome deals. Fast and easy to sell, and receive",5
15576,Just love it!,5
15577,Love this!! I have overhauled my wardrobe buying and selling here! Easy and fun!!,5
15578,amazing...so easy to shop,5
15579,"threadUP offers a one of a kind, great shopping experience! It allows you to customize your search to find high quality pieces of clothing at a fraction of the cost! I'll definitely be back!",5
15580,"I buy and return things frequently and have never encountered a problem. Love that you can see other things from the same seller. Update: app still good. Prices have gone up, they charge a restocking fee now and you can't comment on the clothes. I would like to read why others returned their items and I would like to tell people why I returned stuff. E.g., way low cut clothes dont always appear so.",5
15581,"Sent clothing, nice clothing. They offer you pennies but if you look for your clothing they are selling it at a ridiculous price compared to what few pennies they are giving you. This is a RIP off.",1
15582,"Great site for gently used clothing, name brand styles, and high quality fashion, for all shapes and sizes!",5
15583,I've bought several items and every one of the has been just like the description. Shipping does not take over a week. I love this app,5
15584,Advertised discounts not automatically applied. Takes forever to get a credit on a return. Overpriced.,3
15585,Awesome!!!,5
15586,"Great; has a slight propensity to malfunction, but overall is great if you keep with the updates.",4
15587,Customer service sucks. Be careful what you purchase because it's impossible to reach anyone if they ship the wrong item to you.,1
15588,Love Thredup. Never disappointed!,5
15589,Easy to navigate & LOTS to shop! Always such a deal! Love that there are so many name brands & new with tag opportunities. And be on the look out for coupon codes.,5
15590,Love all the products ive recieved.,5
15591,Love ThredUp!,5
15592,Amazing,5
15593,Thred Up is my favorite website for clothes anyway -- designer & quality for very little money -- and this is an excellent app for the website. Offers a smooth viewing & purchasing experience.,5
15594,"Love it, great clothes half the price",5
15595,I love thredUP. So easy to use. The items I have bought have been in amazing condion. Great way to save money and get paid for things I dont use.,5
15596,😏,4
15597,Love it,5
15598,Absolutely wonderful,5
15599,Wonderful to buy from. Fast shipping easy to return if you need too. Love this app.,5
15600,Love. LOVE this app.,5
15601,Easy shopping and loved the clothes,5
15602,"Love the consistent scroll feature to view all clothes. They also added more options so you can filter by material, pattern, neckline, sleeve length etc. This comes in very handy when you're looking for clothes for the next season. They also have really great sales during holidays. Love this app!",5
15603,Love this app!!!,5
15604,Love everything!,5
15605,"Great place to shop, best prices!",5
15606,I can't add to my bundle to reach free shipping?,3
15607,"Easy to navigate, very fast refresh time, good photos of merch. Love it!",5
15608,Love this shopping site!,5
15609,Easy to use. Great bargains!,5
15610,Good prices....i enjoy this SALES!!!,5
15611,The app works much better than the actual online website version. Got what I drooled over with no hesitation!,5
15612,Online shopping for the second time. Not sure yet.,5
15613,Great app! Makes it really easy to find cute stuff for my wife & save some money shopping at the same time. Works great.,5
15614,Awesome!!!!,5
15615,Fast delivery,5
15616,I buy and sell most of my work & casual clothes here. Receive many compliments. They are clean.,5
15617,Covenient and easy way to shop,5
15618,"Quick and easy ordering otoduct, but I never received it. It was delivered to the wrong address and the resident ""claimed"" dhe didnt receive it. Chalked it up as a loss...",4
15619,Love saving money & getting top quality product!,5
15620,Sent a huge bag of clothes some still with tags on and at the end only made $3.83!! The site is difficult to navigate. They make you pay to reclaim your items that didn't sell by expiration date. Not worth the trouble and I won't be using anymore.,1
15621,"Love this!!! The youngest of three growing up and Mother of two now, no time to shop and love the deals...not to mention quality!!",5
15622,"Thredup lets you personalize your searches, I'm tall & usually a medium. This makes shopping so much better & easier.",5
15623,"Always find just what I'm looking for, at a great price! Items are very good quality.",5
15624,Love the variety and simplicity of ordering,5
15625,"Great, most of the items fit. It's all about the brand!",5
15626,This was great time easy to find .,5
15627,Easy way to buy quality clothing.,5
15628,It's a great app but it doesn't have a men's section in clothing and it's shoe sizes only go up to 12 so people with size 13 feet like me your out of luck. Quick response from developers.,4
15629,Nice clothing pictures and easy to navigate,5
15630,I've purchased a few times from ThredUp and always a pleasant experience. Beautiful packaging is an added touch!,5
15631,"I love the whole concept of this company, but every time i try to have a kit/bag sent to me for me to ship items in, it always say my address doesnt exsit. Not sure whats going on but i have alot if cloths i would love to consign and also donate and well as my sons. Pls fix thank you.",2
15632,Love the great prices!!!,5
15633,So much nicer than store shopping,5
15634,"I order a lovely dress from here, came in really good condition and fits perfectly. Best thing about it is that it came a day early .",5
15635,"Love this app! I haven't had to return anything. All great quality, true to size, great deals and fast shipping! I will buy everything on thredUP. Best user interface of any shopping app. Only recommendation would be to add more inventory to jewelery and accessory categories so I can buy even more. Would love a men's section as well for my husband. Best online shopping app IMO! Thank you!",5
15636,App was no good . i wasnt even able to sign in .,1
15637,No good,1
15638,Everything i have purchased has been on point with description. Will continue shopping now,5
15639,Love👍,5
15640,Easy to use.,5
15641,Thre app is good but sometimes the filters don'twork well.,4
15642,Good Stuff Cheap,5
15643,"Really easy to navigate, save, and filter. Love how it saves my sizes so I only see what will fit. Love it!",5
15644,Love the prices,5
15645,Awesome app easy to buy items,5
15646,Love this app. Great clothes,5
15647,Thrifty! I love this app and check it daily for deals. Two things have been misleading. 1. Coach wallet turned out to be a knock off. 2. Giani Bini shoes were mislabeled and I returned them. All things I bought were great and if they are a bit small I give them to my MIL.,5
15648,Easy,5
15649,"I have thoroughly enjoyed shopping the app. When my first order arrived I was amazed at the perfect condition of the items and the box it arrived in. I am a believer. Never been happier reusing, recycling, and shopping from home.",5
15650,"I send 8 pic they only put in sale 6 , the other 2 pic. Disappear . The 2 pic was brand name,in very good condition they only pay me $ 1.90 for 3 pic..",1
15651,Awesome!!,5
15652,"Most everything is very good. Glad some descriptions of clothing show chest size . After getting about 10 items that are too small in the chest department, I nearly only buy clothes that offer this information.",5
15653,"I love this app! I am always buying from Thredup and the app is very easy to use. I do have a suggestion, I was wondering if you could add a thumbs up or thumbs down feature or a dislike/like button. I feel like a lot of times I constantly see clothes that I don't like or would never wear. I would like to be able to hide that clothing when I refresh the page so I can see stuff that I am interested in. Overall, fantastic app and I enjoy shopping at Thredup!",4
15654,I love the upcycle trend. Thet have quality products and an amazing return policy.,5
15655,Love this app. Always some promo or sale. Love the reject boxes.,5
15656,First time ordering. Easy,5
15657,Nice!,5
15658,Amaz Ing,5
15659,I ordered a clean out package and thought it wouldn't come and it came!!!,5
15660,"Disappointing. The prices are too high, even for new clothes",1
15661,I prefer to buy new clothes with these prices I prefer everything new is supposed to be used clothes and should be cheaper never pay 20 dollars for a shirt that has already been worn,1
15662,Expensive.. Cheaper at the store,1
15663,Love threadup,5
15664,"I'm so upset about this app. I thought I was gonna get paid better than what I got . Out of 6 bags they just took 6 items out of almost over 40 that I sent them. New stuff ,leather jackets , expensive brands ...just paying me a 13 % out of the price they sell it ! They are making money out of our clothes! If I knew it was gonna be like this I could have sold it my own or donate it to people that really needs it! Don't support this company!!!!🤬",1
15665,A bunch of old worn out over priced clothes. No thanks. Deleted.,1
15666,You're making it too easy for me to shop for quality clothing that I wear - EVERY day!!,5
15667,So easy to navigate and input your own size reference. Never had any issues with the app so far :),5
15668,Update on previous review. Not sure why I just noticed that this site does not immediately make available for cash out when you accept their offer. There should not be any 14 day wait period when accepting the offer. The site is good for buyers but not so great sellers. Offers are way to low and need to be revamped. Thinking sellers should make no less than 25% on any item sold on consignment 5% on any item could result in as little as 50 cent or less and discounts should not affect sellers%,2
15669,Love it!!!,5
15670,Awesome experience! ThredUP has me hooked!! Absolutely love this business & app! Keep up the great work!,5
15671,Love this app. Clothes are nice.,5
15672,It's been buffering too long or glitching.,3
15673,I absolutely love this app and company. They're doing what's been done forever in a stylish and professional way. It's my favorite way to shop for clothes.,5
15674,Fun,5
15675,Can you guys add clothes for Men? Really love the app but would love it more if you added for Men as well. Thank you😊,5
15676,"Sometimes refining searches is difficult, but without the app it is impossible.",4
15677,Easy & Great Discount Code !,5
15678,Great experience! I recently challenged myself to pack for a business trip to Australia (from the mid-Atlantic) with only ThredUp purchases. I put together some smart outfits! You can be socially-conscious and stylish! App works very well for me too! (So well that I have two purses and a couple sweaters on their way as I type. :) ),5
15679,all good,5
15680,"Its an okay shopping app, but not even close to thrift prices. Simple t-shirts are hitting close to $20 each, and these are all expenses before shipping and other fees. Not a way to save money. Just go to a real thrift store where shirts are like $1 - $3. This is just a regular shopping app, honestly, not a thrift store.",1
15681,I have a lot of trouble changing categories,4
15682,Love getting new to me clothes,5
15683,"Really like this app, it's pretty easy to navigate. I can find some really good deals. Just wish they would offer free shipping for all orders again.",4
15684,Obsessed!!!! Great finds at great prices. Not to mention you can also send in your own clothes for then to sell and you get a portion of the price. This has changed my whole shopping experience and outlook.,5
15685,Excellent selections,5
15686,I love this site! I love that I am able to find nice items for a discounted price. I just wish the shipping amount could be lowered!!,5
15687,I love this site!! So many great finds!!,5
15688,Boat loads of fun shopping😀,5
15689,Navigating account details via the app is great. The search functionality within the app could be improved.,4
15690,Definitely more focused on brands than items itself. Even after finding the sort of thing I'm looking for most of it looks just like what Id find at my local Americas Thrift but more expensive and less eco friendly (shipping). I was hoping to use this to help me lock down some specific sort of things I was looking for without having to buy new. Finally my last review also applies to the website: Do not force people to sign up before they have a chance to even look. Its annoying.,1
15691,Excellent way to recycle!,5
15692,Love thrifting online,5
15693,Best app and consignment ever. Long time purchaser,5
15694,Very pleasant,5
15695,Great way to save money and have a new wardrobe every season!,5
15696,Love this store and the app. Great place to shop and great prices,5
15697,I enjoy this app! I have bought some awesome clothes. I have not been disappointed yet!,5
15698,Great,5
15699,I found my bootcut jeans...and the shirts i like. I love it,5
15700,Amazing app,5
15701,Love it!,5
15702,App works well for me.,5
15703,"Great for back-to-school shopping! I can easily filter for brands my son likes and pay far less than in-store, and many items are like-new!",5
15704,"I love the app, the only thing i dont like is when tou remove certain items from your cart, you literally have to know the name and research it cause it doesnt show up in your recently temoved items. I hated that and lost so many items cause i couldnt find them again.",4
15705,"Excellent clothing, excellent service!",5
15706,fantastic and amazing deals,5
15707,"The app is nice, and the picture resolution is much better than the website; however, the search options are not as advanced.",4
15708,I'm loving this app! My clothes I ordered are in great condition and I look forward to placing more orders soon! I really recommend others using this App ♡♡♡,5
15709,No mens selection,1
15710,I love thred up. I am able to find great clothes for great prices.,5
15711,Absolutely love!!! I was about to get great piece for my office job after being out for maturity leave. Without breaking my budget!!!!!,5
15712,Love the ease of use with this App! It has made my shopping experience awesome!!,5
15713,Excellent service,5
15714,Loved everything I've gotten. Either new or just about new condition.,5
15715,Easy to use love the search and the ability to filter on just what I want.,5
15716,"You only get a small percentage of your consignment. Will not use this app to sale again, however, I would purchase because they have pretty good prices but cannot comment on the quality of the clothes yet since I have not made a purchase.",1
15717,Excellent,5
15718,Just as great as the website!,5
15719,I was SOOO cheated! Big clear out sale some items arrived with price tags on for less than I paid and non returnable. One pair of pants had been cut off on bottoms and not re-hemmed and were soiled on bottoms. Not returnable even if you can return an item you are charged a restocking fee and with shipping you lost money to try their overpriced junk. Some tags were from Ross and I was charged more than the Ross price just go to Ross and pay less threw up has really come down as a shopping site,1
15720,"Shopping is decent despite poor descriptions of items. You mostly find good deals because they have horrible payout. for 5 brand name items, I got $5.20. I would make more than that per item consigning locally. Free returns if you can try items on right when you get it with short return period. My returns havent processed yet, but I assume this is a reasonable process. Defonitely buy through them but dont sell to them.",3
15721,Fun to shop and lots of filters to make it easy,5
15722,It's a fun way to shop from your couch and help with sustainability!,5
15723,"I LOVE thredUP, SO much!",5
15724,Great Idea!! I buy so many things from this site and I feel like I am doing good for the earth! The app takes some patience to sift threw the stuff unless you know exactly what yoh want.,5
15725,The only thing that could make the app better is when there is a sale you could see which items in your favorites qualify!,5
15726,The clothes are well fitted and you will love the style and prices,5
15727,Clear and easy to use.,5
15728,"I love thredUP! Im able to find professional clothing for chump change, which is exactly what I need as a college student living on a small budget.",5
15729,"Love ThredUp! Got paid shopping credit $$$ for selling them my used clothes I didn't want and otherwise would've got nothing for. They have a great selection of gently used brand name women's clothing and accessories, all for really low prices! Would definitely recommend! **Edit: Sizes are inconsistent.**",5
15730,Best website and excellent clothing and customer service. THANKS thredup for all the best quality second had stuff you share with us.,5
15731,Great stuff at a steel!,5
15732,Awesome,4
15733,Excellent,5
15734,Fun to shop. Like the idea of reusing and resaling clothing.,4
15735,Favorite online thrift store ever...truely a hidden gem!,5
15736,My favorite clothing app,5
15737,Excellent experience!!!!!,5
15738,Makes shopping easy,5
15739,"I have tried to order on this app several times. Either the checkout button doesn't work or the order gets reset - repeatedly. I've tried over several weeks to use it. I can get it to work on IOS but not Android. Serious issues that need to be addressed. I've tried it on Samsung phone and Lenovo tablet, so it's not a device issue. I reached out to support, but was told - -Looks like you made an order so you everything must be ok for you--. Ugh",2
15740,This is the easiest time I've ever had sorting through pre-owned clothes and everything I've bought has fit perfectly.,5
15741,"Unique styles & excellent quality, available at affordable prices .",5
15742,I love shopping thred up!,5
15743,I love this website ive placed 7 or 8 orders this month its great!!,5
15744,"have found so many amazing deals on this app. Wonderful selection, easy to navigate and save favorites.",5
15745,Great way to thrift and find exactly what you're looking for in minimal time. Customer service has always been helpful. The cleanout and goody box options are also economical and fun! I've used the cleanout service a few times already to refresh my wardrobe. App streamlines an already excellent service.,5
15746,Just started and so far I'm in love! I would rather shop on Thredup than anywhere else. Makes me feel good to save money.,5
15747,I truly love the items sent. The packaging is beautiful and can't beat the prices. This will be my new online store. Thank you.,5
15748,Great app but sometimes a little slow to load.,4
15749,"I found good quality clothes for a cheap price. E.g., I got a $120 dress for $26",5
15750,"Easy way to trade/thrift shop. Lots of discounts, and can be tailored to your personal style/size/brand. The app closes itself out sometimes on my iPad, but no issues on my phone.",5
15751,Great deals at unbeatable prices!,5
15752,Fantastic,5
15753,Easy to buy,5
15754,Great prices on very nice items. Easy return if something doesnt work. Love this site!,5
15755,It was an easy app to do everything I needed to do. Went with affirm was approved so payed a down payment today now I just got to wait for my order. Got great deals to.,5
15756,Love it,5
15757,Mostly great. Occasionally I experience glitches where I'll narrow down my search criteria and the results don't update. Usually if I close the app and go back in it works just fine.,4
15758,I just got my first order. 6 of 6 were perfect. I have four more orders coming. I may never shop retail again.,5
15759,Love this app. It makes shopping for lightly used and new clothes so easy. Will continue to use this app.,5
15760,Easy and user friendly app,5
15761,Love it,5
15762,Awesome,5
15763,Great bargains on quality items!,5
15764,"I've just received my first order and couldn't be happier. It arrived earlier than expected and every item was exactly as described as far as the condition, if not better.",5
15765,"Not a big fan. Definitely don't bother trying to sell your items on here. You can try to send in a brand name item in great condition that was just listed and they won't pay you for it. And what they do pay you is barely worth the time it takes you to put it in the bag. As for buying items, pretty much everything is overpriced for being a previoualy worn item. I've had far better luck at my local consignment stores, especially considering the restocking fee they now have on the site. Shop local.",2
15766,"Love it,nice way to get stuff cheep. And comes so fast",5
15767,Love this app! I have loved everything I've ordered!,5
15768,Luv shopping here! Great prices fot items im looking for! :),5
15769,"would be fine stars except for two things: I wish they hadn't added a restocking fee for returns. The app also needs better sorting functions. I love the clothes I get from here though, and I love being able to buy used instead of new and lessen my carbon footprint.",4
15770,App has not worked since last update. All I get is the home screen and it never progresses past that.,1
15771,"Great app, easy to use!",5
15772,I like that you can buy multiple items and pay 1 shipping.,5
15773,easy to use. excellent quality,5
15774,Very disappointed to find out that the majority of my clothes were selling for $14 to $20 and thredUP paid me on the average 50 cents for each. I thought the payout would be at least a dollar or two more than that.,1
15775,Great,5
15776,Great selection!,5
15777,"selling on this app is unbeifitial unless you pay the $12 for you returned clothes, or have very exclusive clothes that someone would pay high dollar for. What they dont tell you is you MAY get $1 per clothing item due to the fact you get about 3% on them. i wish i knew this information before hand. i could have sold more than just 5 our of the 20+ idems i sent in a yard sale for more than the $.50 I'm getting now :(",1
15778,The thredUP app is easy to use from beginning to end.,5
15779,Love it!,5
15780,I absolutley love thredUp and being able to use the app. It works great and makes shopping so easy.,5
15781,Love ordering from them great sizing amazing prices.I get better sized perfect fit clothing from Thredd up. Never disappointed,5
15782,"I have had nothing but great experiences with thredUP. Easy to use, beautiful clothes, and recycling all in one!",5
15783,"This is a fairly easy app to navigate. I've been shopping on this app for workclothes that I know I can feel good about wearing. I love thrifting but would need a lot of patience to go through the racks, the app makes it easier to do the ""sifting"". I would however love a way to sort the Favorites list by category as opposed to only by date of addition. It would make it easier to be able to get through the list without having to scroll through the whole thing",4
15784,Thred up app is amazing! When there is a coupon they don't hide it they show you the code throughout your shopping experience. It's the best online secondhand app!,5
15785,fast shipping and great clotges!!,5
15786,Most of the things I purchase fit great! If they don't they are easy to return. Love thredup!,5
15787,great app and easy to find stuff,5
15788,I love this site. My only complaint is even after you pick your sizes it still shows you things not in your size,3
15789,great app,5
15790,I was an avid buyer for a few years before they began charging a $1.99 restocking fee on every returned item. I may as well buy new for those prices. And have been. At least Gap and Old Navy offer free returns.,1
15791,"Very disappointed!! Sent 1 Jacket And 9 Pairs Of Shoes To Luxe. Sold 3 items at $3.15 payout each! A total rip off!! All these items were in excellent condition, I would have rather given them away. I immediately sent for them to return my remaining items. Happy to be done with them. This app is not for me!!",1
15792,Love it!!!,5
15793,The cloths are just like are described. Crazy prices,5
15794,"didn't have a good variety of clothing. not my style. not very cheap as compared to real thrift stores, where i can get a pair of shoes for five dollars.",2
15795,ive enjoyed it so far. if they can do more codes and what not thats very helpful. i had 11$ in credit so it was great to get my son some shirts. some things are very pricey for what they look like though so have to pay attention to that,5
15796,"I love your concept, I have lost weight (getting healthy) and your company has enabled me to sell my old clothes and to start a whole new wardrobe. Having the measurements listed has been a great help because I did not always know my size. Thanks for being environmentally conscious too. Bonus.",5
15797,it honestly sucked the clothes are so ratchet and ugly and so old they look like my gramas rummage sale I saw one pair of cute shorts and they were 20 dollars!!!,1
15798,thredUP always has exactly what we need for a great price!,5
15799,Always excellent name brand clothing...mostly I purchase Harley Davidson or Juicy Couture for grandkids... new with tags which is especially nice.,5
15800,u have to pay fee for return. n u have to pay a fee if u want a refund on ur order .,1
15801,love the variety,5
15802,love these ppl.. and the clothes have been loved by all age groups,5
15803,"Was super excited to hear about this app, and how its a great alternative to buying new clothes, only to find out that its only for women and children :/ I give it 2 stars for now because I love the concept and overall shop but I just wish I could use it :(",2
15804,Very fun app. Easy to navigate and good quality deals,5
15805,great prices easy app to use,5
15806,Love shopping on here great stuff,5
15807,I love the interaction I can have on the app with the items I'm looking at purchasing. Very user friendly and affordable products.,5
15808,There aren't many items that cost below $10 and the ones that do aren't fashionable. If you want something nice then plan on spending some $$. I should stick with the WISH app.,1
15809,Like going to the thrift store without having to go to the thrift store 😅😍,5
15810,quality clothes that are incredibly affordable,5
15811,great service and options so far. placed my first order today,4
15812,I'm obsessed! I can't not buy the items I see on this website! Amazing fashion of all types and for all seasons/purposes at outrageously affordable prices! Sometimes I feel like I'm stealing. I also have shipped off 3 packages of my own clothing and watched the items sell and money in my account to use towards future purchases.,5
15813,love browsing-But HATE that I can never locate the discount code,4
15814,the amount you get for your clothes is ridiculous. i sent a full bag of clothes and get 5% of what they go for. I will not be doing this again. I sent in alot of my nice brand name well cared for items.,1
15815,awesome,5
15816,"Ever since I found this site and downloaded the app, I have had nothing but the best experience! Keep the thrift shopping going! love it!",5
15817,Excellent quality and excellent prices!! I love ThredUp!!!,5
15818,Decent. Sometimes it has trouble loading.,4
15819,"I love shopping from home and helping the environment, so ThredUp is perfect! Especially the free returns and credit on my account from returned items. AMAZING❤",5
15820,I love this app and the Thred Up experience! I have cleaned out my closet twice and in the process of a 3rd with their clean out bag. Everything I have bought so far has been great- 95% have been excellent and fit well and as described. Highly recommend!,5
15821,app works better than the website overall,5
15822,Fantastic!,5
15823,What a load of bs. Id rather throw my stuff in the trash then send it to this horrid company.,1
15824,Great selection,5
15825,love this app! get clothes and shoes!! saving hundreds!!!!,5
15826,Fantastic way to find treasures. I explore this app monthly and treat myself to several pairs of killer boots or heels or both lol. I'm extremely pleased would definitely suggest checking it out for sure!!,5
15827,So easy to use. filters are easy,4
15828,Easy to use and so far have not had any issues. I like that they show the original retail price!,5
15829,Great place to find discounted new and 2nd hand clothes in great condition. They even offer a payment plan option.,5
15830,"I love thredup! I love the discounts, and that you can find plenty of cure clothes! I love that they are committed to helpin the environment by helpikg donate your clothes, recycling, and selling!",5
15831,love threadUp!!,5
15832,the bestsr,5
15833,i love this shopping app it is so awesome!,4
15834,so easy and affordable,5
15835,this is a great app.I receive a very high quality product that I always wanted.I am very satisfied 😁,5
15836,addicting for sure,5
15837,ok app but if you want good quality products and fast shipping download poshmark it is the best app by far and i guarntee you will love posh as it is the best used and new item site i have found by far it is a great app and i love it posher for life here talking,1
15838,"love the clothing, hate the shipping fee",4
15839,"want your information, even if youre of the gender they don't provide service for. their desc. of the company specifically includes that the platform sells mens clothing, though no mens department exists. they have boys clothing, but have discriminated against all members of the gender exceeding age 15. Which is fine, I understand that womens apparel is a far more sprawling landscape, but dont mandate that i either sign up or give u access to my fb before letting me discover its inutile to me",1
15840,i found the dresses i liked right away.,5
15841,"What an awful experience it has been selling with thredup. Wouldn't recommend this disorganized, slow nightmare to anyone.",1
15842,"I expected a nicer aray of options. This may have just been at the wrong time of the year (end of the back to school frenzy). I will try back later. *Also, I recieved messages to qualify for up to 50% off of my first purchase, but I could not get to that option before I spent $275 (+/-) on used clothing.",3
15843,"Communication with this company is horrible. A week to reply to email??? I placed an order for Goody Box on July 31st...still waiting, finally get someone on chat and they inform they are working on July 29th boxes. So..why not email July customers and let people know what's going on? Nope, play the victim of we are overwhelmed with orders. Hire some help for the stylists and customer service reps so they can answer questions. If I owned this company, I would be embarrassed..",1
15844,Great for the environment and my wallet!,5
15845,great finds! 4 stars because they should offer mens clothing too,4
15846,love,5
15847,It is fun and a surpise😊,5
15848,I've heard a lot about thiis sight and will be excited to try it out. 😛😁🤣😭🤔,5
15849,very easy to navigate. fun to browse. love the concept. love the delivery.,5
15850,Love Thred Up and the app is super easy to use and shop from. You got to try it.,5
15851,This app is amazing! I've ordered 3 times & I happy with all of the clothes. Why pay full price when youve got thredUP?!,5
15852,exceptional deals!,5
15853,haven't ordered yet but I will love looking at everything thanks,5
15854,"measurements provided are not sufficient to see if item fits, and they charge you $2 for each return.",1
15855,I used give it 5 stars and now the pricey are crazy high. some items are pricey higher than retail.,2
15856,Love ThredUp! So easy to use and lots of sales and promo codes!,5
15857,very good everything I ordered was band new,4
15858,luv it!!!,5
15859,"The app does glitch/crash a bit frequently for my taste, but it is much more convenient than the website for tracking shipping and orders already completed",4
15860,Prices are fantastic!!,5
15861,sent a bag of all new stuff and they only posted 35 items and offered me a payout of like 27 bucks and i sent a brand new leather jacket with tags that was never posted i was expecting to get a lot more for my items especially when they price them damn near at the price the store would. I've already sent out my second bag but that was before i peeped what they were doing. how are they getting over like that? if i wanted to give my stuff away i would've just donated them. it's a scam!,1
15862,"I've been more than patient with ThredUp, giving it chance after chance, but every order seems to end in disappointment. Orders take too long to go out and be delivered, and items you're excited for get refunded without ANY notification from the company. You just have to keep an eye on your order and make sure everything you ordered is still queued up to ship. Very upsetting/disappointing. Thread up is also a TOTAL rip off. They charge more than actual stores do for new items.",1
15863,"I have not heard anything since I sent my 75% designer clothes to them. There were several items with tags on them and only one thing sold for. 39cents. They need to be able to contact you with a bulk purchase amount and not bread crumbs. I sent my bundle a month ago, .39 cents, thanks alot",1
15864,"I am new here, to ThreadUp. Found a lot of wonderful things and now we will see how they are, when they arrive. I can say I am enjoying the site, ordered twice already a total of apprx. 13 or 14 items. some blouses, pants and shoes. I LOVE the coupon code for being new! Thank you Nothing is due to arrive at my door for a few more days yet, but then I will be able to say how good ( or not) each item is. but over-all, so far, loving this! I can shop from home at 3 am in my underwear and find fab!",5
15865,looks like an exciting new way to thrift shop :),5
15866,$hopping off of clothing tglhe kids grew out of last year. Buying New With Tags school clothes this year. :),5
15867,"Great, except the color filter doesn't work for the color grey in the app. Probably because there is an inconsistency in spelling gray/grey on the app. Bug fix please!",5
15868,I love how easy it is to use the Thredup app. I like the ease of shopping for brands and outfits jus by simply going into the app. I have yet to experience any problems with this app. I highly recommend.,5
15869,love the app!,5
15870,"LOVE IT! Absolutely obsessed. I have found cuter clothes in better condition and for way better prices on thredUP than I have in stores. I check everyday and always find something I love. There are some minor features I wish were different ($1.99 restocking fee PER item but I rarely return items; 24-hour in-cart item limit -- constantly having to reinsert items in my shopping cart just so I have more time to think about items instead of impulsively ordering). Otherwise, totally recommend!",4
15871,"this app/site use to be great but now they give you pennies for your items - some of it isnt even reasonable. i sent in a gap blazer, new with tags, navy - they sold it and gave me $0.40 for it. if you have a consignment store in your area, go there instead. not worth the time/hassle of getting it to the post office.",1
15872,"Very easy to use! The filters work really well as do the ability to save and sort by personalized sizes. My only complaint is with the company, not the app- I wish it was easier to get free shipping.",5
15873,had a fast and good experience. the hand bag i bought was ad. as leather but was man made. other than that all was great,5
15874,"I sent in a full bag (approx 28)items of new with tags and nearly new, name brand and designer current items. They accepted only 8, and after selling 6 of those I was paid less than $6.00 in the end. Waste of time and effort. I should have taken them to a consignment shop. I was very disappointed!",2
15875,"I enjoy the shopping, and the return feature is good if something doesn't fit just right. I get stuff I don't find around my metroplex",5
15876,This site is my new addiction,5
15877,The worst customer service I have ever experienced! i contacted them about misrepresented items I purchased and got NO response. I contacted them about an item i purchased that had black and gray stains and still no response. I got a response finally when I was trying to make a purchase! Gee really! ??! The last encounter was when my order was taking more than 11 days to arrive. i finally got a response. No apologies. The email said delivery takes 5-8 days Hmmm i wish they read my email.,1
15878,I like that I can look around all I want.,5
15879,Great finds ! Name brands new with tag's. prices are wonderful join if you haven't already,5
15880,i like the app but changes to the filter are very slow to load,3
15881,Nike,5
15882,I sent in a huge bags of items including a practically new Coach purse. Didn't hear anything about my Coach purse and sold an item of clothing for about $3 profit to me. You can't get in touch with ANYONE to inquire about your items. Unbelievable that there is absolutely no way to get in touch with a human. I like purchasing but I will never send them items to sell for me again. I paid $395 for my Coach purse and just didn't like the color after a few months of use. I got $0.,1
15883,always on time love this site will be ording more,5
15884,love it!,5
15885,Wish I'd found this app years ago!,5
15886,This app is AWESOME!,5
15887,I am very satisfied with everything I have ordered.,5
15888,I will never buy retail full price again.,5
15889,"My go to app for clothing is thredUP. I love the filters that hold my size and color choices when buying. I also like that you can see the back of an item. I have ordered dresses,jackets,and sweaters, and accessories too and have liked my purchases. It makes me feel good to wear recycled items and I love to buy on this app. No one can tell my clothes aren't new and I always look terrific! I only wish I could buy pants that fit...I have such a hard size to find.",4
15890,"I purchase clothes from thred up all the time. it's easy. the app is user friendly. returning is hardly ever a problem. I use the saved search feature frequently, so I'm always notified when something matching my search becomes available.",5
15891,love how fast you get your order,5
15892,So many great quality pieces at amazing prices! I love that you can clear your closet of pieces you don't wear and fill it back up without spending a lot. Highly recommend!,5
15893,To touchy keep clicking add item then having to go in & remove. To easy to hit place order when shipping. Go back to desktop version.,1
15894,I think the amount of money a person receives for their clothes isnt enough. my clothes were brand new & like brand new & didnt get much for them. When thred up charges $9.99 for aomething & my payout is like $.23 thats ridiculous! i would have been better off having a yard sale. wasnt worth it at all!!!! will not be dealing with thred up anymore!!!!,1
15895,Very easy to navigate!,5
15896,easy to use app for online shopping. my go-to for all secondhand essentials,5
15897,"Unexpectedly Delightful! I wasn't sure what to expect as there is sooooo much to cooose from. I just received my 1st two packages and with one exception, (I guess you can't expect 100% honesty) everything was as described, packaged nicely and a pleasure to open. The low shipping cost makes this an even better deal. I will be a repeat customer & am already telling my friends that they've got to see thredUP to truely understand what a great shopping site it is!!!",5
15898,I have been using Thredup for years!!! I recently decided to stop buying new clothes and only purchase used items and Thredup is my go to for most everything! I also sell items here as well and love that what isn't sold or chosen for resale is donated. Love them!!,5
15899,Love thredUP and the app works great!,5
15900,not true to price posted in ads,1
15901,easy app to use!! love the prices!,5
15902,"great app, fun!",5
15903,I love how customizable the app is!,5
15904,I'm so addicted to this app!,5
15905,"Very easy to use, I would love if everyone selling on this site would put a little more effort in putting the dimensions of the garments, like threadUP does. It just makes it more easier to know how long/short/fitted the garment would look on you. But over all I love this app and store.",5
15906,Saving money is addicting! 😁,5
15907,Love the selection and filters make it easy to narrow down the choices.,5
15908,I'm trying to purchase a personal goodie box but the checkout button isnt working in that category.,2
15909,Found great pants at great prices.,5
15910,it's so easy I don't have to have my grandchildren help me with it!,5
15911,thredUP provides the chance to gain a fabulous and gently used wardrobe at incredibly decent prices. I also love that they take allow you to clean out your own closet to share with others. It's a win-win all around.,5
15912,"geat app love the prices and great clothes, shoes, and accessories. Wonderful shopping experience!",5
15913,"It's very easy and quick. High quality items. after using them for over 2 years I can say that the experience is very good including returns. options are ever changing, which is good for shopping. I will definitely keep shopping here as long as they keep doing a great job!",5
15914,"ALWAYS have the best experience with this great company, everything has always been exactly what I was looking for 🤓🤓🤓🤓",5
15915,n/a,5
15916,no problems 😁,5
15917,There's no place else where I can get quality name brand clothes at affordable prices. Thanks thredup!!!,5
15918,Easy with good product.,5
15919,I Love this app. So far I received My purchases and I Love them. Great descriptions and Quality.,5
15920,love love love this app. it always works and I love sending my clothes here to sell. it's such an easy process. and you can use your credit to buy more clothes. perfect!,5
15921,if i could give this company a negative 10 stars i would. i ordered over $200 from this company and have not recieved a single item. Terrible!!,1
15922,my shopping experience would have been better with garment measurements,4
15923,Love it,5
15924,"Great way to shop! Easy, fast, enjoyable. Eco smart. Awesome variety of colors and fabrics!",5
15925,"The store has great options, but their limited descriptions make it hard to narrow down choices. You must be committed to spending a lot of time pouring through hundreds of pictures and then read the measurements closely.",4
15926,I buy most of my clothes from ThredUp...love it!,5
15927,"placed in order thru the app last month and they still haven't acknowledged it. My orders screen shows blank, like ive never made a purchase. I have emailed several times now trying to get a refund and am now disputing with PayPal. Do Not use this site, its a scam. Google needs to delete if they are just going to take money and not deliver.",4
15928,very new to company...need sometime.,5
15929,"UPDATE: the 5/3 update fixed the main issue but i am still having all kinds 
of issues that prevent me from shopping. Issues include intermittent 
missing item images though i can see description, searching often returns 0 
results even when there should be plenty (like searching for a mjor brand 
name), ""my sizes"" keeps resetting to include Tall no matter how many times 
i uncheck it and save my settings, sometimes the link to edit ""my sizes"" 
does nothing, the removal of ""my brands"" now makes searching for your 
favorite brands super tedious, a few times a day the app is completely 
unresponsive, searching for something specific in petites is now a chore 
because you can't filter for type of item so you're stuck browsing all 
petites. That's no way to find a pair of petite jeans. I love thredup but 
the recent customer service decline (last 2 support requests took 10+ days 
for a response) combined with all these app issues makes is way less fun. 
(The desktop site also has it's own set of constant issues.)----- Prior 
review: 4/24 (most recent) upgrade gives errors shopping women's clothes. 
Completely unable to search, browse clothes, etc. Seems i'm not the only 
one. Pretty awful experience.",4
15930,August 2019 Update: I've continued to shop used with the ThredUp app over the past 3 years and still love it. Now using the app on a Google Pixel 3 with no issues. I get great items at bargain prices and the filters and searches make shopping for specific items easy and fun. Thanks ThredUp! I love ThredUp! I've ordered 3 times now in 3 weeks. My last 2 orders have been through the app and it works flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Couldn't be happier.,5
15931,wonderful idea i love it cant believe its done so nicely,5
15932,fantastic,5
15933,They have a lot of different varieties of clothes. But I feel like you could purchase 75% of there clothes in the store for cheaper or the same prices they have. This especially goes for the clothes that are Walmart brand& old navy clothes. So I feel like there a rip off.,2
15934,Love this App!,5
15935,"Fun way to shop. I've added a lot to my closet for cheap from this app. Not everything is perfect, which should be expect but some people are unrealistic, but it's easy to return. I've found a lot of new clothes with tags for work.",5
15936,I love this company a lot so far. my only complaint is that the app will lag a little and then it will just crash. but other than that its great I love it!,4
15937,I love this app It has the best clothes and deals,5
15938,"Great clothes, but, the app doesn't work properly. AFFIRM doesn't come up at check out. Customer service sucks!! Can't reset my password. It's too bad, I really like the clothes and prices.",2
15939,"I wrote a review here but maybe it was taken off, so here it is again. If you have loads of money to gave away, go ahead and try this app! At the moment I'm $176.77 poorer than a few days ago because I was charged for clothes I returned (within the time frame allowed). Their recent computer generated mesaage said it would be a week before they got back to me! I hope they read this review and are motivated to resolve this ASAP.",1
15940,I buy many of ny clothes here. Im not thrilled with the new restocking fee and higher free shipping threshold. The app has great search functions and filters. Edit: the new bundle feature helps with shipping costs.,4
15941,"Easy to shop and zoom in on products, well-organized to quickly find what you're looking for",5
15942,AWESOME!!! satisfied 90% of the time. there have been a few times where the items were very worn and should not have been resold but the other 90% have been GREAT & I save so much money!!!,5
15943,great clothes been buying for my 3 kids and me for over year and had nothing but great items,5
15944,it's ok wasn't as much money as I thought it would be!,4
15945,Boring,1
15946,"every item is ranked for quality so you know what you're getting, and whether it's a little damaged or like new. everything I've ordered has been great quality and got to me within a week. lots of regular and plus size options. the prices aren't bad either, especially when there are extra sales. Helpful hint if there's something you love but it's too pricey, look it up in the search bar again. I've found duplicates in the same condition for a lower price.",5
15947,disappointed that they dont sell no men clothing,1
15948,"I LOVE thread up and all of the variety. BUT the filters are useless. it's soooooo annoying, applying the filters only to see half the items are things I am purposely trying to not see. if the filters I want don't produce any results fine, don't fill the results with the hopes I'll find something I really am not looking for. PLEASE fix your filters so they accurately display.",2
15949,"These leather boots are perfect! Fit great! Look tag new! aThank you, Thread up!",5
15950,"I tried this application for a bit and found some really nice deals on good clothes, but my girlfriend has had an extremely poor experience with it.   She placed an order for some clothes a bit ago, and still has not received them. Apparently they were lost in the shipping process, and because ThreadUp and USPS are blaming each other for the problem, nothing is being done to remedy the case.  This lack of quality customer service makes me really nervous to continue using ThreadUp, and I have to recommend that users avoid this application at all costs, until they can prove that they provide good customer service to all customers!",1
15951,"selection, quality is good. some items don't have measurements, this is the one improvement that would be nice. having the measurements of all the garments would increase sales, and reduce returns.",4
15952,Easy to ship your things and love to order stuff for me and my family!,5
15953,new to site but already loving it. easy to use and tons of great items,5
15954,Lots of ways to search!,5
15955,"I couldn't even get to the ""buying"" phase cuz of how obviously trash this stuff is. I found a hat that looked like it was from the old witch in the forest with bleach stains, and jewellery that obviously had the ""gold"" eaten off by the acids in someone's skin. Both were marked as ""like new you can't even tell it's not brand new"". Like seriously?! And you want me to pay nearly $20 for visibly worn costume jewelry and nearly $20 for a hat that looks like you pulled it out of the nearest dumpster?!",1
15956,I love it,5
15957,"absolutely luv ThredUp...great merchandise, prices n service! items are clean, fresh n arrive so nicely packaged...it's like a little gift for myself!",5
15958,awesome,5
15959,"mostly good, but now I cannot retrieve all my favorite items and therefore I lose the opportunity to purchase them. they need to address this because they may lose sales. also I wish we could have a selection of items to choose from when purchasing the various types of boxes they offer. I have considered them, but always decide against it because I want to choose what I get! and I also think they over price a lot of items! they are a huge company and I feel that it should be more affordable.",4
15960,Fantastic,5
15961,cant go to the next page offale doumb,1
15962,"I love the filters and categories that help find the right item. Shopping for just the right style, color, pattern, or feature in a garment is made easu because so much info is shared about each item. The bundle shipment is great too because it reduces waste. Since I shop on-line quite a lot, it is easy to reduce the amount of waste if my items come in as few containers as possible. Great idea and fabulous business model. Love the merch, too!",5
15963,"Scammers! Don't do it! Sent them over $200 in new clothes and my payout was $3.00. Even worse, they never sent the $3.00!",1
15964,"I'm a newbie to thredUP and just received my first purchase, a beautiful handbag 🤩 The handbag is perfect and came exactly as it was described on the app. I am officially addicted and my second purchase arrives Monday!",5
15965,"app is ok, just not for me. ive found better deals.",3
15966,"Took me all day to purchased party dresses and casual Tops. Great variety, but can't picked the certain kind of what I was looking for. I can't typed in like "" Sear cardigans "" and "" dolman sleeves dress "". Should be able to type and search for certain types of clothes. I bought 13 items, I could bought twice as much, but running out of my Saturday.",3
15967,new to it but love it so far,5
15968,Whenever I first used this app I thought I love it. Not until I realized I sold stuff that I really didn't mean to sell and wasn't going to get back.,1
15969,My favorite way to spend time on line shopping!,5
15970,"great mission, great product, great idea",5
15971,thumbs up ♡,5
15972,Great app,5
15973,some times slow but always worth whil,5
15974,"This app is easy to navigate and makes for a great online shopping experience. All the items I have recieved have been in great condition with easy returns if something doesn't fit. They also list all flaws an item may have so you know what to expect when it arrives. The only downfall I see is the fact that you can only purchase Women's or Kid's clothing. I feel the option to look for Men's clothing would be really nice, especially since my husband is getting jealous of all the money I'm saving!",4
15975,Great Everything !,5
15976,"Love ThredUp! Wish they always included measurements of the items, as even within a brand sizes vary. Between brands there's a huge difference. Only app suggestion is to have it default to an indication that an item is in a cart or purchased when the app opens from one of their search notification emails. Right now it just defaults to the 'front page', and I'm not sure if it's just slow opening the page, the link is not working, or the item is gone.",4
15977,"Update: Issue with ""My Sizes"" seems to have been resolved! Now my only complaint is that I always end up buying more and more stuff 😎 But love the selection, the app and the whole concept!! Love the selection! However, I have found the search and ""My Sizes"" feature to be unreliable in the app (often returning 0 results when I search on typical terms (e.g. cardigan, necklace). These features work great fo me in the browser, but not the app. However, it's still got tons of great features!",5
15978,great product secret gem!!!,5
15979,well I haven't received my merchandise yet but what I seen so far was freaking awesome,4
15980,"I have bought form here many time. They have lots of great items, cool discounts and the app and website are pretty easy to navigate. Just wish they sold men's clothing also.",4
15981,many wonderful items but not all prices are low so I need to use discount but I was not able to add it before completing. Process is not useful and reliable. Did not get a chance. It has happened prior so this is the 2nd time.,2
15982,"Ordered crossbody bag described as new. Would assume condition is new. Faux leather is defective and deteriorating. Item sold as not returnable. Dishonest selling practices. I will stick with Ebay, which has much more timely shipping and better customer satisfaction.",1
15983,"I love this app for getting a way better deal than full retail, and any time I've ordered an article of clothing it is pretty much exactly what I expected, aside from those pesky girl sizes but that is no fault of thred up!! I love this app!",5
15984,"nice to shop brand, sales, and promos anytime.",5
15985,I loveeeee the app and in general the services! It's super convenient; saved so much cash and time.,5
15986,"App has many serious problems as does the misrepresentation of items. Customer service is polite but not actually helpful. the response given to this review was to reach out and the point is that I have done this repeatedly and there seems to be a reading comprehension problem or no answer. Lately, the customer service page went blank for about a week and my requests for help disappeared, after I wrote about my cart going blank for several days, I have been cut off with no response for weeks.",1
15987,Buyer beware. I ordered my clothes over a month ago (41 days ago to be exact) and i still haven't received 7 of the 8 items i puchased. The app is also saying that my time return any clothes has expired (even though i have not received my clothes yet). I have contacted customer service multiple times and they have not resolved my issue. They have also refused to give me a refund. Please do not buy from this company.,1
15988,love this!! bought a whole new wardrobe for what 2 dresses would cost! highly recommend!!,5
15989,I put some clothes to sell I never got my money dont put your clothes,1
15990,"I love the ease of using the app! I can set my size preferences and be shown only those items that are going to work for me each time I pull up the app. I can even search more specifically, by designating color, condition, and cut of the garment. Unfortunately, the app shorts out quite often, but this doesn't deter me from shopping with ThredUp. I'm able to get GREAT deals on quality clothing!",4
15991,"The app works well enough, but certain glitches knocked stars off the rating (caching issues, mandatory force refresh to fix bugged pages, sometimes when I scroll down quickly it would add an the item to the cart, etc).The shopping experience is great and the UI is easy to navigate, but I do wish I was able to keep my spot in the catalog while browsing. I noticed that the mobile browser is easier to navigate vs the app, but the app has way less lag (maybe because of lack of thumbnail animations)",3
15992,gosh have so much fun buying my clothes at shredUP ..the best online store ever,5
15993,Great App - Even Better Prices,5
15994,"Love that i have shopping for 2nd hand clothes at touch of a button...going to thrift stores, or any store is hard when your a mom of 2 toddlers. Cant wait until I receive my package and for my next awesome find!",5
15995,love this app,5
15996,"very convenient, and easy to use",5
15997,great online shop. They even have plus sizes!,5
15998,"I used to use their consignment service a lot until recently, they basically did a shady move & didn't 'accept' a pair of shoes due to their 'criteria'. I sent two pairs, neither brands were on the list but the $20 payless shoes were accepted & the $200 name brand were not due to 'pilling'. When does barely used leather 'pill'? Shady. **It isn't about the money, it's about shoes I loved so much that I took a lot of care of them & only wore them on 2 big occasions. I wanted them loved.",1
15999,love this app. Now that my surgery is done I can enjoy 💕,5

16008,thrifting from your couch with sustainable shipping. I love it!,5
16009,"Although USPS ships here, they do not offer any type of service for Alaskans.",1
16010,Love everything about this company. Their app works better than their actual website. Customer Service is always on top of everything. This company does a great job and truly appreciates their customers.,5
16011,"Love, love, LOVE this place!! I order often and been very happy with my buys.",5
16012,"i love the prices, the quality, and my kids, both, love the clothes as well! Just as I have been, I will continue to shop here. Thank you thredUP❤️",5
16013,Great way to get great clothing for way less than retail price. Packaged neatly just like it's new! So far I have been happy with items. Always very honest about the quality of used or new items. Love this app.,5
16014,"Love this company and the app! Favorites help you save what you like as you shop and take a second look before putting the items in your cart. If an item you liked gets purchased before you can buy it, they have a ""look at similar items"". I suggest ThredUp to all my friends. The only suggestion I would give to the company, make it easier to scroll through the 100s of items....or maybe I need to use the filters better, so it could be user error.😆",5
16015,horrible customer service; they ignore your concerns and they respond with the same copy and pasted words,1
16016,It's a cool idea but to involved with what they pay for items,4
16017,great app very easy to manuever highly rexommend,5
16018,great,5
16019,"I love everything I got from my first order! The package arrived days earlier than expected, and they wrapped it up nicely in the package! Such cute packaging also! I'm hooked!",5
16020,I LOVE thredUP!!!,5
16021,Love this app! the only negative is that it is addicting,5
16022,Love the app and the store!,5
16023,great selection to browse through! Always adding new things!,5
16024,love it ❤🤩,5
16025,the ux needs a big overhaul. searching for items is clunky and not intuitive.,3
16026,loooooove it,5
16027,great deals on nice clothes,4
16028,quality for less,5
16029,Good shopping experience.,5
16030,"The only bad thing is it can sometimes be tricky to search through all of the options, even after trying to narrow it down with the filter.",4
16031,It is a lot of fun & has really so much to choose from!!!,5
16032,"My first but definitely NOT my last ""shopping trip"" on thredUP!! I'm super excited about my deals!!!",5
16033,Not very user friendly,1
16034,I will definitely not recommend any one to used this aap for shipping poor costumer service and has no shipping on time the day they say today by end of the day package will be delivered but the end of the day is over but packages not there i try to track it it shows blank so plz dont use this aap 😡🤬😡,1
16035,aaaaahhhh!! this is great!,5
16036,I love Thredup. I've purchased a lot from the company. I am digging the new app. Very addictive and lots of great finds.,5
16037,poor customer service,3
16038,great selection if items are described correctly,4
16039,Develop a Men's section,1
16040,"very good, highly satisfied customer",5
16041,the clothes suck,1
16042,Great finds at great prices!,5
16043,Fun and easy to use! I have had great success buying my clothes on Thred Up. best part is how reliable their customer service and returns are. I also love how accurate the discriptions of each clothing item are.,5
16044,great. .. no problem's. I'll be back,5
16045,"OMG! This site is sooo addicting! I've spent 1000's here. My husband says I'm a shopaholic here. The key is to know your measurements, your body type and style. I've returned very few things. Love love love this site! Consider yourself warned...lol",5
16046,Don't send them your clothes if you are really trying to sell for a profit. If your intentions are to donate go for it.,1
16047,read descriptions about stains and wear of clothing,3
16048,Fun and easy shopping. Great bargains!,5
16049,Why does this app not have mens clothing?,3
16050,love it!! I buy almost all of my clothes here,5
16051,Awesome,5
16052,Excellent business model and get customer service.,5
16053,such nice stuff cheap! better than Ebay!!,5
16054,idk yet,1
16055,love this app! makes thrifting so much easier.,5
16056,Good app and good cause. I try to buy used vs new for most of my clothes and thred up makes it easy. one thing is that it doesn't save my sizes so I have to filter every time I go to a new category.,4
16057,"Wonderful service, love this company!",5
16058,"I buy so much of my clothing from ThredUp, it's low-key ridiculous. I tell everyone I know about it because I love it so much! Although it doesn't offer the immediate gratification of thrifting, ThredUp does allow me to surf through thousands of brand name articles of clothing at prices I am willing to shop (call me frugal). From time to time, I have also sold some of my clothing back to ThredUp to continue the cycle in a very painless drop-the-bag-full-of-clothes-at-the-post-office kind of way.",5
16059,"addicted to this app! I love the options, the layout, and the ease of shopping! I recommend it to everyone looking for deals.",5
16060,Online Treasure Hunt!,5
16061,Best thing EVER!,5
16062,best app ever!!!!,5
16063,"app works well. i like that i can save my sizes, it remembers what i removed from the cart, it keeps promo codes easily accessible. I'd like to be able to select ""must be petite""",4
16064,This app doesnt have mens clothing at all. I just dont understand why an app would literally not even have the capability for men to use it. This app is garbage.,1
16065,Love the app!!,5
16066,No mens section,1
16067,pretty big rip off for clothes. you wont even get 1$ back for each item! better off having a yard sale or just donating them.,1
16068,one of the best apps I've ever used.,5
16069,nice clothes at reasonable prices,5
16070,the clothes i get have been great and fit well.,5
16071,There are so many things to choose from. such a fun experience.,5
16072,Absolutely LOVE this app! I just have had the time to get acquainted and I'm loving the box idea.. going to get to know this app more intimately !,5
16073,Easy to navigate.,5
16074,returns !!! I returned 35.00 boots by postal service for 13.00.Did not know that there were so much trouble as l return something.So now l have no boots and 35.00 that l just lost.So no l wont be using yall.And word of mouth.If anything they could have sent the boots back.,1
16075,Clothes are not as good quality as pertrayed.,1
16076,I've been buying clothes second hand for years now. This app makes it so easy to find the brands/styles that you are looking for and the feature to customize to your sizes is great too. I'd recommend this app to anyone!,5
16077,Awesomeness!!!,5
16078,so easy,5
16079,thumbs up,5
16080,"Thred-up is the real deal. everything they say they do in their literature and on the web, they really keep their word! It's very refreshing. I like website, easy to move around most of the time Theirs just one little hiccup, once your in an item and you want to get an go back to where you were, it doesn't always happen that way. you may end up at the top of the search page instead of the item you were just looking.",4
16081,Love the petite selection. I always choose new or like new so the clothes I buy look brand new.,5
16082,great gifts for my wife,5
16083,"FABULOUS finds...designer items at a fraction of the cost! Quick shipping, great place to use the Closet Cleanout bags for nearly new or items with the tags still on them! Also, price drop alerts on favorited items!",5
16084,Great!!!,5
16085,I sent every item back 2 wks ago and they charged my account yet again causing me another overdraft fee. and contacted customer service via chat and theyll get back to me in a few days???? bs,1
16086,cannot create an account!!,1
16087,it chill,5
16088,easy to use app. great clothes and great for the environment.,5

16090,great prices,5
16091,The app and the concept of Thredup work fantastic in my opinion.,5
16092,"Stay away!! The worst customer service I have had to work with. They sent me incorrect sizing for goody boxes on multiple occasions including sending me maternity pants when I've never indicated I'm pregnant, and I'm not. I contacted customer support to get it resolved and they told me nothing could be done and I'd still have to pay a penalty for not keeping anything in the box. I feel like I've been robbed.",1
16093,"Zero response from customer service when I realized my address was not correct after my order. I contacted within an hour of placing order. And three additional times since. No response either via app or email. Post office didn't forward to our new address and fed-ex will only adjust delivery address for the sender. Clothes over bought in the past were great, but service after the sale stinks!",1
16094,addictive!!!,5

16096,Actually kind of fun to peruse. Some of the items are kind of pricey.,4
16097,"when selling stuff they pretty much have rip you off. I sent in 14 items to them 5 were items I previously purchased from them, 9 items were not previously purchased from them. they kept 5 out of 14 . I was told in a email that the other stuff I sent would be repurposed. The 9 other stuff I sent in consisted of 5 pants, 4 were brand new w/ tags, 3 brand new t-shirts no tags, and 1 pair of flip flops brand new. I have tried talking to their customer service all morning but they are not answer",1

16099,love this app! great prices for name brands that last....,5
16100,I've placed a few orders and they've all been a great experience. Only had to return a couple of items and the process was very easy. Love thredUP!,5
16101,I find nice quality clothing items so much cheaper than in the stores where I live. I'm pleased with most of the things I have ordered. Returns are super easy too.,5
16102,Great place to shop online with home delivery.,5

16104,enjoying the experience,4
16105,awesome customer experience,5
16106,This is a great app try it you will fall in love .,5
16107,ThredUp is a neat way to clean out your personal closet and gain space while swapping for a fresh look on their app. I've sent in several clean out bags and have been satisfied with their service and quality of clothing received.,5
16108,though I would have gotten an extra discount.,4
16109,Orders arrive on time ordered a pair of Nike shoes was sent two different sizes can't wear them ☹️ can't get in touch with no customer service repres 😵,1
16110,"i sent an item back that was described as medium, when i received it, it was a small to xs. i contacted thread up and since it was a final sale was told id receive a check in the mail. i sent it back 7/8 and have not received anything. ive tried chatting with someone and no response. ive read that other people have experienced the same problem with items not being the described size, i will probably stick to poshmark from now on, since they resolve issues almost immediately.",1
16111,"This app is absolutely wonderful! I love every piece that I've bought from here. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I have yet to hear back from customer service about an issue I had with an order. Besides that, I am in love and think this app is the best ever! UPDATE: My issue was resolved. High opinion restored!",5
16112,Customer service chat was supposedly updated but I sent 3 messages with no response to either message. The first msg disappeared completely. They obviously did not test it before executing the new system. It doesn't work.,1
16113,Love the savings and so easy to use! Even get daily emails for new items from any catagory you want...like heels!,5
16114,"Improved app, bugs worked out. They notify you of discount codes during sales and if you want to be notified of an item once its no longer in someone else's cart, you get an alert to your phone. Amazing! LOVE ThredUp, I've found some of my fav pieces here! Edit 7/23/19: Still great! I check ThredUp first for certain styles before shopping mainstream. My husband works for an earth-conscience company and is impressed with what I find and keep out of landfills. Will there ever be Men's clothing??!",5

16123,"Like it a lot. Only thing i absolutely hate about ur site, u totally upped the charge of clothing since u seemed to be getting too big for your britches. The owner seemed to be ""nice"" when they started out, but now seems to be a total ass.",5

16132,"good online and mobile interface. only things I'd recommend is adding lace in the accents section...and pockets as well. women and children want and need pockets... functional pockets. on skirts, dresses, pants, skirts, shirts, etc. not just shallow, decorative pockets that don't hold anything/stuff falls out of.",4

16134,"UPDATE: I decided to give the app another chance & I've been rewarded with missing packages and zero customer service support. Also, thanks for charging shipping fees for items that failed to actually get delivered. What a joke. The design of the app is clearly aiming to be user friendly (which is nice) but the execution isn't quite there. The buggy search features are enough to make me stop searching; it's a shame because I think would use this service a lot more otherwise.",1
16135,good,3
16136,good prices,5
16137,do not bother trying to sell your items I haven't received my items back their fees are high and they give you pennies for your items,1

16142,"I love the goody boxes, I'm a busy mom of 3 Littles under 5 and I don't have time to go shopping and pick things out, let alone try them on there. The goody boxes work great for me, they pick clothes out they think I might like and they arrive, I try them on, I keep what I want and send the rest back. The price is more then my local thrift store but I'm okay with that because of the convince factor for me.",5

16157,"Super easy to buy and sale. I have been using ThreadUp since 2016. The company is great. The app makes getting new and used fashion items in any style super easy. Plus, there is always discounts and sales. One can track their own consignment merch using the app too.",5

16162,Great hard to find large shoe sizes for women! I love the thread up website lay-out. I appreciate having 24 hours to think over my purchase. My wardrope is growing leaps and bounds!,5
16163,"I was excited to find an app that would allow me to get rid of clothes and make extra money. Only 9 items were accepted. The potential payout for those items is a complete insult. I have a dress that's selling for $16.99, but only will receive $1.70. I definitely won't be using Thredup again.",1
16164,Always have a great experience with my orders!,5
16165,"Pretty neat concept. I've been using this app for a couple years now, and it wasn't long before I found myself addicted! Great bargains! Decent selection! Undoubtedly recommend - especially to anyone that is shopping for kids. It's not always very easy to find good quality, and for a super affordable price - but this app makes it possible! I definitely recommend it!",5
16166,Easy-to-use and does just what you need it to do.,5
16167,no mens,1
16168,Great place to shop and find great deals!!,5
16169,"I've bought some rather nice items from ThredUp in the past, but overall the shopping experience is lacking. They don't provide measurements for clothing items and only attach two photos per item. A few items that I've bought from them have had ""surprise"" features that you couldn't see in the photos. Their customer service is TERRIBLE. I tried to get in touch with someone for a week to change my shipping address, but no one ever got back to me. There are better, less expensive thrifting apps.",2
16170,too high of prices,1
16171,An awesome experience every time!!!,5
16172,"this is my FAVORITE place to shop now. i check the app CONSTANTLY for deals. I have found my favorite brands for up to 75% off. i have nothing negative to say. love love love. my latest order was 78.00 and i got 2 shirts and a dress from lane bryant, along with a skirt and 4 pairs of jeans. i am so happy with this app. ive ordered at least 40 pieces of clothing already snd have only been disappointed in one. if youre on the fence about trying it, i urge you to. just once is all it takes!",5
16173,I have loved my experience with Thred Up. The app works great and is easy to navigate and my buying experience has been really great too. I'll definitely keep using it!,5
16174,awesome finds here all the time luv it,5
16175,looks cool... to bad theres no mens.. welp ill take my money somplace else..,1
16176,wish there were better descriptions like belt length etc. Would make it easier to order.,4
16177,great place to buy from but don't send them your clothes if you expect to make anything they don't pay nothing. if they make $25 you make $1.25.,3
16178,"I have received a curated goody box (stylist's choice) and ordered various pieces for me, my tween-aged daughter, and my septuagenarian mother... everything has been gorgeous.",5
16179,Great clothes good prices. No hassles. Love it. It is the best shopping experience I've had online.,5
16180,easy to search!,5
16181,Love the discounts!!,5
16182,"I haven't been able to get the app to open in over a week. Yes it is updated. changing fr9m a 5 star to a 4 star because of this. otherwise I love it, just very frustrated right now.",4
16183,Good quality of clothes,4
16184,so far so good,5
16185,Very easy to navigate and clean design.,5
16186,"always satisfied, can't beat the prices, timely shipping and arival.... Proud to say my whole wardrobe comes from thredUp!",5
16187,It is so fun finding nice clothing at a great price!,5
16188,WHERE IS CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Been offline now for 3 days!!! Please fix or start talking to people. That is what you are there for. Not to hide and not talk to anyone....,2
16189,updating for what?,1
16190,Fantastic!,5
16191,"My stylist sent me clothes that didn't match things I liked in the website or styles I asked for at all. The website is very hard to navigate when I'm trying to find answers, no numbers and the chat option is only between certain times. I wanted to speak to customer service to give them a chance to make things right before I left this review but the only way to get in touch is through the chat and with the work schedule I have I can't get with them before the chat people are offline. Email no go",1
16192,I love this app it GREAT most everything my sister gets is awesome and its cheap. i have a wish list im new but everyone i know loves it,5
16193,"My concerns have been ignored multiple times. I have reached out to them 7/15 via chat and they keep closing down my messages without any acknowledgement. I'm still trying to contact them until now 7/19 even via email, chat, & messenger and there's still no response or any kind of resolution to the questions I have sent!!!!! Extremely disappointed with Customer Support. This doesn't feel like you actually care about customers' concerns at all! AND I STILL DON'T HAVE MY REFUND!!!",1
16194,overpriced! 👎👎👎👎,1
16195,totally luv,5
16196,Love the clothes and can always find a deal. It's fun for someone who is looking for a bargain.,5
16197,good,3
16198,they don't like giving you your money they hold your money hostage can you spend it with them so basically you giving them clothes just to buy their clothes I am so disappointed and threadup and out I would never do business with them again I don't want no more they bags or nothing,1
16199,Nice items.,5
16200,exceptional service and my package came 2 days before expected delivery date i will be a returning customer,5
16201,"They seem confused about what they are selling. Why would I ever give you $20 for a pair of old Navy jeans used, what I can buy brand new pair for penny less.",1
16202,easy app to use nice clean clothees arrived in a cute box within a week thanks,5
16203,A+,5
16204,"I just simply enjoy looking, and shopping using Thred's App. Thanks",5
16205,Awesome clothing at unfathomable prices! The compliments I receive on my attire never cease!,5
16206,like alot,5
16207,By far one of the best resale clothing apps available. product is as described once you are aware of how they size.,5
16208,I've bought tons of clothes here and have never been dissapointed.,5
16209,love the deals!!!,5
16210,Not even close to thrift or consignment store pricing. Not worth my time looking online because I can find more items faster and for a fraction of the price at an actual thrift store.,1
16211,I love this app,5
16212,great,5
16213,"Thanks I'm fully addicted to your app. It's completely amazing and life changing, and don't download this app unless you want to spend all your money!!! I feel slightly less guilty knowing that I'm buying secondhand and at very reasonable prices, but I wasn't shopping hardly at all before, and now I can't stop!!! hahahahahahaha (crazy eyes)",5
16214,just made my first purshase... super excited to receive my items!,5
16215,"sizes not true, quality is good however descriptions are poorly written",3
16216,amazing deals! I am so excited about this app,5
16217,Love this place!,5
16218,item received full of dirt. contacted company and no response. I will not be recommending them to anyone. and don't believe pictures they didn't show lines in the fabric but sure came with a line pattern. will never order again from them.,1
16219,"App works well, easy to use, I've been satisfied with app and purchases.",4
16220,I thought the quick service and quality of my purchases have been excellent. I don't normally rate but I felt this was exceptional and deserved to be recognized. the clothes were even better in person!,5
16221,"Love, love, love thredUP!! Haven't been disappointed with anything! I've been saving for, at least, two years, now, and an so glad I found them!!",5
16222,Very easy to use and I liked that there were plenty of filter options to help me find just the perfect dress for my daughter!,5
16223,"Great app, great choices. I do wish they would not put sizes that you cannot wear under ""you might like these."" I mark what I can wear. Seeing pretty clothes in size s, xs and xxs only makes me want to leave the app. Show me things in the sizes I marked please. I don't understand why you do that. It's irritating. Also, please be careful when marking waist & breast measurements. I see something that I want, in what you have in the description as my exact size. Buy it. Then can't even get it on.",4
16224,The App made scrolling through products alot easier and saved time. I also like that the discount codes are displayed at checkout.,5
16225,love the site's concept but the design not so much. it seems to show the same items over and over.,3
16226,Lot's of choices at great prices. I really enjoy shopping on this site. I have received lot's of great clothing and purses.,5
16227,love it,5
16228,Awesome app!! So many well known branded clothes that are brand new to gently used for such good deals! Already have placed two orders with ThredUp since downloading the app! I do hope they get a men's section soon though! My husband is jealous! haha,5
16229,they dont give 6much money for your items and you have to wait 2 weeks to cash out. HATE IT,1
16230,"everything is exactly as described, great quality and even more amazing price!",5
16231,Total ripoff... they scam you beware! Worst company ever and customer service is a big zero! Don't waste your time or money on this company!,1
16232,"Love it, using the app is better than the eebsite in my opinion.",5
16233,"Customer support totally ignores you. Not worth it. You can spend your money but customer support is pretty much non-existent thereafter, Don't do it! They mislead their customers into thinking they can recieve timely assistance via chat but you will be waiting because they never even RESPOND!",1
16234,"at first, I loved the app. a great selection of clothes, and you could find some inexpensive peices. I've ordered alot from thredup, and 5/10 they send me a different size then listed. you just have to be careful. maybe order accessories instead of clothing from here. also, for some reason the new update made every item have no description?",2
16235,I was only on the app for a few minutes looking for some denim shorts and the prices seemed a bit ridiculas! I thought this was suppose to be a thrift store app!,2
16236,Love my app & my deals!,5
16237,fun,5
16238,love it,5
16239,"love threadup, no need to shop anywhere else",5
16240,awesome service. Great clothing at prices I can afford,5
16241,have lots of fun shopping various brands.,5
16242,great app! great idea!!,5
16243,love this app. so easy to order.,5
16244,its ok but much easier on a computer,3
16245,Amazing to get NEW EXPENSIVE NAME BRAND FOR GOOD PRICES,5
16246,I love how I can save clothes and go back and decide what I still want. I love this site!!,5
16247,I love Thredup! most of my clothes are from here. I love that they have a mobile app now so that I can easily search for what I need at any given moment.,5
16248,very enjoyable,5
16249,Spot on second hand store with first hand goods.,5
16250,"I'm giving it a two star because they do have some cute clothes, but some almost most of the clothes I hearted are a little expensive which I thought this was suppose to be an online thrift store to pay less.. it says 90% off but I see $15 to $20 dollar pieces on here.. you don't pay 15 to 20 dollars on a romper at the thrift store.. even some of the dress are expensive... I tried to do a goody box but it didnt let me check out and I filled out all the questions.",2
16251,so easy!,4
16252,excellent experience,5
16253,This app is horrible! It is only for women and mothers. What kind of business are they running? This is disrespectful!,1
16254,"Great app except for when using email links. I received a survey request in my email recently; when I click the link, the app opens but just stalls on the home page. Taking the survey is supposed to get me credit toward a purchase, so it's pretty disappointing! And, sometimes when clicking on a promoted item in an email, the app opens to a blank page and never loads. It's inconsistent. Otherwise, the app works very well.",3
16255,wonderful,5
16256,"Um women and kids, no men's?",1
16257,I love it. I get great deals for my family and I'm able to sell as well and make a side income. I love ThredUp.,5
16258,"love the app, easy to use and search function is pretty comprehensive. wish there was some way to weed out specific items from search results (like the opposite of a favorite button)",4
16259,dont sell clothes here! total rip off!!,1
16260,I've received a lot of great stuff from thred up at huge savings,5
16261,"Good quality second-hand clothes for women and children, with a huge selection. App is easy to use. Check this out if you enjoy thrifting and second-hand shopping. I will add that I previously rated this at five stars, but my recent customer service experience has prompted me to change it. I had a hard time getting any response about a missing item, trying via the app and email. Very disappointing since I enjoyed shopping with them in the past.",3
16262,I love most of the items I've ordered and the items i didnt love were easily returned. my clean out bag process was easy and I received more $ than Plato's wanted to give me! I used it as thredup credit cuz mama needed some cute sandals!,5
16263,Literally my favorite way to shop now. I wish I could refine my favorites when searching for something specific. And I wish I could save all my favorite brands instead of only being able to save searches. It also takes forever for them to review and post about clothing you send in. But all in all it is great for a wardrobe swap from time to time.,4
16264,very nice variety,5
16265,"Great deals, New Clothes,Shoes,with tags still on them,gently used clothes.Huge selection of clothes,shoes,and accessories.",5
16266,i love that i can shop by brand. reasonable prices,4
16267,I really enjoyed the shopping experience. Can't wait to receive my items.,5
16268,nathin for actual men,1
16269,I like the product comparison,5
16270,"I like selling and buying on this site - never had a bad experience over the years and like the recycling of clothes. We all buy nice things, however, we cannot always make use of them, so making sure the items are not thrown away is important. Selling gives the opportunity to buy something nice. Very pleased!",5
16271,great to find items from brands that you love!,5
16272,nice clothes and sizes .,5
16273,Great clothes for a great price!,5
16274,"Great app, easy to search",5
16275,awesome ...I love it very happy,5
16276,"Nice overall... Until you receive a dress that wasn't desribed, listed, or had details shown that it was a maternity dress! Black strapless GAP dress recieved... low & behold, ""Maternity"" on the tag! Also received a pink dress with severe faded coloring at hem and side of dress (not in photos!) -- go figure, BOTH items are not able to be returned. So much for their ""meticulous"" and ""high standards"" of inspecting clothing... not cool ThredUp. After spending $300+ ... Next please! (shop local!)",1
16277,"just learned about it, I have lot's of item's for sale and I thought it would be a wonderful way to give back. I thank you very much.",5
16278,buying second hand is much easier with thred up.,5
16279,Perfect app for anyone who doesn't like shopping or feeding the fashion industry!,5
16280,uninstalling,1
16281,"great selection, pricing and service! thank you!",5
16282,They make it easy for you to sell items however they make it extremely difficult for you to cash out. It's structured for you to use your credit to purchase clothing. I 've emailed tredup with my cash out issues and I NEVER received a respone.,2
16283,Awesome prices and quick shipping Edit : I'm removing 2 stars because the promo codes never work. Update: customer service to reply to me very quickly. I got the promo codes to work. Putting back 5 stars.,5
16284,"Customer service sucks. Its a long and ardguous trip to get sny info and often doesnt ask the questions I need answered . ie, Please send me another return lablel to my email. I can not get through to ""my account"". There is a deadline. plz hurry. Hope this gets to someone.",1
16285,great stuff and prices,5
16286,"Fun to shop, easy returns",5
16287,AWFUL customer service. No response in weeks and I was charged in full for a box I returned. Negative 5 stars.,1
16288,love it!,5
16289,Quality products. Enjoying my time spent here lately!,5
16290,love everything i have purchased!,5
16291,Exceptional,5
16292,great 35% welcome back coupon!,5
16293,"Its pretty cool if you don't mind taking risks on clothing you can't try on. Returning clothes is often an added cost. But the sheer volume of clothing is good. Especially if all you need is a basic pair of work pants. This review has recently been edited, the customer service here came in clutch for me.",5
16294,So fun to find deals.,5
16295,great,5
16296,nice I like it 👍,5
16297,love it,5
16298,"Using this company has so far been awful and I regret ever downloading it. I ordered 4 items, described as either like new or gently used. Everything I received is trash and it SMELLS. It smells musty like it has been in someone's basement for a decade. I have repeatedly reached out to their customer service via chat and email (they have NO phone number) and have gotten no response. Two items were returned and two are ineligible for return but why should I pay for MISREPRESENTED merchandise.",1
16299,"returns are a hassle , consigning you diffently get pennies on the dollar . upside you diffently come across unique items but really buyer beware kinda situation.",3
16300,super easy to use and addictive!,5
16301,love it! great prices. quick shipping!,5
16302,Thred Up had all my favotite brands. The merchandise is beautiful. Thr prices are fabulously low too!,5
16303,horrible customer service unable to reach anyone via chat support after several purchases missing items that I paid for I like the items and prices but I dont think I will continue purchasing from this site very dissatisfying,1
16304,"I love the idea of saving money and recycling old items. Very disappointing app overall. First complaint there are only 2 pics offered of each item. I will not spend $500 on a designer bag without being able to see it throughly. Second, I filled a 12 pound bag with nice clothes and only 7 pieces were selected to list. IF all 7 pieces sell, I will earn 11 bucks. Really? I could have sold them in a garage sale and gotten more. I will not be sending them anything else to sell or donate.",1
16305,The app is great..Thred Up is a joke!! Yard sale or Facebook sell. You will make more money verses Thred Up you literally MIGHT make 5 bucks for your 30 pound bag of clothing...MAYBE!!!,1
16306,LOVE this app!,5
16307,I sent at least 200 dollars worth of clothes and I got 65 cent for a few things a waste. I am soo unsatisfied with this .,1
16308,"love this app...quality of clothing is awesome, easy to use, quick zero waste shipping.. just amazing!!",5
16309,I just signed up and downloaded this. first time ever. 1st thing you ask is to rate this AP. okay but you need to allow people who get the ap to use it first!,5
16310,"The app is better than the website. Wish they separated tops into business wear. Lots to choose from in Women's wear. It'd be cool if they had a Men's section, especially business wear. Some of the pictures could be better for details and wear style. The sizing could be better categorized.",3
16311,I have bought a lot of dresses on this site. I have never been disappointed in size or quality.,5
16312,"What happened to specific measurements on shirts? Used to give chest and overall length measurements in inches. Now I have no idea if anything is actually going to fit. And I'm not going to buy something, without being confident that it's actually going to fit me. Cause now y'all are charging $1.99 restock fee on every item. I would lose so much money! Yay for the company. Boo for customers. From now on I will just buy jeans from here. At least those have measurements, so I know if they'll fit.",3
16313,they dont like working with you when packages come up missing,1
16314,Am I missing something or is there really not a section for mens clothing?,1
16315,I have built a very nice wardrobe using this site! Beautiful items at minimum cost.,5
16316,easy,5
16317,I love using this app. It's like going to the thrift store but you can always find new and in style items!,5
16318,Disappointed in this company now. Pay outs poor.,2
16319,such a good app to get discounts on expensive brands,5
16320,love thrredup have found tons of great deals.,5
16321,easy to find brand and size,5
16322,Love this app for shopping. Great clothes for great prices.,5
16323,"good way to shop when on a tight budget, as well as give you opportunity to make a little cash",5
16324,Wonderful!,5
16325,love it,5
16326,"hands down one of my favorite apps to purchase on when it comes to second hand shopping! I always find stellar deals, and if once in a blue moon something doesn't work out, returns are extremely easy and always go smoothly!",5
16327,I got 300.00 + worth of stuff for 95.55 for my son. i used it all the time. Its great!,5
16328,just ok. taking so long to process kind of makes me think their business model isn't working. App looks nice.,3
16329,Aimed for females and women buyers and sellers.,2
16330,"great prices, great quality items,I have been a customwr for years, almost everything I have is second hand from thredup.",5
16331,easy to use,5
16332,I love everything i have gotten so far.,5
16333,no mens clothing?! uninstalled,1
16334,Addicting!! It's awesome that there are so many ways to shop now. Love ThredUP and love the improvements to the app!! ❤,5
16335,made my first order and recieved my items fast. also i should state what an amazing deal they gave me as an incentive for first time shopping. am so happy with purchase. the only thing i would change is the reserve of an item in carts most times u will miss out otherwise the app is very easy to use! will purchase more soon **update** I have since made 3 more huge orders from thred up. I am just so happy. I've been buying for my girls as well and the prices cannot be beat. the sales are great too,5
16336,I love it. very convenient. shopping at 2am. when I can't sleep. LOL.,5
16337,Awesome shopping! Easy to use and free shipping! Love it!!!,5
16338,😀,5
16339,"Until my last order (I've ordered a lot from Thred Up) I always gave them 5 stars. My last order, however, ended up with the wrong price for the item (they said it was a glitz on their side). I accepted that. I answered their confirming email, asking them to expedite & charge me for it. I was told I had selected Bag and Bundle (I'd never heard of). I didn't get my order for about 2 1/2 weeks! Missed wearing the expensive dress for what I bought it for. They did give me a percentage off.",3
16340,the clothes are nice not badly priced and ive also donated clothes as well,4
16341,if i could give this no stars i would! Crooks! I recieved a confirmation for an order placed for a series of 4 packages to be deliver totaling $360 and only recieved one package with 2 items in it. No one will they reapond to my multiple attempts to get ahold of them. Steer clear of this site!!!,1
16342,"I love thredup! I always shop at local thrift stores, but it's nice to have an online one when I cant seem to find anything! I do wish they paid out more on things that were sent in and that they accepted more things However, I love the updates they've done and look forward to seeing what they will do in the future!",4
16343,"i absolutely Live Thredup, i am extremely satisfied with every purchase",5
16344,loved it,5
16345,love the app! love the store!! thredup is my go to before purchasing any clothing at any other stores..,5
16346,Great prices! Many discounts offered ^_^,5
16347,Love Thredup! Best deals ever!,5

16350,absolutely love my new shirt.,5
16351,Love the variety of great clothes.,5
16352,I like this app but yet to buy anything.,4
16353,"App ok. selling is not so great. they ship you a bag, you fill it up. they post a fraction of the products you send for peanuts.",2
16354,love love love this app!! amazing prices and easy to use!!,5
16355,Absolutely in love with everything I've purchased from here,5
16356,everything I recieve is in such yreat shape and fits,5
16357,love it!,5
16358,"love, love, love thred up. it has become a life saver for my wallet. name brand items for so much less. great",5
16359,so many options at great prices!!!,5
16360,The app works great! It's a great place to shop!,5
16361,One of my favorite clothing shopping apps by far!! Ive saved over $700 on my last 7 items! Im addicted to ThredUP! Take my money!!,5
16362,dangerous addictive i spent way more than i thought i would because i love to thrift shop and they had a good selection.,4
16363,"I've made many large purchases and it works well. Discount codes help a lot. Ideal for ppl who can't walk through stores for hours. I would buy men's clothes if they carried. Frustrating to have bust or waist size in the description but the app won't filter by them. It takes 4-5 hours to click through enough items to fill a cart, when bettering filtering would save so much time. Some waist sizes are available in filter but very limited, and results still show sizes not selected.",4
16364,"This app is amazing, plus I love this website. I can always find good deals!",5
16365,Recently found out about this app/company - and I'm digging it so far! You could spend hours just scrolling through all the clothes.,5
16366,"I love their approach to recycling clothing,",5
16367,"Got my first poke-a-dot package today and I LOVE IT! Shipped quickly, everything true to size, and great quality. The pricing was unbelievable. Can't wait for my next shopping spree (esp w/o the guilt)🎁🎁🎁🐈🐈🐵",5
16368,some of the clothes are in good shape but I won't order again. I was supposed to receive a Thred up box but never got it but they charged me $229 for it anyway even though I emailed them and told them I did not receive the box.,1
16369,best prices and great clothes!!!!,5
16370,easy to use and I have not encountered any glitches,5
16371,i love this app. let's you shop at your own convenience and returns are a snap. kept majority of what i purchased. pricing is fair and the fact that i don't have to go to the store makes this my new preferred shopping experience,5
16372,Best 2nd hand shopping experience!,4
16373,the best place,5
16374,love the variety. love not spending unnecessarily on perfectly good clothes.,5
16375,"total ripoff, sellers and buyers beware, how this is an editor's choice app is beyond me unless the money that should have been paid to sellers went into payoffs to the editors. this company needs heavy investigation, particularly their alleged donations.",1
16376,"I absolutely love this app., I find the cutest things here. i just cant do without it!",5
16377,"Really disappointed. It is crazy that you can't get all of your stuff in one package. It took 2 weeks to get everything that I ordered from fedex. I have never had to wait that long for any package with USPS. In a lot of the packages, the clothes weren't even folded, they were just thrown in and were super wrinkly. Honestly the clothes aren't worth the prices that they're listed for, so it's not even worth ordering from with all of the hassle that comes with it.",1
16378,Ethical and easy,5
16379,all I get is the intro screen,2
16380,Easy app to use!,5
16381,easy to use,5
16382,love,5
16383,verry good,4
16384,"The app itself is awesome. I'm on it every day checking for price drops or sales for the items saved in my favorites. I have bought a lot of dresses from ThredUp, but I do think that many of the pre owned items are a bit pricey for being ""used."" Still, it is an awesome way to shop a huge variety of brands all in one spot. I have done a few cleanout bags so far and I think the amount you get for cleanout bag items is outrageously low. Better off going to a local consignment store if close by.",4
16385,awesome sales,5
16386,Phenomenal Shopping Experience!!,5
16387,love this app! U would never afford these brands new or get this quality of used anywhere else !!,5
16388,Love the app.,5
16389,Such a time saver! No need to waste time rummaging through clothes at a gigantic mall! Great customer service as well!,5
16390,fun and easy-going,5
16391,buyer beware,1
16392,"Easy and fun, plus you're recycling!",5

16394,"and the best store I have ever bought, here are all the brands and all the prices too. I love shopping here 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰",5
16395,Great deals and Fabulous Clothing!!,5
16396,fun store to find nice pre-owned clothes.,5
16397,not worth it,1
16398,pretty good app. sometime switching back and forth between the kids favorites and mine the app gets stuck. also searching stuff for kids is a little more complicated. but worth it for how much I save shopping.,4
16399,Love this ap! Everything is as-described and comes to you clean and ready. Beyond great deals and always throwing in random discounts.,5
16400,Easy to use and kind of addictive. can't wait to receive my first order. Already ordered one more time.,5
16401,"Overall I like this app & this business. I would like it if you could search by measurements rather than sizes, and I am not fond of the 1 hour cart during sales applying to ALL items - even the ones that the sale doesn't apply to.",3
16402,no customer service at all!!!,2
16403,very easy to use,5
16404,Its a good app. The sale notifications can be a bit much at times....but I do enjoy buying from there.,5
16405,I love the clothes and the great deals.,5
16406,Easy to use. Love the ability to personalize my shopping experience.,5
16407,"Used to be good, now it's pretty pitiful. I will no longer be shopping with them.",1
16408,"This review is based solely on the usability of the app. I do love Thredup and the products they sell, but the app itself needs work. 1. A fix of the search by price function is needed. if you are going to provide the ability to search by a certain dollar amount, please do not exclude most of the results in the range. 2. If you are going to allow us to sort results by price, then put all the items in that price there. Right now you have to scroll through the higher priced items to find the low.",5
16409,easy to shop. with quick processing times & excellent promotions. quality is as described.,5
16410,awesome!,5
16411,Easy to use :-),5
16412,Love it!! I have found amazing items at wonderful bargains!!,4
16413,"You cant beat the saving and selection plus youre saving the environment! Its a win, win, win situation. Thanks!",5
16414,excellent. shipping is quick and items as described,5
16415,great app and I appreciate the alerts and notifications! I am only giving it a 4 star because it freezes and exits abruptly sometimes. I'm enjoying it anyway.,4
16416,I hate shopping and I hate paying full price...thredUP is great!,5
16417,"Easy to order, great experience whenever I place an order. Very professional!",5
16418,fantastic way to buy used clothing and sell your own unwanted items.,5
16419,"I may never shop for new clothes again! Rather than bargain hunt on Amazon (and hope products are what they claim), or wait for sales and coupons at Macy's, or paw through racks at Nordstrom Rack, I can now buy high end designer clothes and handbags for less than I used to spend, brands that I used to only dream about.",5
16420,Normally the cart holds your items for 24 hours but out of nowhere it was for 59 minutes without any warning 😡,2
16421,I've fallen in love with ThredUp. I can search for specifics and always find what I'm looking for. I've not been disappointed with any purchase and I've gotten some awesome deals!,5
16422,awesome,5
16423,"Great app. Clean design and user friendly, autobuy feature now available through it.",5
16424,I'm a regular ThredUp customer and use the app every time now. I love shopping second hand for sustainability and to avoid unethical fashion....also more affordable since I don't have enough time to thrift!,5
16425,ok,5
16426,I love this site! I get so many compliments on my outfits and I can't help but tell everyone what great prices I buy them at. I have also began buying my daughter's (14) clothing from here as well. I recommend this website to everyone to try!,5
16427,Best online consignment store available. LOVE LOVE LOVE!,5
16428,Love this app,5
16429,This app use to have great deals but their prices seem to be increasing more. I rather pay the money for something new vs their cost. I use to shop on this app a lot but I haven't found any good deals lately. Every once in awhile they'll have a good sale.,3
16430,addictive and fun! great customer support!!,5
16431,Great experience so far with both Goody Boxes and orders!,5
16432,I like this app for buying used name brand clothing.,5
16433,Very easy to browse and order.So much to choose from.,5
16434,Great shopping experience and beautiful items.,5
16435,"really good for deals, sometimes glitchy with the cart. Size inclusive",4
16436,Love thredUP!!! I have purchased several times over the past few years and saved a ton of money clothing my family.,5
16437,lm always excited to get things,5
16438,Love this app :-),5
16439,They have a large selection of clothing in very good condition. Prices are great and they are always having extra discounts. The website is user friendly.,5

16444,Love!,5
16445,Awesome app,5
16446,very little choice on juniors clothing,1
16447,"so incredibly bad. clothes were hideous and they didnt match my style profile at all. plus sized girls, stear clear of ThredUp. I returned everything in my box witht trying it on its was so bad.",1
16448,awesome,5
16449,tons of threds for amazing prices. love love love. just got to + mens and it would be for the whole fam. 😎,5
16450,This is a joke! over priced used clothes and you do not even have mens!,1
16451,I'm positively in love with ThredUp,5
16452,L O V E,5
16453,dress was packaged so nice . Received my dress as pictured quickly. I love thred up. Would definitely recommend thred Up.I will buy again on this app.,5
16454,i couldn't find clothes for me my style,1
16455,I've had never experienced outstanding customer service or accuracy from ordering online. the clothes are to DIE for. im buying all my daughter's back to school clothes from Thred Up for sure.,5
16456,do not do the clean out. you send in beand new items with tags and they mark them used.,1
16457,so far so good!,4
16458,i lost my consignment shop so i went searching for new ones and stumble across thred up and gave them a try and been happy ever since and would highly recommend them to everyone...,5
16459,It makes shopping easy,5
16460,"Good selection, great prices",5
16461,no male clothing items,1
16462,my orders arrive in a timely manner and customer service is very helpful items are just as picture or better 😉 very satisfied customer,5
16463,Great looking products at reasonable prices!,5
16464,like the shopping experience,5
16465,The thread's up app is awsome.,3
16466,to expensive,2
16467,love it!,5
16468,Choose sizes & check dimensions each time. Great shopping experience. I really like the sales.,4
16469,Works well. Searching is occasionally glitchy but not so much that it prevents me from shopping.,4
16470,good app easy to use. the filter on searches does not always work correctly,4
16471,This app is great! I find my favorite brands at the best prices!,5
16472,"Complete ripoff. The first two times I sent them clothes, I got a fair return. The third time, they gave me $17 for more than 30 items I sent in. All the clothes I sent were new/like-new - I couldve sold ONE of them on Postmark for more than $17. On top of that, they won't let me cash out on PayPal without a confirmation email they supposedly sent (I didn't have to do this the first two times), except the email never arrived. I guess they weren't making enough profit, so they've resorted to scamming people.",1
16473,found beautiful items and the app was easy to navigate!!!,5
16474,addicting,5
16475,love this app!!!,5
16476,Great place for luxury without the price!,5

16482,I love buying nice clothes at a great price!,5
16483,"Easy to use, love the variety and prices.",5
16484,"I absolutely love everything about thredUP! It is easy and fun and has saved me a ton of money! I don't even enjoy shopping in stores anymore, I'd rather find something on thredUP!",5
16485,saving me tons!,5
16486,"As a customer I'm disappointed in the app. Mainly cuz my first purchase was not as described. I'm a size XL to XXL so when filtering I always use my size to see what's available. I found a dress that was very nice looking and a great price in ""my size"". It came in and this dress is no where near a XL like it was categorized as. This is a medium maybe even a small. But I checked out other items in my size catagory and noticed some had descriptions with measurements that ARE NOT XL or XXL.",2
16487,a fantastic and smart place to shop,5
16488,great!,5
16489,fun shopping on a budget,5
16490,I have only purchased clothes through this app for several years now and I'm obsessed!,5
16491,love it!!,5
16492,"great clothes, great prices!",5
16493,"A lot of fun and savings HOWEVER dont bother selling your items here, they pay you next to nothing then sell your clothes high. Ive also caught them falsely escalating the original price. Additionally their software is rigged to hold your refunds until AFTER you pay for the items in your cart therefore ensuring that you can't use it until you buy even more. With as much money as they make they DO NOT have to cheat their customers and play so many games in order to make more!",3
16494,"The reason I gave it 3 stars is the search option...it doesnt work and is frustrating. Once I find what I need I live the layout, pricing, information and the way you save your favorites.",3
16495,have loved all the items I have bought thus far!!,5
16496,I haven't had a chance to use it yet.....,5
16497,so far very easy to use and cheap! waiting on my first order to see if the clothes are worth it,5
16498,love it! Thredup is amazing!,5
16499,Easy to use! Love this app!,5
16500,"some pictures of clothes are obviously wacky, as though they've been digitally grafted onto the mannequin. good quality clothes, but it's hard to tell if they'll fit (size and style)",4
16501,Easy to navigate. Clothes are well displayed and good description given for each. Love shopping for used clothing like this!!!,5
16502,I am in love with this app and I have been telling everyone I know about it!! Just received my first order and my jeans look brand new 🤗🤗 It came in a neat box & folded very nicely!! I will be ordering lots more of everything!!,5
16503,This is an incredible app!,5
16504,"I saw a commercial for thread up, and i thought, ima take a look. Its awesome! I got an authentic mk purse, and clthing for a great price. Try it. Its nice stuff at good prices.",5
16505,so convenient and quick! love the app!,5
16506,"I love the selection, great prices, armshair shopping & free returns. sometimes there is a restocking fee though. I just wish Thred Up offered e-gift cards.",5
16507,horrible payout!!! You are better off donating your items for a tax write off. They will sell your item for thirty dollars and your lucky to get three dollars. such a rip off! I sent in a stuffed full bag of clothes and boots most with tags and never been worn well over 50 items. I received seven dollars as a payout!!! lol!!! That's not even a dollar an item!! I will never buy anything or send anything again to thred up.,1
16508,"Overall, it's okay. You can get some unique pieces. But sometimes an item is labeled size 12 but it's way too small. And you might order a $50. dress that looks faded and old when you get it. I have filtered my searches for calf length dresses and I see knee length. I find you have to really examine what you order.",3
16509,There was no option for mens clothing,2
16510,"I have been purchasing new clothes with thredup for about 5 months now and over 15 pieces. I have not been disappointed in any piece. The descriptions are pretty much right on, shipping is fast, and I love the bundle option. I have secured what I wanted and can still add that red dress I am looking for and have 7 days to find it before they send my new found clothes with tags on them. So worth the time to shop with this company!",5
16511,waste of time. got nothing for the clothes,1
16512,Great selection of merchandise . Fun to shop on!,5
16513,There are plenty of choices. Filter options make it easy to find what you're searching for and I support the concept of reusing clothing. The only thing I don't enjoy is how long it takes to ship to you. Amazon prime's two day shipping has me spoiled.,4
16514,great app,5
16515,"The most beautiful clothes, at amazing prices, shipped promptly in a box with polka dot tissue paper - it's like receiving a present to self!",5
16516,Great deals and accurate description of clothes!,5
16517,best app ever,5
16518,"I get like new and tags still attached and have never been disappointed... clothes and bags included, even shoes! I've been shopping here for over 2 years",5
16519,"I've gotten some cute clothes for good deals. but I get frustrated with some app issues. Shorts/jeans will be listed as two different sizes, like a pair of shorts might be called ""26 waist shorts"" and then in the description it says 31 inch waist which is a huge difference. Do I believe the thumbnail description or the details?? Also the app prompts you to do certain things like favorite an item and save a search to get a 20% off coupon but it doesn't register those actions and you never get it.",2
16520,love it,5
16521,love all the good finds My favorite place to shop,5
16522,just love this app !!!!😉 what more can I say BUT LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!! I have my niece's loving this app .,5
16523,great brand name for low prices,5
16524,I recieved my goody box and I could not have been more pleased. I have used other companies and stylist but none never really listened to what I wanted. thredup did and I would recommend the goody boxes to everyone! Absolutely the best out there!,5
16525,such cute and cheap stuff! best app for used name brand!,5
16526,Best app ever for buying and selling secondhand!! I love how all of their shipping material is biodegradable!!,5
16527,"The app has some problems in filters, search and description of certain items. However, shipments are fast and accurate. I would recommend this app because there are some great deals here. Shopping here is fun!",3
16528,"Absolutely love it! The clothing prices, the ease of using the app and saving the environment. Highly recommend!",5
16529,love shopping on this site!,5
16530,sent in more than 10 new items. they only posted one. everything else is missing,5
16531,"I used this app as a seller to clean out my closet every now and then, but I'm over it and will sell to a different shop. The amount of money the company makes compared to what they pay you is ridiculous. I've heard things that make them seem too scammy. Personally, I sent in 2 pairs of designer stilettos, nearly perfect condition (worn once at an indoor event for 2 hours)...for some reason they weren't posted for sale. Maybe they ""recycled"" them and sold them in their own store, I dont know.",2
16532,Either a hit or complete miss with quality. even on brand names.,3
16533,Love this site. It's my favorite now! I shop from here constantly. #1 for me.,5
16534,"Buying: has great sort/search options, they have greatly improved. Good womens selections (poshmark has better) Kids and men's items more limited (but better than poshmark). Selling: same as brick consignment, not as good as poshmark but there's no work on your side.",4
16535,This is a great way to shop for high quality used clothing without having to haunt every thrift store in town. Everything I have bought has been great!,5
16536,not sure if it is the only one that is a great job thanks,5
16537,"App is easy to use, easy to bavigate, and I love this company! I have completely changed my outlook on shopping for clothes because of them. I choose used!",5
16538,Hands down the best way to shop if you have small children. So glad I can try things on in the comfort of my own home!,5
16539,Awesome clothes easy to find and easy on the environment.,5
16540,"There are a lot of bugs with the website and app. The search filter is poor and the filters are poor. I select waist sizes and pants that aren't my size appear in the search, but match my tops sizing. Very slow amd if you return back from any screen it takes you to the top or bottom of the page. The search filters really need to be fixed as it is all over the place. Same with the sizing.",3
16541,"Enjoying the Hunt....I've placed two orders. Can't wait to see my designer buys for less. I just received my 1st item. Great value, as good as described, fits perfect. 😎😎",5
16542,"shopping is fun.Items are over priced.Do not sell to them.They only pay 5%.I had many items. And alot were only payable below 60 cents.Half items had tags.If you do not choose store credit and have them keep the denied clothing,there are 2 fees that come out.It would have taken all the money.They make to much off us. Items like dresses that are to short to be a dress.More like tunics.NO MEASUREMENTS REALLY SHOWN.Then the hassle of a return and restock fees. Over charge bad quality stuff too.",3
16543,love the convenience of shopping at home. More clothing then I'd ever see in the store. Love everything I got! Highly recommend,5
16544,awesome,5
16545,Everything is like new!,5
16546,great!,5

16549,Awesome!,5
16550,Alluring and fun. All items are well presented and very tempting!,5
16551,Everything I have gotten through this website has exactly what was expected and I love it!,5
16552,this apk is only for women i download this apk thinking that I would be able to get a decent deal on chothing but i cant,1
16553,love this app. so clear and clean looking. every package is beautiful and well put together.,5
16554,I have purchased 5 designer handbags from ThredUp and have been pleased with all of them. Shipping & handling is slow process but I have found some great deals on ThredUp,4
16555,I absolutely love the thredUP app. Easy to use and totally convenient.,5
16556,"it's a real thrift store but better because you can sort the clothes by size, price, and namebrand!",5
16557,Having fun finding fashion. Pages come up in your size and likes. Whether you sell or buy always something for you. Great way to upcycle...,5
16558,I like the clothes they have.,5
16559,"amazing! best way to find affordable clothes in new or like new condition without having to go to a consignment store. I buy work clothes, athletic gear, swimsuits, and clothes for my kids on the thredup app, heard about it through the MFM podcast. no ads in this app, just sweet deals and convenient features",5
16560,very nice items brand new low prices.,5

16571,love love love the prices!!!,5
16572,love it,5
16573,My only issue is I wish all the clothing had full measurements in the descriptions. I've passed up many items because of this. Otherwise I really like ThredUP!,5
16574,love it,5
16575,love this app! easy to shop.,5
16576,better than going to a store!!,5
16577,Pretty good. Just gotta keep an eye on the measurements.,4
16578,Fenominal!,5
16579,luv it!!!!!!,5
16580,BEST way to shop!,5
16581,"I gave it one star because of the deceptive percentage off on over priced items. Many of the clothes I saw were very overpriced. You can get plain T-shirts at Target, new, for like $8 vs $15 for a used one here. My size was missing in pants, size 7. You can support local organizations by just shopping at thrift stores where the price will be better and the clothes can be tried on.",1
16582,app will not open says to try opening again which I did but never worked,1
16583,Always find something! I love it!,5

16589,"Awesome stuff, & easy to find.",5
16590,Always lots of variety to choose from. I love the goody boxes the most!,5
16591,"I've been ordering from ThredUp for 5 or 6 years, from dresses to shoes to handbags, and everything has always arrived exactly as described. The only feedback I have is for them to include the calf measurements for boots; I have muscular calves (and honestly should know better than to order tall boots online if the measurements aren't included) & any thredUp boot has been too tight around my legs. I don't plan to order boots from here again until that changes; otherwise, thredUp is fantastic!",5
16592,easy to use love the clothing I have received,5
16593,awsome!!,5

16598,I just saw your commercial and downloaded your app. After seeing all the negative reviews i buy pass life is stressful enough with out people trying to give u a Shiny Nickel because Paper don't Shine.,1
16599,I like being able to buy name brand products for a fraction of the cost and I can buy something for the grandkids as well.,5
16600,Absolutely LOVE Thred Up!! The prices are amazing and the variety of clothes are limitless. I can't stop shopping through the app and am now signed up for their bi-monthly subscription boxes. 😁,5

16634,Don't send them your clothes. I sent in a bag of name brand great condition clothing and 4 of the expensive womens clothing somehow disappeared. Will not use this app again. Stick with Mercari and Poshmark. I have never had any problems with them.,1
16635,"love this. good quality, second hand clothing and goods. great for my budget, imperative for the planet.",5
16636,i love ordering from here,5
16637,"I love buying things that are on sale, so I love thredUP",5
16638,Awesome app! So easy to use and get lost in just browsing. I love shopping used.,5
16639,"Sent them two huge bags of name brand clothes, many NWT, for consignment, they priced them at $18-$30 each and sent me $15 in credit. I added it up and they're making about $400 off of me. Lousy cheating scammy business. I had forgotten I ordered from them a year ago and they sent me a bag of trash items with holes and ripped seams claiming it was all ""like new"" then never responded to return requests. Use a company without hundreds of bad reviews online that won't scam you.",1
16640,Love this app!,5
16641,need a phone number to reach someone in cs if your order is lost its just lost. not a happy first time user,1
16642,just got my 1st order of two pairs of shorts. 1st pair was so stretched out it's about two sizes bigger than it said and the 2nd pair the button fell off as soon as I touched it. I understand that they are used but you come off like it's good quality used and it is absolutely not. Thanks for the offer but by the time I pay a restock fee and waste my time and gas returning them. I've just lost more money. I'll sew a button on and donate the others.,1
16643,I have had the worst experience with the company. trying to get an answer to a simple return question is like pulling teeth. I am still stuck with clothes that I am very unhappy with. I do not have a printer to print out a return label and have been trying for a month to have them send me one. the machine that acts as a customer service provider is just an automated tool and can not help. im stuck and thred up has lost a great customer! very unhappy,1
16644,I absolutely love the selection and the prices. Only suggestion I would have for the app is to have separate pages instead of scrolling through one.,5
16645,good idea,5
16646,"literally takes forever for anything. they give u pennies on what you sell. rip off!!!! they sell something for $30 or more, you get $1.26 if that! they literally only give u a alright offer roght away for ur first bag to get a good review after that its worthless",1
16647,💚💚💚💚💚💚,5
16648,Great variety of items to choose from!!,5
16649,Lots of fun to shop at ThredUP!,5
16650,don't send these ppl your stuff you no longer want and are trying to sell. I sent them well over 1000 worth of clothes. they kept everything n.w.t and n.w.o.t and I'm getting 50 buck? then I had to pay to get back what they didn't keep to sell and doesn't get sold. I'm reporting these ppl. they're scam. they have their little estimator but you only get 5% of what it tells you. I send a brynn Walker tunic. mind new brand new with tags. I paid 208 plus tax. they 90 and they're giving me 11. smh.,1
16651,"I never thought to wear second hand clothes, I was impressed with my first order now I can't stop shopping. I love the packaging!! Thank you",5
16652,"lovely clothes, easy returns",5
16653,"I LOVE this app! I used it to build my perfect seasonal wardrobe and I cannot say enough good stuff. There is ALWAYS a coupon, or a sale, and they have an awesome mission of trying to get rid of the clothing waste that we create. 10/10 would reccomend!",5
16654,The best!!!,5
16655,amazing shopping and they are making a great difference!,5
16656,It was an amazing exprience,5
16657,absolutely NOTHING for men kinda sexist i think,1
16658,the most satisfying online shopping experience I've ever had!,5
16659,"I love thrift shopping, especially for clothes. And I love that I can now do it online! I only wish I could sell my used clothing too, but for now they've placed a hold on that due to too many requests.",5
16660,I feel like prices are starting to increase little by little. i find some really good deals and other times the price listed is the same as if its brand new.... i might as well get it new.,4
16661,I ordered a Coach purse & walette. The only reason I gave you 3 stars I liked the purse even though it wss over priced. Then came the womens walette a day later. i wanted to cry. I truly do not think it is coach. looks like plastic on the inside.It has no place to put money. No place to put credit cards. No place to put a picture nothing. I am so disapponted. I had heard good things about your company but it was not fof me. I will not be a return customer and would not.refer anyone I know.RIPOFF,3
16662,I love buying clothes this way! The app is convenient and the notifications hello me save more by buying on sale.,5
16663,This app seems to be geared more towards women and children. there is no 'men's' section.,2
16664,"love this app, my closet is made of thrifted items, finding thredup was the best thing I could find, now I can shop from home my favorite second hand items :)",5

16667,Only women's clothing. Good to know it singles out men.,1

16669,loving the clothing I'm getting through thredup! I've been losing weight so it's been nice to not spend a ton to replace so much of my old clothing.,5
16670,Love shopping with thredUP!,5
16671,Easy to use and can be dangerous from the comfort of your home. it would be nice to see side view of sleeves. they should offer discount deals for spending at certain increments.,4

16695,"I just received my very first order from THREDUP and I couldn't be any happier. I ordered 5 items and 2 of them came on the dates ETA, which was nice. I'm expecting the other 3 on different dates in the very near future, which is great. Both of the descriptions were exactly as described. They both fit just right and the quality was as promised, ""looking brand new without tags"" plus the price was right. I'm so glad that I gave it a try and I plan on to continue with TU . Extremely Happy",5
16696,Amazing find!!!,5

16724,great!,5
16725,"Absolutely livid. DO NOT SEND THEM YOUR CLOTHES! Not only did my bag take over a month to be processed, some of my items only offer me 5% back on consignment! Brand new leggings originally $30, listed for $15 and I'd get less than $1 back after it all goes through. That's a complet scam. You are FAR better off going to a local consignment store. I am so upset and wish I had all my garments back to sell on my own. Unbelievable. DO NOT USE.",1
16726,rarely loads and always crashes,2
16727,The filters are a little wonky.,4

16741,Great prices and variety,5
16742,"Love thredup, been shopping for years now.",5
16743,"An adventure every time! I love using ThredUp and frequently recommend it to friends and even strangers. I find it is easiest to buy clothing from makers that I usually wear. Otherwise, I will find a makers sizing chart to help me choose if the product will fit me. The fact that items are returnable is a huge convenience. I prefer shopping on ThredUp more than any other site whether a manufacturer's or another 'used' site such as Poshmark. Keep up the great work! love, love love💜",5
16744,"there are some great items on this site. I do hate when you are looking and need to do something else, when you come back you have to start looking from the top again. can there be a way to continue where you left off???",5
16745,Great Handbags,5
16746,"Love the quality and selection. This app has been great, love shopping from my couch!",5
16747,"The app is handy because I can shop on the go. However, the filters do not apply to the search. Some items are mismarked (low rise jeans marked as high rise jeans). UPDATE: sometimes the search filters work, better than they used to be. Now the issue is that the checkout button doesn't work. I can't make a purchase if i can't hit ""checkout"".",3
16748,great app,5
16749,super user friendly!!,5
16750,"used crappy clothes, some that cost more than when I bought mine brand new..FORGET IT!!! And a ""restocking"" fee of $2.99 to get USED CLOTHES back??? I would NEVER buy used clothes and then PAY YOU TO TAKE THEM BACK!!!",1
16751,I love thredUP!!! Super cute clothes and super good prices!! 😀 Bought several things from them and have been very happy with my purchases!!,5
16752,site wanted to join. jusr wanted peruse the site.,1
16753,Have fun shopping! Great prices!,5
16754,Love it and everything I have bought is great and excellent condition,5
16755,"When I choose filters, either it ignores the changes I've made and refuses to save them (I notice it didnt filter right, I go back and none of my settings saved) or I choose sort my price and it doesn't sort them correctly (sort by lowest price and it'll show $1.99 items, go up incrementally to $5.99 then start showing $1.99 items again). I have the latest version of the app.",3
16756,I enjoy shopping Thredup. I like that the dresses and skirts have a length measurement... although that seems to be happening less lately. I want my skirts and dresses to hit below my knees and having the measurements has really helped with that.,4
16757,love the variety and ease of use,5
16758,"ThredUp was my go to clothing store until they stopped putting the measurements on their clothing, and on top of that, they now charge you a restocking fee if you return the clothes that no longer have measurements. I'll stick to the other online consignment stores.",2
16759,easy to navigate,5
16760,"I enjoy shopping from ThredUP. Its simple to use and they have so many brands to choose from. I really like how they save my sizes and brands that I like. I've also sent in my clothes and my sons clothes, a few times. I'm glad they are very selective on what the choose to sell, so when I shop I am getting good quality items. And I choose to donate whatever they didn't select. Its a win-win.",5
16761,great,5
16762,No mens clothes,1
16763,Looove the clothes!,5
16764,Great stuff evertimr,5
16765,love the clothes,4
16766,fair,5
16767,"I love shopping with threadUP. The prices are great & it's so easy to filter what you're looking for. With prices this cheap if it's something I don't want or need they'll gladly take it back, plus I don't have to go out shopping at different stores, it's all here for me. Love it, love it, love it!!",5
16768,I've bought about ten items from Thred up and 7 of the ten were amazing! The others were cheap so it didn't matter but they have such great clothes for cheap!!,5
16769,love it!,5
16770,It is fun to have such a wide selection at a discount.,5
16771,awesome!!!,5
16772,Wish has cuter clothes for way less. when I hear discount I'm looking for clothes that are 25$ max. Not 9$ less then previous listing price.,2
16773,Very user friendly,5
16774,I have had great experiences in the past but now I'm being charged $300 for every item in a goody box where I returned every item. I have not been able to get ANY customer service for 3 days and they dont have a number for contact. They didn't message me back until I posted publically on one of their FB posts and then they were categorically unhelpful and refuse to give me any sort of refund for items I RETURNED in perfect condition.,1
16775,"Very easy to use. This Mama needed all the help she can get. I never have time to go to the store. With 6 kids, 4 of them foster and 3 of the medically fragile.",5
16776,needed help,3
16777,"it sometimes seems buggy at times, like not showing all my Favorites or not offering all the filters (or the correct ones, a few times) during a search, but overall a fun and pleasant experience.",4
16778,Easy to use. Like the size settings memory features.,5
16779,"Used clothes, great idea",4
16780,"The variety of clothing available and the discounts make it fun. BUT I have received some REALLY beat up merchandise that never should have been accepted. And from what I hear, they really don't accept much or pay well for what they buy. So not sure why stained and ripped clothing is even acceptable. Also, the time it takes to actually receive items is just plain ridiculous. Business days for shipping?? Come on. And paying $12 for rushed shipping with it taking as long as 3 days... Right!",3
16781,love love love,5
16782,Love all the great finds!,5
16783,Easy to shop,4
16784,WONDERFUL,5
16785,love this site,5
16786,"I recently stumbled across thredUP and absolutely love the concept and app. Now I can find specific clothes at a decent price! I highly recommend adding to the description if the item is dry clean only because that would save money, time and effort in having to ship these items back because I don't like dry clean only items.",5
16787,❤️ Like shopping from your sister's closet.,5
16788,love the prices,4
16789,"I love shopping here. There is plenty to suit every style and every budget. As I have a mobility impairment it is far better than using the mall, the prices are terrific, and the range of choices is fabulous.",5
16790,Super easy to navigate! Tons of options to narrow down your search!,5
16791,"Good clothes and decent prices. Customer service has been helpful. However, several clothes are now being listed without measurements which makes size selection difficult. With return fees this change might be a deal breaker.",3
16792,enjoy their wide selections,5
16793,Love this site!!! Don't love how expensive quite a bit of these 2nd hand clothes can be..,4
16794,Would have given 5 stars but filters do not always filter.,4
16795,They accused me of doing something that I DID NOT DO. This could give me a bad reputation. IAM OUTRAGED!!!They do not even have an office phone so you can talk to a real live person!,1
16796,The app is easy to navigate and the selection is just incredible! I love being able to pick out beautiful new to me items and get them at amazing prices. And so many have never been worn! Thanks thredUP!,5
16797,Always a wonderful experience!,5
16798,the best online shopping app I have ever used!,5
16799,I love thredUP. Great options & great prices. Shipping is fast & painless.,5
16800,never disappointed! fast shipping and like new clothes at a fraction of the cost.,5
16801,only one of my items sold,1
16802,"When I first joined, I automatically got a payout. Not big but I was ok with it. just sent in a bag of very nice clothing and I am not only not eligible for a payout because I missed an email but they are selling my stuff for between $10 and $20, and giving me cents in credit...literally. No thank you Thredup. I will use a local boutique from now on. To top it off you split up the suits and are getting less for them...Don't bother with these folks.",1
16803,I am a man looking for men clothing. This app has none of that. booooooooo 😤,1
16804,cool,5
16805,"I read the reviews ahead of time and saw that many people felt like their stuff was worth more but I thought I'd give it a try. The shipping is easy. I don't know why they say you have to iron your stuff when it's just going to be basically shoved into a trash bag. And the processing does take forever like everyone says, and the main thing the payout sucks. I would only recommend it if you were planning to donate your clothes any way. I sent a HUGE bag with band new items, I made $3.",1
16806,very easy to shop and order,5
16807,great,5
16808,"Awesome great prices. If there was a way to filter out the styles like short sleeve, sleeveless, short, long etc. What makes it better than other online thrift is the fact the majority of clothes have the measurements.",4
16809,"Happy with clothing I received, just had minor issue regarding pricing but excellent customer service. I will be order again !👍",4
16810,this app is great and has some awesome stuff,5

16822,"I love threadUP, it's so fun.",5
16823,I am very happy and comfortable with the service and everything I can get on this page. The most I like is when the package arrives they wrap it as if it were a gift.😍,5
16824,"While the shopping isn't horrible, the consignment is an absolute joke! By no means to I expect to make tons of money, but $1.24 for 2 nice pairs of shoes and 3 baby items is an absolute joke. Glad I didn't spend the extra money to have it processed faster.",2
16825,"I like buying from thredUP, I am always looking for a deal. I almost never pay full price for items I need. And thredUP makes that possible in clothing. I have increased my limited wardrobe and done so without spending much money. But, what happened to the measurements? I do dearly miss being able to order based on measurements.",4
16826,Easy to navigate.,5
16827,plenty of plus sized pretty clothes,5
16828,exciting to find deals on clothes you haven't had time to go out & search for although found that shoes may be stretched on your normal size so I will try one size smaller ♥️🌻👍🌷,5

16837,really really pleased with my purchases and selection for plus sizes,5
16838,"Lots of great items to even just browse through! I got a pair of shoes recently and they are great! perfect size and exactly what I had ordered! Instead of just women, girl and boy departments for favorites, the app should consider using sections like dresses, shoes etc. to be able to find favorites a lot easier for purchases.",4
16839,You must know what you want in order to find what you like. I love this app!,5
16840,Great concept!,5
16841,Just lovely!,5
16842,"The clothes have been great for the most part. Love that a company like this exists with all the textile waste in the world. You guys suck at shipping though. If you order something with basic 3-8 day shipping, expect it in 8-10!",3

16848,"Love this app, a must have!!",5
16849,"Complete Scam. They give you pennies for brand new items while they sell the items for $20 or more. I feel so ripped off. I was also told for the 4 items I sent in, once they sold, I would get $4.10, however only one item sold and they gave me $.50 for a brand new sweater with tags which I was told I would get like $1.50 once it sold. Then they never told me items expire, so the rest of my items expired and then they just keep them! This was NEVER disclosed. Such a garbage company.",1
16850,love this store,5

16854,Very easy to navigate!,5
16855,Love it!,5
16856,"This app is amazing! I love thrifting as it lowers textile waste. Its convenient to have an online thrift store when you don't want to drive. My only complaint is that many items are pricey and it doesn't feel like a real thrift store, in that sense. One dress I'm interested in is $20! But the discount codes really help and you should use them :)",4
16857,Great choices for plus size clothes at reasonable prices.,5

16861,I've made a couple of purchases now and have been pleased. The items delivered in a timely manner and were as described. One item on a purchase needed to be returned and the process for doing so was easy. Very easy. This is a favorite place/app to shop for my tastes and I have been enjoying it so far. I have mentioned it to family and friends and will certainly continue to shop the thredUP app.,5
16862,great app,5
16863,No mens,1

16873,Excelent!!!,5
16874,"the idea of this site is awesome and they have a great selection however...... their shipping takes FOREVER, customer service isnt the nicest or the most helpful; they basically always say the same thing no matter what your issue is and that's ""we are a great shop and we give fair prices to both the seller and the buyer"" and the prices are NOT that much cheaper then buying the item new or at a local secondhand store.",1
16875,Extremely difficult to use. Can't cancel without chatting with customer service,1
16876,"kind of scammy. they send you the bag and sure clear your closet, but most is donated or you get basically nothing. they're only looking for basically new, never touched air for 5 seconds, brand name stuff....oh but theyll only give you $1 for those name brand jeans",2
16877,love this app....and love my purchases!,5
16878,and I want you to buy clothes online I have been so impressed with everything I have got plus a bonus he comes in a cute little box. Love it!!!!,5
16879,I love this app! Great quality of clothes and ships fairly quickly. I just received my first box and am already ordering more. Great way to clean out your closet and restock with new styles!,5
16880,good,5
16881,"easy to order, and exceptional quality clothes! love ThredUp!!! Have been ordering for a couple of years. Always find fantastic deals!",5
16882,"This is my first time, the app was pretty easy to get around. Now I'm waiting for my order. I will rate again once it comes",4
16883,love it,5
16884,looks good....but there's no men's clothing at all! darn :(,3
16885,ok,5
16886,"Shipping is an absolute joke. I've been waiting almost two weeks now for my first order. I ordered in what I assumed to be plenty of time before my vacation. According to FedEx tracker delivery was gaurunteed by 5/25/19. Now Fedex is unable to determine a delivery date. When reaching out to support the answer I received was ""It should be there soon :)"" and the help ticket was closed before I had time to respond. Doubt I will be ordering again. The in-app filters and shopping cart are glitchy AF",1
16887,"love thredup! great mission, great options, great usability, great app! 5 stars!",5
16888,Great clothes & bags at great prices!,5
16889,I love taking advantage of sales. The app always notifies me so I never miss a good one.,5
16890,"Love it! Loved almost all items purchased; and those I didn't love so much, were very easy to return. Great experience thus far!",5
16891,Great experience.,5
16892,I love buying second hand and this app makes it so easy. I shop all the time. So that's what I thought almost a year and a half ago. Now its losing its appeal. Individuals selling stuff on Craigslist give better descriptions and pictures than ThredUp sometimes does. They show one shot of the front and one of the back. If the description says minor stain or some other flaw I'd like to see a picture of it. Also the $1.99 return fee is new since I started shopping here.,3
16893,awsome,5
16894,great deals,5
16895,why is there no mens stuff on here??,1
16896,im addicted to ThredUP!,5

16903,"Great selection of clothes, and they have sales from time to time, too! I can also send in my gently used clothes for credit or cash.",5
16904,OBSESSED with this app.,5
16905,"The sizes need to be checked better. the shirts seem fine but when it comes to pants and shoes, for some reason they dont always get the sizing right!?!?",3
16906,I love Thred Up! Clear and accurate descriptions. Love the clothes I've bought with this app,5
16907,love it,5
16908,"I love the selection of clothes and the way they package orders, but the shipping is expensive for the amount they make of people basically giving them their used clothes.",3
16909,Love all the cute and trending items!! Recommend it to everyone!!,5
16910,love shopping for great clothes at my leisure.,5
16911,They Always Ship Fast & their returns are quick & easy.,5
16912,"great clothes, great service!!",5
16913,great app but a lot of pop-up ads that are irritating,4
16914,No Mens Clothing Option. Only Women and Children Stuff,1
16915,Amazing deals on clothes I can't afford otherwise! I love the goody boxes and the stylists came up with an option for me that I love.,5
16916,"Love this app! I've received some quality pieces at a great prices, and quite quickly as well. I give it 👍👍💋",5

16922,I love this app! Great discounts and very neat layout. Only problem is it's very addictive!,4
16923,"Great clothes, great pricing, great cause!",5
16924,"I've been purchasing clothes from thredup for a few years now and got a lot of good deals. However, I'm giving just 3 stars because I am finding less good deals, prices seem to have increased, the $1.99 restocking fee and clothing not having the measurements.",3
16925,have found a lof of good stuff on here as well as some meh stuff but all in all a pretty good site for shopping on a budget,4
16926,best online shopping for second hand clothing. items match the description. i love the experience with the app,5
16927,easy to manage!,5
16928,"So great to get new or almost-new clothing at AMAZING prices!The app works really well-no waiting for screens to update(I'm using my phone).So, now it's 2 years later,and images no longer show on my phone.gotten worse over the years.Can't find a way to contact thredup so I guess I can no longer shop.I'll miss this site Well now thredUP has fixed its problems and is very easy to use Now a couple years later.ThredUp has stopped giving measurements on most clothes.Cant buy those.Stupid move!",5
16929,great experience all around,5
16930,best online thrift shop ever,5
16931,Great Deals!,5
16932,"I've gotten great items at a very low cost and I love the convenience of shopping from home. I had to use Twitter to get thru to customer service when I recieved a damaged item..but after that they got my squared away. App works well, almost better than the full website. No glitches on my end.",4
16933,"Cute clothes, just bought a couple of dresses!",5
16934,Worst shopping experience ever. They rob their customers! such a damn shame!!,1
16935,Very easy to use but slightly addicting,5

16938,Love all this app is accomplishing in regards to the textile waste crisis. Keep it up!,5
16939,great products for a great price. super helpful staff and easy returns and donations/clean out bag system.,5
16940,"Such a good company!! Tons of selection, great prices, the app is easy to use, and everything arrives on time.",5
16941,Rip off.. don't send your clothing,1
16942,amazing,5
16943,Great idea,4
16944,Have loved everything I've gotten from ThredUp. even if an item doesn't work the returns are super easy. Definitely recommend them.,5
16945,absolutely love this app! I was able to give my wardrobe a complete makeover very inexpensively!!! I now place orders at least twice a month!!!,5

16948,I love this app and use it quite often. Thanks so much!!,5
16949,great,5
16950,"I like the app. If I could change one thing, it would be the search feature. if you want to go to a previous search term and add another word to it, you can't. you have to retype the whole thing from scratch.",5
16951,"I absolutely LOVE this app!! the clothes are great, the prices are fabulous, the ease of using the app is phenomenal & the speed of delivery is insane!",5
16952,"they will bait and switch you on price, buyer beware",2

16958,I highly recommend shopping with Thred Up..everything ive bought has been a great value and in excellant condition...im impressed...jill,5
16959,"More info, please. sizes by maker vary widely, so I really depend on the chest measurements for dresses & tops..usually pass an item up if that # isn't listed. Also, it would be nice if we were returned to the point where we expanded the info on an item to the same place (instead of going back to the top & shuffling the order.",4
16960,"Do not send in items, total RIP off! buying items is decent but I will never send in items again.",2
16961,"I am an avid thredup-er! I love it! Fantastic bargains. But lately I'm noticing the measurements are not being listed on a lot of tops. It only has the size, not the actual measurements, which I have found, in the past, to be immensely important. Can you please return to doing that? It really helps when online shopping for clothes.",3
16962,Love love love,5
16963,Love it!,4
16964,nice,4
16965,Love to shop thread up.Their app is for the most part easy to navigate and i have not experienced too many problems with it.,4
16966,I am only giving a one because they updated and stuff my cart was final sale..well now it back to regular price and they say they cant fix it..also i was sent $10 credit promo code dont work..it just seems to become a joke..maybe they fix it i give a five star.,1
16967,tried to place a order to my mother's house and they instantly canceled my order and also they claim you get up to 50% offer your first order which is false.,1
16968,I love this online store.,5
16969,Everything is as described. I love all the clothes I am getting. It is a great site!!!,5
16970,"Right now, I have to say I don't like it because I tried to check out my first order, I got a pop up message that said my order couldn't be complete, but they immediately took the money out of my account. So I went to talk to customer service and they said someone will be with me in a couple of hours. WHO DOES THAT??",1
16971,I really like the clothes I get and it's really cheap and good quality clothes,5
16972,great app. GREAT PRICES!,5
16973,SCAM ALERT! trying to give me 9.00 for a whole bag of name brand clothes. Will not give me back my clothes! See the BBB website for hundreds of cases against these guys! BEWARE!,1
16974,Obsessed with this shopping experience!,5
16975,Love this app!,5
16976,"Amazinggg app, found so many clothes I love and wear all the time now, good quality for fraction of the original price. I do not really shop anywhere else anymore after I disvovered thredUP :)",5
16977,way way way too expensive for used clothing,1
16978,"i keep wanting to buy here again & use the last $4 of credit but literally cant because they dont measure. the last 3-4 things i got without measurement dont fit at all. i cant shop there anymore because of that. its hard enough to shop online just by sizes, but used clothing is even more rough. otherwise the site is great, but that one thing is enough to keep me from buying again, though i wish i could keep doing it.",1
16979,easy to shop!,5
16980,"App will not function without giving access to my phone... which seems odd, excessive, and unnecessary.",1
16981,"Seams OK...No Men stuff, just Women and Kids!",3

16995,"I've sold so many nwt, euc brand named womens and baby items like Madewell, Zara, Loft only to make $7 this time around. I've sold around 12 items, too. Their payput is cents, yes, cents for an item and is really disheartening and discouraging. I wish i knew this before I ever decided to sell with them. I am sticking with my Poshmark, children's consignment stores and yard sales in the future for selling where with just a little effort, I make a lot more money to offset future baby purchases.",2
16996,I love ThredUP! i love the quality and discounts you get on here. customer service is very responsive. i have bought cpuntless yimes from this app thank you ThredUP!,5

17000,very good Although I have made a couple mistaken purchases when the app is open and of accidentally bumped My phone Against something,5
17001,love the clothes,5
17002,they only cater to women. there is only a women and kids section. completely useless for half of the population on Earth.,1
17003,Can't get enough 😊☺,5
17004,Be very picky. Read the description before you buy. Returns can be difficult and they have cost per item.,4
17005,great quality clothing!!,5
17006,"I have been using thredup for a year and I love it! There have been some good changes with the company. However, sometimes it is a struggle to find things buried in the app such as the rescue boxes. great idea but hard to find in the app. photos are great too!",5
17007,Easy ordering and love the selection.,4
17008,Great selection and service!,5
17009,great app and service.,5

17016,I love ThredUP!! The app works amazingly well & I have NEVER had an issue with the app. This is honestly the only app that I haven't experienced any issues with.,5
17017,I am LOVING this. I've done a few transactions now and so far all as gone smoothly. The app is intuitive to use and there are great filter options. Pictures make it easy to view the conditions of things and basically this is just awesome! I do have one return to make so I'll update my review when I'm done based on how easy or difficult the return will have been.,5
17018,"Love the filters, the finds, and the discounts.",5

17028,easy to navigate and find great deals!,5
17029,very easy to use,5
17030,"Awesome deals, good quality, correct descriptions, arrives quickly",5
17031,the things are way too expensive for hand me downs. i can go to a thrift store and find ten items for the price of one on here. it is not an online thrift shop!,1
17032,"Love this app, love this place to shop",5
17033,I don't know how I found thredup I really don't remember how I ran across it but I'm so glad I did. It makes shopping a whole lot easier for me and I get compliments on everything I buy when I wear my clothes from thredup. Thank you thread up! Sandy from Houston Texas,5
17034,"I LOVE THIS SITE, and THIS APP. Great job. Period!",5
17035,easy to use,5
17036,"at first I loved this site. Then later when I had a few problems, their customer service was bad. I don't get responses from them. I'm more hesitant to buy. I had to keep a few items I'll never use.",3
17037,"I collect leather handbags. I've gotten some great buys using ThreadUp. I love the fast shipping and excellent, quality items. ThreadUp is one of my favorite sites. I have shared with my friends.",5

17043,"easy to navigate, love that it remembers my size. would love more if there was categories and AI to remember my likes to suggest other pieces",5
17044,"way too expensive for a second hand store. and the only store that has restocking fees. when it's very hard to tell if something's going to fit from a picture they're going to charge you. I'm done shopping there, definitely not worth it. *****UPDATE **You see they don't even know that I purchased maybe 10 things and sent back 7. it's like they didn't even read what I wrote. restocking fees 2.99 per item who does that? buyer beware...",2
17045,Yall charged me $6.99 for a shirt that was new with tags that clearly said the shirt was originally $5.99. You are overcharging and operating under the ruse you're used/bargain clothing. You're committing fraud. I've been ghosted by customer service. Make it right thredup! I've been a fan of you since 2015.,1
17046,Love it!! addicted!,5
17047,"Best. Online. Store. Ever. It is my thearpy, my fun and saves me so much money! I would never be able to afford these things full price or have the time to explore racks at actual consignment stores. Thank you so much!",5

17049,wonderful great selection good pricing,5
17050,Love this app! Best secondhand store! My go-to store for everything!,5

17069,everyting ive purchased is great,1
17070,"I love thredup. I love clothes and this way I can get different styles and different brands that are other wise unavaible to me. The price are great! They give good pictures and description for the items so you know what your getting. I love their honesty, when there is an item that has wearing and a little fading, they tell you straight up. All in all I'm very satisfied with this shopping experience.",5
17071,"Fast shipping. Packaging was in great condition, so I knew the items inside were not damaged. I will definitely be order from them again!!!",5
17072,"Amazing way to shop for used clothing! It's easy to find what you want, and so much more convenient than cruising multiple thrift stores for hours. The prices are higher than a thrift store, but it's worth it. The items always ship quickly, and if you have an issue customer service is very responsive. Love this app :)",5
17073,"Easy to use. So glad I found this app. My only complaint is not with the app itself but 2 new practices of the company. No longer giving measurements and you now pay a restocking fee. Hmm, new money making practice. It is a PIA to return stuff.",5
17074,i love this store. Everything is as expected and it's a green way to shop.,5
17075,great experience,5
17076,"Love Thredup, love the app. It makes shopping too easy! Sometimes the filters have trouble refreshing the selection, but its nothing that prevents me from using the app frequently.",4
17077,Love Love Love everything about thredUP.,5
17078,"Installed & app itself is fine. The search engine wont let me ""really"" search. Uninstalling. * my response to thredUPs response* Im sure there are good deals, BUT your search engine is terrible!! At zulily I can put in dresses, tops, etc. under 10.00 & they'll give me a list of ALL items & then i can filter by size, etc. You have to let me search for what I can afford. I bet others would appreciate that as well! Let me know when you change that! You responding to me counts for something!",2
17079,love it,5
17080,"good deals, clothing condition accurately stated, satisfied customer",5

17089,"I really like the app overall, but I wish there were more categories/filters for searching.",4
17090,Love thredUP!!!,5
17091,Awsome!,5
17092,"This is the biggest scam I have ever been in. I was turning in a bag for them to sell, every step of the process was a lie. Their time line was 4x longer, in every aspect from sending the bag, to collection, to processing, to replying to my questions! Out of 50+ items that followed their guidlines and were of excellent conditions a few pairs of brand name, brand new shoes. They accepted two shirts for $1.57 and the payout site was a 404! This site targets women to rob, cheat, and silence them!",1
17093,Great store and great prices.,5
17094,great app for purchasing quality clothing without the price tag. The set up of the app makes it hard to search for a lot of itmes so it takes a long time to find what your looking for.,4
17095,love it,5
17096,"Great products, fantastic prices!",5
17097,Fabulous deals and great customer service!,5
17098,"I wasn't sure I was going to like shopping used clothes online, but everything I have ordered has been just like it said-color, condition, etc. I have had to return a few items, because they didn't fit or I changed my mind, and the return process is very easy. Love Thredup!!",5
17099,Very easy to navigate,5

17105,"my closet has never been happier, changed my look and feels good to shop on this app❤",5
17106,The app seems pretty good so far but I want to know if you can still order stuff without being 18 yrs. old,5
17107,👍 👍,5
17108,I really want to like the app but there are always so many issues. I get pop ups of sales and then the codes say they have expired. I just put in a 20% off entire order code and it only applied to one item. The prices are good but I get so frustrated when the sale codes dont work I give up rather than place my order.,3
17109,"Could use some tweaks. Even after I change my sizes based on brands, the same items pop up. I have the same issue on the website. I do wish the free shipping threshold was lower. The app in general serves its purpose. Not as user friendly as I would like. Love shopping Thred Up though!",4
17110,"I love your app ,It's easy to use the deals are great👌",4
17111,"get rid if the restocking fee. after seeing how much the company pays out for the clothes you send them, I am pretty sure they are making a pretty good profit without the restocking fee. also who wants to buy clothes that don't have a standard sizing if you can't return them for what you paid.",1
17112,awesome sites fantastic deals,5
17113,AWESOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES!,5
17114,"Very good company, very pleased with purchase.",5
17115,I had been looking at dresses from Modcloth but they were so expensive! Decided to try Threadup i got 2 dresses for the price of 1 they are so much better in person! Will definitely be trying again!!,5
17116,easy to use and very addictive!,5
17117,Coupon to lure me back says 35% off...just stated cannot be used on items over $150...so loaded up my cart to find there is a $100 discount limit when it should have been approx $250...again there NO mention of this in the details (i went back to read fine print)...FALSE ADVERTISING...also when i questioned thredup for an answer they said theyd get back to me in a couple of hours which turned into 19 hours...plus now have $1.99 restocking fees...now i remember why i stopped shopping there!!!!,1
17118,my favorite shopping app!,5
17119,Love this app. It's like shopping in your best friends' closets...all in your size!,5
17120,Responsive customer service and a great selection of clothes!,5

17122,Great clothes,5
17123,Very helpful to learn the basics and be fluent in them,4
17124,Far too addictive for the health of my bank account.,5
17125,"easy to use, works well.",5
17126,amazing,5
17127,just love it i just wish we get free shipping,5
17128,I absolutely love thredup! Their clothes are great quality and in terrific shape some of them new or like-new for amazing prices! they are my favorite place to shop,5
17129,charge to much for used clothing. Also dont give you what the item is worth when you sell with them. You are better off using poshmark,1
17130,awesome website that has nice items!,5
17131,"Don't use this app if you want quick cash. actually, don't use this app if you want cash at all. I used this company when it first went public and the whole process took about 3 months (3 weeks for them to ship the bag, 4 weeks for them to recieve the bag, and then over a month for them to process my items). Then, they offered me $.40 for a pair of shoes that were brand new in the box, originally purchased for over $50.00. I was offended. I recently tried again and had a similar experience.",1
17132,I can only say it's the best way to shop for clothes. I love that they are quality used clothes. No complaint yet.,5
17133,some items I've purchased have been small and not sized according to the measurements given. I've also noticed that some items are no longer shown with measurements at all making it a real gamble.,3
17134,Great prices,5
17135,It's great! I love the pictures and large variety!,5
17136,great app,5
17137,This is my 3rd large order. All came in good condition. Returns have been easy. Keep up the good work. This online thrift store was a great idea!,5
17138,Not only did they become nasty about my review but they had my review removed. How much Google charge ya to remove legitimate reviews that you dont like?,1
17139,"The shopping cart function doesn't even work. I'll press the Go to Checkout button and nothing happens. Terrible UX. Just use the website, it actually works.",1
17140,Great clothes and an easy to use app!,5
17141,Love this website!,5
17142,Lost control,5
17143,great prices on great stuff,5
17144,Awesome selection of clothes! I have gotten 3 shipments from thredUP and I am so delighted with my purchases. I've returned a couple of pieces and it couldn't have been easier. My refund was prompt as well. Thank you thredUP!,5
17145,"I love thredUP. but please include exact dimensions of all clothing, thredUP! Brands change their sizing over the years, and sometimes a certain style is sized differently from a brands other styles. I won't buy a shirt if I don't know how long it is, and I'm noticing Thredup is moving away from specific measurements. unfortunately, Thredup, if you stop including measurements then you will eventually loose me as a customer!",4
17146,great,5
17147,Can't figure out how to search for clothes. I love the website but the app is not easy to use.,2
17148,Unique finds at easy on the wallet prices,4
17149,Love it... great stuff in excellent condition for a while lot less $$!!,5
17150,"Sexist, theres no mens section.",1
17151,"The clothes I recieved looked worse than what was advertised. I sent back my own bag and after waiting WEEKS, I was told they couldn't be accepted due to strong odor of perfumes, laundry detergent or cigarette smoke. Well I don't smoke and the clothes were washed before sending. So heaven forbid you do them a favor and wash the clothes before sending them in. Some of the clothes I sent back to them, were clothes that I had purchased from them. I will NEVER use their services again!!",1
17152,love this app!!! will buy here more,5
17153,"not a fan. I clicked on brands i loved, they didnt show items for the brand they showed items for a different brand.",1
17154,Love the app they even gave me 20 percent off first app order with free shipping. Save 15 dollars!!!!,5
17155,ok,5
17156,Absolutely love it.,5
17157,love this app and this idea!,5
17158,"I got a clean out back and i didnt fet any moneu for the 4 tops you guys supposedly took out. this app sucks. and i sent in alot of clothes in bag, was better off selling it on eBay or Mercari",2
17159,very good,5
17160,I love looking at all the clothes. the prices are so good that I can try styles I wouldn't normally buy.,5
17161,"I sent a bag full of clothes and shoes that were not only still in style, but in perfect condition. There were probably 20 different pieces. my consignment payout will be $3 and some change if it sells. 7 pieces totaling almost $100 (what they are selling it for). I wasn't expecting to get rich and I thought the concept was great but that is ridiculous. I may purchase some things from them but I will not be sending anything that I think will be worth selling. to sell on here is a rip off.",1
17162,"Love the selections!! But i have to agree with no measurements on the jeans and tops.... now I've had to return items, due to this issue... I have friends I've told about this company, that loved that information as well.",3
17163,"Love thredUP! However, updated my rating, dropping from 5☆ to 4. Inconsistent sizing has me deciding against a purchase unless specific measurements are listed. I'm losing my opportunity to own some beautiful name-brand items as a result. Currently a 2X or 18/20, w/bust @ 43.5. There are ite.s sized @ 2X w/bust listed @ 30"" ? thredUP makes it super easy to get quality clothing for 4 grands.. Me, too, only not as much as I'd prefer.Discounts, incentives, fast turnaround on delivery, but be wise.",4
17164,"It is hard to understand your jean sizing. What is a size 12 compared to a size 5, or a waist 27?",4
17165,I love this app.they are always improveing a customers choices many new options,5
17166,I love this app,5
17167,I'll never use this again! the prices absolutely suck!,1
17168,great store and great clothing.,5
17169,Easy to use,5
17170,"i love this site (and app) so much. it makes thrifting super easy, and helps me shop sustainably without the inconvenience. I've found so many great spring and summer staples, as well as some of my new favorite pieces. decent search function, and i find it really enjoyable to check on my favorites now and again and see what's still available. i feel like I'm saving much more since i stopped doing new and switching to thrifting. definitely recommend!",5
17171,I love the app it makes it so easy and fun to shop.,5
17172,great site i enjoy it very much and the clothing and items very happy,5
17173,1star if I could leave less I would. no men's? but u have everything else under the sun! BS. seems silly to have online secondhand clothes and not include such a large demographic. probably will see newborn clothes on there before men's. ✌️,1
17174,the best place to get clothes inexpensively,5
17175,"My packages came in just one week, nicly packaged, I love the stuff I got for me and my kids. The clothes are in perfect condition.",5
17176,This app is a great way to shop on thredup without having to use my phone's browser. Well done?,5
17177,I love all the options!,5
17178,"Love everything about this app, so easy, it's my new addiction!!",5
17179,great deals on quality pieces,5
17180,"Great app! Responsive, no plastic packaging and they have filters for material! I love shopping second hand and bonus points for being able to also sort ones that are made of natural fibers!",5
17181,"Need a bigger selection, more marketing and a cause",2
17182,great and easy to use,5
17183,The biggest scam if ever there was one. I wish I could give it zero stars.,1
17184,I love Thred Up! I love the selection and brands! New with tags or gently used! The price is right also I love that I can get it shipped right to my house as it is hard to try on clothes being disabled. Thank you Thred Up!!!,5
17185,very easy to use. great experience. love Thred Up!,5
17186,Always able to find something I like!,5
17187,"May want to put ""women's clothing"" in the title. This app only covers clothing for women and children; however it is not clear that there is nothing here for men. A missed opportunity....",1
17188,"Love most of the stuff i buy, its gone up in price a lot the last few years which is why i gave it 4 stars.",4
17189,"easy to use, very transparent regarding quality of clothing you are purchasing. a lot of different options for filters to sort through all the clothing. I'm not a fan of shopping generally this makes it actually a little fun!",4
17190,bad selection,2
17191,Love this app! Actually prefer it to the desktop version.,5
17192,The best online thrift store experience delivered in beautiful dot packaging.,5
17193,App is great except a few bugs with payment.,4
17194,amazing,5
17195,"wonderful, very easy!!!",5
17196,"UPDATE: I contacted them on Facebook and they quickly responsed & fixed the issue. I've placed several orders & never had any issues. I finally tried their Goody box, kept two items & returned the rest. I got an email showing that I kept 3 items, not 2. Hopefully they will find this error & correct it because they're be charging me for a $35 item that I don't have. I sent an email, can't locate a # to call. From what I'm reading in the reviews I'm hoping this won't take forever to correct.",5
17197,it's fun opening a box of clothes that are discounted but don't look like it.,5
17198,love this app. makes 2nd hand shopping easy. easy return if items don't fit.,5
17199,Love this app great stuff to buy so easy to use and the prices are great,5
17200,So many good quality clothes you will be confused what to choose. And the savings are to die for.,5
17201,This was installed on My Beautiful❤️(1& Only Granddaughter) Beppies 1st birthday last year on the 17th❣️🤗💐🙏🛍️☘️💵🎁🛐🌠🤞⏳😘 🎂🎈🎉‼️,5
17202,"Please fix how the clothes' sizes are determined, a size 10 dress can not have a chest size of 24. -_-",3
17203,excepsional,5
17204,"easy to use, and I always find something i really like",4
17205,So quick & easy to use. Love it.,5
17206,"Ive gotten so many cute, fashionable clothes. Ive been a customer for 3yrs. & I love it!",5
17207,good,5
17208,I love ThredUp,5
17209,awesome,5
17210,"ThredUP! The only way to shop! Just a couple things I've noticed lately:. the description of item, more often than not, no longer gives you measurements of the garment 😖, the packages are no longer arriving with the check list included😕. Otherwise i couldnt be happier with everything i have ordered. Thank you all for your hard work. Every item is wrapped so tidy.😘",5
17211,"good clothing, easy site navigation",5
17212,excellent 👍👍👍,5
17213,LOVE THIS !,5
17214,love love love,5
17215,Love Thred Up just bought my daughter 2 designer dresses and a pair of shoes for $100.,5
17216,"so far, so good",4
17217,do not have men's stuff,1
17218,I love shopping with thredUP. I always find what I want and at a good price!,5
17219,do not send anything to these people cause they only give you about .30€ they screwed me big time and I've sent 2 clean out bags in January. almost all sold on the website and my payout is $10 I sent Gucci and lots of high end clothes nwt and all I have to show is $10 I'm only putting 5 stars so people can see the review. it's really 0 star. worst idea I ever had sending to them,5
17220,easy peasy,5
17221,none of the items look good and shipping is ridiculous. pretty disappointing,1
17222,There's no choices for men's clothes. What a waste.,1
17223,love it!,5
17224,love the Thredup app!,5
17225,sent a clean out bag with some clothes still having tags . none were accepted. i will never use this app again. better to use facebook.,2
17226,enjoyable! Very enjoyable!!,5
17227,"I would rate higher if the app provided measurements on ALL the clothing. This is a basic necessity when buying online. S,M,L is not helpful. And worse there's no option to ask a question about an item if the description is limited. I'm hesitant to buy for this reason alone. No one wants to be stuck with an unuseable item or pay a restocking fee. Please correct this problem!",2
17228,"Great online store! As long as I'm smart when shopping, I know I'll receive quality items in the mail about a week or more after purchasing. I take my time evaluating the clothes, making sure its not just the price that is right! Although that can be difficult when a lot of their inventory does not list sizing, and their photos can look deceiving. Just be smart and take your time thoroughly evaluating each item.",4
17229,"My first order was great the sizes included measurements except their shipping and handling time is to long. So decided to order a 2nd time no measurements on some clothing and the shipping and handling time is even worse this time around. I live 5 hours away from Phoenix, AZ(which is where all this clothing is coming from) and i have to wait 2 weeks to get it! No thank you i'll be uninstalling and no longer be purchasing from this site.",3
17230,totaly awsum,5
17231,So much easier than other apps! Mahalo,5
17232,sweet clothes,4
17233,Excellent,5
17234,Love this app! It makes thrifting so much easier then spending a day digging through smelly racks hoping to find something in your size.,5
17235,I love the clothes and how easy it is to find exactly what you are looking for regardless of price..,5
17236,Love it!!!,5
17237,"not a fan. The app tells you how they take measurements but then most of the clothes don't tell you those measurements so you're just buying blind then not only are you paying shipping when ordering, you then pay even more in a restocking fee to send things back. I ordered 3 items they all shipped separately it took over 2 weeks for everything to arrive and now I'm returning them. So I'm out $16 for getting nothing. Also the items are not all that cheap so really not worth the hassle.",1
17238,very good,5
17239,love the cloths,5
17240,"my Clothes are from Thread up Have not return any of the clothes I both or Shoes,just Love it",5
17241,I loved thred up until they started charging re-stock fees. I used to recommend it to all my friends but now I won't anymore because of that. When you're selling used items you need to offer free returns on case items don't fit right or aren't satisfactory.,3
17242,Good clothes and good prices,5
17243,wish you will include inches on all shoes I bypassed shoes I want because there is no inch,4
17244,love it,5
17245,"Sure they sell some cute stuff at fairly low prices but if you are someone sending stuff to them it is a total rip off. They list items incorrectly, they dont even know what they have or what its worth. Every option to cash your earnings out charges a fee. I typically sell my clothes on Mercari or Poshmark but I had a few items Ive been trying to move for some time. I sent them to thred up. One of the items was a $100 dress with tags that they listed as a swimsuit cover up and gave me a dollar.",2
17246,I hate this app. It's fabulous. I love the way it shows you your sizes only. The categories are clear and easy to navigate. Everything is reasonably priced. It's way to easy to spend money however.,5
17247,"Awesome! Great brands at amazing prices! Plus, I love that I can send in my kids and my own gently used clothes and use them as credit towards my next order. The circle of life...Kinda 🤗 lol",5
17248,l love thred up everything I have gotten is great and there sale items are amazing,5
17249,"I like the ease of viewing front and back images. Also, the app works seamlessly with the thredup website, making for a good shopping experience.",4
17250,Great!,5
17251,great store love it,5
17252,wish i could look before i had to install the app and turn over my info. Nope..not gonna happen folks.,1
17253,i love it. all the convenience without stepping out to go shop!,5
17254,Super easy!,5
17255,"amazing deals one stop shopping, you get your dress, shoes, and accessories all in one place! I love it!",5
17256,great shopping app!,5
17257,The clothing is always in amazing shape just as the app says. My orders come on time and beautifully hand wrapped with care.,5
17258,Easy to navigate.,5
17259,ALSOME!!!!,5
17260,They keep taking money from my charge after everything has been sent back. No response when you email them.Will never deal with this company again. 1st and list time!!!,1
17261,"I have loved thredup for years - whether shopping, selling, trading or donating. I have found so many favorite things here and always refer friends. It's fun to shop here because it feels like 1 of a kind items at FAB prices, and because I know it's like recycling, too, it feels like I'm doing a good deed, too 💙",5
17262,"I've had to return far more clothing than I've kept because of wildly variable sizing. Because I've lost interest in this site, I find it very frustrating that I can't return items without financial punishment unless I take a store credit that I don't even want. Additionally, I made far less than expected when I sold my like new designer handbags here. They won't even return the items they won't list unless you pay them to. I have to wonder if they are selling these items elsewhere for a profit.",3
17263,easy shopping and checking out,4
17264,the idea was good I am a large man so my old clothes large footprint. I would have bought 10nshirts today in 4x or 5x for men. looks like I know my next app.,2
17265,awesome loves it!,5
17266,"Easy, fast and great finds!",5
17267,Would love to see some mens clothes on here.,5
17268,great products,5
17269,prices seem very reasonable,5
17270,"I cannot believe actual real people posted the stuff listed on this site its sooo ugly & WAY OVER PRICED,! I WOULDN'T WEAR NON OF IT 4 FREE LET ALONE PAY 4 IT!!!",1
17271,shipping is very slow.,3
17272,"Love thredUP, can't get enough! changing my opinion you stopped putting measurements on your clothing. now I have much less choice because every brand is different in the sizing and now I can't tell if I can wear it",5
17273,app sometimes awkward to use. but it works and the items are great.,4
17274,love the selection and priced,5
17275,"almost everything I own is from here, great app, great styles, great quality!!! highly recommend!!!",5
17276,"I tried thredUP for the first time about 6 weeks ago! I was so happy, everything looked brand new! Liz Claiborne is my gal. All her clothes fit me well. Thanks guys!",5
17277,"great app, easy to use",5
17278,I. really like this sight also prices are fantastic for the items available to purchase,5
17279,awesome deals,5
17280,"The app works ok. I wish when you put a search in for like ""maxi dress"" that I would actually get maxi dresses. I get every single designer that starts with max when entering the search. When I changed it to ""long skirt"", it sent me designers that have ""long"" in their name. Prices are too high for used clothes. Half the time they are selling things that you can grab at the retailer for the same cost or lower. Definitely getting rid of this pointless app.",1
17281,high prices,1
17282,awesome,4
17283,AWWESOME!! FASHION SHOPP' EAZY- ❤,5
17284,awesome,4
17285,"I love this app! It has a wide selection of items and sizes. And so many things are in excellent condition. And if they arent, Threadup will tell you that it has a minor stain or pre pilling etc. I just wish they photographed the stain or area with pre pilling. 10/10 would recommend",5
17286,addicted to this app,5
17287,"Thredup was great and one of my favorite places to get clothes. Without measurements though I can no longer shop here with confidence. Just telling a person a size S, M, L, etc means nothing because they vary by brand, so I have no idea if what I buy would actually be worth my money and how it would fit at all. Hope this changes",2
17288,this app is a RIP off to sellers just give use ur stuff we will give u some money....yet their used clothes r not cheap. donate local have a garage sale use Facebook market place bc the clothes r still reused ur make a a direct profit and help those in ur community,1
17289,"The app and experience are great, however the amount of emails I receive are a little ridiculous. it's an astronomical amount, and despite combing through every setting and preference available, I have been able to turn them off. It's the only downside.",3
17290,fun shopping and you can search right down to exactly what you want,5
17291,"l love shopping preowned when possible, and thredup has thousands of pieces to choose from. I have not had to return anything yet, but the checkout process is quick. The reason for 4 stars is sometimes when searching, pieces that don't fit the criteria come up or several items are shown multiple times. Also, the way items are photographed sometimes make it difficult to tell what the item actually looks like.",4
17292,"great prices and coupons, clothes are always delivered promptly and look very professional. if I'm not pleased I have availability to return in. love this place!",5
17293,Love it.,5
17294,Not satisfied,1
17295,"the app is useless with the filters not working. I dont have time to sort through 41,000 bags when it wont filter down to just clutches.",2
17296,"I found alot of great deals so far, and will shop here again.",5
17297,my very favorite store 😍😍😍🙂,5
17298,"l love this! Great way to up cycle, plus its convenient. Love this website",5
17299,Fantastix finds,5
17300,"it's great just that before, the length of the skirts was available and now it isn't, I wish you put it back on.",5
17301,"Not enough information on many items as to length. I have a long waist and cannot order without length of tops, dresses and camisoles. I also have short legs so just saying petite is not enough. Such a small thing that keeps me from ordering many things",3
17302,lovely collection of items.,5
17303,wonderful,5
17304,"Great, really nice clothes.",5
17305,awesome!,5
17306,my go to for new clothes ♡,5
17307,"love thredup, feel the mobile app is just as easy to navigate and use as the webpage on a computer",5
17308,Amazing collection and prices! Sizing chart issues cause a lot of returns. But it's gonna be the only place I buy clothes n stuff from for a while now. A few bugs at times when I go to filter. Love the overall experience though. Go second hand!,4
17309,"I 💖 ThredUp. My items are always in good shape, as pictured and they do a very nice job of packing them.",5
17310,i was disappointed at the condition of some of the clothes i received. i felt i would of done better at a yard sale. clothes had a smell to them and looked used although they were new with tags. you can't scan return labels you have to print them very inconvienient.,3
17311,Great app! I do have a plus size daughter though and I would like an option added for that in kids clothing.,5
17312,so many options!,5
17313,size are off.... I wore sz 6 and 8 or medium. First time I bought 6 and 8. they didn't fit.... so my second order I bought large and they ran too big in some area and super tie in my breast. I bought a top medium and its was like X small. I waste my money 2 times!!! I wont buy again. they didn't look like new some of them either!,2
17314,easy to use and easy way to shop used.,4
17315,awesome,5
17316,I love shopping used. This company is great and I have been over joyed at my finds here.,5
17317,the best way to shop!,5
17318,love it,4
17319,Super simple to use! Easiest thrifting ever!,5
17320,Love the treasures I find here!,5
17321,the people that are posting the items for sale need to really need to pay attention to the tags for the sizes. because i found so many baby items in the toddler section and say its a human mistake may be pay attention to the sizing then. i got an outift that i ordered for my son and it was listed as 6 boys but the pants said size 5 and the size tag for the vest and shirt was cut off. PAY ATTENTIN TO WHERE LISTING THE CLOTHES.,1
17322,I'm addicted. I can search or basically anything within my budget and have always received great products.,5
17323,I would give 5 stars if my order didn't take over a week to get to me and the shipping info was correct. I get Amazon orders in 2-3 days from Hawaii. just saying,3
17324,There's only one typo!,5
17325,Recycling phone fun.,5
17326,great,5
17327,I always find great stuff and getting rid of my closet clutter is super easy!,5

17330,great app!!,5
17331,"The app crashes, freezes and will actually take things out of my cart. It doesn't matter if I have 1 item or 8. I like thredup within itself, but this app sucks. I will continue to use thredup, just not this app until they can get it together. Still having this problem. always issues.",1
17332,I love the service and the app.,5

17350,I got some great thing and the arrived in a timely manner,5

17354,"I'm disappointed! The description said the dress could be mistaken for brand new but it had several tears that need to be sewn and color scratched off in multiple places, which can't be fixed. Another dress said like brand new and tag still attached. It was a goodwill tag, not original, and it had fading. Please give a proper description, especially when the item is not returnable! That's awful business practices and a quick way to loose customers.",2
17355,love it!,5
17356,oh my gosh! why did the prices get so high!!?? this app used to be fantastic!,3
17357,"Great service, you receive what you pay for. Excellent customer experience.",5
17358,"been more than 2 weeks, no information about sending bag for clothing. if there isnt communication, then I don't have time either.",1
17359,great experience!!,5
17360,fantastic,5
17361,"Used to love ThredUp, but they've made two changes that make it hard to love them 1) They no longer include measurements for items. Everyone knows that size numbers and S, M, L mean nothing; without actual measurements I end up returning twice as many items. 2) They started charging a ""restocking fee"" for most items if you return them. These two policies make it difficult to love ThredUp. :(",3
17362,Yay online thrift store!!,5
17363,"The search function makes no sense. Every time I try to use it to search for pants of a certain brand, it gives me a list of shoes not even from the brand I searched. I have never found anything eye catching on here in the entire year I owned this app - maybe something was there, but you'd be hard pressed to find it with their search functionality. I felt some of the clothes were overpriced too with some tops marked used (not new with tags) costing almost as much as in-store.",1
17364,Great quality clothes for inexpensive prices.,5
17365,awesome,5
17366,I love the prices!!,5
17367,love shopping here,5

17372,"Awesome selection, great prices",5
17373,A wonderful and refreshing example of service excellence!,5
17374,easy to use website,5
17375,"They used to list the measurements of the items but they are no longer doing that. plus there is a 1.99 restock fee when you return. Bad practice for an online thrift shop... how else can we know if what we are buying will fit? ThredUp, I want the measurements back, or you might lose this customer.",3
17376,Easy to use and good prices on everything!,5
17377,If your looking to sell items using this app dont do it. You only recieve cents on the dollar for payout. For instance sent them 10 pcs of clothing. One shirt the sold for $9.99. My payout was $0.10. Its not worth it. Alot of the items are also WAY over priced as well. Use Poshmark or Mecari instead.,1
17378,"Love this app. Quality clothes and great discounted prices! Lots of stylish selections to choose from. I received a ""free shipping"" offer on 3 orders! I 💚Love ThredUp!💚👍🏾",5
17379,"packaged nicely. I just sent the link to my sister and my niece, they were so excited to see my purchases. I love thredUP!",5

17385,"Cute clothes, reasonable prices, fast shipping and great customer service! Love it!",5
17386,"Love this app! Got exactly what I picked out. All in like new condition, the size was what I asked for and the price was spectacular! I've used some of the other style boxes, this was a quarter of the price and ten times the amount of clothing that was just as nice, same quality. Strongly recommend!",5
17387,beautiful,5
17388,I Love Thred up,5
17389,"Really love tredup I order off this site all the time. The products that I have received are all in great condition.

17395,"Two stars for a few good buys, but that's it. I've sold in the past but in future I Wii donate my things to charity. Selling here is a waste of time.",2
17396,love this app. very easy to navigate. shipping could be a little faster but overall a great app,4
17397,great solution to the needless waste problem. plus i love thrifting anyway!,5
17398,"I love this app! I can shop, there are always great clothea and shoes on there and the discounts!!!!!! I have been eyeing a dress and checking back to see if the person who had it in their cart gave it up. They did! If there was a watch option so you can get an alert when items are in someone's cart and they don't purchase, and a men's section I would probably ALWAYS check here first for everything. I have teens who are in men's sizes and I would love to be able to shop for them on this app.",5
17399,No complaints!,5
17400,love!,5
17401,I used to like it so much more. God forbid you ever have to use their customer service.,3

17416,I love three up and the app makes it so easy to shop for great stuff!,5
17417,"Clothes are beautiful, great features and now offer pay with Affirm!",5
17418,"The clothes could be a bit cheaper, & was disapointed to find out, that the payouts are chump change, but the clothes were decent quality & accurate to sizing, so far. I was looking forward to turning in my dress clothes for $, only to find that they were literally paying out people in pocket change. They would charge us $189 for a brand name blazer, but only reimburse the sender $1.00 or less! Also, they advertise bundling to get it all @ once, but w/ a bundle i still got 4 seperate packages!",3
17419,awesome site,5
17420,i love it very much always find something i like,5
17421,the search could be better,4
17422,fast shipping love everything I have recieved. App easy to use.,5

17426,i found some really cute cloths on this app,5
17427,"Very easy to use and I can use the filter to find the brand's I love!! Just to warn you, it is addicting!!",5
17428,They have a HUGE selection!,4
17429,Love this! I always get good quality clothes just as they describe.,5
17430,should have an explanation of material not just starting fabric unknown,4
17431,i don't have anything to complain about the app. I just wish there were more items. Plus I wish they would provide a description of the fabrics for the shoes.,5
17432,very easy to use and full of drowsing items,5
17433,"I really enjoy the selections of clothing and I'd like to give this 5 stars but there are 2 things that frustrate me. One is that I've have a few favorites that have disappeared after expiring from my cart. I've check other baskets and sold items and they are just gone. The other thing is the shipping is so slow for both purchases and returns. I have watched the slow shipping progress through the tracking, I don't understand why it takes so long. Sometimes it has sat at 1 location for days",2
17434,I'm able to find exactly the kind of style I love and for a good price.,4
17435,awesome!!!!!!,5
17436,"Thread up app is super convenient. I can browse anywhere I go. It notifies me of sales, when any activity happens on my account, and even when an item I like becomes available for purchase. The only thing I find that could work better is viewabilty; that is on angles of shoes and some clothe, but I haven't purchased clothes from anywhere but thredup since I discovered it!",4
17437,love it,5
17438,my absolutely favorite way to shop,5
17439,"I just tried ThredUP for the 1st time. I am impressed. Trust me, that is saying a lot. I'm very picky. I purchased 2 used t-shirts, because I dont want to ruin my clothes while I paint canvas. The t-shirts look brand new! They are so cute, I' may have to buy others to paint in now! Oh, and shipping - super fast, and the polka dot envelope, and tissue paper is adorable, it's like giving yourself a wrapped gift! This is s great place to buy affordable t-shirts. OH, and it's eco friendly.",5
17440,great,5
17441,"Great place to buy used clothes when you figure out your sizes and how to buy to get the most for your buck. Though I miss times when you got free shipping after spending $50 Not a great place to sell. You get barely any money back for your clothes, and since they're listed at ThredUp discretion, you may end up sending a huge bag and only getting a few items listed. Some of mine and my baby's new or almost new clothes never got listed and you can't help but wonder what happens to those clothes..",4
17442,"So easy to maneuver through, sometimes the desktop version is better for narrowing down searches, but this is a great app when browsing",5
17443,fabulous!,5
17444,best online shopping EVER!,5
17445,"Seriously? Love, love, love! I get my favorite brands for a fraction of the cost. Some of them in nearly perfect condition some with tags....this site rocks!!",5

17449,Great app. Works well and keeps my favorites organized. I enjoy looking for deals and the app makes this easier.,5
17450,Ease of shopping is good. (maybe too good and filling my closet too much). they fixed a few bugs I had issue with.,4
17451,i like this,5
17452,Appears to be great selections but was very unhappy with the 40 cents I earned on a 2 shirts I sold. Not even worth it for me to gather items and shio to them. I can write off more on taxes fir donating to goodwill/salvation army.,1
17453,"Happy this is awesome, very satisfied.",5
17454,easy to use and customize,5
17455,It us a great place to shop,5

17457,Easy and fun to use,5
17458,Great app!,5
17459,Online purchasing opportunity.,4
17460,I like the fact that a lot of the things that I get from thredup can be returned no hassles also I like the fact that a lot of things I find or one of a kind and very decent prices even though this second hand a lot of the same look just as good as a new one thank you and keep up the good wor,5
17461,I love ThreadUP they have great deals on slightly used clothes and shoes so far I have been very happy.,5
17462,love this app,5
17463,"they wouldn't allow me to end up donating my unaccepted items after my bag had been processed which took about 2 months for. them to complete I understand they have tons of clothes and tons of bags to sort through though. Also the payout seems like they're the ones making most of the money and I don't reccomend paying for return assurance or expedited shipping as you'll just end up owing them $26 out of whatever you make. this app is however GREAT for shopping ,good prices and deals!",4
17464,"LOVE THIS APP! Legit one of the best online shopping places for previously used name brand and designer clothing, handbags and jewlery!!",5
17465,"app works pretty smoothly, no complaints.",4
17466,i just love this app. glad i found it.,5
17467,"Excellency selection. Clothes fit really well. Clothes in great condition, like new.",5
17468,"I love their clothes and prices!!. BE CAREFUL!!! l Since I placed this review, while I was reviewing my Items Thread up placed my order themselves and said I could cancel the order so I cancelled the order because It was $87.00 and I am low income on the same day I was told I couldn't cancel the order I did not place!!! BEWARE!! I also had sent 2 bags of clothes to sell and only I showed up and I have chatted and there has been no recognition!!! BEWARE!!",1
17469,"I ordered a dress that said like new, it was not. The bottom heem is ripped and very dirty. I guess like new is a subjective tearm.",3
17470,"I love shopping ThredUp, especially when I'm looking for something specific. I can stay on budget and still splurge. 😍🛍️",5
17471,"i loved this app a little too much, borderline intervention was needed, but since you guys have stopped providing chest & length measurements this will significantly drop my purchases. It was a very convenient addition to list product info. When i asked the reason behind the change i was told thst i could reference the manufacturers sizing. For all the different brands that thread up offers, this will not be convenient.",3
17472,easy to use. the clothes are true to size and good quality.,5
17473,"I love ThredUp! If you're looking to be greener and pay less for your clothes, this is the place. It's also a great way to trade in your old stuff for new stuff. The app is a little easier to use than their site, although I will say the search function on both leaves something to be desired. Get ready to browse for awhile and you'll find some real treasures, especially if you're looking for maternity or jeans.",4
17474,this place has nice shies for ladies & plus size clothes for a great price.,4
17475,sold my very expensive items for pennies and then website didn't allow me to cash out! I do NOT recommend!!!!,1
17476,"Awesome way to have great clothes at a reasonable price and sell to a a worldwide audience. Caution...always make an inventory including pics *and* pay the return fee for unwanted items. I didn't do that on my 1st clean out back and was shocked by some of the ""unaccepted items"" (like-new Joie sIlk tops, Jean jacket identical to one for sale on the site).",5
17477,So many options,5
17478,"My first purchase was excellent 👍👌, what I ordered I received. Great quality and pricing. The only issue I had was with the delivery the mailman just shoved the bag in the mailbox and has broken my lock. Lazy mailman, instead of bringing the items to my apartment. So my rating for ThredUP is a 5, Loved everything that I ordered. Rating for mailman -1 (LoL) I am a happy customer and will continue to shop with your Company. Thank you so very much. God Bless 🙏😇🙏",5
17479,Ilove to shop with ThredUp! everything comes fast and its packaged so nicely. great company.,5
17480,awful for returns,1
17481,never ever get a response when I contact them. terrible customer service.,1
17482,Uninstalled it. There is no men's section,1
17483,easy to use and love the products!,5
17484,I love thredUP. Great designer clothes at great prices.,5
17485,So much variety!,5
17486,"I love this company. I've gotten new clothes for a fraction of the cost and saved close to $600! The only thing I would like to see in the app is the ability to not include items in the results. For example, option to exclude maternity clothing or certain colors.",4
17487,So cool! I get excited just thinking about the treasures found. Can't wait to see what I'll find next.,4
17488,great. simple to use and a large selection.,5
17489,I love my clothes. And they really are plus sized. You of course have to do a little research to make sure certain items from certain brands fit but other than that I live thredup,5
17490,love this app! great deals,5
17491,The app works well. I havent had problems with the app not working. Wish search parameters worked a little better.,4
17492,ThredUP is how I shop for clothes now!,5
17493,always a great experience. look forward to opening my package.,5
17494,I would have given 5 stars but I often run into issues with the picture and description not matching.,4
17495,This is such a fun way to shop! All items I've purchased have been in excellent condition and are listed at great prices!,5
17496,I love it!,5
17497,Often freezes but it also asks if you'd like to pick up where you left off which is a great feature.,5
17498,I have been using this app for a year and half and love it. I have purchased some great finds.,5
17499,great,5
17500,"sent in high end clothing. Only half the items sent were listed and DIDN'T get a fraction of what they were valued at. sadly, I will not be selling my clothing through here.",1
17501,Love this app!! i have found many treasured pieces. 50 ⭐s!!!,5
17502,Great finds and convenient shopping! Sometimes items don't have enough information about size or materials but for the most part you can find the actual measurements online.,4
17503,Love shopping with ThredUp!,5
17504,love this app,5
17505,I live this thrift shopping. So much easier to find things I like in my size. Bonus when they have a huge sale.,5

17508,I love it. Great deals and everything comes really fast.,5

17510,"Easy to use the site. Everything purchased so far has been great, exactly as described.",5
17511,Love it!!!,5
17512,"finding gorgeous clothes at great prices that I would not find in my area, not you typical second hand store. delivery is very fast too and plus size clothing and brand new items with tags attached.",5
17513,Excellent experience! Love the choices and prices are great!,5
17514,Love it!!!,5
17515,"I found a pair of shoes on Pinterest that I wanted for my bridesmaid dress, only to find they were $270 + international shipping Rachel Simpson shoes from the UK. A day later I found them in my size on thredUP for less than $40. The description said gently used. When they arrived, the plastic film over the leather sole hadn't even been removed yet so they were like new. What a great deal! I've let all my sisters and friends know about the site in the meantime, and I've been back to shop since :-)",5
17516,love it!,5
17517,so easy! love the selections!,5
17518,I have shopped with ThredUp for 3 years. I always gave 5 stars. The reason for 2 stars is that they have almost done away with providing measurements. tired of looking at items that I liked only to have no measurements. I don't buy anything online without them. I am hugely disappointed ThredUp.,2
17519,Quality products. Great specials.,5
17520,"They have a huge selection for all sizes! I was nervous about quality at first, but every purchase I've made from them has been in great condition. The deals are amazing! I will definitely continue to purchase from thredUp",5
17521,"love it, good clothes,nice prices",4
17522,great experience / Lots of choices,5
17523,"Thread Up has the best selection of clothing for both new and used for any budget. The sales prices are fabulous. For me and my busy schedule, the 'filter' option is the most time saving of anywhere I have ever shopped. Just put in the parameters and let it do the shopping for you. 😊",5
17524,love thredup!,5
17525,"the prices are sometimes good but the colors of the items are never accurate and they only ever have 2 photos per item. I recently bought a pair of $100 shoes and the description said they were gently used with minor signs of wear, this was not true, almost the entire sole was worn off. They were a ripoff. Also return shipping is not free. I'll stick to thrifting in person from now on.",3
17526,my experience with Thredup has been great. Great clothing at such good prices and have also sent in clean out bags several times and this has been great as well,5
17527,the app is easy to use and I've been very happy with my purchases and the service !,5
17528,This app makes thrifting addictive.,5
17529,Love this place,5
17530,love it,5
17531,don't have plus sizes,3
17532,love it,5
17533,Great Shopping!,5
17534,"My first experience shopping, the item I purchased was not as described. It was listed as size 7 boy pants, when they were actually size 7 girl capris. I realized they were girls because the inside the pockets were designed with flowers patterns and they were obviously capris. in addition, I placed my order on 3/9/19 and as of today, I have not received every item yet. Disappointed with my experience. Won't take the risk again.",1
17535,Best way to shop now! You never know what new treasures you will find.,5
17536,perfect,5
17537,"Cute clothes, Great deals!",5
17538,Love my new items! You guys are amazing! Thanks for your service!,5
17539,"i have a semi- addiction to this app! it is so easy to navigate, and everything i have ordered has been exactly as shown. Fast, well packaged delivery, and they have special discounts from time to time. definitely worth a try!",5
17540,based on the poor reviews i uninstalled to save myself,1
17541,the clothing are in excellent condition i love them,5
17542,Love the company,4
17543,great deals on high quality items!,5
17544,Shopping made easy,5
17545,"loved the experience! The app is easy to use, I've really enjoyed the clothes I bought. this is my third time making a purchase, and now that I've learned what to look for that works for me, I love everything I got. learning to look at the materials the clothes are made out of and zoom in on the pictures helped me find the right pieces for me.",5
17546,Cannot believe the deals on designer items!,5
17547,Been very pleasant. Returns for store credit take about 2 weeks. Receiving orders usually take less than a week.,4
17548,Love the layout. Easy to navigate. Prices are very high on most items. Tried the closet clean out. I sent in at least 15 items from top brands and got zero credit. I would rather donate my clothing somewhere locally.,1
17549,intresting and good price looking for good for your feet flip flops,5
17550,"Waaaaay more fun to shop on the app then their site! It's laggy for me when scrolling down. I Wish they didn't force the filter settings on the page. Whenever I take out the filter settings, it's a noticeable change in scrolling speed! And now I have my new phone, & I even got a first time discount, for shopping on the app, & was done in an hour! Even while I made dinner! YUMMMM!!! 😎 Lol",5
17551,love it,5
17552,Love this App!,5
17553,nice clothing and fast shipping,4
17554,easy to use...great stuff!,5
17555,Lots of nice stuff for fair prices!,5
17556,"here's my issues: it is super easy to hit the wrong button on your phone and wind up losing your search. when you're looking through thousands of products, this is VERY frustrating. the descriptions of clothing can be off or incomplete. i have purchased many items that are sheer or semi-sheer or that had huge slits up the sides or front that were not visible in the photos. finally, it costs money for returns. so you wind up sending stuff back for store credit to spend more the next time.",4
17557,I love how easy this app is to use. Also all the great selections! More designer handbags please! 😊,5
17558,great company options galore and wonderful return policy😍😍,5
17559,Excellent clothing for a great price!!!,5
17560,perfect,5
17561,"I really like the app, easy to use, easy to filter. I wish there were pictures of the clothes on a person or maniquine to get a better idea of the fit and length. Also there are no wedding dresses or vow renewal dresses.",3
17562,love it,5
17563,"fun site, great deals.",5
17564,"love every item i order. love the ease of shopping online, the variety, the great prices, and the great discounts and it ships to my door!",5
17565,great product and quality,5
17566,LOVE TO SHOP HERE!!! MERCHANDISE IS JUST AS ADVERTISED! GREAT PRICES. I'VE GOTTEN TWO BRAND NEW DOONEYS FOR HALF OFF.,5
17567,"thredUP is amazing!! There are so many options to choose from and being able to filter your search, makes it even easier to find what you need. You cannot beat these prices for name brand items that are in great condition, even items new with tags. Returning is simple and hassle free. I tell everyone about thredUP!",5
17568,wonderful ❣️,5
17569,love this app The Best Shopping App EVER,5
17570,Super easy app to use!,5
17571,I love Thred up. This app makes shopping and purchasing easy.,5
17572,like.,5
17573,Great app. love the endless scrolling. I just wish it had all the extra search options that the website does.,4
17574,app does not sort properly......other than that it's pretty good. uninstalled and reinstalled and still has the same issue. sort does not work properly. otherwise I like the app and love the website.,3
17575,LOVE THE DEALS!,5
17576,Awesome,5
17577,good,5
17578,This is a great experience!!,5
17579,Thank you for responding.,4
17580,"The app doesn't sync any favorites or purchase history from your account when you sign in. I browse Thredup on mobile and on my computer but I don't like to make purchases on mobile. Since none of my activity syncs between mobile and desktop, there's basically no point to even using the app. I'll just use my Chrome app to browse the site I guess.",2
17581,Absolutely LOVE,4
17582,"easy to shop, huge variety, great brands",5
17583,"Easy website, great customer service, my go to now!",5
17584,"Great, but you need a forward button, not just a back botton.",4
17585,Awesome!!,5
17586,great selection at affordable prices,5
17587,"Love it!!!!!! The only thing I wish you could do, unless you can and I'm not aware, is set your brands to be permanent just like your size preferences. It's a pain every time to add all my brands in. Other then that, I love it, and I spend way to much money on here. A coupon a little more often wouldn't kill ya either, if other people are like me, we spend a lot of money on this site. So maybe some sort of loyalty program, like the more you spend, the better discount you get.",5
17588,fun and exciting,5
17589,Excellent prices and deals! I recommend!,5
17590,always satisfied with order..they take pride in the delivery...,5

17592,Great brands. New w tags. Also a place for my clothes to find a new home.,5
17593,love this app.,5
17594,I'm loving this,5
17595,"I love to shop ThredUp, but the app doesn't have as many filter options as the website and sometimes the filters don't work.",3
17596,Love it. I prefer to shop thred up these days,5
17597,"I sent in clothes to try it out, thinking it would make resale of clothing easier. I found out I would only receive mere cents for high quality brands, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. Their overhead must be ridiculous!! So I had to pay shipping to get my clothes back, which was worth it, and I'll still make more selling on my own online.",1
17598,No men's clothing.,1
17599,"Haven't had 1 complaint regarding my purchases, items are Exactly as they are described. I have never been into spending crazy money on name Brand pocket books,. But.. The amount of money that I have spent on my Awesome Top of the line, Top Name Brand *new to me bags* ( I've bought a few), are only a bit more $ than I would have spent on my seasonal bags. I say seasonal bc they don't really hold up for much more than a year or two. Love this app..",5
17600,"its so easy to browse clothes. the filters include everything and gives you good options. they tell you the quality of the clothes, the material used etc. i use this app to shop cuz i dont mind wearing used clothes. this app is good for people who are saving money, and for those who wants to buy branded clothes for a cheaper price.",5
17601,love the ease off app,5
17602,So easy and convenient to shop with this app.,5
17603,"Love the Variety, Easy to Use",5
17604,Great app. Easy to use.,4
17605,"very nice clothes 👌. love the three months to pay,made it so easy.im satisfied and will definitely be ordering again.thank you.",5
17606,"Okay to buy, certainly not to sell. I sent them a bag mixed with premium fashion, luxury items and kids clothes (think YSL, Opening Ceremony, sunglasses, shoes, etc.) didn't spend less than $100 bucks on the women's items and they offered $1/piece for them. Will just go with a luxury consignment shop next time and hope that the stuff they don't post gets donated accordingly. Bought a few things and it's not consistent in quality. They were on sale though, so you get what you pay for.",1
17607,LOVE YA THREDUP I HAVE BEEN A DEVOTED CUSTOMER FOR 3YRS. THANK YOU FOR GREAT VALUABLES👍👍👍👍👍,5
17608,I love this app.The prices are great and I always find what im looking for. I just ordered my 4th box.I love everthing I've gotten so far.thanks so much.,5

17610,good clothes at a reasonable price,5
17611,so far I've ordered 3 different times and love what I've ordered.,5
17612,"The more I use this App, the more I'm loving it. I enjoy finding that cute little dress or those ""gotta have"" boots. I'm completely addicted. When that one or six special items that I can't live without becomes available and I'm notified about it, well, that brings a big ole smile to my face. Thank you ThreadUp. Loving the bargins. And, I'm yet to be disappointed with the quality of an item I've purchased. Awesome App! Applause! Applause!",5
17613,I absolutely love this app!! Recommended it to someone at the top of a ski hill last weekend!!,5
17614,very good,5
17615,"I wanted to try thred up, not knowing what to expect. I sent my bag with no expense to send it, it got to the warhouse but then took forever to get proccessed and accepted. Then sending some valuable peices I got such a small expected payout, which is what you get in the end even if your items do sell. When they sell and you get the money in your account you can access your money until 14 days after. They dont price things correctly and you really are better off selling your stuff on let go.",1
17616,"fast, fun, easy! what more could you want?",5
17617,love it!!! 😊,4
17618,love this store!!,5
17619,Love everything about Thredup!,5
17620,"excellent, easy!",5
17621,"This is a one and done. Like many others, what I received for what I sent is ridiculously low. I will, from now on , just give my items to local charities where at least I know someone in my own community will benefit. The process to get my cash back is confusing. I don't want to purchase anything. However, for what little I will receive it's not worth the hassle trying to figure out the complicated process to receive my money back.",1
17622,i ordered and paid for a goody box and still havent recieved it it should have been here by March 27th .,1
17623,Excellent company. I haven't bought new clothes in over a year. I recommend it to everyone I know.,5
17624,can't checkout!,5
17625,very easy to navigate and fun to look through all the options. though if you need to find something specific it could take awhile just because there are so many pages of clothing,5
17626,super easy to use and great selection!,5
17627,"This app used to be perfect. Over the past 6 months it has gotten more expensive by charging a restocking fee for returns and charging for the donation bag to be sent to you, which used to be free. However, they do offer a free downloadable label now if you have a box of your own you can use to send your donations. Overall, if you are looking to earn cash or put your gently used clothes to good use, this app is still the best. Items not sold are used in an eco-conscious way. Everyone wins:)",4
17628,"Great stuff, easy to order and easy to return what doesn't fit.",5
17629,awesome,5
17630,"Theu seened trustworthy, but i sent my bag into them a month ago and havent heard a peep. I tried to message and it said someone would be back to be in a couple hours, 24 hours. With how poor the customer service and timely manner is, I'm not going to buy off their website. It makes me very wary the way they have been acting.",1
17631,thredup is the best way to shop & save money. no problem with delivery & can't beat the price !!!,5

17660,"If you are a fashion addict like I am, you might enjoy Thred Up a little too much. They have an impressive and affordable selection of clothing and accessories, and the app is super easy to use. *Editing to remove a star for their jewelry buying experience. There is no point of reference for scale in their jewelry pics, so size is hard to judge. Since jewelry is never returnable, I've been burned too many times. Never buying jewelry from ThredUp again. Still LOVE buying clothes from them tho!",4
17661,have my favorite brand and size,5
17662,I love that it saves my sizes and automatically filters my searches by my size. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I think the filters could be improved (sometimes it glitches).,4
17663,"My daughter introduced me to thredUP & I love everything I have ordered. I selected brands I know, gently used & every item has been in excellent condition.",5
17664,AMAZING DEALS on designer brands,5

17681,love love love!,5
17682,"Nice search functionality, spectacular pricing, and the company seems to have good ethics, which matters to me. Free shipping for larger orders, and a pleasing focus on sustainable practices and shipping materials that still keep the clothes safe. Also, amazing selection. I just got four gorgeous, professional jackets and cardigans, one of them made of silk and cashmere, for less than seventy dollars.",5
17683,very good app,5
17684,"It's hard to reach someone who will help you. I placed a $192.00 order did not receive a tracking number. I tried to call the number listed on my bank statement, it led to a recording stating that the phone number did not belong to ThredUp and no messages would be returned. I sent an email to ThredUp and have yet to hear from them. Sent a second email today. I like the idea of an online thrift store but most probably won't do business with them again due to lack of communication.",1
17685,"Constant bombardment of push notifications is not what i signed up for. with no way to turn them off, i will no longer be using this app.",1
17686,love the clothes but customer service is awful already waited 2 hours to talk to someone only to be contacted to say someone will be with me in a few hours,5
17687,Everything I have received has been in excellent condition! Just be mindful of your measurements. Some of the shirts I ordered were way too long.,5
17688,"In reference to the quality of the clothes I've purchased so far, I am exceptionally pleased. customer service is great! The 1 & only thing I would change is how much is paid out for items bought out of customers' clean-out kits..i've sold quite a few things & have never felt that I was getting a fair price for them.",5
17689,Awesome! I have found so many things and have loved what ive gotten. the sizing is right on with the description. I've only had to return 1 item and the process was smooth and quick. Great idea!,5
17690,"Love to shop more ethically, but can't always afford the ethical brands so I love ThredUP because I can still shop the brands I know and love without supporting the not so eco friendly practices the companies have!",5
17691,"great clothes and shoes, new or like new at a great price!",5
17692,Excellent quality on the like new items! love the selection and the ease of online search and ordering! Have been very happy with all my purchases!!,5

17700,I bought a LOT and saved soooooo much money!!!,5
17701,nice items,4
17702,Great app!,5
17703,I was really iffy about this app after reading bad online reviews. I haven't sold anything so I can't rate that but as far as purchases they've been mostly small sale items. Everything has come as listed in great condition. I was everything when I get it cause I'm paranoid but they come boxed great. I've had no issues at all and have ordered a few times now. Highly suggest it for basic closet filler items.,5
17704,The app is okay but for the prices I would rather buy from Poshmark or Zulilly. Too expensive for me.,3
17705,i have enjoyed losing weight and buying 2d hand. The products i have received have been in excellent shape.,5
17706,Easy to find items!!!,4
17707,I'll never shop retail again! Returns take forever but they eventually get done.....,5

17709,Love it! It's kind of changed my life! I'm not motivated to shop in stores again!,5
17710,loved the items I bought!!!,5
17711,dont do it. ive sent in a couple of bags of like new clothes. some with tags still attached. the biggest payout was $6.00 !!! and twice they kept the entire bag and I got $0.00!!!,1
17712,I love this app!,5
17713,been waiting a month for 2 packages i ordered to be delivered. no help from customer service at all. wont use them anymore,1
17714,I have found several great finds. As with online shopping not everything I end up liking but yiur able to return most things for in store credit. As a working mom it saves me a lot of time and hasle.,5
17715,i truly love how thred up works and especially with our eco system...by recycling products and conserving water.,5
17716,I love the convenience! They also buy my clothing and I use the credit given to get new to me items.,5
17717,Excellent,5
17718,Love thredUP! I have updated my wardrobe and saved thousands of dollars. If only they would buy from those of us who live in Hawaii...24 March 2019: still loving thredUp. Still wishing they'd buy from Hawaii. Still a 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 shopping experience!,5
17719,👍,5
17720,"Going through a fitness transformation has been amazing, but clothes shopping is hard when your size is rapidly changing. So thankful for ThredUp helping me keep my wardrobe on point, on a budget, with easy returns as needed. I've also been able to sell my clothes as I shrink out of them! Win win!",5
17721,I've bought several items and they were in great shape. I highly recommend it.,5
17722,"Customer Service doesn't respond to concerns about clothing quality. Product quality seems to be going downhill with company growth. Messaged multiple times about the quality of a recent order, no response.",1
17723,easy to use and order!!,5
17724,easy to use great design on the site,5
17725,.I love that you have such a great selection. Great prices. Just fun.,5

17730,Easy to navigate,5

17739,love how easy it is to shop and love giving second chances to things.,5
17740,I love this app. I have placed 5 to 6 orders and it's so much easier than the website.,5
17741,Fun!! :),5
17742,"I've loved everything I've purchased from ThredUp. My only complaint is that the search function is not great. The filters they have available are very general, and if you're looking for something specific it takes a lot longer. I recently bought a gold clutch from ThredUp and had to scroll through 300+ results because their was no way to narrow down my options.",3
17743,"This apps literally only for women and children, should probably change that or let people know.",1
17744,awesome deals! everything is like new!,5
17745,awesome love this site!!!,5
17746,Love the app! It makes checking for new deals and shopping so easy!,5
17747,"Like the app, but it is missing sections from the website. You can't access recommendations, and I feel like the search results don't show the entire inventory. However, the ability of the app to store a couple search windows at once really comes in handy.",4
17748,easy to use and great deals. items show up as described. easy to return when something didnt fit right.,5
17749,"I started off liking Thred Up but they charge you too much on returns and since these are 2nd hand clothes, sometimes you have to return things. Also, if the description says ""minor stain"" don't charge me $40 for a dress. I can get a new one on clearance for less. I am probably going to delete this app after they process my recent bag.",3
17750,"I love this app I'm hooked for life! I get my work clothes, cocktail party clothes, and my son lucks out too!! It helps that everything comes speedy fast!!",5
17751,"Love ThredUp ,I've been ordering from them for years,and anytime I have gotten anything that didn't fit the way I wanted, returns were a breeze. Half my wardrobe is ThredUp purchases.",5

17754,thredUP is awesome,5

17757,So far my best place to buy anything I need 💕👌👌,5
17758,my favorite place to shop!!,5
17759,"Great app. The searching and sorting options could be a bit better, but overall everything works great and it's fairly easy to use.",4
17760,"I like the app for the most part, my only complaint is that it is slow at times on updating searches",4
17761,have had a great experience buying and am now considing becoming a seller as well.,5

17775,I absolutely love this website!!! I find a great deal on here every time I log on!!,5
17776,"I love this app. Being able to search for new unused shoes changes the way I shop. Being fairly broke, this is a way I can indulge a little without blowing my budget.",5

17780,beautiful clothes in all sizes. i cant wait to get my dress!,5
17781,App was amazing... now it closes everytime I open it,3
17782,"I haven't bought anything from them yet, mainly because the usability is pretty mediocre. Having the option to search with filters is wonderful, but they don't work. Whether I""m using the app or the website, categories that I have filtered out ALWAYS come up during my search. It makes me not want to use the site or the app because it's a waste of time :(",3
17783,Just downloaded about 5 minutes ago... I get to search for maybe 1 full minute before it forces close.,1
17784,absolutely love this site!!!,5
17785,"My biggest complaint is that they make up pricing for the retail price. There was one tank top I was interested in and they had that it retailed for $147. I went and researched the brand on the brand's site and could find one more than $88 new. Then when I searched for just that brand on Threadup I noticed they had blanket prices all items from this particular brand of clothing as retailing for $147! Update: Did nothing, when I reached out. Gave me some generic answer.",1

17799,"would not order from this place. bought purse looks more worn then described (should cost 5, instead 20 you go discount store buy new purse for same price), should show actual photos of clothing item. Gives pennies on dollar to people send stuff to be sold.",1

17818,anxiously waiting on my first purchase,5
17819,I absolutly love it so far so good am just getting started but i can tell its the kind of app that i love thank you,5
17820,so far so good. ive order clothes for my daughter they were good condition and have lasted her the school year.,5
17821,Mostly Love. Great finds at good prices. I expected more on the payout than a small percentage. Especially considering I am sending in barely used clothes.,4
17822,"ThredUp is a wonderful way to get designer clothes, purses and accessories at a fraction of the retail price. I love it! Just bought my entire vacation wardrobe.",5

17828,Easy shopping and clean out,4
17829,item are exactly as described. excellent prices on name brand items. Love how they give the measurements. being short this makes a huge difference,5
17830,I really enjoy all of the great savings they have at the convience of not leaving your home. My only critisism is that they need to do better on the measurements of a garment. When you buy something rhat you cant try on you REALLY rely on the measurements being right! I have seen 2 exact garments have ENTIRELY different measurement?? How can that be and which one is the right measurement? That teuly is my only complaints so far!,4
17831,"Huge fan of Thredup! I order all the time. The app has gotten better over the last year, but it seems to still have issues when I filter and search.",4
17832,great app,4
17833,love it...,5

17850,good!,5
17851,apps been down for 3 days now. I've Uninstalled & reinstalled. it won't open,1
17852,"first off, customer service sucks. only have live chat. I messaged them 11hrs ago and still have not heard back. I purchased an item for $22 on here. got it in the mail and the original tag was on the item and it was for $12! they charged me an additional $10!! what the heck. I tried to ask customer support but have heard nothing back.",1
17853,love the clothes. Read the description for size detail and you are sure to get a good fit. If not returns are easy. Also the clothes are great quality. I love it all!,5

17857,best find!,5
17858,Love shopping with thredUP,5
17859,Dangerously addicting and easy to use!,5
17860,"Easy and quick to use interface compared to website shopping! I've had some issues with posting my order on the website, no probs on the app",5
17861,love it!,5
17862,"App sometimes lets you get free shipping. I am addicted to adding favorites! Thred up itself is ok, not the best or worst, but the App is pretty good. App sometimes malfunctions but has fantastic features like many filters, speed, recommendations, and closet ideas.",5
17863,do not use this app. they make it difficult to receive your money and take too long to assist you,1
17864,sometimes there are not options to pick styles and I cannot search by style ie: open front seems I can only search by brand,4
17865,love it!,5
17866,Great service! Love the recyclable packaging. descriprion of clothing is accurate and they always provide the measurements of the actual items so you can see if they will fit.,5
17867,I love the site.The clothing is great. Even if you are on a budget you can wear great outfits.,5
17868,I love the site,5
17869,"Great app! easy to navigate, your sizes and styles are saved and your notified if a liked item is no longer available. Great way to shop and save.",5
17870,IM JUST IN LOVE WITH ITTT,5
17871,it was easy to find what i was looking for and just as described.,5
17872,Easy peasy,5
17873,I love Thredup!,5
17874,items were just as described and arived nicely packaged and early. a pleasant experience.,5
17875,amazing options quick ship and lots of search options and great detail on items!,5
17876,"this app used to be great but now for some reason everytime I go to buy something, the checkout button doesn't work so I cant buy anything. I keep having to go on the computer in order to buy stuff.",4
17877,Love shopping thru Thred Up great prices,5
17878,i love love love thredUp,5
17879,"It has a nice selection, but if you don't order enough items the shipping and handling negate the reasonable prices.",4
17880,I love to look at that app and see different things on it that I love to buy,5
17881,easy site to use. Great selection and quality,5
17882,love it,5
17883,love this site so much,5
17884,Love Thred Up!,5
17885,"app works well, thredup itself is a great service",5
17886,The sort and filter options don't work. I am constantly having to look through items that don't fit and I'm not interested in. This usually results in me just deciding to look elsewhere and purchase somewhere else.,1
17887,"good, fast",5
17888,I still enjoy the app and the site though I did like it better the way it was before.,5
17889,"The app functions well but the business behind it has lost my support. Item descriptions fail to match the items: wrong brand, wrong measurements, or item condition overstated (like new when it has pilling or other problems). Yet company is nervy enough to add a per item fee for returns. Not for me. I spent my credits and closed out my account when my items arrived.",2
17890,very good,5
17891,Love the entire experience!,5
17892,love it! could be better in terms of the search database,5
17893,My experience with ThredUp was exceptional! I do not have a single complaint! Bonus points for excellent customer service.,5
17894,"I enjoy shopping on the site, but there are slow lag times. I normally walk away and by the time I come back, its cleared up. but the clothes are in the condition listed. great deals for my children.",3
17895,"i like the site but the app is glitchy sometimes. it would be nice if you didn't have to reenter the search term every time you click in the search bar (like if you make a typo). also often after i select to be notified when an item is available, the app doesn't show me having done so and doesn't notify me. i would like the cart to show the discount applied per item, just like on a desktop site. however, a thing i love that the app does but the site doesn't is the app sorts the cart by warehouse.",3
17896,Love it,5
17897,great app!! love the clothes and prices. however the app doesnt work too well sometimes.,4
17898,"constantly ""breaks down"". cart shows empty or ""thinking"" forever when you want to check out or view your favorites",1
17899,Love ThredUp! Only issue is I have to close and reopen the app if I want it to correctly open from notifications.,4
17900,what a Genius!,5
17901,"Great service and pretty good app, but notifications often don't open to a functional page.",4
17902,I am not pleased with this company and I will never use them again.,2
17903,"150 bones for a USED shirt with some stains, fading and a button missing.... ARE YOU KIDDING?! Goodbye Thred Up",1
17904,"I used to love this site. Now they are so expensive. Paying full price for second hand items. They post the 'original' price and then the price you pay...the original is not correct, SO much higher...even if the original tags are still on it. FOR EXAMPLE...my last order I purchased a shirt for my son. Original price $26.99. Purchase price $15.99. That is a 52% discount. Description...new with tags on it. I receive the item and look at the tag, the original tag that was still attached and not modified...$17.99. I double checked my order because I thought paying $15.99 from $17.99 didn't sound familiar...now I, and you, know why. That's just dishonest and that's false advertising. No way around that. No finger pointing can justify that. I'm just disappointed! Like I said, I used to love the site.",2
17905,love!!,5
17906,Addicting.,5
17907,Very easy to use,5
17908,Best clothing ever,5
17909,Have loved everything I've ordered so far! Good prices and quick delivery,5
17910,"Bought three tops and all were in good condition. I didn't like the smell of whatever they clean the clothes with, but it comes out un the wash. The only issue I have been noticing is the prices. I can get brand new clothes from tjmaxx and places like loft when they have sales for cheaper then what's being sold second hand.",3
17911,addictive!! save your coupons.,5
17912,excellent 👍👍,5
17913,I've enjoyed shopping on thred up! lots of great things!,5
17914,so I sent my clothes a long long long time ago i never got an email that they had processed my bag. thredup sent me a TON of emails to the wrong account and then 2 years later I find out they dont accept mens clothes that info should come with the bag instead of ripping me off I sent a couple of new items in that bag so it feels like this app dumb,1
17915,i love the product that i order.,5
17916,not anything like what they advertise.,1
17917,I love this app. So easy to use and no issues!!,5
17918,My experience with thredup has been a positive one. The best feature for me is that they tell the length and material of the clothes . I like that I can donate clothes. I get a little money and some extra room in my closet,5
17919,"I've loved ThredUp, and the reasons behind reselling, for several years now. I've ordered dozens of items, literally. The app is so easy to use, I can shop by material, item dimensions, all sorts of neat ways. When I found the app, I was excited to be able to ""virtual window shop"" anytime, without having to open a bookmarked site.",5
17920,view archived versions,5
17921,Love this app. Lots of great deals from great people. Have purchased several times,5
17922,love it!,5
17923,Always find nice clothes for Reasonable prices,5
17924,im still waiting for my goody bags to be processed. I chose this app because my office manager uses them. it takes so long for someone to get back to you. I'm not pleased at all.,1
17925,great shopping.,5
17926,tons of deals! I'm not one for shopping I've placed 3 orders in 2 days!,5
17927,Great prices!,5
17928,Coolest app ever,5
17929,I love the selection and it's so much more convenient than digging at thrift stores.,5
17930,I love having my selection in my sizes right atmy finger tip,5
17931,love it! point blank.,5
17932,"gun, easy, and you save alot for what you get!",5
17933,great,5
17934,I could not have started my new career without Thredup helping me build a new wardrobe.,5
17935,"Shopping is easy. There is more variety than other online options. Returns are simple and easy. I usually hate shopping for clothes, but thredUP has made buying clothes enjoyable.",5
17936,won't let me apply my promo codes. would rather just go to the site online.,1
17937,"love them, never disappointed with the care, prices or shipping!",5
17938,"simple to navigate, fun to discover",5
17939,was not impressed boots look like they are long but they are the short ones first pair came back size 7 but fit like size 9 second pair say size 7 but fit like size 8 also changed address and had to pay shipping and handling again,2
17940,"Simple & easy shopping! Absolutely love that they carry children's clothes. I wish they carried men's clothing. Some sizes are a little off. However with free returns for store credit it makes it easy to find something else. Only things I would change is, #1 the use multiple discounts instead of just one, with a limit of 3 to get the most out of my order since I do order quiet a lot. #2 to see more pictures of the item especially if there are any imperfections such as a small stain.",5
17941,very disappointed not worth it. it doesnt even desever a star.,1
17942,I get compliments all the time on the clothes I get from thredUP !,5
17943,"pretty freaking sweet, no bs, just saying.",5
17944,I sent a large bag of clothing in good condition and name brands with tags I got $1.15 for everything. What a scam!,1
17945,"Great idea! I cannot shop in stores due to physical restrictions, so this is the next best thing. Many of the items are brand-new, with the tags attached. One thing I would be careful of: find out if your item can be returned or not! The prices are about half of what I was going to pay at another place for styling me. Although I had no issues with the other company, you cannot beat the prices with ThredUp.",5
17946,great prices and great options!,5
17947,I love the experience,5
17948,"Got my first order, love it!",5
17949,addicting. love shopping on thredup. most of my favorite clothes have come from here.,5
17950,It makes shopping on the go easy.,5
17951,"I am a first time buyer of thred up. I really liked the prices and the convenience of buying second hand items from home. The only problem I experienced was a sizing issue. I purchased an item that was said to be a large. But when it came in, the tag said medium and of course it didn't fit. I was really excited to receive my first purchase , but very bumbed out that the sizing was posted wrong.",4
17952,easy to find what you're looking for!,5
17953,"They admit to rejecting more than 50% of all items sent in, but sell secondhand items that they do take for more than actual retail price. Waste of time.",1
17954,good,5
17955,I like every item ordered so far,5
17956,"it's gonna break me, but not as fast as the mall!",5
17957,I absolutely love thredup!!! I keep losing weight and I'm down to 0 and 0 0... This is the only place I can find my size 👍,5
17958,Awesome stuff at a reasonable price.,5
17959,"I have sold many items on this app and bought many. I've gotten some great things for very little money. I like that you can search by brand to weed out the cheap brands. That said, they have something for every price range. The only thing I wish they had were additional photos of the items when they indicate a stain or worn area. I'd like to see a photo of the stain and where it's located.",5
17960,great app. wish there was a way to sort by price in favourites,4
17961,Love Love Love this app Got cloths that fit. NEVER in my life has shopping been so easy,5
17962,great way to shop,5
17963,OMG I Love this site!!! I ordered 500 dollars in clothes in one week. free delivery and half my stuff got here in 4 days the other 6 days....im so impressed!! Everything was either still tagged or like new!!!! I LOVE THRED-UP and would reccomend it to all my female friends and family!! I have not sold them any clothes yet so I cant comment about that yet. Will do in near future though and update review. I saved over 400 bux in retail off designer stuff. ty thred up guys!!!,5
17964,"ThredUp is awesome! I have used this app for about a year and I love it. You can find items that are affordable, trendy, classic, edgy, boho chic etc. the possibilities are endless. I recommend people give it a try.",5
17965,awesomely unbelievable....there is always something uniquely new....i love it.😘,5
17966,Great company to work with. Great deals!,5
17967,love thred up,5
17968,love this site so much! :),5
17969,"An upgrade to the usual thrifty shopping conditions, no endless sifting through racks of dirty, dusty clothes, just trusted brands in like-new and new conditions, at great prices. Their customer service is on point as well. My favorite place to buy clothes!",5
17970,"love this app but notifications are a bit overwhelming for searches and canlt be tuned. also not every notification clicks through to its target. other than that, love this app",4
17971,love it,5
17972,this is a good company to order from. everything I've ordered has been as described.,5
17973,love that they made an app. works great!,5
17974,terrible I can't get to returns on the computer so I can't get a return printed out nice way to screw people over,1
17975,love shopping on here! great deals!,5
17976,Disappointed on the processing time for my bag which took 2 months and the payout for each item is only pennies. I probably would have had better luck trying to sell it at a local consignment store. Was expecting a better profit for the condition the clothes were in! most of the clothes i sent in were barely worn.,1
17977,excellent,5
17978,love thread up!,5
17979,"fast, affordable, great quality",5
17980,who doesnt like shopping,5
17981,Amazing I have purchased multiple items baby to mommy lol and all very gently used can't wait to get my bag to now send clothes in 💞👍😎🤗,5
17982,Is a useful app for finding quality used clothes. The service is great and fast. I highly recommend it.,5
17983,Tons of choices all in one spot!,5
17984,Theres a bug with selecting filters for clothing. It doesnt allow for multiple filters to be selected and processed. Otherwise great app and concept.,3
17985,"just received my first order today from thredUP and I couldn't be happier, only took a few days to receive it and the condition is excellent, looks new and I love the polka dot packaging! Thank you so much thredUP for making secondhand...first!",5
17986,Love love love!,5
17987,i enjoyed my experience. i found great stuff for great prices.,5
17988,Best bargain shopping ever!,5
17989,I've bought a lot of clothes from this app. I haven't decided if I'm happy about how much I've saved or upset at how much I've spent.,5
17990,Ease of access is wonderful,5
17991,"I like the Thred up app, but it keeps giving me a popup for ""are you enjoying the thred up app"". It's super annoying and won't let me go without leaving a review. So, 1 star. Is that better than no review?",1
17992,Love this app,5
17993,easy to use and easy to shop!!,4
17994,its great!!!,5
17995,"When I 1st gave my 5 star review, I only received 1 of my orders. Now after a few more orders have come in. Everything I purchased has just exceeded my expectations! Quality, brand names, & even the packaging is amazing. The prices are affordable, and if you order by the bundle, free shipping! Can't beat that!",5
17996,Easy to use and find exactly was I need.,5
17997,I love this app!,5
17998,love the clothes love the app. so easy to use great clothing,4
17999,love this app! my new favorite adorable place to shop. just wish the app had a night mode for those late night searchs,5
18000,love the clothes an prices!!,5
18001,I like the quality,5
18002,"i havent even purchased anything, and im already disappointed; You carry womens and childrens clothes... only? Seriously? What if I want to buy a mens leather jacket, or pants? EDIT: I'd be quite excited to see that. I'll check back sometime.",3
18003,I enjoy thred up and the app makes shopping easy. Maybe too easy.,4
18004,i love to order for this app.,5
18005,awesome products amazing prices,5
18006,love this app,5
18007,I love this app! I buy stuff from them every pay day. best place to buy clothes hands down!!,5
18008,I used to LOVE this site/app but it seems to me (like everyone else) Thredup is getting a little ridiculous w their pricing. This is a consignment site. I can find most of these brands brand new in the store for the same prices during off season when the clothes go on sale. Thanks but no thanks,1
18009,Convenient way of online shopping!,5
18010,love thredUP,5
18011,love it!,5
18012,Reasonable prices and clothes are nice!!,5
18013,I'm not satisfied with some of my items. Some are worn out.,3
18014,just ok,4
18015,love it..have ordered so many thinngs,5
18016,Very nice shopping experience 😊,5
18017,Everything I have ordered is awesome,5
18018,"ordered from the app, got it about 10 business days later. perfect condition, smells like new store scent. a bit spendy for secondhand but i saved a lot. ordered Nike funnel neck pullover retail $70 at Fred Meyer, paid $34 total including shipping. will definitely order again for the right items/price. app is easy to shop/buy with and excellent description on the condition of items.",4
18019,terribly glitchy. when I have saved searches I get a push notification that if I click on doesnt take me to the item or the search. have missed out on items that go fast because the app doesnt open to the correct part.,1
18020,Nice app.,4
18021,"Great service! I practically buy all my clothes from this app. I get endless compliments on my purchases and I love that it allows me to have a bigger selection of clothes without paying the crazy high prices I used to. Furthermore I love the sustainability aspect of thredUP. It is like Sally's but more convenient and you know the quality before you put it on. Love you, thredUP! :D",5
18022,good app but not enough promo codes. when refining searches it hasn't updated for the last 3 weeks.,3
18023,easy breezy! great layout and not a lot of static,5
18024,"Outstanding! Love shopping here. I sew a lot of my own things and so I don't buy unless it's cheaper than buying the material. I can pick and choose, discard when I change my mind. I save money, too. Win-win situation all down the line....",5
18025,if you wanna sell make sure everything is up to date other wise good luck selling,5
18026,love thredUP!!,5
18027,I have tried Dia and Stitch Fix. I LOVE thredUP!!!,5
18028,prices are reasonable and quality is excellent. shipping is fast.,5
18029,love this site,5
18030,"app is really lacking in searchability. If I want to look for work pants, it endlessly/randomly adds leggings or boho or linen to the search. Basically bogging my search down with leggings. It continues to do this even after i save the search. It also likes to freeze. As for the clothes, I'm about 90% satisfied. It's hard to trust the measurements on skirts and pants. Apparently, 26"" waists could actually mean 24-30""? I have had good luck with shirts, blouses, and sweaters, though.",3
18031,"I like it, it works for me",5
18032,"love it, very easy to use.",5
18033,I wish it let you sort by measurements,1
18034,Relaxing. enjoyable. My space!,5
18035,Great clothes at a great price!,5
18036,Wish I'd discovered Thredup sooner!,4
18037,I love thredup! I've bought clothes for my kids and myself using this app. Prices and value are great! I used Stitch Fix in the past and was disappointed by the poor quality of some of the pieces I recieved. Thred Up has been amazing. I know exactly what I'm getting and most of the brands are familiar to me so I know the value.,5
18038,love thred up,5
18039,awesome.,4
18040,Nice alternative to thrift store shopping! Continues to be a favorite online shop!,4
18041,way to pricey for used clothing,2

18043,Awesome selections. Easy to use app. Immediately processed orders. Can't wait for my items to arrive!,5
18044,I'm hooked😍,5
18045,I'm loving this site! Easy to navigate and filter and save searches. I love when a thread up box arrives with all my great deals! AND I can shop from the comfort of my home!,5
18046,So much stuff to browse. Better than rummaging through used clothing in the store. that being said I will NEVER again sell my clothes through this company.,5
18047,great app I absolutely love thredup,5
18048,Nice clothes at good prices!,5
18049,I love everything I've gotten for me and my little one! thanks guys!,5

18056,great,5
18057,Excellent experience every time,5
18058,odered from here a few times good deals most of the time,5
18059,"I was very happy at first with their selections. Then they would not accept my boyfriends credit card, because we dont live at the same address, eventhough I verified his address. I then emailed customer support because that is the only way to reach them. They told me I would have to wait until my items were reshelved and then reorder them with a card in my name. I agreed and waited 4 days for the items to be reshelved and when I went to place the order, it told me I was a banned account.",2
18060,amazing deals and very convenient to shop with the app!!,5
18061,great usability,5
18062,love it,5
18063,"I love ThredUP! It is so much fun looking at the different pieces of clothing and putting outfits together! From coats, jewelry to shoes, I love I love it. And the fact I set my own budget and have a wide selection is what makes it so nice. Shipping is so quick! I believe in recycling, get to know your brands and sizes and you'll be on your way to fun shopping without breaking the bank!!",5
18064,love it,5
18065,fine,5
18066,"i gotta say ya take the cake 4 how great it is 2 find exactly whatcha want with ease thanks 2 ur altho pretty basic picture standards, they far exceed my needs to buy based on just a pic & desc its awesome so thank u! ya lost a star 4 a cupl reasons...price all over the board from what u pay for our clothes we send u to your prices to sellin our things to u (u make a killing off us).

18095,"Expensive for used clothes. Most everything is sold at or above NEW retail price and they only paid me 76 CENTS for each brand name, brand new item I sent in to them. No thanks. Not that it matters. They haven't been accepting clothes since July. UPDATE: Trying to buy some things and it keeps telling me the promo code isn't active. Even though its telling me to use it literally on the same screen. Tried to contact customer service for it to tell me theyd ""try"" to get back to me in a couple hours",1
18096,Awesome!,5
18097,"They neglected to mention, no category for men's clothing.",1
18098,Friendly easy to use app!,5
18099,"My packages arrived a couple days earlier than expected, and everything was in great condition. my only complaint is that the measurements aren't always accurate. I ordered two similar pairs of jeans. They listed measurements of one pair at 34"" and the other at 32"". The 32"" fit comfortably, yet the 34"" couldn't come close to buttoning. I measured the top of the waist band on the one that didn't fit and it was closer to 30"" while the HIP measured at 34"". Thankfully I am able to return that one.",4
18100,awsome deals and easyable movement app thank you,5
18101,great finds and an easy app!,5

18110,very affordable! great packaging and quick arrival! only wish they sold men's clothing too but i am very satisfied with this app,5
18111,love it! :),5
18112,"I got my first bag in January and kept 4 of the 10 items I was sent. I've gotten compliments on all 4 pieces!!! One of the pieces I kept was a purse that I never thought I would like, but absolutely love it!!!",5
18113,"Great finds! So many options and good prices. Also, good filter options but I only wish they also had more filter options for when youre looking for something more specific. but works verh smoothly",4
18114,fast check out,5
18115,I love an online option for resale clothing! shipping is relatively quick. the selection is outstanding!,5
18116,"i have ordered from treadup several times now. the shipping is fast. i do think a lot of the clothing is overpriced, especially for 2nd hand. The sizing isnt always very accurate, i would suggest to give a better sizing description such as runs large for a medium..... over all not bad.",3
18117,"they sneak things in your cart right before checkout, super slow shipping, overpriced.",2
18118,i love it but hate you at the same time for having soo many beautiful bags clothes name brands with tags and some that you can't tell its been used I give you 5stars so much to see so much to choose o wow I love bags and there are many to choose from 😱,5
18119,cant get affirm on my thredup app.,3
18120,i have been very pleased and satisfied with everything i have purchased. all the items look brand new and i saved a ton of money.,5
18121,it's easy to use. there are a lot of options as well..,5
18122,I loved ThredUp but their policies have continued to become less and less user friendly and getting assistance is near impossible. Fair warning it now Cost $12 to return anything and $2 more per item in the return it is ridiculous!,2
18123,This app is easy to use.,5
18124,loving it!!!,5
18125,you are great in,5
18126,i love this app because i love thirft shopping. also the clothes always look great ! shipping good too they give coupons also . i would give 5 if they would keep you updated on whats going on with clothes you are selling.,4
18127,great,5
18128,I AM VERY SATISFIED.. SURPRISING!! BEST PLACE TO FIND DESIGNER CLOTHES AT REASONABLE PRICES,5
18129,great app i love it,5
18130,"Okay I ordered a ""goody box"" on the 2nd of Feb. and it still isn't here! then my 4 yr old accidentally put in a order so I immediately 2 minutes after ordering put in a cancellation request. and they only cancelled half the order!! who does that? and where is the third order,?? still haven't shipped it out even!! oh! and the boots from the half order I received have burns and gum all over the bottom! not to mention they are the wrong size (and look at my second review for a shocker)(need more rm)",1
18131,wonderful shopping with them!!,5
18132,clothes are great but the processing time for you bag being sent in are far to long. I've been trying for days to get my items returned to take to a local consignment shop and still haven't heard anything. quite displeased at the moment.,2
18133,This is a great experience to shop online a thrifty way and to sell items so I don't have to do all the work!!,5
18134,prices are the same if you buy something new. why would I pay 25 dollars for an old used sweater. rather get a new one. would suggest just doing a flat rate get everything. uninstalled.,2
18135,easy to navigate,5
18136,"Way too limited. Several features aren't even available. It's pretty pointless to even have the app, when I have to go to the desktop site to do most things.",1
18137,"available sizing and price for used clothing was riduliculous, $67 for a shirt, I don't care if they paid $120 new it is used clothing, $38 for a pair of jeans, I can buy them new for that price. Do people bring you the receipts or do you take their word for the original price.",1
18138,not hapypy,2
18139,app is great!,5
18140,Great!,5
18141,They wouldn't send out a clean out kit to my address. That's the only reason why I made an account.,1
18142,Great selection and deals!,5
18143,"overall, it is an okay app. Many of the clothes are ugly, in my opinion, and not much of a discount. I received a pair of pants that was a supposed size, but was clearly several sizes smaller that i now have to deal with returning for a minimal return amount. i realize they have to make money, but much of this app seems like a sham to me. just not impressed.",3
18144,"love the app, except when you sort by lowest price it doesn't show all lowest price items first 🤷",4
18145,so easy to use! love this app!,5
18146,"my guilty pleasure. great app, easy to navigate, get alerts for saved searches on the go!",5
18147,My order always arrives quickly and the items are like new. I love that I can get my daughter an entire season's wardrobe for less than what a couple outfits would cost from the store. she gets so excited when she sees the polka dotted box because she knows she's getting more fun outfits.,5
18148,"The app works fine but I'm done with this company. The credit they offer you for your items is a joke. I've been using them for years and it didn't used to be this way. Years ago, I had a bag that got me $80. My most recent bag was $7. From what I hear, some don't even get that much.",3
18149,"I don't understand why tops with a chest measurement of 32"" are included in my search for plus size clothing size 2-3x. It seems like most of the plus size clothing is actually straight size, making the app useless to.",1
18150,my favorite online thrift shop!,5
18151,I love this app!,5
18152,My closet has become my favorite place!,5
18153,"I love Thredup and the app! it's easy to browse styles, save your favorites and even do returns easily on your phone.",5

18156,amazing! my favorite app!,5
18157,amazing!,5
18158,"I have bought a few items in the past and had a good experience or two, but the last order was horrible. The shirt was stretched out and I had to toss it. I also made the huge mistake of trusting this business to sell my clothes. I sent several items that I paid $400+ for like new and I got under $1 for all of it. SCAM!!!!!!!!! 😡 *In response to Thread Up, I sent new jeans worn once that I just bought from Nordstrom. If you think I sent clothes not up to your standards, why do you sell them?",1
18159,"items are incorrectly marked, some items have been shrunk during prior use and not indicated, no fabric details, pics are not taken of damage to item, cust service is non existant.",3
18160,"best way to purchase high end clothing, jewelry, shoes, and accessories without the high end cost. All of the items I have received have looked brand new. many still have tags. and the best part is that you can try on items in the comfort of your own home and return what you decide not to keep for a full refund or store credit.",5
18161,love it,5
18162,"I love thredUP. I have bought some amazing clothes. If I would have bought at retail, I would have paid at least 4 - 5 times more per item. I have been able to buy a complete summer wardrobe for a few of hundred dollars. Now all I need is summer to hurry up and get here. Lol. I recommend this site to all my family and friends. They all love it too. It has become our little game we play. Who can get the best deal.",5
18163,Great App for Online Shopping!,5
18164,"By far, the best thrifting experience ever!!! I am hooked!!!",5
18165,"I love this...its my favorite shopping experience on my phone. I will continue to use this app as long as its around. And to have the ability to use a stylist or just shop the clothes and favorite what youd like. It just has so many amazing qualities, if you havent tried it yet, you need to, like now.",5
18166,love me some bargains from the couch!!,5
18167,The best deals are in the sales,5
18168,like the app. I would like to specify a sleeve length on dresses and tops though and it's not available.,4
18169,what i have received in orders is exactly as depicted. no surprises. i am very happy with my experiences with thred up.,5
18170,i love everything i have purchased so far. Thank You for the great stuff and great service.✌😁,5
18171,my daughter tried to sign up under her email and was told she was using deceptive ways because we have the same sizes and address apparently and using my credit card and the pay monthly because I still pay for her her stuff because she's a minor. i have spent a lot of money on this site but will find another to spend my money on.,1
18172,Love Thredup 😁,5
18173,love this!!,5
18174,love...love..love the store. but what happened to Affirm on app? still love though!,4
18175,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP AND THE CLOTHES THEY SELL. AFFORDABLE PRICES & BRAND NAME DESIGNER CLOTHING. ONLY BAD THING IS THEY DON'T HAVE MEN'S CLOTHING. I WILL CHANGE TO. STAR ONCE THEY START SELLING MEN'S CLOTHING.,3
18176,everything is smooth! very happy with it!,5
18177,i love it i find what i need,5
18178,love this app! I installed it and ordered the same day! the jeans I ordered came quick and were exactly what I wanted so I went back and ordered again! you cant bday the prices either 💚,5
18179,its nice when you branded clothes at affordable prices...,5
18180,"It is really easy to find what I want, and the orders arrive quickly.",4
18181,"This app must discriminate against men because not one thing on this for 
adult males. Males don't waste ya time",1
18182,Love the ease of buying and the cloths. Loved everything so far.,5
18183,Waste of time and it's not worth trying to sell anything. I sent barely used baby clothes and received hardly any money for them. Beware when sending your stuff in even if it's barely used you'll get hardly any money for them. EDIT: I have contacted your customer service team and they were of no help. Clearly my business isn't needed nor wanted. I'm more than happy to take my business elsewhere.,1
18184,great for purchases. do not recommend clean out kit.,2
18185,"So far, the app has been easy to navigate and use. No issues so far.",5
18186,love this app,5
18187,great quality cloths at great prices thanks thredUp,5
18188,"It's easy and fun to look at all the new clothing and shoes items everyday. Your sizes are remembered by this app so all the things you are looking at and absolutely love are just your size! You just put it in your cart, pay, and it's on way to your closet, so easy!",5
18189,Easy to use & fast,5
18190,Thread up has an overall good cause. Being environmentally conscious is the reason I began to buy and sell on here. Sometimes the prices are to high and not worth it when you can buy it brand new for cheaper. I only purchase when they have an additional discount available. Dealing with usps and fed ex losing packages is another downfall.,3
18191,Love the app but the new restocking fee for items you order and change your mind about is dumb. I think if you are choosing store credit that should be waved. That's why I had to give 4 stars. Just my two cents.,4
18192,"Very convenient, when you need an outfit that's just right and need to upgrade your wardrobe.",5
18193,Love the app. Actually easier to use than the website in some cases :),5
18194,I love ThredUp. it's where I get all my clothes,5
18195,Love the deals and variety,5
18196,Best place to get like-new clothes at very affordable prices.,5
18197,"The app is great--easy to use and convenient. The photos have distorted or hidden details on items I've purchase. It wasn't worth returning them, but I wish the photos were more clesr.",4
18198,was pleased with the choices of clothing,4
18199,do idiots actually pay full price for used clothes!?! No Thank You!,5
18200,"Prices way too high for secondhand stuff. They claim to be a certain percentage off retail but I have seen some stuff listed for more than the store. Also they need to be more particular about what they list, I don't want to sift through a bunch of stuff from Walmart and Coldwater Creek.",2
18201,ok,4
18202,Terrific! I love treasure hunting in this app & have found some amazing deals.,5
18203,#1 secondhand store and easy to find what you want through the app,5

18209,my experiences have been good with shopping and returning.,5
18210,I'm addicted to thredUP! I absolutely love shopping on the app. I can donate my clothes through them and get a small amount of store credit to use on new clothes! I can easily return items that don't fit as well. I have even purchased gorgeous jewelry with the tags still on for a small fraction of the original cost. I will definitely be ordering again!,5
18211,love,5
18212,I have bought & sold items on here & have always had a good experience!,5
18213,I love everything about this app! I get to upgrade my wardrobe without spending a lot of extra money! I also really like the options to donate clothing for charity or they can sell it for you.,5

18267,don't sell your clothes. you literally get pennies from what they sell. you could get so much more from a local buy and sell app.,1
18268,awesome,5
18269,Quality clothes! Quality prices! Saves so much clothes from just being throw away and ending up in landfill. There is always discount codes available as well. I love brand names for a discount price! I just placed my second order with ThredUp and I'm excited to get my clothes!,5

18272,Addictive,5
18273,"Not satisfied at all. Purchased several items and 2 items were wrong (i.e. not the item I purchased). For the price I didn't complain. 2 of the dresses I purchased had pulls and holes. Again, low priced and would cost more to return. My rating comes from my selling side. I sent a bag of barely worn shoes (some name brands) and a designer dress with tags on, and they didnt list it and are sending it all back except 3 prs of shoes. Will just donate locally.",2
18274,"I've bought items. And sold items on here, they have return assurance so that what doesn't sell they send back to you. Only they don't send it back always and you have to harrassed them to get it returned to you. Nice items to choose from.",3

18287,"Seling items: payouts aren't all that great and are SLOW (like months) which I can deal with, but I've sent 2 bags of really nice clothes in and it's like they dissapeared into the abyss. Which kills me because I could of sold them to a local consignment store. Buying items: The quality of merchandise I've recieved is really nice. I've only recieved one item not as described (it had a small hole in it). Overall in my opinion, buy dont sell.",2
18288,Amazing company. They are eco-friendly and economically friendly! Only wish the app had more cadigories to narrow searches and cadigories in my favorites.,4

I clicked on google pay and the order got placed to an incorrect address. When I emailed Thredup immediately after placing an order, they never replied, then they took my money and continued to ship it to the wrong address. Now I am attempting to block the shipment through fedex and am going to my bank to explain this was an unauthorized transaction.",1

18354,love love love 😍😍😁😊❤️,5
18355,First order Promo got me boots for free!,5
18356,"Incorrect sizing on everything I ordered. But, costs more to return it than keeping it all. I'm stuck with clothes that dont fit and don't match their description. Waste of money. Unfortunately this was not my first terrible experience with this dishonest company, but will be my last. I'd give no stars, if possible.",1
18357,love this site! so easy to shop at great prices!,5
18358,I've shopped with them quite a bit lately and so far they've been on the money honey,5
18359,i love ThredUp and their app makes it easy to shop with them.,5
18360,very happy!!,5
18361,I never could check out generally unorganized,1
18362,I was surpised how fast my order shipped! The quilty was great as well.,5
18363,"love it, easy to use",5
18364,I love love love thredUP,5
18365,love the prices.,5
18366,love thred up!!! ive ordered twice now and have yet to be disappointed!! highly recommed,5
18367,Very good so far.,5
18368,"Great app, easy to use!",5
18369,So easy to use!,5
18370,"My new place to shop at. I recommend it to everyone i know. Its like the app KNOWS what you are looking for, and i love that",5
18371,This app is so easy to use! Easiest shopping experience ever!,5
18372,easy and shipping is reasonable,5
18373,"love shopping here, I always find something I can't live without",5
18374,"I highly recommend them! I got a pair of Miss Me Jean's, basically new, for 18 dollars!! I will be doing all my clothes shopping with them. I just wish they would start selling mens clothes too! Remember the give 10 get 10. You can actually buy a good bit of stuff for 10 dollars!",5
18375,love it,5
18376,great app makes shopping fun.,5
18377,lags and seems like a lot of in and out/ back and forth.,3
18378,"Only reason not 5 stars is because some orders take WEEKS to arrive. You cannot be in a hurry to receive any of your items. I've have some that took 2-3 weeks to arrive. Otherwise, I'm happy with my items and the app over all. Just wish delivery was 3-7 days or something more realistic.",4
18379,"Great app, easy to navigate",5
18380,processing is slow and they barely pay you anything for your items.,1
18381,The search feature leaves room for improvement. I can search through a million shoes and choose what heel height but if I want to just look at boots I have to search for boots and I don't get a choice of herl height and go through tons of boots with too high heel. I don't really care what's in season. Fast fashion is disgusting and limits the use of this service. Uninstalling.,2
18382,good deed,4
18383,so fun!!,5
18384,Amazing! Quality of clothing and packaging is better than most stores.,5
18385,very good,4
18386,great place to shop... clothes always show up before delivery time,4
18387,Fake and broken goods constantly,1
18388,I really enjoy buying my grandkids clothes here.They can wear top new clothes for a great deal,5
18389,It's a good app overall. You can find some really good bargains. I wish there was a better way to choose brands but overall it works well. Some of the items could use better descriptions.,4
18390,great,5
18391,thredUP makes it easy to look great year round... Recycle❤,5
18392,Love it!!! Seriously.. I am addicted to ThredUp!! 💋 It's now been over a year and I'm happy as ever with my ThredUp addiction! 😍,5
18393,Awesome app and company!,5
18394,this app/website is amazing! great prices and great quality!,5
18395,Shipping is MEGA slow minus 2 stars just for that. App is hard to navigate. Poor filter options. Returns are allowed but they charge an OUTRAGEOUS return fee. I will never place another order. EBay forever.,1
18396,Love this company,4
18397,I've bought two dresses so far. the shipping was fast and dresses are in good shape. I do not believe the chest measurements listed for the dresses were accurate but because I knew my size and body well they do fit. Overall will most likely use thredUP again.,4
18398,I very much enjoy thredUp. Very helpful and convenient 👍.,5
18399,it was fast and easy to order items. I received my order fast and in perfect condition.,5
18400,"There's a lot of good name brands you can find at a steal. Just be wary when you add items to your cart; unless you buy them immediately, they can disappear from your cart as they are on a timer. The clean out kits aren't the best either. I did one to see how it would go, and I sent about 20 or so items, and only 2 items got accepted for resell. Thredup kept the rest. The app is great at giving you notifications about your cart and order though, which is very helpful because I am forgetful.",5
18401,i love thredup,5
18402,I love this app I am obsessed,5
18403,"Site has a Rachel Zoe tote listed for $180. I got the same tote last summer in her Box of Style. Entire Box of Style was only $100, and Rachel Zoe's site lists the value at $99.",1
18404,awesome!,5
18405,"no mens clothing, thats half the population",1
18406,"Easiest thrift store experience ever. This is not a function of the app per se, but I wish they would photograph the shoes from the top view so the toe shape is more visible, and that they would measure the length of the necklaces.",4
18407,exciting! im a giant online shopper addict. this site seems fun. earn ways to make money and get good deals. i like,5
18408,I love Thredup!,5
18409,A new way of thinking about updating your wardrobe. So many unique pieces. I love how diverse my closet is now. Easy returns. Excellent customer service. I absolutely love thredUp!!!,5
18410,On time delivery n good style,5
18411,This app is really nice and organized. You can find a lot of different clothes easily. Shipping costs a lot though,5
18412,"Was not allowing me to sign up. Kept saying email was already in use, and then told me user does not exist during a password reset attempt.",2
18413,So much fun! Huge selection of very nice things. I've been super happy with everything I've ordered!,5
18414,great when there is a discount code!,4
18415,Absolutely love this app. Reasonable prices. Unique items.,5
18416,"So far, so good. 1st time buyer.",5
18417,GREAT!,5
18418,"Consignment made easy!! I use thredUP for bi-yearly closet purges. Then, I use the credit to purchase staples or items I need for the next season. The clean out bags are HUGE and the communication from thredUP about the timeline for payout has been great. My advice is to send in name brand, like new items because they are selective. On the otherside, every item I've purchased has been exquisitely clean and packaged. When they advertise that something is ""like new,"" they mean it.",5
18419,Very easy to filter for your specific needs!,5
18420,"Great prices, awesome variety, and more sustainable than buying new!",5
18421,it's been great!!,5
18422,once had issue but resolved quickly,4
18423,I love buying a new or slightly used garment that was sold originally for $148 knowing that I paid $25 to look perfect. Please keep up what you are doing. ~Gwen,5
18424,Good prices but descriptions are vague. No way to contact seller to ask questions,5
18425,sucks that guys are excluded,1
18426,phenomenal!,5
18427,Love it!,5
18428,didn't allow me to enter promo code!,3

18430,great!,5
18431,"good online store, i can find my favorite brands and good prices",5
18432,I love ThredUp. Great deals! Wish they offered more codes to repeat customers.,5
18433,"Shopping with Thredup is a hit or miss. I find some great deals, but when I have a question or need help...Forget about it. They have Absolutely No Customer Service tactics whatsoeverI So if you buy something that needs to be returned, you're basically stuck with an item you can't use! I've spent @ lot of money wi%h this company; however, they're about to lose my business for lack of customer service with you need it.",2
18434,"great prices, nice to U, very helpful 🤩",5
18435,easy thrifting! Returns love it!,5
18436,excellent,5
18437,"Love this app and business, I've only had one article of clothing arrive that wasn't what I expected. Returns are simple.",5
18438,easy to use great variety,5
18439,"Pro: Can shop particular brands at once Cons: No sort option, not enough cathegories - meaning you have to shop ALL SHOES even if you only need boots; terrible user interface. Sorry devs if you are considering handicapped users, add an option for them to tweak the UI. it is annoying for the most users. Also I want to price and ship my items myself. So...uninstalled",2
18440,love the feel-good method of marketing,5
18441,This makes shopping so much fun. Everything I have ordered so far I have loved! Everything has been great quality!,5
18442,LOVE THIS APP💝!! ITEMS ARE AS DESCRIBED. NO HASSLES ON RETURNS. PROVIDES ALOUT OF JOBS(IN AMERICA),5

18459,love it!,5
18460,great finds at incredible prices. can't believe I haven't heard of this site before,5
18461,Great finds!!! Love it❤,5
18462,"ThredUP is awesome but their app is broken. I am using a Moto G4 Plus which, yes, is an older phone but it works fine on other apps. But ThredUP's app locks up and refuses to go through checkout. Clicking add to cart takes a very long time to process, removing from cart does as well. Sometimes it removes the wrong item from the cart or you have to click remove multiple times for it to go through. But none of this matters because it's impossible to check out. Clicking ""Go to checkout"" does NOTHING, literally nothing. I only downloaded the app to use the mobile coupon and since I can't check out using the app, it was a complete waste of my time.",1
18463,Really love this app for the things I cannot find at a local thrift store.,5
18464,Great way to shop for quality clothing!,5
18465,"great app, very easy to use",5
18466,I just placed my second order with thredup and I can honestly say it's so simple and easy to find everything I'm looking for and at prices I want to pay while using this app. I always sort my items I'm looking for to the lowest prices and I still always find what I'm looking for. I have never paid more the $10 on any of the items I have purchased. They also always have some kind of discount available as well 😁. Very happy with thredup app.,5
18467,The only male options they have are for little kids,1
18468,love thredUP! I have shopped & sold items and always have a great experience! quality clothes at great prices. selling couldnt be easier!,5
18469,i love shopping with thredup!,5

18474,find products easily by style or size! great value! ethical choices!,5
18475,addicted to this app,5
18476,"the app is great, the categorization of items needs help though. Aeropostale and Old Navy tops do not belong in the designer dress section.",4
18477,love it!!,5
18478,very easy to use.,5
18479,great app,5
18480,"love this website, great prices and service!",5
18481,"Great app for shopping, every experience has been positive",5
18482,"Love this shop! Just make sure you don't need your order in a hurry, as shipping takes quite awhile. I've scored some great finds, so it's worth the wait for me.",5

18494,Love being thrifty!,4
18495,I keep finding more things to spend money on...,5
18496,"Great idea, love that they added a bundle feature, use it all the time. That being said, the filters often don't work (ie search for solids and end up with a million patterned items) and things are constantly mislabeled (ie vest as a blazer or a tank top as a sweater). Would love if they temporarily kept two piece suits together until x time if they don't sell. Always trying to hunt down matching pieces.",4
18497,"I really like all the options on this app! I'm really petite and usually extra small sizes in maternity clothes dont exist or I never find them. being pregnant with my second child, I love that I could find extra small pants/leggings here and i wont spend so much on clothes I'll only use for a few months. plus they are really cute!",5
18498,"They advertise clean out bags, but they are only available sometimes. Very few items are accepted and you recieve a fraction of what the item sells for. It's too bad I can't make more money on the site, I would purchase more.",2
18499,many and varied items - mice selection with good prices,5
18500,best shopping I can do. clothes are awesome,5

18505,I like the app so far but it would be better if I could sort my favorites.,4
18506,Nothing for the men.,3
18507,love the variety!!!,5
18508,Being a mom of 5 that is unable to drive I love being able to sell and buy my sons clothes cheap on here but my first order was missing a pair of pants and I've been having a lot of difficulty getting a hold of anyone. 😕,4
18509,excellent 🤗it's a great online shopping store,5
18510,fair,3
18511,Always a great experience. I find so many great things I can't find elsewhere ❤ Decent prices too!,5

18514,great selection of clothes and equally great prices. the process you can get on your consignments are some of the most reasonable out there.,5
18515,"Brands like Burberry, Prada, Hermes, Kate Spade, D&B and others that were previously too cost prohibitive are now bursting from my closet! thredUP is my new favorite place to shop!",5
18516,"User-friendly, clear and simple, good clean interface, and full features just like the website. The best virtual thrift store for my money.",5

18525,love this app. All my favorite name brands at a low price. so glad this exsists,5
18526,This store is really bad for my pocketbook....I am deep troublè,5
18527,"every time I check the app i buy something 😊.. even when they charge shipping, if you order less than 79$ they have alot of promotion..",5
18528,"super easy, great options",4
18529,"Jesus, I could have gotten the same amount of money by donating my clothes and claiming it on my tax return. I sent somewhere near 40 items that were either new or hardly worn name brands. After payout, I received only NINETY-ONE cents with the possibility of under $15 after consignment. Biggest waste of my time and money, I'll jumyself from now on. If that's not bad enough, if your consignment items don't sell, you can either BUY back by paying for shipping, or they get to keep them to either d",1
18530,great interface,5

18533,love this service.,5
18534,"This app is GREAT - it's so user-friendly and I've found some seriously amazing deals on nice clothing. Returns couldn't be easier, and the clean-out kits are a nice way to give back. I recommend it to everyone!",5
18535,I must say it was quite an experience to shop at your own convenience in your own home. We all have done shopping online or maybe a QVC hvc but to take your time and be more selective and have the filters to help you do so is a different type of experience. I received my first polka dotted box yesterday other than the necklace which was which was missing beads and I was a little bit disappointed. but overall it was a really good experience and I jumped online and shop some more.,4
18536,"Love it! Returns are easy, and shopping is a blast!",5
18537,"I love this app! Every thing is always in great shape, really quick delivery times and of course very reasonable prices",5
18538,"Very easy to use to shop, favorite or buy! Complete listing of items sold, in someone's cart, available or you can track by using ""all"". Browsing easier than desktop version, you do not have to wait for next page to load. The app has most of some of same features as desktop, just in different locations. For example notify me option is in listing. Additionally, you may not use the app to pay via Affirm, only allows paying via debit or credit card.",4
18539,LOVE♡LOVE♡LOVE♡Thread Up! ITS MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE TO SHOP!! AND I DONT HAVE TO GO ANYWHERE!,5
18540,"I reccomend Thredup to anyone who wants to get pretty things at great prices. I personally enjoy the occasional find of a ""new to me"" brand and I reap the benefits of looking stylishly up to date without even knowing it.",5

18550,"Easy to use, Great Products, Easy Returns",5
18551,have tried to update app 4 times now and have not been able to. whats wrong?,4
18552,💯,5
18553,They are not upfront about the percentage you get. 5% on item under $15. So on an item that sells for $12.99 you receive $0.60. Highway robbery. They sold my stuff for $170.00 and I received $16.00. It is not worth it. You are better off selling your own clothes or donating them to a worthy cause and getting a tax write off for the actual cost of the clothing.,1
18554,love the coach jackets and boots yes,5
18555,"I was disappointed with the variety of choices or that actually look like they're good quality... Most everything being sold looks like something I'd see at a Garage Sale table, and walk right by... I looked up ""bedding"" and found NOTHING adult size, everything was these tiny-tiny baby blankets that would only be used for a newborn...",1
18556,cute clothes at a good prices only downside is that you have a wait about 7-10 days for shipment. no issues so far.,5

18572,Every time I order from thredUp I am very pleased with the clothes and the service. Everyone should try thredUp! I'm certainly happy that I did!,5
18573,Redo your wardrobe for a fraction of the cost,5
18574,"great deals, search is not very intelligent, and favorites can randomly add items i didn't select. cant modify saved searches. takes getting used to.",3
18575,Absolutely love this app for purchasing clothes! They have amazing deals and they perfectly describe the condition of the item before you purchase it. This is now my first stop when I need something new to add to my closet,5
18576,Excellent app to purchase used clothing!,5
18577,Good app but needs some improvements,4

18584,"prices used to be reasonable, they're now ridiculous and I can get better items at a resale store for better prices.",1
18585,Great!,5
18586,I love this. This app makes shopping easy.,5
18587,I am absolutely hooked to ThredUp! Beautiful pieces for a beautiful price!,5

18590,My daughter and I love ThreadUP!,5
18591,I absolutely love this site for my both my 5 year old daughter and myself! I wish they had clothing for my husband as well. The pricing is unbeatable and the quality is excellent. Shipping is so fast and we get so excited seeing the adorable polka dot packages arrive.,5

18595,they steal clothes and call reject rescue so the clothes they dont buy from me they are Still selling them,1

18602,"THIEVES!!!! DO NOT SEND IN CLOTHING I sent in a bag packed with all Brand named clothing in excellent/like new condition. J.Crew,Hollister,Abercrombie,Ralph Lauren etc. They sold 16 items and are offering me $7 ..are you kidding me? When I saw they were giving me scratch for my items, I asked them to return the clothing. Apparently I didnt opt for return, was not aware I had to, and they said all my items are gone. They had every bs excuse to not list my other items. Furious! Scammed!",1
18603,love love love it!!!!,5
18604,"thredup used to be good but not anymore. Now there are restocking fees if you return items. And I've seen that most items are overpriced in general. example: a pair of shoes with a marshalls tag attached price $ 34.99 on tag with a red mark through it, so it was probably even cheaper than that. thredup had it listed as $60.99 down from $195.00.... I wish I could attch the screenshots of various examples I've seen. So sad. Their greed has costed me as a customer.",1
18605,"disappointed, returned most of what I purchased, it's expensive to return and they charge a restocking fee on top of that. customer service is great as long as you contact them within the limited hours they have, if you don't, it will be days before you get a response. The clothes are in generally worse shape that advertised. It's a good idea, just poor execution.",1
18606,"just received my order, very satisfied, loved the cute box and was pacaged so nice",5
18607,Love this!! The money you can save is awrsome... dont like it send it back...no hassle.. Great way to keep your closet fresh!,5

18609,"i love thredup!!!! not only for it's ease of use and affordable prices, but because they are thinking about the environment!!!",5
18610,A lot of options without digging through store racks!!,5
18611,"Easy to use, well organized!",5
18612,"easy to use, better download of items",5
18613,I am obsessed with this store and favoriting items on this app has helped me ditch a social media absent minding scrolling habit.,5
18614,great,5
18615,amazing,5
18616,"Customer service sucks. They don't get back to you. You pay for shipping that's not secure. FedEx leaves packages at your door while you're at work, and ThredUp doesn't let you manage your delivery. I've had TWO deliveries stolen due to this and they refuse to respond to my complaints. I'm never ordering for such an irresponsible company again.",1
18617,nice clothes.,5
18618,love it,5
18619,I will buy and sell clothes thru pmark from now on. I sent them hundreds of dollars of clothes and I have a credit of $17. it takes forever and they dont give you a choice as to how you are compensated. what a joke.,1
18620,the price is excellant for what your buying,5
18621,great buys and prices,4
18622,"great place to shop. ask for label and go. found evem high end tongs for 1\2 price. no pressure, easy to exchange or return. homebound this is the answer. many items brand new with great discounts. love this stote.",5
18623,Have ordered 3 times and am very pleased. Economical way to buy name brand clothing.,5
18624,NEVER SELL THEM ANY CLOTHES. THEY GIVE PENNY'S AND HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.,1
18625,mostly great but wish i could see the back of the item without having to click on the item. i have an android.,4
18626,AMAZING,5
18627,love shopping on thread up😀,5
18628,"easy to use, so much to see!",5
18629,good but does not sync up well when opened thru email link,4
18630,Pretty decent site for cheap name brand stuff! Kinda wish it was cheaper but hey again still a good deal on hit brand stuff!,5

18638,love it,5
18639,great.,5
18640,Love love love this app! ThredUp has a great selection of clothes. The prices are amazing for what you purchase. There are all kinds of name brands to choose from. They clothing is exactly as described. You definitely won't be disappointed.,5
18641,"Not worth it at all... everything used and out of style. it even prices you can find for newer products.. these prices are not low for used things. go to tj max, ross,Marshall and get great name brand stuff for these prices, but have better style and newer things, I already deleted this app.",1
18642,sooo much fun!!!,5
18643,Love Thredup! Easy to function app and response.,5
18644,"love this website! it's basically thrifting online. they're great at keeping their clothes trendy and current, which can be great but if you have a more eclectic or vintage style, it may not be for you. the app itself is super user friendly, fast, and well organized",5
18645,love it!!,5
18646,love this site!!!,5
18647,sucks gave them never used b4 items over 1000 got in return less than 100!!,2

18651,I love thredup!!! Cheap prices for great clothes!!😉,5
18652,Loved my first order. Wouldn't have even know they weren't brand new items. I'll be shopping here a lot!!,5
18653,"i love being able to find deals, but buyer beware: some of the deals are not deals. If you are willing to look around and not get caught up in the initial excitement, you'll do well.",4
18654,like the app easy to use but shipping seems to take awhile. my sister uses it alot!,4
18655,"I've had sucess using thread up in the past, but my most recent experience was very disappointing. I placed an order on Saturday morning, and within an hour realized I had ordered the wrong sizes. I immediately contacted customer service through the chat option in the app. There was no response until the next day when they told me the order had already been filled.... seriously?!?! I could understand if more time had gone by, but I reached out within an hour or so. Not impressed!!",1
18656,awesome,5
18657,"I always buy from Thred Up.What you find here, you cannot beat their prices anywhere.I love buying second hand.The items they sell,are high quality.",5
18658,"Overall good experience. Have had to return many things. Bust, waist and length measurements should be included on all items.",3
18659,"Great app, great site!",5
18660,A great option for our environment!,5
18661,easy to use- quick service,5
18662,horrible sellingexperience. lost all my clothes.,1
18663,i was a little nervous the first time I ordered... every single thing has been PERFECT! I am so deeply happy with my Thred Up experience!,5
18664,Love Thred-up! Great app saves your cart!,5
18665,first time,3
18666,Easy to use. Great products! my friend orders from there all the time and has the cutest things without breaking the bank.,5
18667,I've loved all of the clothes I've ordered so far! They come all wrapped up and in a cute little polkadot box. Glad I took a chance and ordered 😊,5
18668,Love this online shopping app! i just placed a second order. you can't go wrong especially when you don't have the money to buy new. the clothing i have purchased are in great condition and the shipping is pretty darn fast! Thank you ThredUP! You enabled me to buy clothes that are awesome and fantastic brand names that even i can afford!!,5
18669,did not get my free shipping after installing app.,2
18670,love it!,5
18671,amazing deals! easy to make returns. i love thred up,5
18672,"I really enjoy scoring unique finds, cleaning out my closet and reselling, and easily returning what doesn't quite fit right. All done from the comfort of my own home. Which is really helpful when you have really young children and shopping out and trying on clothes becomes an impossible task. I would recommend thredup to anyone and everyone!",5
18673,"The app is fine; however, I sent a lot of NICE things for sale and got nothing for them. I've never bought anything here but definitely wouldn't recommend selling to them. It's a rip off.",1
18674,Easy and convenient to use.,5
18675,fun,5
18676,easy shopping experience!,5
18677,Super easy!! Quick to find you are looking for!! Luv it!!,5
18678,Great app. They have nice clothes at a great price. Returns are fairly easy.,5
18679,easy search experience,5
18680,"I have used thredup for buying and selling. It is super simple to sell, however you never can tell what they will take and why they reject. I am okay with that, but some people might not be.",4
18681,Thus far I have enjoyed my shopping experience on this app. My only wish is that they had more images of the interiors of products such as purses and wallets.,4
18682,"Love it!!! As much as I love bargain hunting as the next budget conscious woman, this app/site takes 75% of the work off your back. Be care 'though. Those items you found can be snapped up pretty quickly by someone else!",5
18683,Easy Shopping makes for Easy Spending Love the app. Easy to use.,5
18684,"they take everything you give them, offer pennies on the dollar (if you want ""not approved"" items back there is a fee....... ) total scam",1
18685,"Just placed my first order...will have to wait and see. The app is great, especially after I learned how to use it! 《|| That was written over 4 months ago. Since, I have placed several orders and have always been pleased with the items received, and if not, returns are no hassle! The best part is I don't have to go to a shop, and I can shop anywhere and anytime! I love ThredUp!",5
18686,This app is awesome! i recently got the gastric bypass and go down clothing sizes really quick so i have to buy second hand so i dont end up broke. the clothes are always in GREAT condition and the shipping is not very slow. its amazing how cheap you can get great quality clothing. Thank you ThredUP you have changed my life! 😍😍😍😍😍,5
18687,I love this place!,5
18688,awesome selection,5
18689,LOVE IT!!!,5
18690,"No problems with the app, other than thredUP is highly addictive and I've actually had fun shopping for clothes.",5
18691,"Useless to me since im a man, i care about my clothes and im sad to find that 99.9% of all apps like this are for woman and kids. Would give five stars but its hard to find no sexist clothing stores.",1
18692,Easy sorting and search tools help you find what you are looking for. Email reminders before your cart expires are the best.,5
18693,Great app! Easy to use and I can't recall having an issue with the app itself. Returns are easy. They're not FAST by any means but I've not had any issues returning unwanted or unused goods.,4
18694,"out of many purchases, i have only been unlucky with two. be sure to go by measurements, not just size. also best to buy with tags or ""like new"" and zoom in on pics to really see the garments.",5
18695,Very good price!!,5
18696,very pleased with the quality and the fitting,5
18697,Great deals and even better prices! I have never been disappointed with an order and am definitely a fan of this site,5
18698,I still do not understand how it all works....but...I will catch on soon by doing things and figuring it out...I only get paid on the 3rd of every month....please bare with me....Pam,5
18699,love thred up! i tell everyone about this store...but really wish you sold mens clothes!!,5
18700,very easy to use and awesome clothing selection,5
18701,The clothes came pretty quickly but what came looked thrown together without thought. It was as if someone only picked pieces within my size range and didnt take style into consideration. They were pretty ugly - not flattering or feminine. Some articles looked heavily worn and all had a musty smell. I Tried something new but wont be doing it again.,1
18702,camt do anything but wonder where the mens clothimg is hidimg. soumds lile an app-ortunity for me with a niche like that.,5
18703,Best kept secret ever! Quality clothing for great prices!,5
18704,"I love this app. And using the filter helps me find exactly what I want without the over pricing of used clothes. I normally save over $1,000 everytime I shop. I always get 25 pieces and it normally equates to $3 per piece and everything I get is named brand. Just make sure to click the ""Like New"" option to get better quality clothing.",5
18705,hella cool but can we get some more promos or offers or even some new year chances 2 win xy or z would be so cool keep things interesting make it a fun social app would b cool too i saw ur addition to follow actually ppl do luv that heck why not right?! The only thing i would complain about truthfully is y'all REALLY kinda screw us on what y'all pay us 4 what stuff we send that ya keep i mean if there's any room in the budget couldya consider uping that i mean just a little would really help❤️👍,5
18706,"This site is AMAAAAAZING, I got 2 really cute brand new tops and saved $68 off of retail.",5
18707,"Overpriced for used clothing. Better off going to a thrift shop. Last items purchased did not match. Also, takes an eternity for items to arrive.",1
18708,Love it,5
18709,"Love this app! Very user friendly! Designer clothes as low as $3! The shipping has taken longer than I hoped in some instances, but you can choose to shop the warehouse near you and get them quicker! Definitely recommend 👍",5
18710,Love shopping here! Great deals on everything...even plus sizes!,5
18711,im addicted!!,5
18712,NEVER a disappointment!,5
18713,"Love this app. Fun and easy to use, I love getting the goody boxes. Prices are great!",5
18714,A great way to shop second hand clothing!,5
18715,Works great except it's up have all the options as the desktop version,4
18716,thought I could sell my stuff and get my money...didn't know I had to spend it on this website,1
18717,"As much as I like ThredUp, I discovered that the app was ALWAYS RUNNING, despite having settings set to limit background data, etc. I can think of no conceivable reason for this. It's less convenient going to the website (so I browse less frequently), but I uninstalled the app. It should only be running when actually in use.",3
18718,Great site!,5
18719,I've ordered from Thredup several times in the last month. The quality of the clothing and shoes are incredible. All you have to do is put your measurements and size preferences in and it will pull in every piece of clothing or shoes in those sizes. It's like shopping in a clothing store specifically for you. The prices for designer clothing are a fraction of the original cost. This now the only place I shop for clothing.,5
18720,Good quality items- shipped quickly- just as advertised!,5
18721,Great,5
18722,I love thred up. However I can find cheaper deals in walk in thrift stores without a doubt. That being said it ia quite easy to find brands you like and favoriting products also helps the shopping process .,4
18723,This thing flat eats up the data,2
18724,"I love thredup, they have beautiful clothes at beautiful prices.",5
18725,"Love thred up, but the app has decided to show me sizes that are not my size when I filter them.... Hard to browse.",3
18726,Love this app! Easy and fun to use. Great deals on clothes for me and my daughter.,5
18727,everything overcharged,1
18728,"Love selling, consigning and buying!! Great selection and prices.",5
18729,"Saves TONS of money!! Recieved my first order, and it is safe to say I will be buying all of my clothes from here. LOVE that I can search by inseam, as a tall girl those are things youre always worried about. Still loving this app! Highly recommended.",5
18730,love it! loyal shopper and will continue to shop here in the future.,5
18731,Easy shopping and i love it!,5
18732,some gliches but overall great!,4
18733,Easiest way to get a beautiful wardrobe of new clothes.,5
18734,the app doesnt open.,1
18735,"A great shopping site,wonderful idea to send you a box to clean out your closet.I'm gonna give it a try . We can always make room for new stuff!",5
18736,Designer brands at rudiculously low prices! I'm addicted!,5
18737,Good deals on used name brand clothing. I wish there were people on staff that could just do minor repairs on the clothing. It would also be helpful if the clothing was cleaned and pressed.,4
18738,"Hard to find bigger sizes that fit me & my budget, but I've found some here.",5
18739,I love ThredUP and this app. Excellent deals and the app is simple to use. 😁,5
18740,Everything I've ordered has been in great condition & a perfect fit!! I love to shop at thrift stores & this is a good way to do so without leaving the house!! I'll keep coming back for sure!!,5
18741,It's like getting new items for used prices. We LOVE this app!!,5
18742,"omg the goodie box was right on point every item fit to perfectly,,, cant wait to order my next box,, thanks",5
18743,So shopper friendly and easy to navigate. Love the search options.,5
18744,"Bought my son clothes on here, they are way overpriced and terrible misleading photos of the clothes. The clothes are old and outdated, I am never buying off here ever again.",1
18745,i love it. its cheap and good merchandise.,5
18746,wish they had more brand selections on their refined searches. but it's a great app amyway.,4
18747,not a stable app,2
18748,"I have shopped and sold at thredup even before they had their app and I'm still with them. Super easy to find what you want or didn't realize you wanted, love it!!!!!",5
18749,I am seriouly addicted to shopping thredUP.,5
18750,"excellent concept, easy to use app! two thumbs up!",5
18751,awesome place to find what your looking for. highly recommended!!!!!!,5
18752,"I absolutely love the thred up app! clothing is great, prices are awesome, and customer service is lovely.",5
18753,love it!,5
18754,I love this app...,5
18755,Great deal notifications and quick purchasing.,5
18756,I LOVE LOVE LOVE 😍😍😍😍 THIS PLACE CLOTHES ARE THE CUTEST PLUS SIZE CLOTHES I COULD FIND AT VERY DECENT PRICES PLEASE GIVE US MORE FREE SHIPPING MORE PURCHASES WOULD HAPPEN!,5
18757,EXCELLENT FIRST EXPERIENCE! I have been and will be continuing to refer folks to thredUP,5
18758,It makes it easy to shop online and has great brands,5
18759,"I love, love, love this app!",5
18760,Made some great finds. Bought my favorite jeans that i pay almost $50. I got same one that looked brand new for $13. Button up shirts for 1.99.,4
18761,I'm very pleased with my purchases. I have been ordering from threadUP for over a year now. I love it. I just placed an order for 8 garments for under $50.00 including tax and shipping!,5
18762,"great clothes, buy for me and my grandkids",5
18763,love all the different styles of clothing offered at great prices,5
18764,perfect way to save on great clothes while spreading positive change,5
18765,great selection! I've used this app/store many times and the experience is always without problems! use with confidence!,5
18766,"I used to love thread up and recommended it to everyone. Now its awful. the restocking fee is rediculous, there are way less opportunities for free shipping and discounts, and prices have gone up. I have also sold many items to thread up and got paid very little for them, but didn't mind because I wasn't looking to make money and figured it was worth it to be getting decent prices on the clothes that I bought. They are being selfish now and ripping off their customers.",1
18767,literally an addiction. I love thred up,5
18768,love shopping from this app..although i think some items are over priced,4
18769,"I love how easy it is to filter search results by fabric content, color or condition. I shop for myself and child on here. Love it!",5
18770,"I love stocking my, and especially my kids' clothes for so little! I do wish we could filter individual styles in a sale though, for example if I'm only looking for short sleeve tops.",5
18771,"Unimpressive. There are similar apps w/better quality. The stock photos are horrendous. Does not show close details/versatility. Some clothing isn't even pressed. Looks like it was dug out of bottom of dirty hamper. Ridiculous prices for outdated styles. I'm seeing Factory-made purses, for ex., they're selling for $100s! Lol, just bc the style is old doesn't mean it's worth more today, especially factory made. Overall, quality of products and efforts made by thredUP belong in the trash.",1
18772,easy! even for us old folk! love it,5
18773,pretty good app. even gives you a discount for using it!,5
18774,Easy to search. Lots of filter options to find what you're looking for as well as suggestions for similar items that gets more accurate as you browse.,5
18775,After losing nearly 40 lbs in 8 months i needed a whole new wardrobe. Because this weight loss may be temporary I didn't want to spend thousands of dollars on a new wardrobe only to have to get rid of it. thredup has allowed me to purchase high quality products for under $5 a piece! Gift giving through thredup is equally amazing and Christmas this year was abundant because of thredup! please sell mens clothing soon!,5
18776,it's great and easy to use,5
18777,successful,5
18778,Very nice merchandise.,5
18779,"So convenient! And great high-end thrift stuff and still worthy of the word ""thrift.""",5
18780,"what I bought was great,but a lot of your prices are way to high for used clothing. I might have to stick with goodwill,where I have found designer clothes for next to nothing.",2
18781,Awesome deals on great name brand items. Every item fits description and size.,5
18782,"It's fun to just look at the new clothes they get in daily! Easy to use app, the shipping could be faster, but I understand that's easier said than done. I haven't had a bad experience yet. everything arrives as described. I love promo codes!",5
18783,"Great place to donate or sell your clothing, even better place to shop. You can save your favortie items for later and omce you haave an item in your cart, it will be there for 24 hours so no one else will snatch it up. The only downside for me is probably that there is too much to choose from. Also, the filters sometimes do not work as much as I would hope.",4
18784,love it!,5
18785,"Love it♡ Edit: I've fallen out of love. There are so many bugs now... Your search results are a mess (it doesn't search within the parameters given), while scrolling through options it jumps to the home screen of the app, and while adding an item to my favorites... it adds the item after it as well. I'm putting my desire to shop on hold for a while... Shopping online shouldn't be so frustrating. Deleted account and uninstalled.",1
18786,"LOVE this site! What a great find. Tons of choices, user friendly, fast delivery ... very pleased.",5
18787,Every transaction went very quickly and very smoothly!,5
18788,love it,5
18789,the best clothes ever. gently used and I love the business model. you guys are awesome,5
18790,Easy to use,5
18791,Awesome,5
18792,great customer service,5
18793,I am obsessed with thredUP right now!! Love my favorites goodie box❣️ Definitely great if your already a thrifty shopper like me. The pure Joy of finding MY brands at cheap prices 🤑,5
18794,Great,5
18795,received an empty package,1
18796,I really enjoy ThredUp it's very inexpensive and offers a variety of designer brand. ThredUp also help me eliminate the long line check out at the stores. I love it❤,5
18797,Amazing things at great prices. The app is easy to use.,5
18798,received my first goody box from thred up and loved it.,5
18799,easy to use app. excellent placeholders so you're always returning to where you left off in your search.,5
18800,great finds and closet clean outs earn more store credit for future purchases!,5
18801,Enjoyed shopping here.,4
18802,New or gently used top brands for great prices!!!,5
18803,"Addicting! i am not enamored with their customer service, but the app is fantastic and you won't find a better value for your money.",5
18804,"The filters in this app make it so easy to shop. And everything I've ordered has been in great shape, exactly as the quality was described.",5
18805,This app works really well. I never have connectivity issues and it is easy to navigate. the only issue I have is that some of the features and categories from the website are not available.,4
18806,Thred Up takes to long to process bags and after processing you receive a minor payout or no payout at all. Local consignment is much better to use.,1
18807,Very easy to find exactly what I want.,5
18808,scam ... they buy just enough to cover shipping so they dont owe you anything! they also resale your items for 4x so much as they pay you! you will get .70 for a pair of brand new pants with the rags still attached!!,1
18809,"super easy to use, no glitches, and faster than using the web to view the goodies on thredUP.",5
18810,"Buyer beware! I ordered a pair of very attractive pants from here that was originally $60 and onsale for $11.99 (with tags still attached!). I was later informed that they were ""misplaced"". I will not be ordering from this company again.",2
18811,Love this app and the clothes. Already ordered 3 times and haven't had the app a month.,5
18812,Great app. Great prices! Great selection!,5
18813,Everything I have orded has pleased me and the sizes are accurate.,5
18814,The best part is that the app automatically filters by your sizes. Why doesn't every shopping app do this?? Its brilliant!!,5
18815,just love it!! I search for exactly what I am looking for and lots of choices pop up!!,5
18816,"Only place I go for my clothes! I'm addicted to this site. I love the quality of clothes I receive. If I dont or something is just not right, I send it back for a full credit to get more. The downsides are the long wait times for arrival of items from outside warehouses, the wait time for return credit, the reimbursement for consignment items(just terrible), and getting stuck with final sale items when Thredup made a mistake in measurements. 😒",4
18817,😍😍😍😍😍,5
18818,I love Thred Up and their ap is very easy to navigate.,5
18819,live this app,5
18820,"love to find good deals, and they have them!",5
18821,Thanks.,5
18822,"easy search functions, easy returns, low prices, FUN to scroll thru!!",5
18823,great items at a great price,5
18824,Just saved over $60 and fast delivery. Great deals and app.,5
18825,Easy and fast!,5
18826,ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PLACE TO SHOP HANDS DOWN!!! UNBEATABLE!!,5
18827,"Jean's marked 35 inseam arrived and were ""short"". Not paying 9 bucks to send them back. probably won't order again.",2
18828,"I like the fact that sizing for pants is given, since they are the most difficult article of clothing to fit. (rise, waist, inseam)",5
18829,easy to use,5
18830,excellent app for finding great deals,5
18831,"Most items are as described, but I have had a few items come to me with holes or stains. Items are mailed quite timely and the selection is pretty decent. If you know your size in the brand, this is a perfect shopping app.",4
18832,"I really enjoy the quality of the items they sell, I also enjoy the wide variety of choices. The service is great! I just love thredUP.",5
18833,wow!!! I can't stop shopping!,5
18834,Great app!,5
18835,Addicting.,5
18836,"I have ordered from Thread Up multiple times. A purse I bought had not been cleaned out, a sweater listed as ""LIKE NEW"" was in very poor condition and I sent many items to be sold and only earned $7.",3
18837,I accidentally put an order and tried to cancel it at very minute but.. nothing is resolve. Customer support send you a message saying the customer service is back up so you have to wait for them to send you a message not a call but message.. trendup is just another website that mislead people... I would not recommend to anyone,1
18838,I bought 1 sweater for a great price. The sweater is nice. The CEO sent me an email. Which was cool. overall a good experience.,4
18839,"Best online thrift store ever. I highly recommend Thred Up. Shopping is easy through the filters they provide, they also provide the best details on every product, they ship the products in a nice package with tissue paper, and you get exactly what you pick out. I've never been let down by this company and I will continue to be a customer. Sizes are accurate and pricing is fair. You won't be let down.",5
18840,Beautiful dresses with unbelievable low price. Love it!:-),5
18841,"great clean cut website and app that is professional, easy to use, and makes everything easy! a great business!",5
18842,"Love this site, love the app too!!!",5
18843,Never received a bag I was promised to send in items. Customer support does not respond in a timely manner. Items are overpriced. More than the high end stores I purchase from.,2
18844,I love thredup,5
18845,"App is buggy and limited in features. Website is more reliable and has more search parameters available, but even the website doesn't have it all. Frequently have to use the website instead of the app. The app has a number of issues related to its search feature. -Cannot search by inseam length, shoe width, ring size, etc. This is annoying when you aren't looking for a standard size. -Searching across categories doesn't always produce reliable results. -Searching by any shoe width always returns zero results. -The shoe width parameter only appears when you go to the ""search"" tab, but not when you browse by using the shoe category. Not that it works anyway. When ThredUp sends out emails advertising promo codes via a ""game"" or blog post, you have to use the website to access it. App won't let you see it.",1
18846,This app is seriously my new addiction & its only been a couple days since I first discovered it! I cant Express enough how much I love whomever had this wonderful idea. Thank you,5
18847,LOVE Thredup. App is ok,4
18848,Good prices,5
18849,Great site for inexpensive quality clothing!,5
18850,"Really cool concept and app, however when suggesting ""something similar"", it should either give you the ability to filter for your size or only show your size.",4
18851,Amazing prices and fast shipping! Love this site!,5
18852,"Look hard, get great bargains!",5
18853,"My opinion, handbags should be refundable especially if they are damaged. I received one and the comments from Threadup stated in excellent condition you might think it's new.It cost me over $100.00 and I can't use it at all, outside damaged.I will not buy another bag from them.I threw away money thinking the handbag was ok,but very damaged on outside.",5
18854,"Literally, so easy to find what you want. Best way to shop secondhand!",5
18855,Great prices! Cute clothes,5
18856,"I have spend a LOT of money with Thredup over the last several years. That's over. Lengthening shipping and processing times, fine. Restocking fee, okay. The straw breaking the camel's back is the several high end items that have turned out to be damaged (and that one knock off that customer service didn't seem concerned about). I don't mind the short return window, but I've ended up with several tops with holes in them (one with a stain I noticed quick enough to return). The quality control has failed me. I trust when it says ""like new"" then find a hole! Way too many pieces I've been very excited about only to find them needing repair. The business has not worn scaling up well, so I'll take my business elsewhere.",2
18857,"The only thing that I have found that I don't like about this app, is that I cannot update my email address and contact information.",4
18858,Great prices and big variety.,5
18859,Love this app!,5
18860,Expensive brands at low prices!,5
18861,I stumbled on Thred Up sometime ago and I love the app. It makes shopping super easy and I am always looking for that must have item.,5
18862,"Easy to use, loads fast.",5
18863,"Everything Ive bought so far has been perfect, beautiful, and priced so low I could afford 5 or 6 things instead of one too expensive ítem at the original Store. I love thredup!!!",5
18864,Nice or new...low prices too!!!!,5
18865,"Ok, I love this app, and I spend too much money. However, while I wait for certain items to hopefully become available by popping out of other's carts, I try to maintain the items I want in my cart. But I realized the price slowly goes up when you do this on most of the items. While I can't blame them, supply and demand, I really don't like it. And delete any items I see go up in price that I would have bought otherwise.",3
18866,Love it,4
18867,Like it a lot!,5
18868,Love buying from Thred Up. Easy to return. Don't like restocking fee.,5
18869,Very fast and easy to use!,5
18870,I love this app because there are many selections and the filters help you narrow down your search,5
18871,Love this stuff,5
18872,love the convenience of this shopping app. super easy and fast to find the right outfit..,5
18873,Easy to use and love this store!,5
18874,Love this app so much! Easy to navigate and great prices!,5
18875,They need to be more accurate when listing items,2
18876,"I buy most of my clothes on here. I like that they have dimensions on the clothes not just sizes because size can vary so much from company to company. They are honest about the quality of the items, and the prices are great! Highly recommend.",5
18877,I do not like their return policy.,1
18878,With ThredUp I have revamped my wardrobe with designer pieces at a fraction of retail prices. The app allows me to browse and save items whenever and wherever I want.,5
18879,"If you like to thrift, you will love this.",5
18880,"Great app, fantastic company👍",5
18881,love it!,5
18882,"Wonderful way to get rid of unwanted, never wearing, clothes, shoes, etc...!!",5
18883,I ordered a handbag and a wallet. Paid 84.00 and the ad said leather. It's not leather it's vinyl and I cant get a refund or even anyone to contact me back. Never will buy from here again or reccomend this site. Poor customer service. These products are not even worth 25$,1
18884,Always have the best clothes to choose from.,5
18885,Bargains!!!!,5
18886,Love love love thredup!!!,5
18887,I can get anything on this app!!!,5
18888,Boojee on a budget! My wardrobe has never been better and luxurious at a low cost.,5
18889,App itself isn't a complete bomb but the experience with selling it ThredUp is a waste of time and a rip off. I wouldn't bother to ever sell with them again. Customer service is also little to none.,1
18890,"Great concept, great selection!",5
18891,"So far, it's seems pretty good!",5
18892,"Thredup is a great place to find cheaper than new used clothes. Some things could be improved, like adding a sleeve length filter to dresses and waist measurements to skirts. It's more expensive than a local consignment store, returns are relatively easy. Poshmark is another site that I check for specific pieces. Selling to thredup gets cents per piece on low end stuff so keep that in mind.",5
18893,So cool,5
18894,I love it!! They have great quality clothes at a great price.,5
18895,Wonderful way to shop,5
18896,"Most comfortable dress I bought, fits my body perfect, now my favorite dress ever.",5
18897,The ordering process is very easy when using the app. Loved the discount and free shipping on my first app order.,5
18898,Love love love,5
18899,Easy to return if needed. Promos often!,5
18900,I love their 3 month interest free plan!!!,5
18901,I'm able to access this site quicker and searching for different items with ease.,5
18902,Theres no mens clothing...,1
18903,Love everything I brought so far. My weakness is designer bags especially Coach !,5
18904,App worked great until December update. If you want to go back a page you will lose browsing history,2
18905,Thred Up is a way to feel good about shopping as you're reducing your carbon foot print!,5
18906,"The selection is okay, every now and then you can find good items. The payout prices are ridiculous for the amount they resale items and they are super picky on what they choose to resale. It's okay if your just looking to clean out your closet and not really care about getting paid in return.",2
18907,Love it!,5
18908,No commit,2
18909,Love everything about this app,5
18910,Love this app and the great deals on clothes,5
18911,Great app!!,5
18912,Hooked on this site!,5
18913,STOP updating my app.,1
18914,"Great clothes, horrible customer service.",1
18915,Absolutely LOVE this app!!,5
18916,I wish they would describe the colors better warm or cold.,4
18917,Love it. Its nice & cheap. Thanks,5
18918,Love this app,5
18919,I was wrong. Good company.,5
18920,most everything I've bought from thread up is in excellent condition.love seeing all the new items.,5
18921,The filters in the app work poorly compared with the mobile site.,2
18922,"I like this app, the clothes are always in good condition and I love that returns are a breeze!",5
18923,"Update: I'm now a forever fan of Thred Up! ""Several orders later, I'm still as pleased with the entire shopping experience as I was with my 1st."" ""My 1st order arrived! Clean beautiful quality, as described. I love my purchases, and expect to be a loyal customer from here on out.""",5
18924,The descriptions of items are sometimes inaccurate and it is difficult to return items when received and they dont fit.,3
18925,"I love thredUP! The desktop site has slightly more features than the Android app. For example, in the app, I couldn't find how to view my recommendations. Otherwise, the app is clean and neat, and so easy to use, that I can ""power shop"" my eay through lunch. I just pop it right open and find fresh, beautiful things have been added~ yay! I hope a future improvement will be that items with a specific motif mention those in the keywords - so I could search for blouses with cats, or funny t shirts. I think all the clothes with images and currently just labeled as ""graphic."" Overall, recommend this app. Fun to browse, great selection, choose your own budget.",4
18926,"I love searching for the hidden gems! Great deals on great clothes. Love everything I order! Easy, no hassle returns on items I send back (which is seldom).",5
18927,"Got charged close to $250 for a box of clothing that I NEVER received, and trying to reach their customer service for help has been a complete waste of time.. will stick to Stitch Fix next time",1
18928,Addicted.,5
18929,Great clothes!,5
18930,Its a way to buy stylish clothes that you can afford.,5
18931,Getting better by day,5
18932,So addicting and easy to peruse. My closet is full! Time to donate and pay it forward:),5
18933,I have found some perfect gifts here!!,5
18934,I love this app!,5
18935,Haven't shopped here in awhile....fixing to ...will let u know,5
18936,"I hard a hard time at first finding things that fit but now I've discovered a few more brands that usually fit me. Also, paying attention to the actual measurements of the garments is better than going by the arbitrary size - I'm a small in some brands and a large in others!",5
18937,I shop thredUP a lot and the app makes it super easy!,5
18938,"Superb place to browse and buy gently used clothing, shoes and accessories with an excellent array of designers and price tags that'll knock your socks off.",5
18939,Find things to match my taste in possessions,4
18940,I have been shopping from ThredUp for three years now and is my primary shopping place. I am always pleased with the products I get as well as the quality. I get brands that I otherwise couldn't afford and wouldn't purchase for full price. I get compliment on my outfits and I never fail to say they are from ThredUp,5
18941,Just wish there were more pictures of the inside of handbags,4
18942,I love it!! Needed work outfits and I found all that I wanted within budget. Happy camper right here.,5
18943,"I like ThredUp in general but their website and app could use some work. You have to search to contact customer service making it kind of hard. My biggest complaint is that the items only have 2 pictures, I feel there should at least be 5.",3
18944,The items i purchase was easy shopping. The price was great. an the quality,5
18945,"The app does not work during peak hours and will kickk you out from time to time, but on average works adequately.",4
18946,It's basically an upscale online Goodwill!! I love it!,5
18947,The prices are very expensive for what you get. They are selling some used clothing for retail price. I also tried selling clothing to them and they give you nothing for nice things. I had a DVF dress and they didnt give me a penny for it. I wish I could get it back. I would not recommend selling on here. Buying is ok if you want to pay the asking price,2
18948,"I thought this was a thrift store app, the prices were ridiculous!",1
18949,Easy to navigate. I like it very much!,5
18950,Love it,5
18951,Great shoes and clothes,5
18952,I bought TWENTY ONE articles of clothing for $61. The app is amazing!,5
18953,Love all the variety in styles. Like the goody boxes. Easy to navigate on the app.,5
18954,Love the fact of getting these clothes at huge markdowns.,5
18955,Great way to fill your closet with nearly new/new clothes. Found it way more successful than Stitchfix or Wantable and a lot cheaper!,5
18956,Awesome price. Good stuff,5
18957,Love it!,5
18958,excellant as always,5
18959,I love this service and the app!,5
18960,I totally love this app and store 🙂.. I find great deals on everything and love that they offer coupons to save even more that's a big plus for me 👍,5
18961,Wow! Clothes I can afford in my size!,5
18962,"Like the app, but there are some navigation quirks like when you open then favorite an item, the item next to it also gets favorited.",4
18963,No customer service,2
18964,They have well detailed listings and specific sizes. They even have many discounts and their pricing is reasonable. I could spend hours scrolling on this app finding things I like.,5
18965,"Each item I have ordered and received, I have really loved. Thank you.",5
18966,Love love love this business & super easy app!,5
18967,I haven't been disappointed yet.,5
18968,Items are as advertised!,5
18969,so far this is the best way to satisfy my love of great Brands and quality products.,5
18970,"Used to love and recommend thredup. Now it's too expensive for the quality, and it costs money to return.",2
18971,Just placed my first order. Can't wait for its arrival.,5
18972,"Really easy to search, add to favorite, order, track orders, etc",5
18973,Love the app,5
18974,"Excellent app, I saved a ton of money shopping here!",5
18975,Best way to buy used....,5
18976,I absolutely love thredup! I get to save money and recycle clothing at the same time!,5
18977,I am in love with Thred Up!,5
18978,no customer support,1
18979,Awesome. Addicting!,5
18980,Great,5
18981,Love!!,5
18982,addictive and great deals!,5
18983,I've found some incredible deals on things I love! Customer service is also super helpful if there's ever an issue.,5
18984,Great app for finding fashion treasures,4
18985,Makes shopping so easy!,5
18986,Easy app to use and checkout was fast and easy.,5
18987,When I first began shopping on this app I wouldve given them 5 stars but at that time I was shopping for my daughter. As a plus sized woman shopping on this site has been horrible for me. I dont feel included because all the plus sized clothong is priced on the higher end. I cant even afford to purchase anything for myself from this site.,3
18988,Good reliable store!,5
18989,HOOKED!!!,5
18990,"My first App experience! Super easy, efficient, and convenient. Many thanks!",5
18991,Great items. I miss the free shipping once you get to a certain amount. But over all love it💞,5
18992,"Great name brand and store brand clothes in terrific condition, and with very reasonable prices.",5
18993,I am addicted to it... thanks,5
18994,Love this app great prices,5
18995,Great app. My favorites were duplicating over and over though. I liked better when they were on separate pages.,4
18996,Love the easy navigation!,5
18997,"Like the fact that I can customize searches down to exact color, style and sizes for quick searches.",4
18998,I love this app,5
18999,I enjoy being able to browse for great deals on nice quality merchandise.,4
19000,"Great shopping experience, fast delivery, clothes arrive neat and clean and packaged with care. Returns are a breeze as well. Go ahead and order. You won't be sorry.",5
19001,User friendly app. I have purchased from ThredUP many times. I love having the app for shopping when I don't have access to my computer.,5
19002,"It seems like the website may have a few more filter features but overall, the app is easy to use and just as fun (and addictive!) Be careful. If you download, you will be hooked. I check ThredUp more than Instagram.",5
19003,I have been able to expand my wardrobe without spending a lot of money and I have been able to find interesting pieces that I wouldn't find in the store which I appreciate the app works great and all the codes work,5
19004,Love it,5
19005,Able to find quality clothes at a low price.,5
19006,Love this site and app is so easy,5
19007,I love this app!! Everything I've ordered is AWESOME and I've saved so much money! I definitely recommend!!!,5
19008,So far so good!,5
19009,"Love thred up! There's no large thrift stores near me, so it's super convenient. Their app is easy to navigate and their clothes have always been clean and of great quality. It's a little more expensive than say goodwill, but not by a whole lot and the overall quality and variety is miles better.",5
19010,Love it!,5
19011,It's easy to find what you're looking for plus some.,5
19012,Best app ever,5
19013,Easy to use. Love it!,5
19014,Thank you so much!,5
19015,Looks nice but being there is no mens category to me it is useless. You know men like to have money also.,1
19016,Love the deals,5
19017,🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼,5
19018,Love this company... so much fun getting high quality clothes at such fantastic prices.,5
19019,Great way to buy clothes and sell extra stuff from your closet!,5
19020,"I like this app and will probably buy from it again but I would love it if the descriptions were way more specific for each item. For example, I want pair of Nike Zoom Train Complete (a specific style), but there is no way to search like this. The most narrowed down you can get is simply searching for ""Nike"". Also, how come there is no men's part to the app? This would bring so many more people to the app",3
19021,Best app ever!,5
19022,"Great values! I have found MANY treasures thru Thred Up! The only negative I have found is the filters can be a bit wonky, but that's doesn't warrant dropping it any stars. Prices are incredible! I know there are numerous other recycled clothing apps, Thred Up is, by far, the easiest to use the best selection & the best prices!",5
19023,The ThredUp app works very well.,5
19024,Make the app like the website in that you can click on the brand of an item to peruse the other items of that brand currently in stock please.,4
19025,Love the price,5
19026,"Great selection, great prices. Easy to use and fast shipping.",5
19027,Great..online secondhand store 😊,4
19028,I love the huge selections thredup has and some items are brand new with tags. I love it!,5
19029,"A wonderful shopping experience great discounts, quality clothing, shoes, coats. Oh my goodness...I'm hook.",5
19030,"Love, love, love thredup",5
19031,The only problem I have had is with things shipped through Fed Ex. They dont always arrive when they are supposed to.,4
19032,"The only thing I would suggest is to have measurements on all clothing (bust, hip, length) that would save alot of my returns!",5
19033,Love this app. Great way to shop great brands for affordable prices,5
19034,Great app. Would be nice if saving searches we're easier. Love the idea and remain a loyal customer.,4
19035,Good selection and savings - items are accurately depicted - wish the search and suggestion options were more robust,5
19036,Love shopping this site for items I cn't find elsewhere.,5
19037,Great site. Cheap affordable clothing,4
19038,Love! Love! This app.. I love bargains,5
19039,Very easy to use.,5
19040,Love buying clothes but I got pennies back for expensive items I sent in. Not worth sending your clothes in but great place to buy.,3
19041,Enjoying this app,5
19042,Love it!,5
19043,Get a lot for my money. Love this app,4
19044,Quality products with quick delivery !,5
19045,"Really enjoy shopping on the app. Get good deals with sale codes. Full price, the items tend to be over priced, but good deals are possible if patient enough to page through",5
19046,I have never had a problem with items coming to me in bad shape actually I got a little addicted to the website and reffered this site to everyone I know. My problem is pricing has rose drastically. I get cheaper new name brand tags on clothes at Ross or Burlington or Marshalls or tj Maxx. I feel owner has gotten a little greedy. Please remember you are a thrift store thred up! Otherwise if you don't mind the pricing then I do feel they have good quality used clothes.,2
19047,Looove it!!,5
19048,Great app and Service!,5
19049,"I love this App! It Makes it so easy to shop! They have great deals on great secondhand clothes! Their Clean out program is Amazing, I like to get the credit for the clothes out of my closet so I can shop more! I Love ThredUP!!!",5
19050,I think you need to be cautious when you purchase something because if it comes and it's not what you think thought it was they're going to charge you a big amount to restock it so you will not get a full refund. I'm not happy at all,2
19051,Good prices on used name brand clothing.,4
19052,Love using this app...soo easy & appealing!,5
19053,"This is a great app. I do kind of wish for better pictures for clothing and more in depth photos but I understand its purpose and so I am fairly content. I do believe that there can be room for improvement, but for now it is made up for by the extraordinary customer service.",4
19054,"Items arrived exactly as expected, the prices are terrific, and the app is very user-friendly. Excellent site for buying and selling",5
19055,The prices are outrageous.,3
19056,I love that I can browse and shop my specific sizes and styles anytime. They send me discount codes all the time to use and keep track of my return credits. It's so easy!!,5
19057,Love it,5
19058,Love it,5
19059,Like it,5
19060,Absolutely love thredup,5
19061,Great value on top quality clothing. And I love the way it comes packaged.,5
19062,Love it. THANKS,5
19063,This app is only part of what's great about threadUP.,5
19064,I love threadup! I have ordered several different times and the clothing has always been exactly as described!,5
19065,"I was using stitch fix before, but decided to try thredup. My thredup stylist really paid attention to the things I liked, and the things I mentioned I did not like for my body type. My stitch fix stylist kept sending me what I guess they thought I should like. I LOVED my first goody box! I was only sad that I couldn't afford to buy it all! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of a discrepancy in my return order that kept me from ordering another goody box. We did get it straightened out!",4
19066,Great deals on great brands,5
19067,Thredup is the way to go!,5
19068,"I set notification settings so that this app SHOULD NOT notify me about coupons and specials, yet this morning at 7am my phone vibrated and I had a notification from thread up about a discount code. This is not appropriate. Please respect my notification choices. DON'T download this app unless you want them sending you notifications every day telling you to buy from their store.",1
19069,Love it! Easy to use. Clothes are in good condition. Great customer service!,5
19070,Super convenient!,5
19071,I've loved everything I've ordered and never could have afforded these brands!!,5
19072,"Great products, everything I have order was as described!",4
19073,Great app. I highly recommend! I have send in about 5 bags of clothes now and it was mainly stuff I was going to take to my local thrift shop but instead mailed out for free and got a decent return back! 💵 Sending good quality name brands will obviously get you a larger payout as well.,5
19074,I'm new to this app and an instant convert after my first order. I'm in love with these beautiful items!,5
19075,"TOTAL RIPOFF!!!! I sent a bag with at least $750 worth of like new designer clothing. My payout is for 3 shirts totaling $2.95!! I would have done SO much better selling my things on ebay!!!!!! I'm so mad that I even thought thredup would be a good idea!! My advice, don't do it! They will steal your stuff!!!",1
19076,I love it,5
19077,Love everything about it. I ordered and was very pleased with how clean and nicely packaged they were,5
19078,"love ur store,I love the discount too and it's easy to return as well",3
19079,Love it nobody else comes close to the deals here.,5
19080,Easy to use. Wish I could track where my order is throughout the shipping process though,4
19081,Love it,5
19082,Quality bargains!,5
19083,"I used their clean out bag, however they offered me pennies and didn't count all of my items.",2
19084,The best clothes for the best prices. Endless amounts,5
19085,Works well i love it!!,5
19086,Love the selection,5
19087,Problematic in Canada,3
19088,Makes it easier to get your style and size. Quick check out.,5
19089,I have already ordered twice from the app and it's really easy to use and I will continue to use the app!,5
19090,Love this app,5
19091,I use this for myself and my kids! Great finds and the quality is VERY accurate. As if buying brand new!!!,5
19092,LOVE LOVE LOVE!,5
19093,Love it very useful!,5
19094,"I love this app, it's easy to use and there are some great finds! :))",5
19095,"I decided to try threadup for the 1st time recently. I sent in a huge bag of brand new, designer items and was credited. 55 cents. CENTS!!! That does not even make up for the time I've wasted. I would have, should have donated the clothing (over 50 items for sure) to charity. Atleast it would have been somewhat rewarding. Never again.",1
19096,I can find expensive brands at affordable prices I've always wanted!,5
19097,Love it!,5
19098,Awesome.,4

19107,Oh my gosh! Great clothes that I can afford.,5
19108,Easy ordering and fun receiving!,5
19109,"Huge selection, love it",5
19110,I love the reminders and ability to have a chance to buy something that is in another cart. I can see the time limit and plan!,5
19111,"I've been purchasing clothes for my 3 grandchildren for their birthdays, and Christmas for the last few years and I've never been disappointed in any purchase I've made, and everything has been delivered VERY quickly, and packaged so nicely. I will definitely continue to shop for their gifts here for many years to come",5
19112,The app is fine however the company itself has changed for the negative since opening. They now give you cents for your items and tell you the beautiful and clean items show or are worn out and tell you the items gave been donated. I took photos of everything I sent this last time and their claims were bogus. They have become unethical in my oppinion.,2
19113,"I really like shopping on here! Fantastic selection, grest prices, fast shipping!!",5
19114,Excellent variety and fun,5
19115,Love it so far.,5
19116,Love the filter to easily find what I'm looking for.,5
19117,Glad I can order from the pa warehouse and get my items in less than 4days,5
19118,Gently used designer brands and others about 50% off new retail,5
19119,Love the items,5
19120,Love it!,5
19121,Easy to use and good quality stuff.,5
19122,"Easy to navigate and use, although it's kind of a pain to navigate to special sizes (like petite only).",4
19123,Best consignment shop ever!,5
19124,Just fun to see variety from home.,5
19125,Love this app! Love how it can save preferences so I don't have to click into an item only to find out it is not in my size after all. Returns are easy when necessary and there are so many awesome deals!,5
19126,Easy to use!!! Cute clothes that I can't find around home!,4
19127,Love it!,5
19128,I think it needs to have more baby options and needs update on baby items on what you're looking for,3
19129,Excellent app. Very easy to use.,5
19130,The items are nice,4
19131,Awesome hope my order is just as good as photo,5
19132,I sent clothes in never again beware.,1
19133,Love the clothes,5
19134,This app is definitely something to check out!! I always am highly satisfied with the deals I find on here!,5
19135,love to shop here esp clothings a lil bit unhappy with the shoes (bought 2 shoes which are way too big for my feet),5
19136,"Prices went up and are inconsistent depending on where the garment is located. PA and IL tends to price the items higher, compared to CA and GA for example. If you sell your clothes to them, do not expect to get your money's worth. Purchase with the intent on never returning, they will charge you an arm and a leg to return an item. Anticipate company errors, regarding incorrect measurements and sizing. If this happens to you, good luck, you're going to need it-especially if you get Francisco as your customer service representative..... Lastly, only purchase products that are described as ""in excellent condition,"" the other items aren't worth the price point.",5
19137,FABULOUS!!! My go to when I need something specific or just something new in my closet. I can set the price im looking for so i never break the bank.,5
19138,Love it and super easy to use!,5
19139,"Prices are wayyy to expensive, have been hiked up recently what gives?",2
19140,I have found a lot of great deals!! Love it :),5
19141,rip off,1
19142,I think this was such a good idea Kinda Company...,5
19143,Love it. Great variety and prices,5
19144,"Love threadUP! The quality, prices, service and wide selection are a wonderful blessing! I will shop here in a heartbeat from the comfort of my warm , cozy living room chair. Mall shopping is not for me. I give threadUP a resounding Thank You!",5
19145,Love it so far have loved all my purchases!,5
19146,I gotta take this app off of my phone. Too easy for me to spend money. I love it.,5
19147,Hate your app,1
19148,"I just love this apps,",5
19149,"High quality, great prices, free shipping and easy returns....love it",5
19150,"I love this app, I'm a teen on a bad salary and i just bought a ton of Tommy hilfigure. I always want to look my best because that's just how high school is.its a great experience and app.",5
19151,Great way to get exactly what I'm looking for without spending a lot.,5
19152,I used to love this app and the concept but they have really changed. The purchase used Clothing and resale it. Not only have the prices gone up but the condition of the items has gone down and now they have recently tacked on a $2 restocking fee if you return the item for store credit! I never received 2 times equaling $40 and they never arrived. I emailed customer service since they no longer offer a chat option and was told it would be refunded. I never got the refund! I'm deleting this app. Don't even bother getting mixed up with this company!,2
19153,So happy to have found this site. Now I can afford great quality designer clothes at great prices.,5
19154,Great way to switch the clothes I don't want for ones I do.,4
19155,"Great concept. Love the clothes. App crashes often, which is frustrating. Search doesn't always work.",4
19156,I love it.,5
19157,It's where I go to for most of my clothing purchases,5
19158,"Awesome app, I have used quite often",5
19159,I love that you can narrow your search by a variety of filters.,5
19160,I like this store,4
19161,Best way to get quality clothes and clean out your closet,5
19162,<3. It. (:,5
19163,Had a little trouble getting it to take my credit card but PayPal went through ok,5
19164,I have ordered sevsral things from clothes to boots and bags. All of the things I have ordered have come looking new and exactly how I expected them to look!,5
19165,Easy to use,5
19166,I'm so glad I found this app. I ordered clothes for my 2 grandsons but next time I'll be ordering clothes for me. I've always wanted a pair of Hollister jeans and I found plenty in my size so next month it's my turn.,5
19167,"Great sales, good deals.",5
19168,I have purchased at ThreadUp several times. All items were as described. On time shipping and lots of fun!,5
19169,Love thread up,5
19170,Great app!! Easy to use!!,5
19171,Horrible. Rip off overpriced would not recommend to anyone u be better off spending ur money elsewhere or sending ur clothes in even if u got brand new clothes with tags on them they still rejected smh,1
19172,Love it!!!!,5
19173,U love shopping at thred up!,5
19174,Love thredup sooo much! I always find great deals & almost exactly what I'm looking for !,4
19175,Best way to second hand shop! Love it!,5
19176,Been using this app for three months now and love it! Haven't bought anything that doesn't fit. If you know your size and have used the brand then it's meant to be.,5
19177,Great deals love!,5
19178,Very easy to use and great brands to choose from!,5
19179,This app works well. I have a few specific brands I like for the fit and style. This app allows me to search by size and brand.,4
19180,I loved shopping here the clothes are really cute. I decided to get a clean out bag to sell some of my clothes and donate the rest. The things that they did take they gave me 70. Cents and listed to sell it for 17 dollars. Thats pretty crooky.,2
19181,This whole send in a bag is a joke. I sent in a whole bag of quality pieces and I'm getting 60 cents that I can't even claim because I have to wait for the item to reach its new destination! Contacting support can only be done through the app but you will need to sit there and wait for response I never got 1 push notification of contact. I work full time and have a baby I can't just sit and wait! Then they closed my ticket because I didn't respond. I'm so pissed. Never again. Process used to be easier. 2 stars us only for some good deals but their estimates on some items are way over just so they can ask for more I guess!,2
19182,I think I'm done buying clothing from this company. It looks like people are getting ripped off and frankly that's not right .,1
19183,Keeps crashing,1
19184,I lovet,5
19185,Great prices on expensive brands,5
19186,I do have an issue with narrowing down in the app using filters,4
19187,This is the only way I buy clothes!!,5
19188,"This app is a ripe off, sells your stuff brand new with the tag on it for $2.66",1
19189,Over priced junky looking,1
19190,Great!,5
19191,Still waiting on arrival,5
19192,"First order, can't wait, to see the quality",5
19193,Great options and prices,4
19194,I adore this app it's what all online shopping experiences should be like go ahead and try it you won't be disappointed,5
19195,My only complaint is they don't give measurements on belts only size and no waist measurements on skirts only size. So many brands measure sizes differently,4
19196,"Love shopping recycled, easy to return also",5
19197,"I'm disappointed in this company. Over time they have hiked their prices to where it's often times cheaper to buy it new than at thredup. They also have done away with giving frequent percentages off like they once did and now they are charging if you have to return an item ""to keep the prices low""...there have been many times where I had to return an item because the size was not what they had said it was...what a joke. I think they officially just lost this customer",2
19198,"Horrible , there isn't even a Men's clothing category",1
19199,I purchased clothes for the entire family...My money was well spent.,5
19200,Love shopping 2nd hand clothing without having to dig through the 2nd hand shop racks.,5
19201,Great way to get brands you could not normally afford. I just wish they could hold your basket for 36 hours.,5
19202,It pays nothing. If you just want to get discard clothing it would be just as easy to call local donation sites.,2
19203,"Love this app! Easy to shop, easy to buy, and the shipping is quick. The packaging is beautiful when I receive my items. I love that I can shop secondhand, but have control over the quality of the items I buy. Great app!",5
19204,"Placed my first order with a 20% welcome discount. Great items, some new and there are sells all the time.",5
19205,I open this app every single day!,4
19206,Some things marked as excellent with no flaws are not truly in excellent condition. More often than not this is a 5 star app,5
19207,"Found some great clothes for sooooooo cheap that I wear every day, I love this little online thrift store!",5
19208,"This is by word of mouth good, yea.",5
19209,Best app ever made!!!!,5
19210,Costumed all our girls for In The Heights musical! Is there something similar for boys? Cute boxes and paper too!,5
19211,Great for thrifters with no time to get into the store!,5
19212,"I order from Thredup frequently but just noticed $2 per item restocking fee....NOT a fan of that. Please please make that go away, I'm already paying $9 if I decide to return something, now this PER ITEM is a bit much.",3
19213,Awesome app !!!!,5
19214,My Jean's are great.,5
19215,Great app! Intuitive and easy to navigate.,5
19216,I am addicted!,5
19217,I love it a little too much 😁,5
19218,"Started a new career as an educator, and I needed more teacher-approved outfits. Loved every piece I've purchased!!",5
19219,Awsome,5
19220,I used this app when it. First came out. I loved it,5
19221,Love the variety,5
19222,Have been using thred up since they launched. Haven't had a bad experience yet.,5
19223,Thredup has the best deals and has great customer service!,5
19224,Love the selection and app is easy to use!,5
19225,Love the value and prices! Great selection.,5
19226,"I like the app, products are described well but, I liked it better when I could us Amazon Pay. Not sure why that changed since I downloaded the app.",4
19227,Love this App. Great stuff. Amazing prices!,5
19228,Have only had one shipment not make it and was immediately regunded. The products are spot on.,5
19229,I found a lot of great deals. I love second hand shopping. Thred up has an endless amount of items.,5
19230,I think thredup is great but the app is super crappy. Wont load any orders or show you any previous items. Very disappointing.,3
19231,"I wasn't sure about buying second hand clothing online, but I love it. Everything I have gotten new with tags are brand new at great prices and the items without new tags are gently broke in. I love having someone else break in my jeans for me. The few things I have sent back have been size issues. Love thredup it the new way I shop for name brand clothing that I couldn't afford otherwise.",5
19232,I absolutely love this site! I find everything that fits me at amazing prices!,5
19233,This app will freeze randomly. The store and the orders are amazing. Just a bit frustrating looking for something but after 90 seconds it freezes up and you have force shut the app to start your search from the beginning.,3
19234,Great quality clothing,5
19235,"I love this app, I will order much more.",5
19236,I absolutely love this app. The clothes are high quality at great prices. I can now dress like I have a lot of money without having to pay the price for high quality name brand clothes.,5
19237,Easy to use.,5
19238,Cool,5
19239,Very happy with the site and the customer service.,5
19240,I like it. Prefer the search bottom is more robust.,4
19241,"So this concept is great and the participation is wide enough that you find lots of good deals. The only difficulty is that you can only search by brand name and category, no specific fashion search terms are tagged. But if you have the time to scroll and sift and scroll and scroll, then you'll be happy you did.",4
19242,In love with ThredUP!,5
19243,I am in love with ThredUp! I may never shop new again!,5
19244,"Awesome app, get 15 and 20% off codes like all the time",5
19245,Used to love and use constantly but they added fees and increased limits to get free shipping etc etc... I won't be using anymore sadly.,3
19246,Super slow at loading. Couldn't even use the app.,1
19247,"No section for men's clothing, which is what I need, being that I'm a man.",1
19248,"What can I say but what I tell everyone...""I Luv It!""",5
19249,The items I'm getting are not labeled as short when they clearly are. They now charge a restocking fee for the pants that are clearly mislabeled. The kids clothes are the exact same price at target. My clean out bag took double the longest estimated time and then they stopped letting people have them.,2
19250,"Used to love thredup... but their quality has gone downhill. The way they resale items in the ""reject boxes"" they have rejected (and therefore don't have to pay the sender for) is SUPER shady, and the fact that there is a 2$ restocking fee per returned item is moronic (like 80g of any order does fit the waythem again it should given the size/dim listed) They can keep the last 7$ in thredup credits from my last return... I'll never buy anything from them again!",1
19251,The items are exactly as shown. Fast shipping.,5
19252,No men's just women and kids damn,1
19253,I love ThredUp,5
19254,Love this site!,5
19255,Love it!,5
19256,Come on Google make it so you can rate an app zero. I would tell you whay I thought I've been waiting for a week and a half for an empty box. You know how difficult it is to ship empty boxes. Lot of work and stress. Unbelievable how long this process is taking. If you use this app order your clean out Kits weeks in advance so you won't have clothes all over your living room like I do. Wait for an empty box. Awesome app NOT,1
19257,Great navigation and loading. Easy to use and fast processing.,5
19258,Great resource for gently-used clothing and accessories!,5
19259,"Customer service is horrible. You get no results from them. They offer a bundled packaging to eliminate shipping charges, but you can not bundle the packages when ordering from your phone. Ridiculous. An order is an order. When I called about it I was told they could do nothing about the $4.99 shipping charge. I ask for them to credit my account for a future purchase and was told all orders are final. I believe I would have credited the $4.99 rather than lose a customer. Especially since I have spent $200 in one month. I live second hand, but will not use Thredup again. Also...you aren't able to sell through them ..you can only donate. Sounds fishy ....so they make money on what you donate. I will ship elsewhere...Postmark, Merica, others. Shop elsewhere folks. Don't support this business.",1
19260,"Easy to use,have a large selection of items that you need time to look at everything lol, I just purchased 8 name brand items for like $35!",5
19261,Phenominal deals!,5
19262,"LOVE this site!!! Very honest about condition of clothes, shoes, etc. Have NEVER been disappointed.",5
19263,Easy to find everything I'm looking for.,5
19264,Absolutely love this app! I've revamped my entire wardrobe through them at a fraction of the price! Returns are super easy. Clothes and shoes are always as stated in the descriptions. Shipping is fairly quick. Just love it!,5
19265,Deleted after 4 seconds. There's no men's section.,1
19266,I love thredup! Every item i have purchased has surpassed my expectations! I highly recommend shopping thredup,5
19267,"Good app, but noticed some filters don't work. i.e. when you are searching by brand, and then want to see a specific type of clothing, i.e. pants, when you select that filter it does not update to only show pants.",4
19268,Easy and fun!,5
19269,Big fan of thredUP. The app makes shopping the website so much easier. Love it.,5
19270,Yes,5
19271,"Super easy to use app for shopping, checking your account and ordering a clean put bag! Friendly and responsive customer service. It would be nice, however, if they were fair trade and offered 50% of sales for trade ins like other Bay Area consignment stores. You'll get less for what you sell here, though their prices are often standard and it isn't fair to sellers They are getting loaded at our expense. Come on, kindergarteners! Share. Ms Treesa",5
19272,Great selection with great prices and sales. Love it!,5
19273,"Clear, concise and great prices.",5
19274,Love the great deals!,5
19275,"Awesome deals! But it won't say if something has a hole, it just states ""like new"". Other than that I really all the variety.",4
19276,The app does not let you review your order before making the purchase. I hope they cancel my order!!!!,1
19277,The prices aren't thrift store! I left this before because it advertised $8.00 dresses constantly on Pinterest .There was never one!,1
19278,"Easy to use, clear, easy to follow. Great shopping experience!",5
19279,Love everything I get,5
19280,Lots of good deal to be found,5
19281,"Huge selection of everything you need to look fab! Great pricing, fast shipping and love the promos.",5
19282,"I LOVE THREDUP, BIG BUT now I'm having to pay $1.99 for each item I return. Not even department stores that sell NEW items charge for a restock fee. What WAS an extra clothing item is now me paying more. They should just charge MORE and leave things the way they were.",4
19283,Really good items for a very reasonable price.,5
19284,Edited to change to 2 stars now that there is a $1.99 restocking fee applied to most returned items. I've been a regular customer for years and have always enjoyed the generous return policy. I'll be on the lookout for another shopping app now because of this change. I liked this better before the most recent update. The feature where I could filter for just the categories I wanted to view seems to have disappeared. Would be 5 stars if that comes back.,2
19285,"Love the selection, love the prices, love the ever changing options!",5
19286,Quality used clothing,5
19287,"Love the clothes, dislike the high shipping. I would buy a lot more much more often if the shipping was always free",5
19288,Perfect place to shop 🥀,5
19289,"A great way to shop for second-hand clothes. A great selection, with amazing brands at good prices. No need to buy new!",5
19290,"I love thredup!! Most of my clothes are second hand now. Easy return process, quick shipping, quality clothes. Definitely worth a try! Also, second hand is better for the environment!",5
19291,Great...I love this website!!,4
19292,Convenient and smart,5
19293,I love buying on ThredUp! I feel I get good fashion for less while recycling great finds.,5
19294,Very easy navigation and great quality priducts.,5
19295,Great styles with great prices!,5
19296,There's not much that you have that I would be interested in you have only one purse that like,3
19297,"I used to love ThredUp, but the app sucks. When placing an order, it doesn't bother to show a confirmation screen before the order goes through, so if a promo code didn't work, you're just out of luck. And app orders can't be added to a bundle. Customer service does not care, in the slightest, and made no effort to even sound vaguely sympathetic, let alone actually make it right. Apparently they've finally fixed the crappy search functionality on the app, but for me, it's too late, as I don't intend to ever use this app again.",1
19298,It was great. Easy to use. Loved the introductory discount.,5
19299,Best shopping experience ever!,5
19300,I use this all the time!! Never disappoints,5
19301,Awesome quality,5
19302,Great deals,5
19303,"I like it a lot but sometimes when I'm linked something and try to follow it, I just go to the home page.",4
19304,"The app is great, the order I received not so. I ordered an xlarge track jacket and it didn't fit me, but it fits my 100 lbs daughter, and the tennis shoes you can tell we're just spray painted with stencils used for the stars which were still tacky when they arrived. Never ordering from here again.",4
19305,They give you nothing for your clothes and sell you messed up cheap items while hiding what's wrong with it,1
19306,"I love this app. The extensive and easy filtering of searches is amazing. Can you find the same item cheaper elsewhere? Maybe. Probably not. Unless you search exhaustively. But it won't be much. For buying this company rocks. If you're selling and you are not reasonable or you have high expectations, you should just sell them by yourself because you will not be happy. I love these guys. I've bought from them more than once and will again. Big big fan",5
19307,If you sell with them and the item is l$19.99 or less you only get 10% of that sale ridiculous ill stay with poshmark thank you.,3
19308,It's lit,5
19309,"YOU CAN BUY DIRECT FROM MAKER CHEAPER THAN APP OFFERS!!! TOTAL SCAM!! You can only shop for brands. I tried to search for ""overalls"" and was told they couldn't find what I was looking for. The sizes are odd, I've had to return three separate orders due to size. Wont let me sell. Filters dont work. This app sucks!",1
19310,"Perfectly fine I'm sure for buying, just don't send them your stuff. I sent purses brand new with tags and they gave me next to nothing for them. DO NOT SEND YOUR STUFF, YOU WILL BE SCAMMED.",1
19311,"I love thredup, I really do, but the search function is not at all robust on the website and is even worse on the app. It's very time consuming to go through thousands of clothing articles with many options to narrow your search.",3
19312,Love Thred up! I always come back looking for more and I'm never disappointed,4
19313,I have had good success with buying nice clothes from ThredUp. The quality of clothes is great. Service is reliable. An enjoyable experience and clothes comes smelling fresh and clean. Great condition!,5
19314,This is a brilliant and user friendly app!! I love the cheap brands. And they're constantly sending awesome coupons and deals. And their shipping is quick and efficient. Could work on getting a little more lager size clothes. Other then that this app is amazing!!,5
19315,Love it!,5
19316,Excellent CUSTOMER service experience. Very good application for buy clothes. Good specials. I love shop here.😃😀😀,5
19317,Love finding the brands of clothing I love at such great prices. But you really have to watch...the exact same items are often listed at different prices. I wish the search engine would group all the same items together so I wouldn't have to scroll through the all to find the best deal. Also wish shipping was free and there was no restocking fee on returns.,4
19318,Love it. Easy to use,5
19319,Love this app.,5
19320,Recommend this app to anyone very easy to use and great prices!!!!!,5
19321,"Great app, they could improve their search filters for easier shopping. It is better than a year ago, so keep up the good work.",4
19322,I like it...,5
19323,Not worth the wait for a clean out bag for what you receive in payout for the items you send in. Total waste of time. Highly not recommended,1
19324,Love this app,5
19325,First time to order we'll see! App is very user friendly with great deals on clothes!,5
19326,"Have used this app/site for years. Recently prices have gone way up and the stuff I've bought/received is not as high of quality. There's not a lot of quality options for plus size, or even if you're above a size 10. Used to be free returns for credit but now they charge a $1.99 restocking fee on each item.",3
19327,"It's very useful when you're looking for casual everyday clothing for my kids at an affordable price, but you also care for quality. Fast delivery and items are exactly as described.",4
19328,I have been pleased with my purchases thus far. And I'm sure I'll order more. Purchases have always arrived in a timely manner.,5
19329,Best experience ever. Very few returns.,5
19330,"I have enjoyed buying great, quality items from ThredUp for about two years. Ive never been disappointed with the items I have bought. Shipping is fast. Items are in Great condition. I highly recommend trying them out! You wont be disappointed",5
19331,"Very easy to use, and the search feature frequently seems to work better in the app than on the website.",5
19332,Good stuff,5
19333,Love it,5
19334,Great app. Love it for the ease of use!,5
19335,"I don't think there's anything better than finding an awesome thrift store, aside from this app that is! Able to shop by brand, size, category, etc!",5
19336,Love Thred Up,5
19337,"All the bugs are fixed! Some brands are split between women and juniors, not sure based on what criteria..",5
19338,Great way to shop!,5
19339,Super easy to shop and buy.,5
19340,Quick friendly and great selections,5
19341,The best online secondhand clothing . I don't even call secondhand because everything looks like new.,5
19342,Love them,5
19343,Contacting customer service can be difficult.,4
19344,"This app can become addicting because there are new items everyday and the prices are decent. Still, it can also be frustrating because there are tons of duplicate listings.",4
19345,"Got $114 off my order with free shipping and free returns, got each dress for $24 each on average, great brands, can't wait to try them on!",5
19346,Great site to buy quality things,4
19347,Love it!,5
19348,I get all my work clothes from here. I can look professional without having to pay. I shop on here all the time and always find something. Love it!,5
19349,Only negative is that sometimes screen freezes when loading within the app,4
19350,Very easy to use!,5
19351,Love this concept !,5
19352,Love finding things not available in my area for great prices.,5
19353,"Best place to buy clothes! Huge selection, accurate descriptions, love that I can now afford designer clothes",5
19354,Really easy to use. Easy searches.,5
19355,Love this website!,5
19356,Love organization,5
19357,Amazing site,5
19358,Good deals on some brand name items. Selling experience not-so-great only received 10% of what they sold the item for.,4
19359,So great for working moms!,5
19360,Great place to shop. Clothes are in excellent condition!,5
19361,Great,5
19362,Love the price,5
19363,"I love the products they have. What I don't care for is the fee for restocking. My personal feeling is that it's just being petty. I, mean $1.99 to restock...oh wow. Let's nickel and dime the customer.",4
19364,"You get 5% on selling back. DON'T DO IT, DONATE YOUR CLOTHES TO A GOOD CAUSE!",1
19365,Go shop at THRED UP!!!,5
19366,Its a good way for me to buy clothes that are very good quality and name brand. I live in Alaska and Fred Meyer doesn't cut it. Fast shipping and fun to get something in the mail every day.,5
19367,"I look for one brand in particular. They post it around they same time daily, and it seems someone has written some code to get it into their cart the microsecond the items appear on the site. I no longer have any chance anymore to buy these items here at a decent price. If I want the items, I have to wait a few days to find them posted for 2-4 times the price on one of the other apps. Sad this site is now merely funneling deals to resellers who have the resources to trick the system. This is nothing but frustration for me now, so have given up on this app.",3
19368,awesome!,5
19369,"Easy to browse, simple, quick buys.",5
19370,Addictive!!!,5
19371,"I have used both the company's website and app and I love both, they're easy to use and if I find something on the website I like and put it in my cart, but wait to buy it, it's always in the cart on the app which has different coupons I can use.",5
19372,Love it!,5
19373,"Love thredUP so much. I wish something like this was around when I was a fat kid so I would have been interested in fashion. Now that I'm a fat adult, it's harder to find cute clothes in my size that are also affordable. thredUP hits all three points with an easy to navigate app. The app has a clean UI that's functional and has a nice palette of colors. One minor complaint about the app is that sometimes I have to close it and reopen it because my searches won't aggregate. All in all, a great site with a great app, highly recommended!",5
19374,Great name brands for chesp,5
19375,"Love it! Easy, convenient and great selection",5
19376,"Not worth it anymore. Changed free returns, not paying $2 for each item.",1
19377,It is very easy to use! Love it!,5
19378,The best high end clothing I have ever experienced at low prices.,5
19379,Love !!!!,5
19380,Pleased with everything I have bought.,4
19381,Great site and never disappointed with the clothing.,5
19382,Love it !!,5
19383,I loved the app so far so many items that I liked but not enough money to buy them all! Lol I think you got my email wrong though so when you send me a confirmation number on my order I hope I receive it!,5
19384,I've only used this app for a short time but I just bought a coat and saved $90 off retail. I'm pretty excited for sure!,5
19385,Love everything,5
19386,Must improve items description. Also sometimes the filters are not available. It's really hard to view thousands of items without filtering for just what I want.,3
19387,It's so easy to filter to find what I want for myself or my daughter!,5
19388,Enjoy buying but horrible for selling,5
19389,"Up to date, user friendly, easy purchasing.",5
19390,"Great app, very organized, easy to shop, but some prices seem too high for second hand items (I could get some cheaper on the clearance rack at Penny's with a coupon).",4
19391,Absolutely love this app! So many cute clothes and great deals,5
19392,Love. It,5
19393,One of the better shopping apps. Rarely find a glitch. Good job,5
19394,Great clothes and deals!,5
19395,Love Love Love Thredup!!,5
19396,"It's still easier for me to use the mobile site rather than the app, especially when it comes to viewing my favorites and being able to navigate between the 'pages' of saved items. I stay signed in to both and at least all changes are saved, even if I go back and forth. The upside of the app is that there's a discount code for first time order using it.",3
19397,Easy to use and strong filters for the bewildering volume of merchandise.,5
19398,Great user interface. Easy to use and doesn't break or crash.,5
19399,I've never ordered anything,5
19400,"I will be reporting them to the BBB. Buyer beware! Update 10/15/18: they have changed their return policy yet again, but didnt update the faq section, just the app algorithm. My items that I wanted to return expired. Meanwhile, you still have to wait for 30 days to return for free. Customers were not notified of this change. Previous review (still relevant): I've been a customer for a few years now. Not happy at all about the new restocking fee. This was not communicated to customers at all.. only saw it today when I wanted to return some items. It's already a pain that you have to wait 30 days to place a free return now, or pay for that too (also a sudden policy that wasn't communicated to existing customers). They make a ton of money by paying mere cents for each item acquired and selling for much more. Just another way for them to make a profit of off people. I plan to use up my balance and will likely not purchase from them again. Such a shame. I love the idea of reusing clothing. But there have been too many sudden changes to policies recently that aren't properly communicated to customers. I used to rave about this online store to friends... now, no longer.",1
19401,I have loved every piece I have received from Thredup. Another item is on the way to me now.👍💕😁,5
19402,Love it,4
19403,"I love shopping at second hand stores but it's so hard to dig through all the clothing racks...this app makes it so easy to shop and everything I've purchased so far has been exactly what I expected. The app makes it easy to save your searches, your sizes and your favorites. They also make is easy to shop similar items and the notifications are great. Love this app!",5
19404,Great quality used items for low prices! Perfect for bargain hunters.,5
19405,Love to purchase from app!,5
19406,Love this! My wardrobe is the cutest it's ever been. Amazing prices! So easy!,5

19413,Love the app!,5
19414,"Easy to use, fun to shop",5
19415,"Great selection and the shipping costs are reason enough to use this app over poshmark. So much more affordable. Great interface and the clothes are displayed in a very professional way. Clothes are also much more carefully catagorized than other sites. If I want to see jeans, I select jeans. So when I look at pants, I don't see a bunch of jeans mixed in. This was very helpful. Keep up the good work ya'll.",5
19416,Very quick delivery. The packaging was excellent! The product was a different shade of yellow from their pic but am keeping it anyway!!,5
19417,"I really like using Thread up. I've gotten several pieces that I absolutely love! Some things on here are still a tad pricey, but overall, I like using this app.",4
19418,The app has improved so much no longer freezes and is much faster,5
19419,"I've been using ThredUp for a few years desktop and app, great service & mobile/pad friendly. Maintains current tech standards for ease of browsing & thrifting. Thanks!",4
19420,Quick no fuss returns!,5
19421,This is a good idea but i have found that alot of times i can get the same brand names clothes brand new for the same price or even cheaper directly through the actual store. Its unfortunate. I used to recommend this site all the time but the prices just keep going up.,3
19422,"Absolutely awesome! Great service, shipping time is great, product is as described! I'm addicted.",5
19423,Fantastic!,5
19424,The app is easy to use. Love it!,5
19425,I love this app I'm on it at least once every day!,5
19426,"There are so many great deals to be had if you check in often. I've made over $10,000 selling and continue to find extraordinary pieces everytime I visit this site. Easy check out and returns.",5
19427,"I love the app! easy to use, great items , I love it!",5
19428,Organized perfectly. One thing I would suggest is within Luxe buying if there was a way to show just shoes in luxe or just dresses in luxe. Perhaps I have not figured this out yet but otherwise great App. Great company. Great service.,5
19429,"I love thred up, ive placed and received many orders from them and have been very happy with every item ive received",5
19430,I get great clothes at fantastic prices,5
19431,"I love Vera Bradley purses, they are very well made. I've already ordered a purse and received it within 2 weeks. Now I have ordered the matching wallet. Can't wait to get it.",5
19432,You should have more promo codes but I love that I can keep a favorites list to shop from.,5
19433,Very impressed with my first purchase. The shoes I bought appear brand new as stated. Price was amazing. Shipping was inexpensive and it arrived quickly. I will shop here again.,5
19434,Works well and find a lot of great deals.,4

19436,So gooooood,5
19437,"Quick and easy to order things, and prices are great.",5

19441,Always find great stuff.,5
19442,You send In a bunch of good clothing and they olny accept about two things not worth it.,1
19443,Bought and found some adorable things on this app! Size description is always correct and they give discounts,5
19444,"I love Thredup and the app makes shopping with them so much easier. I just click, choose, and buy, that simple!",5
19445,No comment,5
19446,Fun app. Cant wait to use it again. I hope the clothes is as it appears to be,5
19447,"For what it is, it works well",5
19448,Awesome !,5
19449,Great app! Great business!,5
19450,Prices a little high for resale.,4
19451,I've loved everything I bought,5
19452,My husband's not gonna be happy but I love this site. Such great deals....I can't pass that up! LOVE ME SOME THREAD UP!,5
19453,The filters are not usually applied when doing searches.,4
19454,"The app is easy to use. And I like that I can buy clothes from a range of brands, save money and reduce my carbon footprint.",5
19455,This is a fun way to shop secondhand treasures,5
19456,"This used to be my favorite app to buy 2nd hand clothing but the prices are more than outlet prices, mind as well by brand new",2
19457,I'm so addicted to this app. I love online shopping and this is my top online store! Except now there is a new policy to return items for 1.99 PER ITEM for a restocking fee??? I spend way too much money on these clothes to be charged a stupid fee. NOT HAPPY.,4
19458,Got great clothes. Fast and nicely maintained,5
19459,Pretty easy to use. I do find when I hit the back button it will close out completely when I only want to go back once.,4
19460,"App is excellent, just wish more brands came up to scroll through when you filter by brand",5
19461,Amazing app - very professionally designed. Makes shopping extremely convenient.,5
19462,Was easy to use and a fast check out,4
19463,"The app doesn't seem to handle filtering very well. I'll bring up a category, add a filter, and still get the same number of items that was originally brought up. Samsung Galaxy S8",3
19464,Great app!,5
19465,So many fabulous things to choose!,5
19466,I've found wonderful tops for my daughter Bella on this app! Cat and Jack brand and the Justice brand! Awesome site!,5
19467,"I use this app for specific items, like jeans for my 8 year old boy.",4
19468,They've gotten pricey. Used to be thrift store prices on used clothes. Now they seem to buy overstock. They have 10 or 12 of the same shirt NWT and charge more than a store. Shoes are pricey too. Especially off season! Kohl's & Macy's have better off season prices.,3
19469,Great place to shop for gently used top brands.,5
19470,"Once you get the hang of it, it's nice to see your items being sold. thredUP is an excellent idea.",5
19471,Always satisfied,5
19472,Love shopping here! Great selection & fast shipping!,5
19473,Awesome site,5
19474,"Excellent! Not quite as easy to filter searches as the main website, but very good for specific searches and browsing. Great integration with main website",5
19475,Wonderful online shopping,5
19476,I THINK THIS WEBSITE IS THE BEST. THANK YOU!,5
19477,So easy to shop,5
19478,I LOVE this app! It lets me shop till I drop and still have money leftover 🤓,5
19479,Wonderful when it comes to size every thing fits. Ty,5
19480,It's way too difficult to search and filter. Most of the time the filter doesn't work because items aren't categorized. There are too many items with no way to actually find what you're looking for. It's a needle in a haystack every time and I give up before I can find anything worthwhile.,2
19481,Love this! My first order came quickly and I LOVE them! I also love that I was able to sell some items that were just taking up space in my closet.,5
19482,Everyone should use this!,5
19483,Awesome deals on new and barely worn Designer brands!,5
19484,"I absolutely love this app, I can shop online instead of going out to shop and I've never had any problems with the clothes I purchase. I love thred up",5
19485,I have ordered multiple things in the last 30 days and loved everything in it have not had anything that I did not like or did not fit well so far I'm 110% happy I have told all of my friends,5
19486,"While the app itself works well, the customer service at thredUP has been deteriorating over the last few years. Payouts have decreased, prices have increased, and fees have been added to returned items. I recently recieved a final sale purchase that was a different size than the one listed on the item description. Multiple messages to customer service were unanswered. This could have been a quick fix, as I am a long time customer and have had a generally favorable opinion of the company, but the lack of response coupled with the new fee schedule and price increase has me ready to delete my account.",1
19487,Great stuff....love I can sell my old clothes and use credit towards some other clothes.,5
19488,Love 'em!,5
19489,I am a big fan of Thredup but the app does not let you sort by prices or pay with an Amazon account. I prefer the website instead.,2
19490,"Juuusttt downloaded it, and maybe I sound too picky or stuck up idk but, I just downloaded this not even 30 minutes ago and I already don't like this app.... I HIGHLY wish there was people wearing the clothes... It just seems weird looking at a clothing app and not even knowing how they really would look wearing them, ya know. I am hoping and wishing they begin to use models..",3
19491,I have bought & sold items with thredUp. I love it! I'm a teacher on a budget & can get quality clothes @ a great price. Highly recommend!!,5
19492,"Great for inexpensive, quality clothing",5
19493,Lots of options,5
19494,"I love Thedup! I find deals I could never find anywhere else. Friend: ""Say what? Those are $500 jeans, but how?"" Me: "" $30 dolla holla on Thredup."" 😉",5
19495,Love this app,5
19496,I love Thred Up!!,5
19497,Great app!,5
19498,Easy to use and convenient.,5
19499,Love you thredup!,4
19500,My friend introduced me to ThredUp and now I'm addicted. I've put in 2 orders with great deals just within the first 2 days. This could be dangerous.,5
19501,Glad I found thredup. Get all my footwear for all seasons at great prices,5
19502,Love!! Great prices on great clothes!,5
19503,Awesome deals.love this site!!,5
19504,The app is easy to use. It's fun to shop online this way.,5
19505,Smart way to shop,5
19506,Search feature isn't working properly,3
19507,Difficult to narrow down searches and categories. Impossible to search for petite ONLY sizes. Great deals though and prompt shipping.,3
19508,I'm addicted to how convenient it is to shop for good cheap clothes online. Love it!,5
19509,Love ThredUp!!!,5
19510,Awesome way to thrift shop!!.,5
19511,I absolutely love this app!,5
19512,Love Thred Up and the app!,5
19513,I love thred up,5
19514,I'd love it if there were a way to set up notifications for searched items!,4
19515,"Love it... just wish I could go back to where I left off when looking instead of starting over. Example medium shirts, there are 1000's... can't look at all of them in one sitting. Lol",5
19516,I love all of your merchandise too much. I need to when the lottery.,5
19517,Love it!,5
19518,"Great way to declutter my wordrab and get new clothes for my girl and I. Love it, great app",5
19519,Love it!,4
19520,I love thredUP!,5
19521,Love you!,5
19522,"LOVE this app, great experience!",5
19523,Glitch in style filter shows you things you are not looking for. I.E. tops when you are looking for pants,4
19524,The searches are unreliable and prices for used clothes too high compared to what they pay for them. LOCAL consignment shops are far superior,1
19525,Love it!,5
19526,Love this app. Have told everyone about it!!!!,5
19527,I love thisThredup app I can shop anytime and anywhere.,5
19528,Very cool,5
19529,Love buying my clothes used. This sight has a lot to offer and searching for items is fun and easy!,5
19530,more coupons,5
19531,They raised the price once my bank information was entered?!? And now I can't cancel my order? This is so sketchy. I'm contacting my bank!,1
19532,"Other than waiting for shipping which is always 5 to 7 business days more than projected, I love this app!",4
19533,This is one of the best online thrift apps EVER!! I love that it is simple and every item I've purchased has been perfect. I will continue shopping here and spreading the word to my friends and family ❤,5
19534,"Not satisfied with the selling service,",3
19535,Well as a customer your should put all dress sizes the same. The shoes the same size together as usual.,5
19536,This app has a great selection of clothing at a wide range of pricing,5
19537,"Beware, this app can be dangerous. I am on it daily because I love finding great deals and great pieces.",5
19538,I don't know I am new,5
19539,Love it!,5
19540,👍,5
19541,App is currently not working at all,1
19542,Simple and easy to use. I really enjoy shopping on it.,5
19543,Thred Up is super easy to shop with all the lAtest styles and accessories. It's a mist try. You will not be disappointed,5

19545,Love it!,5
19546,This is great!,5

19551,Love the app!,5
19552,Great prices and super quality merchandise. Shipping and packaging is also impressive. Great job and I am hooked on this website 😁,5
19553,"The sort by price option is still a button but doesn't work. If it's not gonna work, take away the button.",2
19554,"Overall good functionality. The tagging could use some work, though, and resetting the filters sometimes causes the app to freeze.",4
19555,I love the app in my opinion I love online and thrift store shopping so this is the app for me,5
19556,Love this site!,5
19557,Perfect place to buy second-hand. Great quality clothing. Love it!,5
19558,"Thrifting from home = good for your soul, the planet and your wallet",5

19563,I wish there was a better purse selection.,5
19564,This app is absolutely amazing! The prices are amazing!,5
19565,I am very pleased with my shopping & selling experiences on this site.,5
19566,So nice purchasing higher ended clothes at such a discounted price,5
19567,awesome!,5
19568,"The fact that I feel catered to every time I log into this app is amazing,I love it! 😍😍😍",5
19569,Very affordable...very nice pieces!,4
19570,Love the prices!,5
19571,Loved it until more than half my order ended up being shipped without a shipping label. 👍 Toying with my feelings ThredUp 😭,4
19572,Despite the large # of items I can find what I am looking for,5
19573,Love this app! Way easier then the website. Love the fact that its recycling online. Much rather shop here then in a store.,5
19574,Love this app to shop kids clothes,5
19575,Love this app! Shopping online is affordable and easy,5
19576,Great things at great prices,5
19577,"I love that the clothes come the way it's described, I have very little returns.",5
19578,"Super store. Saves time, trouble, and money, and is good for the environment.",5
19579,Nice outfits,5
19580,Love it,5
19581,Clean out bag system is not in favor of the clients. You basically get pennies for your clothes and pay too much for theirs. Prices are high for Wal-Mart quality clothes packages take longer to arrive then they claim.,2
19582,Je suis satisfaite mais de temps en temps il faut que je le réinstalle,5
19583,Have placed two orders.. first order is in 4 separate shipments. All packages were shipped out within 24 hours of ordering!,5
19584,"It's good. I have found several tops I would not have been able to find elsewhere and that's fun. I have purchased an entire season's wardrobe for my 7 year old grandson, and that's good.",4
19585,"No mens section, what guys full price you twits.",1
19586,"I really love this store and this app! Some of the pictures could be better, but other than that great job as a seller and a buyer!",4
19587,"Love the company, the app and the entire concept!! Well done thredup #downsince2014",5
19588,It sometimes won't search and you have to close the app and restart it. It's a pain. But I love the sight.,3
19589,Best online consignment shop ever!,5
19590,"Great prices for secondhand women's clothes. Living in a small town, this gives me access to a much wider selection than local thrifting. Gave 4 stars because I would like to see more children's clothes, and also be able to send in my children's clothes. But I'm glad to see the service is so popular already!",4
19591,Love the app! It's honestly perfect. I also love the their store in Walnut Creek!!,5
19592,"Used to be a great site/app to buy secondhand clothing. Prices have gone up, quality has gone way down. Will not be using this app or shopping ThredUp anymore.",1
19593,Easy to use and navigate!,5
19594,Awesome finds.,5
19595,I think this company needs better customer service contact,5
19596,"Easy shopping right from home. Tells you sizing, measurements, and condition of the item so there are no surprises. So many brands and styles to choose from.",5
19597,I think it is fun with expectation and a little terror. I have enjoyed my purchases and look forward to more goodies! 😊,5
19598,"This is a great app for a buyer. Since I've only sent in items, I haven't had the buyers experience. One thing that should be considered for sellers, is that you should communicate with the seller what you ended up doing with the clothes as a courtesy. Because since I selected the option that if they do not accept my garments, they do not have to send them back. And that's fine, but tell me what you did with them and maybe a reason. It just makes you feel you sent good clothes away to never never land. An email would be nice as an update explaining why you didnt accept the garments. Especially when some of the items sent were never used with tags on them. As far as I know you did end up selling them on the low. Just my feeling.",5
19599,"So much fun! Shop second hand, many items new with tags, from the comfort of your home. Plus buying second hand is good for the planet. Five stars!",5
19600,"I tried ThredUp cautiously but love it! Great quality items, return process is easy.",5
19601,Love ThredUp. Highly recommend.,5
19602,So far so good!,3
19603,There's no way to turn off push notifications? Are you kidding me?,2
19604,Love the deals!!!,5
19605,Good finds for good prices,4
19606,"Love, love, love thredup. Designer clothes at thrift store prices. Don't expect garage sale prices. These clothes are carefully selected for resale.",5
19607,"Quick, easy. Great app.",5
19608,I'm a a huge thrifter and second hand first. I love the app it's so easy to filter things out by size condition and price. The items are hand picked in good condition and any flaws are mentioned. The wide selection is amazing . Great if your busy and can't thrift in store. Prices are great and it's my new favorite place to online shop.,5
19609,"Prices used to be really great, they have raised prices and now value on a lot of items is just not there. You can find cheaper on sale in a store.",3
19610,love it,5
19611,Only problem with app is that the search similar function does not search within your selected sizes.,5
19612,Filters don't work,3
19613,Very pleased with my purchases and having the app makes it so easy!,5
19614,"I'm amazed at the quality, I love it. I need more ! I bought a purse and I'm mind-blown at the condition it arrived in. ---> it was quick too",5
19615,Guilt-less shopping done easy,5
19616,Love it,5
19617,"Easy to use, makes shopping, and even returning the item I didn't like, easier.",5
19618,I ❤❤❤❤ thred up!!!,5
19619,I love Thredup,5
19620,I really love thredup! This app makes it easy to find quality items at great prices. Their sales are an added bonus!,5
19621,So far so good 😁,5
19622,First time buyer. Very happy with all 4 items that I ordered. Exactly what was advertised and true to size. Shipping was fast.,5
19623,Got my clothes fast and was in excellent condition.. highly recommended,5
19624,"Great deals can be found and I love this app. Sometimes their pricing on used items is a little unreasonable, but I'm still finding awesome deals. Recommend!",5
19625,Clothes are awesome. App is terrible.,1
19626,"Great app, wish the filter option worked better and saved sizing preferences. Beautiful packaging, easy returns, quick shipping",4
19627,Just placed my first order on thred-up and I will be back!! 🙂,5
19628,I am disappointed. I was so happy to help and place and order. Found a shirt and 2 pairs of pants. I ordered a 2X pants and received a pair of pants labeled 2X but fit more like almost a 4X and they are petite. To return the I have to pay a restocking fee and to get a full refund to my bank card which is how I paid I had to pay 8.99 for a shipping label. The item only cost 6.99 and I already had to pay 1.99 fee for restocking. That's not good business.,1
19629,Disappointed! There is no cash out button on the app!! I've been screwed out of money too many times!!,1
19630,Great app. And store.,5
19631,"Detailed sizing preferences, fantastic deals and top-notch clothes and accessories. I don't even shop on Amazon any more.",5
19632,Awesome! Fast shipping. Nice packaging. Items were all exactly as described.,5
19633,Tons of nice stuff. Very reasonable prices. It is a great way to shop.,5
19634,love it,5
19635,"Easy to use. Almost too easy- but hey, who doesn't love a bargain",5
19636,Little hard to navigate at times but other wise I really like it!,4
19637,Quick. Easy. Fun!,5
19638,Fantastic way to shop on your own time. A walking personal shopper experience.,5
19639,love the collection of clothes they acquire,5
19640,"Overall, I like the thredUP app. It's designed in a way that's easy to use, and the pictures of each item are good quality. I would love if they had even more filters, such as sleeve length. Also, when the app makes suggestions of items I may like, I would love for the suggestions to be in my size. I'd also like to see a ""you may also like"" area based on the items in my favorites.",4
19641,I really love my Coach step-ins ...I just received today. They are beautiful. Five stars Thred Up*****,5
19642,"Fantastic! Thrift shopping while laying in bed. Can it get any better? Amazing ux/ui design on the mobile site. It's a joy to shop this site. My first order of 5 items came in under $20 including shipping. My second order included a real leather jacket and jeans, under $25 including shipping. I'm officially hooked.",5
19643,So easy it could be dangerous 😁 great bargains on superb brands,5
19644,love love love,5
19645,I've been satisfied with my orders,4
19646,Easy to filter to get down to the business of shopping quickly and efficiently. Can't beat the prices!,5
19647,The app can be a little flaky when going back and forth between the app and web.,4
19648,ThredUp changed the way I shop! ❤,5
19649,"Great prices, helpful customer service!",4
19650,Awesome prices with great selection. Can buy items with tags for big savings in including shoes and handbags. My new favorite site!,5
19651,Really like ThredUP. App is easy to use. Been very satisfied with everything I have received and have not returned anything yet. Really like the Goody Boxes.,5
19652,I love the detailed descriptions of each piece.,5
19653,Rill good. Never leave the house. Wear your pretty clothes in bed.,5
19654,Easy to use and navigate,5
19655,Love this app! I can rock my style without rocking my budget!,5
19656,Great products & prices!,5
19657,"Thred up used to be great and great prices. They charge you more then in store prices for a lot of things now for used clothing! I used to order from here all the time but not anymore. I sent in 10 HUGE bags packed full of clothes that were worth well over $5,000 and got under $200 for them. Prices are way too high now and they dont give you as much as they used to and also took away the 40% your first order. Ridiculous. And now today the app keeps crashing again!!! I am just trying to use up my credit and be done with it but cant even get into it to use the app...",1
19658,Like thrift store or garage sale shopping---but more gas and time efficient!,5
19659,Easy to use. Cute clothing.,4
19660,Thrift store shopping from home. Fabulous clothes and can even sell some of yours to them!! Just wish they were around sooner!,5
19661,Only shows me my size (it can be changed) but I love it. I can't fall in love with a dress that's not in my size.,5
19662,"Great app, just as functional, easy to search and check out as the website on my computer",5
19663,I really like this app,5
19664,"Its the only way I shop for clothes anymore. Brillant service, quick shipping, amazing prices on great items. What more could you want?",5
19665,Great deals on good quality clothes. Everything is very good condition. And returns are not a problem. I just wish I had more time to browse the website. So many choices!,5
19666,It's a great app!,5
19667,"It started out to be a great place to find clothes and to send clothes, but the return you get for real quality items is very minimal and they have put the prices so high that you might as well get it brand new at the store instead of someone's second hand. I understand they need to run the place and it takes a lot to go through everyone's bags but making prices $10 and Below would be a lot better for moving their merchandise. Some of the prices are crazy. Great idea but the price increase has definitely put me off and I would only send clothes there if there was no other way to sell them because you're not going to get much back but basically a few pennies to a dollar per piece",3
19668,I love this app!,5
19669,I liked the previous app here it allowed you to switch the sizing to a special size. I'm very petite so I can't shop in regular sizes. It's impossible for me to shop. I have to scroll through hundreds of clothes just to look for petite sizing. Very dissapointed because I love ThredUp.,2
19670,Easy to use!,5
19671,Super easy to navigate and use!,5
19672,"A little glitchy, but love the merch",4
19673,Order came earlier than expected. Made my whole week! Great bag by Kate Spade. Looks brand new!,5
19674,I didn't receive an item that i purchased in there no contact number to contact them! I haven't got no response from there live chat!,1
19675,My favorite shopping experience EVER!!!!,5
19676,Clothes shopping doesn't get easier than this. Fun. Cheap. Easy.,5
19677,Easy to use and fun way to shop for clothes.,5
19678,Love this app! So easy to use!,5
19679,"I've been shocked with the quality of my purchases. (I choose 'new' or ""like new' pieces always... I recommend.",5
19680,"Liars. It was all good until they payed me less than the payout announced on the listing of my item: 45% Instead of 60%. Customer service was useless. All they said was: ""You got payed this amount"". Duuh, I know how much I got payed! The question was why that amount and not the one listed?? And where's the rest of my money?? On top of this, you can't even call them! It's all texting.",2
19681,I used to love ThredUp but have noticed a big jump in their prices. I can get similar items brand new on sale for the same price ThredUp is charging. I used to shop here frequently but have decided to take my business elsewhere.,2
19682,"Love this app. Like the free shipping, Clothing is fresh and comes as advertised",5
19683,"I find the cutest outfits that are totally original! The prices are a bit high, but if you shop the final sale items you score some amazing deals on practically brand new clothes",5
19684,This app makes shopping very easy.,4
19685,"Great deals, nice search function and always cute clothes! Glad I can recycle instead of buying fast fashion.",5
19686,Such a fun way to shop!,5
19687,Descriptions are spot on and shipping is prompt. I'm hooked...,5
19688,Awesome money saver!,5
19689,This app is easy to navigate. Not only are there beautiful things to look at 😍 but it's a fantastic company to support.,5
19690,"The app is easy to use, but the clothes are pricey for second-hand.",4
19691,Love ThredUp. Purchased thousands for dollars worth of clothes A FRACTION of that!! I love that I can get make brands amer amazing quality clothes for an awesome price. Will be my go to store first before looking at retail!!,5
19692,I love the Thredup website and I used to really enjoy this app until recently when it stops updating the merchandise according to my filters. I have tried everything including deleting reinstalling the app with no luck. I will be a life long Thredup user but the website is more user friendly in my opinion.,2
19693,"Just bought two outfits for under $20!! Second order first one was great, hoping this one will be too!!",5
19694,Costumer service is very helpful,5
19695,I got my first order in the mail today. Beautifully packaged and everything was awesome!!,5
19696,"Been waiting to get a clean out bag, but they are never available!",2
19697,Fun alternative choice for shopping. There are features I wish it had but maybe it will happen down the line. Get app and service.,5
19698,"Great deals, convenient shopping and app is easy to use!",5
19699,Impressed. I found what I was looking for rather easily and the pieces I purchased are quality items; each--so far--runs true to size. This company allows me and my girls to cut down on waste and re-use resources in a meaningful and realistic manner.,5
19700,Love this site,5
19701,Groovy app and the prices are reasonable. Peace and Love,5
19702,Always tell people how much I love this place. Great brands for great prices!,5
19703,You can find a lot but honestly the prices are crazy. There's really never a sale. I use to love it but there's a lot of stores that are way less expensive.,3
19704,Best deal for name brand app,5
19705,Love that I can look up similar styles to things I like,5
19706,"Love shopping Thredup and love having the app, but there seem to be a few glitches with their item filtering.",4
19707,"Really like this app and company. So far I enjoy the ease and quality I have experienced. I reccommend this app and company to everyone. Prices are decent and there are some great deals. Just like at a thrift store, the fun is in the hunt.",5
19708,Addicting. Love it tho,5
19709,Great clothes at great prices!!♥️,5
19710,"This app/company is good in concept but not in reality. They are now charging fees for everything, paying you less and less for your sell back, are not accurate in their listing, and have the worst customer service. Never using again",1
19711,Downloaded the app for a discount. Didn't like the buying experience: multiple items were not as listed including being several sizes off and such. Was charged restocking anyways and then learned that Thredup app doesn't have a real customer service form. Uninstall!,1
19712,Excellent app. Oh the years spent searching the racks! Never again. One button shopping is the best!,5
19713,Great deals!,5
19714,"Wish there were more ways to sort, but overall great app",4
19715,Love thred up!,5
19716,Not the cheapest but the prices are definitely worth your time.,5
19717,Love this website/app,5
19718,Love this app,5
19719,"Very easy to use, lots of choices, good notifications when an item is available",5
19720,Completely non-functional. Does not load any search results even when it's from me clicking a push notification,1
19721,"Love the quality of the items, the beautiful packaging, and ease of return!",5
19722,"Found my fave jeans at a fraction of the cost - they arrived quickly, in perfect condition and fit to a T! Fabulous first experience!",5
19723,This is the only place l shop. The deals are phenomenal.,5
19724,App for the avid thrift shopper,5
19725,"The site itself is great, and the app works well. My only complain is that sometimes promo codes come through as push notifications that aren't shown anywhere else, so you have to be careful dismissing them or turning them off.",5
19726,"Great site, great customer service!",5
19727,The app is fine. The customer service is terrible. And the strike through prices are just fraudulent.,1
19728,Everything handled with care. Excellent value.,5
19729,So far I got two blouse and I am pleased with them.,5
19730,Love this app - you can get great deals on designer brands!,5
19731,Love browsing through daily deals... Affordable!,5
19732,thredUP is excellent and I am very satisfied with the conditions of my items I Will recommend thredUP to all my family and friends I don't have to go to thrift shop anymore thanks thredUP,4
19733,"Huge fan! Smooth, efficient, and just awesome!!!",5
19734,"Just needs a men's department, but awesome!!",5
19735,"To sum it up, I'm happy with this app.",4
19736,Some items have questionable sizes like an extra large top with a 32in bust...?,5
19737,I like it easy to use but don't enroll me in the thread up every day even though I already bought more than 150.00 last month so thank you very much I gonna look for free shipping somewhere else. The enrollment should be automatically I believe.,2
19738,Great app. Very user friendly.,5
19739,Amazing,5
19740,I have been with ThredUP for as long as it has been here. I love everything about ThredUP. I would recommend ThredUP to all my family and friends.,5
19741,Great quality items and AMAZING prices.,5
19742,"Overall, I give this app high marks because I feel good buying second-hand and saving money & the environment. the products I have received are good quality and have arrived as described. As far as improvements, I would like to see better descriptions and more sizing information. It is also a little odd to not receive a confirmation email when an order is placed.",4
19743,Great deals!,5
19744,The app has a better selection of items than the website,5
19745,"This company is wonderful, and the app is easy to use.",5
19746,Super easy. Love it!,5
19747,Love this site. Shop it all the time!,5
19748,Very easy to use!,5
19749,"Great idea, love the deals",5
19750,I love this company. The app is exceptional in complimenting their mission.,5
19751,"What I love are the designer clothing at a great price, and I can find clothing that doesn't look like everything else on the rack. Where I'd love to see improvement : better filters, for example if I'm looking for a peasant blouse I'd like to be able to either do as a search or as a choice., another is when I click on an image an example needing a top but I need a style that defines my waist, to have some sort of icon that shows what items fit that body type. I would also like to see quicker turnaround time on shipping, and bag quotes, and no wait time for receiving a bag. And much better quality of photos. Of course would love to be paid more for the clothing items I send that you keep but honestly I think it's pretty fair and I like the fact you pay some up front and as other items are sold you credit the account. Lastly, and this is just an idea put together outfits, I'm going to guess most women have items they have purchased, a top they like that doesn't work with anything in their closet etc. If I could go to your website click on more personalized outfits, with items categorized best for hourglass shape, stick thin, etc. What would be even better but probably too expensive to set up is to have an avatar that all I would have to do is plug in my measurements it would change the avatars size to match those measurements then be able to virtually try on any clothing items on your website. If I found a place to make my shopping more personalized to my body type without the personal designer price I'd be a customer for life and I'd tell everyone 😁",3
19752,Love having such a huge inventory at my fingertips,5
19753,"Such a great way to buy and sell new and used clothing!! I have sold items and purchased from thred up and i love it! Plus the referrals are worth it, they credit you 20 bucks!!",5
19754,Its 👍! Easy to use and I've found items I was looking for in the stores!,5
19755,Great app!,5
19756,Great deals on gently worn clothes!,5
19757,I always find great items at great prices!,5
19758,Easy to navigate website. Good fashion selection.,5
19759,thredUp is fun and environmentally sensible. The app works smoothly.,5
19760,"Great experience so far! Great selection of clothes, good quality.",5
19761,This app is the best thing that's ever happened to my closet!,5
19762,"I love shopping on ThredUp! I've gotten more compliments on my clothes lately, and I'm spending the same for name brand as I would shopping at department stores for off-brand clothes. The app is easy to use, too. And I like that I can get notifications by app when an item I want is available.",5
19763,"lots of variety, many still with new tags. everything at a terrific price",5
19764,Wish they saved my brands!!!!,4
19765,"I like Thredup and buy most of my clothes here, but there are some issues with the app and service. The app used to allow you to filter by a saved search of your favorite brands, but they removed that feature a while back. You can still save a brand search on the website, but I do most of my shopping from my cell phone, so it's not convenient to have to input 30 or so favorite brands every time. The filters on the app don't always work. For example, I just did a simple search for Tops, then clicked the filter for Sweatshirts, and it still showed all of the tops with no filtering. This happens fairly often with various filters on the app although the website filters seem to work fine. Sometimes if you filter for a specific inseam length on pants, it will give you no results, but when you click on individual items descriptions, there are pants that should have shown up in the search. I love the new policy of being able to return items from multiple orders together but hate the new policy which requires waiting 30 days between free returns. I'm definitely spending less and at a slower pace because of it. As others have mentioned, there was no formal announcement if this new policy to their regular shoppers, so it caught many of us off guard the first time we tried to make a free return after it went into effect. Customer Service response time can be slow although it seems that they've tried to make some improvements. Lately some of the prices seem to be higher than in the past. I haven't tried selling items, so I can't comment on that process. I would prefer to get any unsold items back so I could take them somewhere local to sell or donate to someone or an organization of my own choosing.",3
19766,Sold and bought many times!,5
19767,Love this app! Great clothes at amazing prices!! I received my first 9-5 Goody Box and could have kept everything in it. I'm not sure I will ever shop in a store again.,5
19768,"I really like the app to save searches and find items across different brands. The return policy doesn't quite work for me, but I bet it would work better for someone in the contiguous US. The items are really good quality despite being ""previously loved"" and the prices are great.",4
19769,A great way to boost your wardrobe without busting your budget.,5
19770,Great deals on name brand clothes!,5
19771,"Good app wish it had all the features of the web site, like bulk shipping, reject rescue orders and goody boxes but I still love to shop using the app",4
19772,"Best ever...better interface and user friendly than trendsy, and poshmarket",5
19773,Would not recommend.,1
19774,Love that I'm able to get designer items at a fraction of the price. App works really well and enhances the experience immensely.,5
19775,Great selection and prices. Always new stuff. Coupons available and trade in used clothes for new clothes!,5
19776,Great items with great prices. I love that I can trust the descriptions. No bad surprise when you receive your items.,5
19777,"Great prices and selection, easy to use, love it!",5
19778,The return policy kind of sucks but other than that if you're sure of what brands fit you really great you can find some awesome stuff on here I've had box after box and a smile on my face every time,5
19779,I love that I am reducing waste and getting beautiful clothes.,5
19780,Easy to use. Great graphics,5
19781,"Left stitch fix for thredup, never went back.",5
19782,I enjoy this app so much. I can always find a good deal and the measurements on each item make it easy to be sure it is going to fit! I've had no problems with returns or exchanges either!,4
19783,Amazing app and amazing quality clothes for a great price. Highly recommend.,5
19784,I love giving my clothes to thred up and getting a stipend back to spend on new to me clothes. So much more fun then a consignment shop.,5
19785,"Its excellent in every way, no complaints except needs more plus sizes for my heavier friends",5
19786,Amazing deals! I bought so many great dresses for work and I get compliments on them all the time! You have to try it!!!,5
19787,Love it! Shopping for my entire family.,5
19788,"I love that ThredUp lets me shop secondhand from the comfort of my couch. They have an excellent selection, items are in fantastic shape, and I feel good about turning someone else's cast-offs into my new favorites!",5
19789,Great selection and prices. I have found many great items from ThredUP. Fast delivery. App is easy to use.,5
19790,Hated the selections...,1
19791,Great app to take thrift shopping on the go,5
19792,Great clothes at great prices!,5
19793,"***Restocking fee sucks. Was not told about before I ordered.*** I've loved Thredup for the past couple of years. Allows me to try on clothes at home and return the ones I didn't love. But with my most recent order I've gotten burned but the new restocking fee. Totally did not expect that, and I should have been warned before purchasing. I understand why they implemented it, but not happy that I wasn't aware when I ordered. This will definitely make me use the app less. Pretty much destroys the reason I loved it.",3
19794,"Update: I'm disappointed with my orders from here. I ordered a clutch from them and it's literally a pencil case. It's so small and barely fits my phone. My daughter's clothes arrived and the bottom of one pair was raggedy and filthy. Of course, nothing is refundable. So disappointed.",3
19795,You're gonna love Thredup.,5
19796,I get great savings and good quality of items shopping on thredup. Plus the delivery of items is always on point,5
19797,It is fun to look through clothes at any time. I love that you can send in your old clothes for credit!!!,5
19798,"Great app and store. The only thing is it confuses girls size 12 with toddlers 12 months sometimes and its hard to tell what size it really is in the pictures. For example, caprees vs. toddlers pants.",4
19799,Still learning,4
19800,"Thredup use to be awesome, but now they barely pay anything for items & is next to impossible to get them to send you a bag. Went from getting $40-$60 a bag to a little over $10.",1
19801,Not sure why it takes so long to get a bag for resale items . I live in washington. company is in california. I requested a bag on 8/22. Its almost sept 1st. Thats why i rated 1 less star,4
19802,Love it! I hate the store Lines and the chaos but love to shop. This lets me get what i want when i want it!,5
19803,I LOVE AND RECOMEND THIS APP EVEN WHEN LIVING IN HAWAII!,5
19804,Overall a good experience.,4
19805,Best way to find what I'm looking for with thrifty prices. Thanks ThredUp!!,5
19806,I'm using it mainly to build my professional wardrobe and it's been great so far!,5
19807,LOVE thredUp! The site is amazing and the app is just as great. Very user-friendly and easy to navigate from the beginning.,5
19808,"If you know your size and measure correctly. The clothes will fit well. Thredup has a great selection, good quality, great condition and even better prices",5
19809,Not worth trying to sell if your closet is anything average. Sent in over 40+ pieces only to have 9 accepted for $25. I would have gotten $100+ if I would have tried fb garage sale boards as many items were maternity. I just couldn't believe it i nearly cried. I can't bring myself to shop with them again and will be deleting the app off my phone after I spend my last balance.,2
19810,Best place to shop!!!!very trendy !!!Thank you THRED UP!!!,5
19811,Fun and easy to shop!,5
19812,I love this store,5
19813,"Not exactly thrift store prices but it's nice that you know something about the garment before you buy it and that they have a return policy. It would be neat if the app allowed you to make multiple wish lists or to prioritize your WL and it'd be cool if there were style tags like ""retro"" or ""boho"". As staff have to enter items into the catalog that might just be too messy logistically speaking",4
19814,"So convenient, runs smoothly, great app",5
19815,Love this site.,5
19816,Amazing,5
19817,I spend too much money on this app with all I buy.,5
19818,Wonderful! Everything came quickly and as expected. Very pleased.,5
19819,"The app is easy to use, just bought my first set of clothes. It was so easy to do. And they recommend other items to go with what you bought if you need help with that.",5
19820,"Sent in $400÷ in clothing, got paid $7.46 for it. Company is a rip-off.",1
19821,Love it!,5
19822,"Great store, great concept, but app is glitchy",3
19823,"Great, have order several times and will be ordering again.",5
19824,One of my favorite online stores AND one of my favorite places for consignment. Also from experience customer service is great 💯,5
19825,"I love thrifting. Being able to take my time to view & ordering online, makes it so easier.",5
19826,"I got this app months ago and nothing ever caught my eye until i figured out how to do a search for specific brands. Once i had brands that would help me better guess my fit, i was able to find loads more items that i loved aaaand i don't have to leave my house. Win win.",4
19827,Great company! I'm addicted!!,5
19828,I'm in Love with Thredup,5
19829,I love the clothes and the prices. I also like the fact that I get free shipping.,5
19830,Love ThredUp - maybe too much!,5
19831,"Love the app, clothes and service! I sometimes question the statements shown in the listings. Like shoes that are very tall being listed as kitten heels. They say if the listing is wrong they will return, no issues. I just wish it was done better so that the AMAZING filters they have would work more effectively!",4
19832,"Love the clothes, love the service",5
19833,Love it!,5
19834,"Where has this site been all my life?! I LOVE that there's an option to return. That's the only reason I usually don't buy online bc the return process with other sites is a pain, plus u have to pay to ship back, not with Thred Up...Brilliant! I can't wait until I receive my 1st shipment!!",5
19835,"Prices are sometimes not much different than buying new on sale at a store, but mostly it's good deals. They have sales and promo codes and when you put things in the cart they are held for 24 hrs, and you can keep a favorites list and save your sizes. The app is well designed and easy to use.",5
19836,"Highly disappointed. Attempted to look at formal wear, and even after using filters mostly casual showed, zero formal. I'm also not happy with the prices.",1
19837,So delicious! Wish you could search on more categories or styles.,4
19838,Just opened it. I'm going to order a pair of jeans and see how that's turns out. Ill do a review on them. look for an updates,4
19839,"I agree with a lot of other reviews on here. I really love the selections, descriptions,and pics, but just a few downfalls like, the ""you may also like"" is always off with sizes. I wear an XL and it always shows Sm, XS, XXS, Or occasionally a M, and I agree with the ""Clean out bag"" Payouts, they are so outrageously low. I had a pair of really nice, no flaws, jeans and I got .75cents. It sold for $14.99. And I had A LOT of nice items that weren't even posted, and my bag was crammed packed!! And last, yes I agree that the selling prices are sometimes way too high. Like the Nike sneakers, a lot of them sell for $52.99. Granted I've bought a couple of pairs for under $26, and I love them!! And that's a great price for USED Nikes. I know their in business to make $$ but it is a consignment/thrift store too though. But also on the positive side, I've bought a lot of great stuff from them and have only had to return just a few items, in which was my own stupidity. Overall I love ""ThredUP"" shoot I'm constantly browsing!!",5
19840,So far everything I've purchased has been good and arrived in record time. Good site to buy clothes at a bargain.,4
19841,Very easy to use! Always find cute brand name items at deep price cuts. Repeat customer forever!,5
19842,Love this app,5
19843,Nice selection and prices! Love the clean out bag service too!,5
19844,"Love it, feels like a bargin each time I shop.",5
19845,Love this app!,5
19846,I have bought some beautiful pieces of clothing from Thredup. Absolutely love this site,5
19847,"Be warned: this app is addicting. I've never been one to spend much money on clothes, partially because getting stylish, affordable clothes from ethical companies was such a headache. But ThredUp eliminates all the things that made shopping unenjoyable for me, and the so now I can have high-quality clothes on a teacher's budget and have a clear conscience about all of it. I find myself scrolling through whenever I have some spare time, and it's hard to resist the deals! The app itself does need some improvements, but customer service was very prompt at forwarding my suggestions for an ""exclude"" feature to their tech folks. Can't wait to start thw school year as one stylish teach!",5
19848,Love it,5
19849,"Simple, offers little deals every once in a while, and allows for great search filters.",5
19850,It's the best online shopping site ever,5
19851,Awesome service,5
19852,"I love using ThreadUP because often it's more difficult to find specific items/a fit you're looking for, in traditional thrift stores. ThreadUP is more consignment based and allows the customer to narrow down their searches by using several parameters, from sizes and brands to even color. I really appreciate this app and its message, I havent shopped in a normal clothing store in a year.",5
19853,In the past few months they've been making changes to the return process; decreasing allowable frequency and making you pay a restocking fee of $2. This will definitely make a big impact on my use of the app/threadup purchases. Disappointed.,3
19854,Great site for bargains! Love that it has filters to narrow your search.,5
19855,Nothing but good experiences here. My favorite way to shop for clothes by far!,5
19856,"Great service. App is hard to navigate. Too much tapping, clicking, etc.",4
19857,I was charged for an item I did not keep,2
19858,I have been a member of Thread up for years. Always friendly. The site is easy and fun to use. Love the new app!,5
19859,I am loving this new app. I was riding the line with the original total but then not only did I get 20% off but also free shipping!,5
19860,I buy lots of clothes from thredup and I'm happy with the app.,5
19861,Glitchy but I can get through if I restart it every so often.,4
19862,"I love this app, and the clothes are true to size and in great shape!",5
19863,I love finding nice items for cheap. They deliver fast. They also will buy items from you to help with room in your closet. Addicted!!!,5
19864,"Amazing, so glad I found this app on FB !",5
19865,"Love love this app. Great clothes, great prices.",5
19866,I've just made my last order from ThreadUp. The restocking fee is unacceptable for returning items.,1
19867,Quick & easy. Shopping & selling are a snap!,5
19868,I love thredUP!,5
19869,Great concept. I've Never been disappointed,5
19870,Great quality clothes at great prices,5
19871,"Pays almost nothing for clothes, then resells at high prices. Filter feature in app doesn't work at all for me.",1
19872,"I have purchased several pieces of costume jewelry through the app, description states ""excellent condition, could be mistaken for brand new""....2 different items from 2 completely different orders both arrived with missing stones. I would not have made the purchases at all, especially for the price point, if I knew stones were missing.",2
19873,"Great store. Products are as promised actually even better on some. Shipping was fine. Great store great value. App is not perfect, but the store is amazeballs.",5
19874,Love ThredUp!,5
19875,"App merchandise updates frequently, so you hardly ever miss a great deal. Easy to navigate and make purchases!",5
19876,"Purchased several times, very pleased",5
19877,Easy to use and navigate. Items are very nice and exactly as described.,5
19878,"They have a really large selection, and I found some really great items. I sent some clothes in earlier this summer, but they have not given me any info about what the status is. I will update when I do get something back from them",4
19879,I love using the app. It's super convenient and fairly easy to find what you are looking for. My only complaint is that some of the filters don't work when you're browsing a category. This can get rather frustrating but overall very happy with the app.,4
19880,"I have been able to completely overhaul my wardrobe affordably, due mostly to ThredUp. I also love that they are truly committed to environmentally friendly practices, from how they ship to how they pack.",5
19881,"Love the discount, delivery, packaging w/cute clothes for great Prices(AWESOME. ONLINE STORE)",5
19882,Fun and easy bought way too much time,5
19883,"I have pick clothes I wanted but couldn't afford new but now I have them on my budget. I got favorite jean's and dresses I absolutely love. Thanks, there is nothing better then having your favorite jeans!!!!!",5
19884,"Awesome stuff, always new items added.",5
19885,Love thredup and the app.,5
19886,Great for back to school shopping!,5
19887,I have been purchasing from thredUp because of the quality of the clothing that I've gotten. The compliments that I get on the clothing is my incentive to come back again and again and again. The majority of my clothing expense purchases comes from thredUp and I will be an avid fan for a long time.,5
19888,I gave my (nine west) shoes to them. Barely used. They selling it for $44 whilst I get $ 1 back. A fair transaction should be 50%. The purchaser gets good products however the return on value for seller is nothing. The company gets the profit.,1
19889,Excellent place to shop for good quality clothes for a small price,5
19890,Awesome,5
19891,My GO TO app to find my favorite brands!,5
19892,"Fun, easy. No bugs that i had to deal with....♡♡♡",5
19893,Good app,4
19894,"I have been using thredup for little over a year now and I absolutely love it!!! Everything I have bought has looked brand new!!! The pricing is perfect for being used items, their return process is quick and easy, and your stuff is delivered on time like the tracking says it will! Overall this is been the best ""thrift"" store experience you could ask for!! I do snd will continue to tell my friends about ThredUp!! Thanks so much",5
19895,I have both sold stuff and bought stuff using the Thred up app. I have been very happy with everything I have bought!,5
19896,A new way to thrift.,5
19897,This app is excellent but it runs really slowly on my phone and I'm not sure why. Other than that it is great.,4
19898,USED to love thredup but not anymore! prices are extremely high for a thrift store. Over $50 for used shoes?? Also DON'T sell your stuff here. They LOST my clean out bag in transit and won't even compensate for the inconvenience of my lost bag. Asking for proof of what was in there. Unbelievable. The fact that my clean out bag was lost is the point!,1
19899,Love love love! Easy to use and very rarely have I ever had an issue with the app,5
19900,Deducted the ammount of my order from my account but there is no order on file for me...it vanished. They have their money and the items i purchased are no where to be found.customer service is terrible. No help. Either return my money or give me my items.. is there any help???,1
19901,"This site is easy to use and offers everyone something for their budget and 
taste.",5
19902,i cant seem to stop shopping... at this time browsing by a style is not available but probably a good thing because id just end up giving my money away much faster if i could find what i wanted that much quicker,5
19903,"Love the clothing and prices. I have been shopping Thredup for sometime now 
and still loving it.",5
19904,Pretty easy to use,5
19905,"Keeping up with a growing toddler has been so much easier since finding 
thredUP!! Never disappoints!!",5
19906,"I LOVE ThredUP! This has to be one of the most amazing apps ever invented. 
Super kudos ❤️",5
19907,Brilliant! I love it! 😊,5
19908,"I do most of my thrifting through thredup. 90% satisfied with the items I 
receive...even better than when I thrift in person!",5
19909,Love the app. Helps to save money on great brands!,5
19910,"App never loads. Just keeps trying to load. Have to the chrome app on my 
phone",1
19911,"Have loved everything I have purchased and returns are easy! Great 
selection of petite sizes!",5
19912,"I love this website! So many great clothes at great prices! So glad I 
stumbled upon it.",5
19913,I love this website its my favorite thrift store online!,5
19914,"This is a great version of the online web page. I enjoy browsing on this 
app. All of the items I bought were as advertised, and I was very pleased 
with my purchases.",5
19915,"Pain free shopping. Downloaded the app, signed in with my account and I 
made my purchase!",5
19916,"Love this website. App is even better! Only thing is, be ready to wait if 
you're doing standard/free shipping. It will not arrive quickly, especially 
if you order on a weekend.",4
19917,"The app is great; easy to use, easy to find what you're looking for. The 
search filters are intuitive, & I love that it saves ""my sizes"" so I don't 
have to put that in every time.",5
19918,Great clothes at awesome prices!,5
19919,"Good deals, easy to use. What more could I ask for?",5
19920,"Second hand shopping is better for the environment. Like new clothes from 
great brands and very good deals.",5
19921,Very user friendly experience,5
19922,"Placed 3 orders. The first two came fine but then the third said it was 
delivered and I received someone elses order. Now I have no idea where my 
order is and I cant return this other persons order.",2
19923,"This app is good and evil. Good because I love to shop and a good deal is 
EVERYTHING! It's also evil because there are deals so great I look at 
things that I don't really need to buy 
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🤑🤑🤑🤑 I 
suffer from POTS and shopping in stores is a no go. This app allows me to 
find great fashion at a great price without ever leaving home. KUTGW 
#thredUP",5
19924,"The prices kind of suck, considering that it's a thrift shop.... I don't 
like how it's so hard to find anything specific in the app. The format and 
organization of the app could be a lot better. Overall it's just okay. 
Maybe if you're lucky you'll find a good deal but it's hit or miss",2
19925,"Aside from the goodie box not having plus sizes I love shopping with this 
app the only other thing I think you guys should improve on is adding a 
wide section to the app for the shoe selection it's a little bit confusing 
that I have to go all the way in to search and then plus size shoes",5
19926,Very addicting!,5
19927,"easy to use, safe, and overall super fun",5
19928,"The only problem I am having is with the children's sizes. Is it 6 in kids 
or 6 in infants...may never know until it is too late. Just please add an 
""m"" to indicate months.",4
19929,"Love the variety of clothing and pricing is great. My feedback is that I 
wish that there was a zoom feature on pictures of items to better see 
texture/details, and I wish that shopping was faster.",4
19930,"This app and store is fantastic. Great deals and fast shipping. The clothes 
come clean and almost in brand new condition.",5
19931,"Love it! I wish it would let me make an offer on items that have been 
posted for a long period of time.",5
19932,Love it!,5
19933,Love the opportunity to shop from home and great merchandise,5
19934,"Few kinks in the app, and one return was having a little issue. Nothing I'm 
not willing to deal with. Wonderful store.",4
19935,Fantastic and fun site.,5
19936,Easy to use. Great deals.,5
19937,"Great app, but the site needs better descriptions of the clothing and 
location of stains or tears",4
19938,Easy to use!,5
19939,All ugly stuff,1
19940,"Once you start shopping with Thredup you'll come back to shop again and 
again!",4
19941,"It's a little difficult to figure out how to save, bundle, and receive 
alerts that I can do from the web browser. Otherwise it's perfect and great 
to use!",4
19942,"Tons and tons of items from brand new to basement. Well worth spending time 
browsing for steals!",5
19943,Love the app! Its thrift shopping without having to leave home!,5
19944,"Love that Thread Up has an app! So many styles to choose from. Only thing 
I'd like to see different is that when I do a search for ""similar items"" I 
can see items with similar styles and not just similar colors. I also like 
that I can view my order history (of all orders done through the app).",5
19945,"Buy off of here alot. Always like new. I just wish it was free shipping and 
that they would send me promo codes!",4
19946,"Love, love, love!!!! This app is amazing!",5
19947,"Their selling sucks! They up sell the items you send in & send you very 
little money, while they make quite a bit off your items. Will NEVER EVER 
use again. Better off selling on Poshmark or other sites where you make 
more money or might as well just give away to Salvation Army or other 
thrift store.",1
19948,Love shopping secondhand and getting amazing fashion at great prices!!!,5
19949,Awesome app! Makes shopping super easy!!!,5
19950,I love three up,5
19951,"Seriously addicting. ThredUp knows how to make a great mobile app. Easy to 
navigate, terrific filter options, and quick loading of search items. I 
especially love how easy it is to favorite irems. I'd love to see a way to 
filter or categorize my favorites in a future update.",5
19952,Addicting.... all my favorite brands for a fraction of the price! Amazing!,5
19953,"So many good, quality items for such great prices! Definitely my new 
favorite shopping app! Blows EBAY away!!",5
19954,"The app is good and as a buyer this is a good deal but if you are 
consigning with thred up don't you will make peanuts and they have upfront 
payment and consignment and they take 82% and you get 18% different on 
consigned items. Take your stuff to a consignment store at least they give 
you 40%.",2
19955,"Easy to use, great prices.",5
19956,I'm addicted 😅,5
19957,"What the heck?? I bought a pair of boot and they cancled the order! No

find. Cute packaging!",5
19964,"Love this app and love thredup! I get a lot of compliments on everything 
I've purchased.",5
19965,"I love it. Only issue is I wish the search feature was less brand specific, 
and more style specific.",4
19966,"Prices have gotten way too high for used, damaged & discontinued clothing. 
Quality going down! Think they tried to expand to fast.",1
19967,Great app! Does everything I need it to! I'm addicted to ThredUp!,5
19968,"I really enjoy using thredup! My only complaint is sometimes leaving the 
search page starts the search over and the results are mixed up so you

from my mobile phone.",5

this is the only way I can dress how I want to in whatever size suits me 
best at the moment.",5
19978,"Nice clothes some good deals. Do not like that they sell obvious suit sets 
separate.",4

out bags!",5
19980,Super easy to use. Just makes me love this great site more!,5

dresses are overlapped with wedding reception. Otherwise it's great!",5
