1,"Trying to sign in to ebay on the app and password I'm using Is the right one as I use it on my computer but on the app it comes up with the words ""technical difficulties"" I don't know what to do is it the app and its not working properly. As I have unstalled and re-installed but still the same problem.",2
2,Great app.. You can most always find what you are looking for on eBay it has most anything you need,5
3,Love it it's awesome and always on time,5
4,Not very good I'm been charged a a eBay shop I am not a business,5
5,"Good price,easy return and good administrative intervention.",5
6,Good,5
7,Shite,1
8,Looooove it...... It's 🔥🔥💯,5
9,great experience!,5
10,Please ad some sort of confirmation when deleting listing drafts in the app. Frequently I will be scrolling through my drafts and the phone registers a downwards scroll as a sideways swipe and just deletes a draft with no confirmation. This is VERY frustrating!!!,3
11,This app is cloned,1
12,Great App..,5
13,Great app👍,5
14,Good selection and service. App allows me to quickly find and purchase items from Ebay independent sellers. I continue to be a fan. I save items to my Ebay and occasionally get offers. The infrequent returns are handled smoothly.,5
15,"Great for deal shopping, you can make offers etc.",5
16,Excellent,5
17,"So far the purchase experience has been satisfactory. Had no problem with the vendors, all the products arrived in timely manner, working fine. The 1-2 issues I had either wrong product or not reciving the order, the sellers had completed the refund with no major issues. Ebay is highly recommended.",5
18,eBay has always been good throughout the decades keep up the good work guys 👍 you guys are still super super when it comes to helping thank you 💯⚡️🔥🔥🥰💥💯❤️,5
19,Like it so much Shopping or auctions are so much fun,5
20,"the app has now taken upon itself to send me NOTIFICATIONS for items I looked at but was so disinterested in I didn't even bother to add to my watch list. This is pretty darned presumptious, and very annoying. Also, it sends loud push notifications for Buy It Now items. IF I wanted the Buy It Now item, I'd have bought it already. Constantly NAGGING, harassing and trying to be manipulative tends to lead to a divorce. There needs to be settings options to disable these types of notification.",1
21,"Easy to use, and very secure. Perfect for people on the go 👍👍👍👍.",5
22,"Closing a case and then taking the money for something I shipped takes the p*ss, ridiculous app stay clear of it.",1

24,Use it all the time Wotks great.,5
25,"It's run by PERVERTS trying to sell disgusting items! My recommendations will have kid's toys, non-fiction books, the Bible, electrical parts, shoes, things we actually look at. But then it throws in SEX DOLLS and other related items!! It's not an accident and can't be blamed on the algorithm. It's not the first time it has happened either!! It is DELIBERATE just like other PERV companies like Amazon, Etsy and Google, who are run by Chester, Chester, child mol******!",1

30,Ebay is really good at hard to find parts,5
31,Easy to use. Very efficient.,5
32,"App has a huge glitch, does not show your offers as a notification. You have to go to each individual listing each day to check your offers. It will not notify you or show. Customer service DOESNT exist for this problem. Only good for desktop.",1
33,I prefer eBay over Amazon and others because of much better customer service and the ease of the rare return/refund which I've only had to do twice out of the many orders. Most everything arrives on the earlier dates of estimated delivery time.,4
34,Does what I need and I haven't had any issues with it.,5
35,"Really nice buyer protection, you can find some great deals.",5
36,Ebay doesn't allowed me to put my debit card on payout I dont know why they need to fix this I already put to many times doesn't work !! It doesn't make sense as a buyer when I put my debit it work !! As a seller put my debit card doesn't even work at all!! This piss me off,1

54,"So glad ebay has an app! It makes even easier to get the items I want with a push of a button. They have such a wide variety in sizes and different looks, old, new and today. They always have the shirts I'm Looking for that are hard find! I Keep coming back! Lol",5
55,"Ebay is the best place to buy/sell! The app is nice & easy use, However, the app pales in comparison to ebay customer service! Literally every single time I have called they have gone out of their way to help! Even if they aren't able to give you what you want, they will look for a resolution that is acceptable! I wish everyone had the level of real caring that ebay reps have. I need a lot more room to truly say how much they go out of the way to help! Sorry I'm out of room and haven't even star",5
56,Excellent for online shopping,5

72,Services are great,5
73,Perfect,5
74,fantastic,5
75,"Repeated in-app surveys interrupting with feedback requests, that they promise to listen to.. yet the interrupting surveys never stop. What was I doing before the survey popped up in the middle of me working on a a task, and derailed my train of thought? I dunno! With seller fees forever going up, and buyers facing more and more cookie-cutter repetitive (sometimes bordering on deceptive) listings swamping any decent deals, eBay is now a pale shadow of what it was when I joined in 2001.",1
76,I like it,5
77,It's eBay you must of heard of it by now,5

82,"Doesn't work. Every action meets with ""invalid access token""",1
83,"Great for those who still use eBay, unfortunately with all the other competitors, websites, apps, ect., selling on here has become a bit of a challenge. Still a great place to find rare, unique, one of a kind items, and certified merch and guessing that probably won't change. 🙏",5

130,"Stay away from eBay. As a seller, this platform has extra fees and hidden charges for shipping. Buyers as well. This platform is not what it used to be. I used it for 18 years. No loyalty or respect. Fees are ridiculous. I dont know how you can make money here. I paid 13.90 for the shipping label and then charged an extra 4.89 in unexpected charges. After the item was delivered. Im closing my accounts and selling somewhere else like temu or etsy. Im done with ebay fees",1

156,"Been using eBay since the 1890's. Computers were slower. Horses everywhere. Simpler time. Auctions only. ""Buy It Now"" is a viable alternative to Amazon. Ebay runs a lot faster now with electricity being so common. 👍🏼",5
157,Great 👍🏾,5
158,not compatible with my device any more??? why? just don't want me to use ot any more? OK,1

164,This platform sells fake items. I bought the original but the scammer sent me a fake. I requested a return request. They offered to send the item to Sri Lanka at my own expense. I reported this to the support team but they said it was normal. I do not recommend this experience to anyone.,1

211,Great app,5
212,"I have a collectors original beanie baby. I saw the price it was being sold and marked it slightly lower than everyone else since ebay has a limit for new users. They banned me for life. Their explanation ""they don't trust me"" I had to give them my I.D, a picture of me, and I filled out the forms. I've seen disgusting things on ebay but a beanie baby is where they draw the line? I tried asking for more info. They blocked me.",1
213,"Only 2 stars because of the transaction fees, they are absolutely ridiculous, if you sell something for £70 you will loose £10 in fees, it's robbery. I sold something for £3k and lost over £400 in fees. I can see why people are stopping using ebay to sell things on, they just advertise them on here and do cash on collection when possible. Ebay is more expensive than an auction house which blows my mind.",2

219,A great app 👌 👏,5
220,"Keeps logging out! Joke! Inbox ain't messages, how stupid! What's the point of having app verification if never works!? Terrible design deliberately made to mislead sellers and overcharge their costs, often with no protection!! Fees are ridiculous for the service provided. Huge step backwards in design! Constant listing manipulation and shadow banning for sellers during promotion period! Negative feedback removed for those who pay for premium, no consequences for unpaid items and much more!!!",1
221,"I've just uninstalled the app, which is what I assume eBay want, due to Nectar being unlinked from everyone's accounts. The only way to collect points is to shop through Nectar, which is what I will now do. They've also removed Amex in yet another greedy, anti-user move. Ultimately, the eBay app is now useless.",1

249,"I like eBay just about anything you need is here somewhere normally sensibly priced. Some care is required if purchasing expensive items as you may get fake or unregistable items, also ensure you get a serial number and product codes, if in doubt ask, eBay returns policy is normally straight forward. Occasionally things do arwy, but that's internet shopping in general. Ebay do protect the buyer to a fairly good degree. Great for the small items.",5

259,I like ebay it's nice but what I hate is that they always change my bidding start price whenever I'm selling sm and I put a good price down they change it to $9.40 like it's soo annoying.,3
260,At first the recent redesign was annoying but still functioned minimally. Now however all you get to do is look at a loading page. Stop messing up the few things you actually have working correctly. If it works leave it alone.,1

274,Cheap parts and accessories,5
275,"Unfamiliar and leary about online shopping, but took chance with well-known eBay to purchase items. After receiving a battery operated, toy version of what was supposed to be a beautiful household appliance, I found out that if we want that refund as promised, cost of shipping for returns are on us. Maybe depends on reason? Was offered a one-time limited reimbursement, but it would require having a PayPal account. More personal info, huh? Don't have, don't want. Lesson? It pays to be Leary...",1

355,"It works for me yet it may be rubbish for everyone else. Glad eBay has ended its association with PayPal/PP. PP ruined it for me in 2002. Haven't sold anything since. May start selling again if PP are not involved. I have purchased some unavailable elsewhere spares and I am very grateful for that seller offering them for sale. I only buy Click and Collect as delivery here at my home address is a nightmare being a manual wheelchair user. Live in a high-rise, they expect me to go down to collect!",5
356,"I've got a problem I have had an offer from a seller, but when I click on Review Offer it says ""Your ebay app is outdated, please delete your present app and then turn off your mobile. Restart your mobile and then reinstall the ebay app to fix the problem"" I did this and the message ""Your ebay app is outdated"" still appears I checked other offers from other seller's and the message doesn't appear I have installed the latest ebay app from the Play Store Why am I seeing this message?",5

361,"Fast buying process, once all is settings in place",5
362,Suspend me without any reason,1
363,"A good interpretation of the desktop experience, which has improved in the past couple of years, causing me to change from a four to a five star review. Certainly useful for listing items.",5
364,Ebay support will lie to you about getting a refund then have you wait days just to contact a new agent to be told the first one lied to you better off buying things from a different site,1

378,Mostly good prices and very comfortable easy to find stuff,5
379,"Well first, fees are too high when I sell something. When I got scammed I contacted an ebay agent and they told me to wait a couple days then contact again to get my money back. I contacted them again after trying the seller and they said they can't do anything. Never got my money back and seller removed my negative review (with ebays help) to get their lying ""100% positive feedback."" So much for ""money back guarantee"" Ebay is not good AT ALL when there's a problem and even is a complete lie!",1
380,Good app,4
381,I can buy just about anything or sell.,5
382,I spend all my paychecks on eBay. They need to give me like a gold membership.,5

385,"Ebay is such a blessing of an app. The things that I would've never gotten in my life, I have acquired through this app. I love this app and will use it until the end of my days.",5
386,Excellent AP to use Ebay!,5
387,I love ebay and the audience they provide me for my side hustle and its very effective.,5
388,disappointing that you don't get a list of your ebay plus vouchers on any screen for this app since you pay for this service.,2

390,So much better these days. .,5

392,"I have conducted the majority of my shopping through this application, and I have found it to be quite satisfactory. I have not encountered any issues or complaints regarding its functionality. From an aesthetic and general perspective, it is an exceptional application.",5
393,"I RATED 5 STARS BEFORE YOUR LAST UPDATES...!!! Purchasing on eBay has become increasingly frustrating after the recent updates. Reaching customer service now requires spending over half an hour navigating through a chatbot, trying to find the right keywords to finally reach a human representative. In the end, you may find yourself deceived by a seller, out of pocket, and with your case put on hold for two weeks until the seller returns from vacation.!!!!!!!",1
394,Dramatic improvement over last time I tested several years ago. Nice Paypal integration. Better than Amazon shopping. However there should be an easier way to toggle between a particular item you search for that has sold and the price versus the asking price of what's on sale. In other words I'd like to know the sale history of a product I'm searching for,4
395,nice,5
396,I am trying to find out what to do as I'm new to this,5
397,Love to shop here,5
398,Everything I have bought has arrived on time and been great quality. Easy to use and customer service is great and really helpful.,5
399,I can find almost anything on eBay! It's easy to buy the products and the shipping is very reasonable. I don't like to use the bidding because when I want something I want to buy now.,5
400,Customer service won't help you.,1
401,"Nice for buying online, better prices XD",5
402,"The constant Spam notifications I receive from sellers when all i'm doing is viewing a item Is extremely annoying. It's getting to a point where I no longer enjoy looking on eBay. I've turned off all notifications, but unfortunately it makes no difference.",1
403,eBay starts to be a joke . You can win an item but the seller can decide to cancel the auction and you can't even give him bad feedback. Not to maintain that you have no support from eBay/real person anymore but AI .,1
404,Cant fault it,5
405,Love ebay it is an amazing app,5
406,Good info,5
407,Good app,5
408,"There is bug on ""Track Package"" page. After provided the tracking number several days ago. The ""Track Package"" does not update.. After checking the package on USPS, the item has been delivered today. But the 'Track Package' page on eBay still remains the same... My Order Details page still remains 'Shipped' instead of 'Delivered'. Please fix the issue. Thank you",2

410,Great secure buying.,5
411,Very happy with this app from finding what you want to delivery never had a problem,5
412,I utilize eBay frequently and I always compare their prices to prices I can find on other sites including amazon. Multiple times eBay is quite competitive and the support that eBay does of its consumers is spot on,5
413,Items for sale are always exact as described and shown. They appear at the door as promised Price is very reasonable,5
414,"Ebay needs to amp up their game, I am finding numerous items on amazon 7 to 12$ cheaper. I was an abbit ebay shopper but why pay more, when you get same product for less and faster shipping. I still use auction for occasional items but Ebay needs a change.",1
415,Can't copy tracking number above tracking history. Needs an app lock too.,2

462,I love eBay but NOT THE APP. It no longer lets me view offers from sellers. It says I need to update my app. In the app store it does not show that I need to update. I wonder how many of my customers are not able to see my offers.,2
463,Incredible app,5
464,Great app for Ebay no issues,5
465,"Terrible company. They don't like sellers, they don't help sellers, they just punish others. They just block your account for no real reason, doesn't matter how good of a seller you are. I have 100% feedback. Keep getting my listings taken down for zero reason. And then they decide to make it so that you can't be able to have your listing to be able to be shown because they're just evil. Haven't been a dedicated eBay seller and they've been dedicated to just messing everything up.",1

470,Love it ebay is my absoulute go to place for almost everything.,5
471,I find it very easy to browse and use it as my first choice when searching for all sorts of products Still find it mostly OK apart from the results of searches for specific items. I.e. I wear and put in searches for Ladies Skechers UK size 5.5. Very rarely do i receive all 5.5. After the first couple the majority are size 5. No good for me; I waste hours going through them because very rarely does the size show up in the header info ! It drives me nuts and frequently now I will first try Vinted,4

479,Great,5
480,"I just love ebay! You find that many of the items are less expensive than the same items are on Etsy. And I can almost always find what I'm looking for. And the one experience I ever had with a seller not delivering what they were supposed to, ebay gave me a full refund.",5
481,"NEVER EVER BUY HIGH VALUE ITEM FROM EBay$1519, THEY ALWAYS TAKE THE SELLER SIDES.Avoid Chinese sellers(AU),posted wrong description, argued about it,I decided to return it,asked eBay to step in,they put the case on hold for 5 days, when it's over they put it again on 3 days hold,then again after the item finally got received,they asked me for a proof of delivery although the delivery status says delivered, dodgy seller wanted me to change my feedback,eBay yetnot refunded deposit it was delivered",1

It's TWO months, and I can only get refunded after October 31st. This is ridiculous, I contacted the seller about it and their response was NOT helpful. It's coming from China to Poland, and when I bought multiple things from other apps the package came in less than two weeks, NOT two MONTHS.",1
513,Great app! Legendary!,5

538,"Some recent changes make zero sense from a sales and marketing standpoint. For one, limiting the amount of items I can put in my watch list. This is my shopping list and you are essentially putting a limit on the amount of items I purchase. The more I have in there, the more I buy. And recently, you've removed the listing ending timestamp allowing me to set a quick reminder note. Yes, I can count down the hours left, but why should I have to? Poor marketing skills on the developers",3

Would give 5 but I'm finding the prices are not less than amazon or walmart .it used to be you could always find it cheaper on ebay. But wow you can find great jeans from the 90s, and amazing coats.

651,2022 sellers were stealing my money thru ebay and now AS OF 2024 EBAY is stealing my money. This AUTOPAY feature is ruining my experience as a buyer and stealing money from me. 1 hr is not enough time for the sellers to combine shipping after me winning auctions and im being AUTOCHARGED 5$ per item shipping even if it's all the same seller at the same time and have no way to get refunded.,1
652,"aweful customer service, ebay is currently trying to steal £80 from me, they will not give me any help, when I send emails asking for help they send back emails of completely random words that do not even make sense. don't use this app as it seems they do not care about their users and will do what ever to make cheap easy money.",1

Due to this, i missed out on a reduced offer from a seller because it wouldn't let me buy at the reduced amount without updating the app. I was left with no choice but to buy the product at the full asking price but when i attempted to do this someone else beat me and bought the item. Not pleased at all, as it appears i'm forced to pay the full asking price all because i can't update the stupid app!!",1

683,"Ebay fees are a bit ridiculous for the buyer and the seller. If you are a buyer, be aware that the price you and the seller agree on is not the final price. You are going to pay taxes. If you're a seller. You're not only going to pay 10% advertising fees, but there's additional fees on top of that, taking away from your final balance. I agreed on $1700 with the buyer only receiving $1246 after fees. Never again",1

719,"The entire marketplace is a sham. Ebay customer service representative Shubham Kumar informed me that they ROUTINELY remove negative feedback with no reason so you do not truly know the type of person you are buying from. Save your money, buy from meecari, Amazon, poshmark, Facebook marketplace, this is a dead stick selling venue with the highest selling fees on the planet. Do not buy here. Do not sell here.

They gouge sellers up to 20% for the shipping fee they collect! They claim I have below average rating, so they charge extra. I have 98% positive feedback with 1600+ unique feedback. They don't save your records for sales info beyond a couple months. The app lag is infuriating when trying to edit items. The features in the app are limited.",1

Buyer stated there was no audio. eBay took the side of the buyer and I ended up with a broken radio that I could see had been tampered with as some screws not fully returned and it was seriously contaminated with tobacco smoke! The lesson I have learnt is to take a video before listing as proof of working condition. It was binned!",5

Most of the time shipping cost are ok, but when shipping cost more than the item it make you rethink purchasing. This happens a lot when the item is based in USA. Update 2024. Still happy using eBay, everything from clothes to electronics. Delivery times are still pretty good, and sellers always reply to my questions if I have any.",5
851,Awesome phone selection something for everyone,5
852,"Great for selling starting a business or getting rid of unwanted items, fees are relatively a lot higher than most, they need to slash prices like Mecari who lets you keep all of your profit, i still dont understand all the greed with Ebay especially with inflation the way it is, now you will see rediculous prices for common items to make up for all the money Ebay takes from you.

952,it's easy to use and it's very reasonable,4
953,App will not let me access offers until I update. But No updates are showing in the app store! How can I update the app if none are available? Also trying to update my phone number (it's a new number). But app keeps telling me to use a valid number! What is going on at ebay??,1
954,"Whatever need, parts, shoes, clothes and etc. I can find in this app. Been using for years and has never failed.",5

957,Great app,5
958,Great functionality.,5
959,Got app because ebay said I'd get $5 of coupon I'd I spent over $50. I spent over $100 and it said I didn't have the minimum order for the coupon.,1
960,"It was wonderful, thank you",5
961,Easy to use.,5
962,All okay and commos.,3
963,"Seriously, for the love of god, put the damn sizing option first! It's ridiculous that this filter only appears if you accidentally click the right category. And what’s with constantly shoving clothes in my face that are way too big? What the actual hell? I don't have the time or patience to wade through endless options only to find out there’s nothing in my size (XS). It's beyond stupid and a total waste of time. Fix it!",1
964,Excellent,5
965,Watchlists and features can be a little muddy but it's still a pretty good app,4

985,"Not good. I've been shopping ebay the past few weeks and now all of a sudden I'm locked out with no way to sign in via username or email even tho my email is indeed my active email and repeatedly getting that 'it doesn't match'. Edit: Ebay quickly fixed the situation and the app is back to working order. Thank you, Ebay.",5

992,"eBay is the original and as far as I'm concerned, it's still the best. I've had problems with eBay over the years, but those were my own lack of integrity, no this companies. The app is good, the website as well. Cheers. Well done. Mark Y.",5
993,Very good people I like the way you handle things,5
994,It's ebay you know the experience.,5

996,"Handy but the Android version is increasingly buggy: notifications that won't clear, item descriptions not showing up.",2
997,Good app,5
998,I've been a buyer and seller on ebay for years there's no place like it for unique deals and markets to sell your items that simply don't exist anywhere else. You'll love it! There's no comparison out there!,5
999,Great,5
1000,App is great. I've always had good experiences with ebay.,5

1006,"Immediate care free shopping... additionally used for years corner shop on your phone Problem free app Additionak comment to this review 27 may 2023- immediate protected way to shop Only ever had one difficult seller, but that not down to the app.",5
1007,This is one of the best apps I ever use really easy to use,5
1008,Great,4
1009,Always wonderful,5
1010,Search feature is and has been a complete wreck. Changes to feedback form ensure I will never leave feedback for a seller ever again. You continue to screw sellers in literally every case brought before you. And eBay continues to get worse. Why can't you ever give me a reason to rate you better? You have the resources to be better. I just don't understand it. This app the most polished turd on the internet.,1
1011,"Ebay app is great, I never have any problems with it and I am a seller too.",5
1012,Good so far.,5
1013,Must say eBay is very good,4
1014,"15 year member. Ran into an issue where my account was hacked ebay informed me and a purchase was made but ebay refused to take my side and it got shipped to the hackers address and I didn't recieve my money back. Incredibly disappointed in ebays "" money back gaurentee"" otherwise a decent app for the most part",4
1015,I will be deleting this app asap. To many shady advertisement and product warranties.,1
1016,Saved me alot of money. Also helps me make a little money as well.,5
1017,"App has become unusable. Technical difficulties apparently. Can't login, can't do anything.",1
1018,Very good,5
1019,I havent really sold on ebay yet but buying and shopping with the app is awesome. Iv had a few complications but nothing major.,4
1020,"Easy to navigate and all the features work. I've made purchases to canceling bids to contacting sellers, all with ease. The filters are a bit jumbled, but the screen space is limited.",5
1021,Excellent customer service.,5
1022,Great app. Easy to use.,4
1023,Sick as hell,5
1024,Great,5
1025,Excellent,5
1026,"Swiping messages to discard / delete was awesome, now they just had to ruin it by now having to tap edit and then tick the boxes for the ones you want to delete and then hit delete.. this is a not making the app better than before which was way better. Good LORD, what are the devs smoking lately?",2
1027,Great is to use,4
1028,Very easy and reliable,5
1029,"Very bad this app Unfortunately eBay closed my account when I sold & buy an item in another account💔😔I know my voice will not be heard.I have seen such a nonsense app for the first time in my life My money has also been wasted, I don't know what to do I did this with borrowed money",1
1030,Ok,4
1031,It not the 1st I used this company.,4
1032,I like shopping on ebay..,4
1033,"A 6 star for excellence professional, great service. A must have app",5
1034,Why they want to upgrade went I didn't want to and didn't want to delete the aplicacation all I want to delete the updated why because you did it in purpose,1
1035,"Terrible new feature is designed to hurt buyers & unfairly protect sellers. Why should I have to wait 7 days to leave neutral/negative feedback? That just gives them more time to sell an awful, misleading product & buyers aren't able to warn each other in the reviews until the item has been posted for at least 8 days. Will be ordering from Amazon instead for now on. I hope they reverse this decision so I can confidently purchase on Ebay again.",1
1036,I've bought and sold on eBay for many years. They've made it better and better over the years.,4
1037,"Apologies, just realised you tap the bid and date below starting price.",5
1038,Lot better then it use to be,5
1039,Great prices and products,5
1040,Good,5
1041,excellent app,5
1042,"One stop shop, everything is in Ebay",5
1043,Very nice.,5
1044,"Unfortunately I got scam by a user called fl644713. I made a purchase worth of $267.2 on some PRV audio. Giving me a wrong tracking number not once but twice! I called my post office and give the info of the tracking number as they confirm that the tracking number doesn't match with my address. I report it, open an appeal and try to speak with a real agent as they DIDN'T HELP ME! I EVEN LEAVE A BAD REVIEW WHERE THE SELLER DELETE IT! PLEASE BE CAREFUL! EBAY DOESNT HELP WHEN IS SCAM INVOLVED!",1
1045,Best app for online purchases,5

1047,"Works perfectly, very happy. Thank you :)",5
1048,Experience with ebay is great,5
1049,This is a local ebay listing is not possible here and they take the money for listing separately. This. 🙏🙏🙏🙏,1
1050,Best,5
1051,Exactly what I needed,5
1052,Awful experience 👎,1
1053,I don't mind giving feedback but whenI have to go searching for photos. I have to spend more time spending research then ordering and using the item. If I am satisfied I will tell you. If not I will tell you.,5
1054,The app just works. Haven't had any issues.,5
1055,eBay has the WORST customer service ever. It is impossible to get help for anything except their predetermined topics. And you will absolutely never get to speak with a person. A seller cancelled a purchase that I made for a little over $500 and I was only givin a partial refund. Now I'm out $212 and I have no way to contest it because that isn't covered in any of the topics listed. The seller says they didn't receive any payment from eBay so my best guess is that eBay has stolen the money. 👎,1
1056,Always a good experience,5
1057,Thumbs up.,5
1058,Good,5
1059,❤️,5
1060,Very helpful when I cannot get to my computer. Need to check on my account and activities!,5

I have to drop it to 4 stars, because of a few problems I've come across.

1127,"Basic functionality had been going downhill lately. The front page shows items in my watchlist. when I go to my watchlist, it's empty. When I save items on the front page and refresh, they come back. I keep getting suggestions for frequent searches.

In the past, the payment process took me to the PayPal site, where I would login with username and password. All the transaction data migrated over for payment approval and then bounce back to eBay for payment confirmation. Now it's linked so I just choose PayPal for payment, and my item is paid for instantly. Even easier!!!",5
1187,It's 2022! You can't update the shipping address immediately after you hit the wrong button. They don't buffer orders for 3 minutes and because of that they're trying to cancel. This is the worst software I've got in ages.,1

1288,I cannot bid after being outbid. The app is incredibly buggy in general,1
1289,I like eBay because i find what i want with ease most of the time and with good suggestion options,5
1290,"All eBay does is spam my messages, alerts, and email with dozens of unwanted offers. I can't find the actual items I'm bidding on because of the pages of spam I get. I can't read my emails because it's just an onslaught of emails from eBay. It's ridiculous.",1

1303,"eBay has been my go-to since the inception of e-commerce. Industry pioneer. Industry stalwart. Thank you, people!",5
1304,"eBay keeps changing my address so I'm not receiving any of my purchases. Firstly they reverted my address back to my old one, so everything was being sent there. Now they've cut out my apartment number so everything is being returned to the sellers. You'd swear that eBay didn't have the time or resources to fix these simple issues.",1
1305,Always helpful,5
1306,"Love this company. When I had an issue with my account, customer service has been so helpful with solving it.",5

1315,"Love it, easy to use . Wish it included a view similar items. Glad to be back.",5
1316,Evil bay ! How does a buyer pay for 48 hrs postage..... Then when not received can't get eBay protection to step in for another 9 days after.... Protects sellers because they make you more money Your nothing without buyers Also protecting sellers over seas selling copy s stating they are here in the UK just because they have a UK lock up address. Nah not for me like I say evil bay !,1
1317,ease,5
1318,Ebay is one of the best places to get top of the line items.although you have to be really careful not to get scam. If you do it can get rough..but you do you due work before hand you'll be fine,4

1336,I always find wot I'm looking for,5
1337,"Closed my account after 20 year becuase ebay is now garbage. Ai customer service that fails, bad policies, don't use ebay. Amazon is better",1

1352,Very easy to use,5
1353,Minus or Zero Stars! Horrible app. 99% of the space is occupied by sponsored and advertised products you are not interested while viewing the actual product you are interested in. Seems it is not making any more normal revenues hence resorted to such cheap ways to maximise their revenues through advertisement of shifty products thinking customers are fools.,1
1354,If you like Shopping...you will love ebay. Great deals everyday 😊,5
1355,Excellent,5
1356,"This just started recently, when you scroll down to seller ratings & select this item, there are no reviews. They are all just blank boxes. However, if you select all items it has the written reviews. I use the reviews on the item to help me make a decision on purchasing it so I want the ability to be able to read those again.",3

1377,"*I had done a lot more business when you were given Ebay bucks for your purchases. **I miss that you got Ebay bucks on almost every item (you got 1%, or 2%, or sometimes a special came around for 5% of the purchase price). *** You use your accumulated Ebay bucks to buy other items of your desire. ****Please bring those Ebay bucks back!",4

1384,All around great place to find anything literally good job,5
1385,Like the merchandise.. but security and postage not so good..,1
1386,Not working for day's,1
1387,Updated 2024: Worst thing eBay ever done was introduce AI for seller descriptions. They're now useless as AI just writes them from information already in the listing elsewhere. Doesn't help the buyer at all. So annoying.,2
1388,Never had a problem.,5

I have had the same phone number and address for 24 years.. So they got the payment from the customer who received the item 3 days after buying,and a month later they haven't paid me..",1
1408,It's ok I guess 😐😐😐,3
1409,I found what I want right away,5
1410,Handy but a bit hard for me on the small screen,4
1411,I can look at everything and order anything,5
1412,"So bad with selling process, get your funds so late, yet doesn't cover customers, especially when a glitch in the app is the cause of closing the case ! Inexperienced customer support, 7 agents in half an hour no one solved the problem.",1

1419,"Im only selling my second item but have liked it so far, and my first item sold at asking price almost immediately, but ya got me with the promotional fees and after it was all said and done I walked away with about $200 less than what I thought I would be. Should be a little more upfront about how that all works and how much it actually costs, if I would've realized and known I wouldn't have agreed to let my item be promoted but ya live n ya learn.",4
1420,Good,5
1421,Never sent me some of the CDs i bought and never gave me any customer service. There is however some decent products on the site that did arrive.,2

1427,Buy stuff more buy many much more,5
1428,Terrible company. LIES TO YOU EVERY CHANCE IT GETS JUST TO GET RID OF YOU!!!! Package are always late if they show. I lost $126.00 dollars of my money on shoes I'm still waiting for. It's been 3 months I haven't been waiting for awhile now. I just wanted to show you what can happen. There jewelry there sellers are claiming is silver is stainless steel that wouldn't fit a child. I have tried and tried to get eBay to fix . They want you to send package back at your cost and you don't get it back.,1
1429,Easy to use and not down alot,5
1430,Always a great experience when I use eBay their customer service is very good and their sellers are vetted,5

1438,"This app is perfect, I've sold a lot of items and got a lot of money thanks to this app. It really helps a lot.",5
1439,Great way to spend money you ain't got 🤪🤣,5
1440,"Selling is a huge pain because they hold your money for a ridiculous amount of time, without giving a proper estimate for how long it will be held. At first it listed a date that the funds would be held until. Then I was thankful it updated and said I'd get paid once the item was delivered. But once it delivered, they updated it to say they were holding my money another four days. If you're reading this and have other avenues to sell, I'd wouldn't recommend eBay, only as a very last resort.",1
1441,"It's great. I save money buying new and used cart parts. I like that the app tells you if a part fits. 👍 I have rental houses that sometimes need parts for appliance, and I can save on used parts from people making a little money on the side, or even making a living, while saving old appliances from landfills. I greatly appreciate that. 👍👏👏👏 It even helps write your item description.",5
1442,"They are charging me for a scam purchase and a transaction that was never made. So a scammer (tried to) buy my listing and didn't pay obviously, and ebay charged me $20 as a ""selling fee"" even though I never got paid!!! Ebay is a SCAM and should be avoided at all costs. I am very upset about this.",1
1443,Good app for selling,5
1444,The best shopping site I have ever come across. You can buy any good quality on it.,5
1445,Impressive,5
1446,"Selecting a Click & Collect delivery address does not work on the Android app. In emaiil confirmation of the order, home address is stated. This has happened to me on three occasions and needs to be fixed.",2
1447,"This app is so good to see what you need to buy online. And for back to school shopping for my kids, like clothes, and shoes, and emergency phone's. I recommend this app.",4
1448,"Good,really good app",5
1449,"always have great experience, customer focused.",5
1450,"Now, there's no way to talk with them about sellers not responding about returns so that they can step in anymore. They've made it where sellers can defraud buyers without fear of ebay making them pay the money back anymore. Ebay USED TO BE one of the safest places to buy anything online, but now ebay is helping the scammers rip off buyers, and there's no way to contact them for help anymore. They've completely stopped caring about buyers, and I don't feel safe buying there anymore.",1

1468,Awesome 👌,5
1469,Very useful for auction bidding,5
1470,"It charged way to much to sell anything it literally took almost half of my funds from sells for taxes, advertising I requested not to have, and other taxes cost I never specified what exactly not to mention I paid twice for a refund and when I requested a refund for one of the refund payments I was completely ignored so I took all my items off and closed my account I understand you should pay for using their site but not almost half of what I'm selling it for I mean good lord what's that about",2

1479,Ebay is the best thing you can buy and it delivers it quickly so why not download,5
1480,Inadequate buyer protections. Here's how you make money: List an item with an estimated shipping date more than 30 days out from date of purchase. That's it! You get paid and you never have to ship your item! eBay will do nothing! Enjoy and happy scamming!,1
1481,Covers Every Search,5
1482,Awesome,5

1491,"It's easy to post items for sale because the way the app walks me through the options, luv it...",4
1492,Riddled with bugs making it useless as an editing tool.,1
1493,"Can beat eBay backup and asking for tracking your purchase and keeping contact with your sellers and them knowing you, keep contact with you too fantastic",5

1506,"The app has always been excellent and easy to use, however, some recent update (I assume) has made it so that I can no longer checkout if I have more than one item in my basket due to an error (Error type: 99).

1522,The lastest upgrade sucks. (Ago 24) In the previous version I could delete notifications with just a swipe now I have to select and delete. What a stupidity. Give the swipe back Shitware,1
1523,Very useful and convenient 👌,5
1524,AVOID at all costs eBay doesn't honer there money back guarantee even when you send them proof you never received item now reporting eBay to action fraud,1
1525,"annoying ads such as ""frequently bought together"", ""more sponsored items"" etc, instead of displaying useful info about the item i""m viewing 👎 missing half of the features of the web version",1

1527,"Reviewing from the latest version. My address is UK, I'm in the UK, it should priotise UK not streamline the search to US first, do better.",1
1528,"Absolutely despise the message system and pages. You can NOT open a message then delete it, while you are still on the page. You know like every other mail and message system out there. Nope, you have to go back to the main listings, tap the delete button, select the message, then select the actual delete button. 4 actions MORE than is actually needed. If all this needed extra time was monetized, you would be loosing thousands. But hey it's your money and time not eBay's.",2
1529,It's good,5
1530,App keeps getting better,5
1531,"Sponsored listings mean it's difficult to find items sold by people, not businesses. AI generated descriptions are bad, they all seem super fake. Fees are very expensive. AI reporting of listings doesn't work.",1
1532,Superb,5
1533,"I have become a habitual eBay shopper. It's a very unique website to find all kinds of treasures, clothing, electronics, just about anything. Ebay is one of a kind and there is no other website like it.",5
1534,"Ebay started the net commerce system browsing, purchasing, or online-selling it's going very smoothly.",5
1535,"HORRID APP. 1. COPY PASTE RARELY WORKS [1%], 2. TRACKING ORDER NUMBERS RARELY WORKS TOO [1%] 2. ALSO DOES NOT DISCOUNT AS IT SUGGESTS AND 4. THE HUMAN ASSISTANTS ARE USELESS AND CLUELESS AT SOLUTIONS REGARDING THE APP.",1

1552,"Pretty good, not all functionalities from the computer but it's very good 4.5/5",4
1553,"My daily purchase for cars parts , gave a great addition to my business. Cheaper than amazon.",5
1554,"Still by far best shopping even over Ama...z..n, as they don't have as many corrupt sellers. Ebay weeds out those very quickly leaving honest legit sellers. 5 star ebay, 2 star Ama..z..n. eBay for the win. I dont like the sponsor pay to be head of the line. Should be based on selling record, not what do you wanna give us to be able to be seen. Fac...bo..k is same way now. Don't like it at all. But I guess we're all getting ripped off one way or another. Least they tell us before rammin' it in",5

1560,Love it!!!...I can find what I'm looking for and more........finishing projects.......very convenient,5
1561,"Great app. The messaging interface between buyers and sellers is a much better experience in the app than the website. That said, the website does offer exclusive features not in the app, for example the ability to create and post from templates, which is currently the only way to include a video in your listing.",4
1562,Best tool on the internet,5
1563,Ebay is the best vehicle to get the things you need and discard the the things you don't need.,5
1564,"Ebay is a great way to buy and sell items. I really like the 80% off selling fee offer from time to time, and buying is easy as well. Lots of choice. Ebay also gives its own offers. So I bought a golf club recently with 10% discount that the seller wasn't offering on their website. A trusted marketplace with the majority of buyers and sellers being very honest and trusted.",5
1565,"Refuses to work properly, don't bother",1
1566,Ebay getting the worst for scam not only are you fooled in to paying for ebay plus membership that parcels are left outside in open view streets for them to be stolen and that does ebay do NOTHING it's badluck we got our money so go away. Ebay plus is meant to help and if product is faulty or doesn't come it's back up by ebay. It's enough to want to go to another shopping app cause ebay just full of untrusted sellers and not even in this country and when they say they are Ebay does not care,1
1567,"Most of listing is a short living accounts: you buy something they pretend to send it, feed you with promises and delete account. Ebay dont care. Zero buyer and customer protection. Loosing money in both cases.",1
1568,"Simple, effective and easy search engine",5

1591,Fenomenal,5
1592,Very good,5
1593,"Annoyed they removed the filter/sort lock option. No identifiable reason to why they removed this feature. It wasn't malfunctioning or losing them money, it was just a very nice feature which made searching easier, now if I need to rephrase my search or find an additional item I need to reselect the cleared filter/sort options every time. Wish they told you this suff before you updated. Also they don't monitor scams and false claims at all. Tech stats, pseudoscience, etc. Do your own research.",2

1602,once again ebay do a wicked job of updating the way you log in DONT WORK usless just why fix something that's not broken online is fast becoming a joke,1
1603,"Ebay has really gone downhill. Now, you cant make an offer on a listing without requiring instant payment. I HATE auto payments, I often need to move money around or put payments in different accounts. Bring back the way Best Offers have worked since the beginning of time!!! Now, I cant even make or review offers at all, I get an error that my app is out of date and needs to update, but I come here to update, and it is already most recent version.FIX THINGS, TEST BETTER,AND STOP CHANGING STUFF!",1

1605,Just love it. ❤️,5
1606,WOW,5
1607,Always find a good reference point for purchasing things online with Ebay. Sounds like a weird review but 90% of the time they have someone selling what your looking for at the best price for the condition of what your looking for. Great customer service and buy back guarantee and fraud protection.,5

1620,I like it,5
1621,It's awesome,5
1622,Good site to sell things,5
1623,Scam company won't honor their motor vehicle money back guarantee. Ordered parts that didn't fit and eBay refused to pay return shipping and sided with scam sellers. Stay far away from this company since they don't abide by their own TOS Scammed me out of 300$ don't bother. App UI is garbage and constantly shoves ads and promotes junk.,1
1624,Very good service and delivery time,5
1625,"Amazing to be able to buy quality items from real people and small businesses who really put the extra effort in, cheap items from big business too if that's your thing",5

1637,Great app only problem is they changed the layout of the app and i have really tried to get my head round it but i just cannot Is there a way to revert? Because i genuinely cant do half my job on this app now,3
1638,"Always something that I need is bound to be on eBay, it's a cheap place with great items",5
1639,I love soft silky nighties and nightgowns and I find good quality on eBay.,5
1640,giving it 2 stars because no one comes close to ebay but I really dislike they have a new feature when you make an offer or auction if your offer is accepted than you automatically get charged which is not ok I loved it when I could choose when to pay if I don't want the item you should not be able to be forced to purchase product if I found It cheaper it is what is that's how the world works I don't have to purchase something because I offered,2
1641,Difficult site to navigate site.,5
1642,Looks great and easy to find what you're looking for. Good prices.,5
1643,Brilliant,5
1644,Simply love this app.,5
1645,8-24 Update: Cannot respond to counter offers (oops something went wrong error). Absolutely maddening. The more things change the more things stay the same. Forced updates to a worse experience. Not even surprised anymore. come to expect it. Still no ability to fully edit photos and no ability to use the advanced editor. Please stop making stupid additions to your app (Like default require immediate payments & prefilling shipping in description!).,1
1646,Best app for deal,5
1647,Really good to buy things on,5
1648,"Great ,easy to find what you are looking for. Nice to know ebay has your back with eBay money back",5

1654,Great app thanks,5
1655,Still one of the best,5
1656,"A good service, quality products with professional couriers.",4
1657,Guys don’t install this app or use there website. If your account got a permanent restrictions you guys can't delete that account and can't make a new account using linked Facebook or Google. And you guys can't even delete that account and create a new one with that email or linked accounts. You guys can't get the facilities. 'Don't install this app and don't use eBay's website.',1
1658,"Response from sellers could be better Looking at engine replacement. Sent a request for information on shipping cost, no response.",4
1659,Great when you are on the move but a little slow for closing bids,4
1660,Easy to find what you looking for and they behind everything,5
1661,Fast and easy to navigate,5
1662,Great app! easy to use! I'm new to putting listings on items that I purchased from thrift stores and the AI and easy user interface makes it very easy for me to get started! I'm having a great time! I'll let you know when I sell something!,5

1664,Shop here sometimes it is good,5
1665,Ebay all the way.,5
1666,Easy to use. I like it.,5
1667,"I wasn't covered by eBay buyer protection on a faulty £400 car infotainment system I bought just because I previously accepted a refund for the postage. Customer service (a woman called Denise) was dismissive, unhelpful and rude. Had a terrible 'not my problem' kind of attitude that makes you wonder how she got a customer service job in the first place. I won't be buying anymore high value items on eBay, and I wouldn't recommend anybody does either.",1
1668,I love it and I can find wherever I need for my car at great price 😁,5
1669,Very good thing is ebay gets all the bargains and saves a ton. Ebay was supposed to be a dating site but I am glad it didn't materialise.,5
1670,"Vert pleased. With the Ebay, Got almost everything I need. 🙏👌",5
1671,Fantastic,5
1672,Excellent,5
1673,Great,5
1674,At least you don't have to wait long for a delivery,5
1675,Suspended my account less than ten minutes old for no reason then permanently deactivated it and gave no explanation for their actions so I won't be using ebay any longer for my company or myself.,1
1676,"I like the free postage on slot of items, and the customer service is very good.",5
1677,Just helpful,5
1678,Good,5
1679,Professional service,4
1680,The app works very well,5
1681,"This app seems to be working much better than ever before. I thank you for that! I have a suggestion for a future update add-on. Display the seller's name on the watchlist page for each item being watched. As of now, I have multiple auctions from multiple sellers. Who's auctions are they? When bidding on items, it's beneficial to purchase multiple actions from one seller, so one plays less for shipping. There is no way to see whose auctions they are unless one goes into each auction and checks.",4
1682,"eBay is not like what it used to be and has fallen of dramatically. Nowadays eBay are far more controlling with your listings, money and even the way you can sell and what you can sell. I would not recommend them and instead just use Facebook marketplace or other Trusted Selling platforms as currently I am facing issues with eBay where I have sent the buyer a product they did not complain and have the product in hand however eBay still chooses not to pay me for a dodgy and sub par reason.",1
1683,Seems to be improving every year.,5
1684,Easy to follow,5
1685,❤️💗😌🎀👼🏿,5
1686,Easy to use,4
1687,Help alot,5
1688,Very few technical issues with this app and I've been using it for some years now. I feel like it's well optimised; the user interface of the eBay app feels very comfortable and easy to use. Would recommend it to your granny,5
1689,So easy to shop!,5
1690,Thank you!🥰,5
1691,So far so good thanks eBay.,5

1696,Can't access my account anymore,1
1697,VERY HELPFUL PLACE TO SHOP.,5
1698,👍,5
1699,I have only made purchases and never sold. Ebay has banned me. I m really sure now... I had made only 2 purchases and never caused any breach. 1st was the parts for my Ducati and the second was AED 850 approx for a leather bike jacket and leather gloves. The seller was supposed to deliver this to me by 7th Aug and its the 22nd Aug now... Ebay has scammed me as they say i do not have buyer protection for my account is banned... People form Dubai... Think a 1000 times before using this fraud app,1
1700,Good service,5
1701,Brilliant for what you need,5
1702,"Little hard to find, I got 7 at once.Price reasonable, good delivery.",5

1704,Can't view item description,1
1705,I haven't been disappointed in anything I've bought on eBay yet. I've been using them over a year now. Still happy with the item's I bought off eBay,5
1706,I barely had the account open a week the permanently suspended me I call customer service they said they could tell me why they suspended me now I have to items I also want to return they can't because my account is suspended I'm not sure how to correct this with everything but it sucks,1
1707,Happy with ebay app . But I've been scam couple years ago £680 .Ebay could not be bothered to get my money back Till now. And same again happen to my older brother been scam from Ebay 7 years ago. For me personal I don't believe in guarantee money back from Ebay. Amazon 100% help full. They do more then enough for customer. Ebay good but I don't have trust them. I still give 5 stars BTW,5
1708,"It's a wonderful site,easy to find things that I'm looking for",5
1709,Great 👍,5
1710,"I have years now ebay, their response aman you have a problem is zero. And it takes a large share of your sale because at the end of the day some things aren't worth putting up for sale",1
1711,"Simple, easy to use",5
1712,Nothing to describe yet but I already can pretend that this function will be better then in the past,2
1713,My first stop of online shopping,5
1714,"Very good service & delivery, tracking updates....easy to use.",5
1715,"The app recently changed the search function, so that every search shows items related to any one of the words in the search. It no longer matters how specific your search query is. Most of the results are unrelated to what you actually searched for. Customer service is impossible to obtain. Seller fees have reached the point of being so ridiculously high that people are now referring to it as FeeBay. eBay is no longer my go to for buying and it's my last resort for selling.",2

1717,Great app,5
1718,"100% GARBAGE!!!!! EBAY IS NOW #1WORST THERE IS!!! SELLERS ARE LITERALLY TAKING TOTAL ADVANTAGE OF US NOW!!! AFTER IMMEDIATE PAYMENT WAS IMPLEMENTED?!?!

1720,Great products for a reasonable price ‼️,5
1721,"You have the option to make an offer on something that you like but may not like the price so you send an offer to see if they are interested in the price you have offered to pay,,, and that's something I really like about this thanks for all your help and options for doing business with others thanks murrey Mercer",5

1729,Great app for buying and selling.,5
1730,Great products offered. Feels like I'm at a yard sale in my living room. Sellers are becoming more unscrupulous and lie in review response often I've noticed. Shipping costs are downright shameful.,4
1731,Lot of good decent products.Add decent prizes,5
1732,I've Always Loved EBay will always shop on it. Thank You.,5

1738,"Easy to use and at your fingertips. Like American products, best place to look and find exactly what you want.",5
1739,Terrific!,5
1740,"The app works fine, but there are issues with the platform: 1. Bundled listings should be banned, sellers use them to make it impossible to sort by price 2. Recommended listings clutter up most of a page, which help paying advertisers obscure better value standard listings 3. Multipack and by weight listings should show and sort by standardised prices (per item, per kg). 4. We need a sort by shipping arrival date option for urgent items, eBay's big problem is lengthy delivery times vs prime.",2
1741,Great app never had any issues unlike many other apps!,5

1743,Ebay is am amazing shopping platform easy to use and transparent,5
1744,I really appreciate for ebay customer's support is very good. Thanks eBay,5
1745,Ebay fees are too high. $32 for selling something for $150 is ridiculous. Stay off this app. Offer up and mercari are way better. They don't rob you with hidden fees.,1
1746,Simple to use and shows various products you have asked to see and purchase.,5
1747,"Ebay use to be a place to get great deals, not anymore. sellers selling used cloths at msrp prices. Ebay has gone down hill and trust me you will lose A LOT OF MONEY shopping here getting scammed by sellers and Ebay will do nothing!!!

1754,"Ebay say 'it's not against their policy' when you report serious price gouging. Now LAST choice to shop/sell here due to this and the continual allowing of some sellers ignorance/discriminatory behaviour of blocking Scottish Highlands altogether including from basic Royal Mail postage use for small items where it doesn't cost any more than the rest of the mainland UK to post to or from. It's disgraceful, it shouldn't even be an option to allow this and there is often no easy way to report it.",2

Everything is spread out and I can't see everything on one screen. I now need to scroll down to see my seller summary and to-do's. They've made confusing changes that are unfriendly to both buyers and sellers. I'm worried eBay is being bought out.

1807,"Great app,however dont expect any help if you order something that doesn't arrive,ebay favours the seller rather than the buyer,ive found that any cases you open,expecting ebay to return your money are quickly closed by ebay before you have a chance to submit evidence in your favour,i recently opened a case where the seller had obviously sent at least two people the same tracking number,only to find out that my item had been sent to a different address with the different postcode,it's! shocking!",3

1830,"Was told by ebay I would get a refund for a faulty item. Contacted ebay 4 times and 5 months later still no refund. Don't honour their word, online crooks who don't care about their customers. And it was a refund from ebay not the seller so this is not a user error.",1

1836,"It's impossible to get a payout on your ""available funds"" after you sell something. There is no button/option anywhere on the site. If you set it for daily pay it just keeps changing the payout initiation date to tomorrow and thus tomorrow never comes. 19 years on ebay and I. Am. Done. Just Keep my $20. Bye bye!",1
1837,It help to be specific,5
1838,"I used to love selling on this app. However, you just can't edit listing anymore?????????? Which us a horrible design flaw. I have no idea why you'd even think to change this as it just makes it worse for every user. Buyers and sellers alike",2

1852,"It's perfect for second hand stuff that's great, and brand new stuff with Tags!",5
1853,Works great!!,5
1854,I have never ever had an issue within this App. More importantly Ebay is quick in dealing with possible Fraud.,5
1855,Everything you need you can find.. especially special rare items,5

1859,"Ebay is a thief!! I ordered two polo shirts but never received the parcels, and I made multiple complaints about it. Yodel says the item was delivered without producing any evidence of the delivery. Ebay favoured the seller as well as Yodel. The bank initially refunded me, but they told the bank not to refund me. Therefore, the bank took the refund back. They closed the case without I'm as a customer receive my parcels or my purchase money. Now, I'm left with no options but get police involved.",1

1865,"Convenience and easy way to use, reliable",5
1866,"I will NEVER shop from here ever again! They allow sellers to scam people and steal money from their buyers! I will be doing all of my shopping on Amazon from now on, at least Amazon actually cares about their customers and doesn't allow scammers & thieves. eBay is pathetic and so is their customer service. By far the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Someone sold me a broken laptop and eBay literally went out of their way to ensure that the scammer gets to scam me consequence free",1
1867,"Ebay used to be my favorite until Amazon prime came along , ebay should launch their own prime speedy service then see",5
1868,Great way to buy and sell,5

1871,"First timer, full of hope for a great result in time for my birthday in 2 months !!! I will send an honest review !!!",3
1872,I've used ebay all my adult life. It's a great source. I can often find things on the app that aren't avaliable anywhere else and there are always competitive offers on branded products. The only downside is the lack of accountability from sellers and support from ebay with issues. Many times I've purchased items that have ended up being fake/counterfeit and once I was scammed by a seller. On none of these occasions would ebay step in to support so I was left out of pocket.,4
1873,Good service,5
1874,Great app and eBay has everything!,5
1875,better then Amazon great prices not to out of pocket so many choices when i search for what im looking for,5

1886,Good to use,5
1887,"Ebay has decided I (a human, admitedly allegedly) am a bot and has banned me from signing in.... But I can still browse like any other human being, or bot, without signing in. What kind of useless security measure is this. I'M SIGNING IN ON THE APP, not a blocking browser, or browser without Java. I browse like a human too! Give me any recapture and I'd ACE it. I bet I'd ace any background recapture based on my app interaction too! Immature AI bot detection here.",1

1890,Camera app is great feature,5

1900,"(would have given 0 stars if there was an option)Should have stayed away from it for good, taking into consideration,all the previous bad experiences, customer service...the worst of all, eBay itself, should buy and return from either Wal-Mart or Amazon, so they could learn what A1 customer service is all about. Not buying a single penny worth item from this "" company"", I am done with them, this time is for good. Bought a couple of simple SD cards, seller took an eternity to get,never got them.",1
1901,new update cant load basket or items whats going on?,1

Oh, and buying car parts is also a great thing about good old EBAY! Recommended of course. Pretty sure it is an app that is already on your phone from the beginning. If it's not then it should be! I just wish I can win more bids! Lol",5

1932,loving it,5
1933,Great app,5
1934,11 mins i was selling. well done,5
1935,Ebay offers money back guarantee but refuses to help when my package was stolen. If you buy anything from this site you are taking a risk. I will never buy anything from this site again and encourage others not to either. They side 100% with seller no matter how much proof you have. Ebay has always been a scam.,1
1936,Brilliant alternative to Amazon,5
1937,Super easy to use and very safe transactions 😊,5
1938,The notifications have been duplicating (Showing twice) for quite some versions when I only need just ONE.,4

1954,"Generally good as an app, but when things go wrong the ai chatbot you're forced to use is useless. It infuriatingly goes round in loops without understanding the issue, and just provides irrelevant links that don't help.",3

1968,"Description of articles mostly spot on ,and lots of choices whatever ur after ,love ebay And bidding as well",5
1969,Absolutely hate the new layout of the homepage. Harder to see because everything is smaller to cram it all on the page. Just horrendous. Tried the new message style absolutely hate it leave it the way it is ther is nothing wrong with the classic message system the new chat style is god damn awful how do I switch it back to how it was,1
1970,Ebay is a great place to buy and sell items. The app is really easy to use.,5
1971,"Don't download this app, whenever I ordered something the wrong item was sent and in a very bad condition. When u tried to return thise items the steps were so confusing and didn't help at all. You can't return your items here and also if you want to the return address was always out of country. How are we supposed to do it. This app it the worst app.",1
1972,My only gripe is it takes one or more extra clicks to get a better description the item otherwise 👍,4
1973,So far it has been smooth. I have sold an item here on eBay and I have also bought some goods here as well. Keep going eBay.,5
1974,The best!,5
1975,Good app,5
1976,"All my messages and conversation history from sellers have disappeared. Unsave option for saved sellers doesn't work. Constantly getting feedback requests when there has been no time to decide on the quality of the product. Hate this app, so only doing Buy it Now purchases. Don't like that offers can be automatically agreed and immediately debited from the bank account with no option given to pay by PayPal spreading payments over time. Use desktop pc for anything important. Horrible app.",1
1977,I find the e-bay app very useful.,5
1978,Great app easy to use and very professional,5
1979,Good,5
1980,eBay does just as promised they guarantee your purchase. They are good about getting in touch with the sellers if something is wrong and the sellers do not correct the problem. Only one time did it take 6 months to get a refund but I did get it. I like shopping through eBay.,5

I'm writing this review at 2am as I've just been notified of a discount code for vacuum cleaners! I don't want to turn notifications off as I will miss things but I'm at work at 5am.

2037,Sound,5
2038,This selling app has become a scam. I would not buy anything off of here it's a joke. My package never got delivered to my address the seller said it was my problem and then contact ebay and they gave me the run around I'll never use there service again,1
2039,Everything has been what i wanted. Great ship time,5
2040,The app works great super easy to use have been using it for years absolutely love it,5

2043,Great,5
2044,Excellent and thank you 😊,5
2045,The app has become more user-friendly and convenient. Almost no need for desktop unless you need to print a receipt. Photo search needs improvements.,5

You can buy almost anything you desire on this app, and on the off chance something doesn't go to plan, all you have to do is contact Ebay, and they help you sort the problem out.

2049,"hi, I love the app but I always miss auctions because I only get notifications for upto 10 minutes after I close the app, can you please do an update that gives me the option to set an alarm on my phone to go off 15 minutes before the end of the auction as well as a notification off the app so if the app doesn't notify me then my phones alarm will, eBay will make more money if less people miss things because they haven't been notified so it works out better for everyone, thanks",3
2050,Brilliant app,5
2051,Great app to start a small business.,5
2052,Good,5
2053,"It's a very convenient platform for this kind of shopping. I only wish it was more safe, more anti-scammers",5
2054,Graet,5
2055,I personally think that all orders should have a tracking number.national and international orders. When bidding all bidders should receive notification of the last amount on the items before the bidding ends.,4
2056,Good I like it very professional,5
2057,Great,5
2058,Always top notch,5
2059,I now remember why I stopped using EBay. The number of errors committed by sellers is mind numbing or the sellers are coming out of China (basically no way to return cheap product no one wood want) or there is something else wrong with the product.,1

2080,"Would rate 0 if I could. new SCAM that eBay allows. Watch out. I TRIED to explain they need to call PO as sellers are now STEALING tracking #'s. So, the trscking# shows it was delivered. ONLY way to tell is to CALL the PO and give tracking #. eBay REFUSES to call and DENIED my claim and appeal. I even ASKED eBay what they NEED from PO to prove I didn't get the item? Again no explanation just DENIED, DENIED, DENIED.",1

2088,It is easy to find what you're looking for and the prices are good. The sellers are easy to deal with as well.,5
2089,It's just so easy and hassle fee to buy. You get notified when your item has been posted and notified when it is delivered. The only thing that puts me off is so many sellers do not do returns which stops me from buying their items.,5
2090,Very happy customer 😀,5
2091,"Technical errors, not working at all. Tried uninstalling it. Still same issues",1
2092,You can find almost anything here. Especially old CDs that have been out of print for decades.,5
2093,Easy to find almost anything I look for,5

2114,Great,5
2115,Always been weary of buying things online and took the leap with eBay after I read some of the T&C's and they have quite good policies so I am now a regular on their app.,5

2153,Wish that I made more $$ !,5
2154,Works great,5
2155,One of the easiest Apps to use. Ebay makes buying (or Selling) very easy. They back all sellers items (should there be an issue). I have had a few issues and Ebay made it easy to work with the seller and correct the problem with out any trouble. I highly recommend this App for both buyers and sellers.,5
2156,Easy,5
2157,I like using PayPal for security.,4
2158,"Ebay remains the same cesspool of unprofessional sellers and questionable business practices it has always been. A horrendous flea market of missing items, damaged items, incorrect items, a hit and miss checkout system, uncommunicative sellers, crazy fees - you name it; it's here. Ebay's masterstrokes are normalising disgraceful service and over stating unremarkable service . Avoid Ebay wherever possible and stick to Facebook marketplace if you're desperate for a bargain.",1
2159,I have been using Ebay for 25 years. With one minor problem very early o the service has been very good.,4
2160,Good service,4

2169,Very nice,5
2170,"Still getting used to it on my phone, but seems simple and quick.",5
2171,I don't know what's going on with the app but the user experience is awful. Couldn't buy something on the platform today because it wouldn't give me payment options. Glad more people are selling stuff on vinted 👍🏻,1

2185,"A really good app. Does pretty much all that you would expect to a great standard. As with anything which involves typing, the desktop version is faster and more user-friendly. But for buying it's perfect, once you learn how to skim past the fifth-rate AI descriptions. I recommend it, but avoid the AI, which in this case, stands for 'Annoying Irritation'. Or 'Annoyingly Irrelevant'.",5

2207,Nice,5
2208,"The fees are absolutely absurd. If the buyer is even REGISTERED out of country, they'll charge a giant fee, even if it's being shipped in the US. The default fee they steal from you is >12%. Stay away from this garbage service, you do not need them to sell your stuff. I promise that anything is better than dealing with this fkn trash app. I hope somebody gets caught laundering money or drugs on the app so it can all be shut down.",1
2209,Love ebay. Good deals,5
2210,Easy and convenient.,5
2211,"Great app! One of my favorite shopping platforms! Where you can find, the hard to find items you're looking for. But you have to stay persistent! There are millions of items out there and you may not find what you're looking for on the first or second try. It may even take months, but you will eventually find the one person selling exactly what you want! So before you give up searching... I would highly recommend eBay to anyone! Hope this helps!",5

2242,There are a crazy amount of counterfeit electronics! After the 1st one is sold &the buyer rates the seller stating that it's counterfeit ebay should take that listing down! There is a ton of counterfeit complaints for each seller & the listing stays up?! I just purchased jbl earbuds thinking ok there is no complaints about them being fake but then I see one review in another language & I translated it sure enough they are saying they are fake so I immediately tried 2 cancel but won't allow me to,1

2263,items recently and both buyers filing for returns on the two items both claiming they were unclean and damaged which was not the case when I packaged and sent them out.    With the first Ebay refunded the first buyer with no cost to either of us and he left negative feedback.

2272,Easiest app to buy and sell on,5
2273,Very good and satisfying,5
2274,I'm sick of dealing with dodgy sellers. And the option to exclude them using filters is not user friendly ... give us (the buyers) the option to either block sellers. Or have flagged seller content visibly different from everyone else ... and on that note. Colour flagging sellers you follow would be a great idea. Would be good to see a seller you trust have their products highlighted some way (could have a green colour for good sellers and red for bad. Another colour for ones you've used b4,1

2299,"It's a good place to shop long distance, but this year, in 2024, they started letting the CHINESE SELLERS, with products shipped from outside the U.S., take advantage, of Americans, by not sending the product, and stealing our money. Then we have to go through loopholes and hurdles, to try, to get a refund and sometimes you don't get it. They are doing this so much, that one seller had about 200 people, before I stopped scrolling, that all said there item, either never arrived, or eBay refunded.",2

2301,The app definitely improved a lot more. It's smoother than before hopefully continues to improve making everything a lot easier to understand.,5
2302,Very good,5
2303,Very easy to use,5
2304,There is no customer support or refunds unlike what is advertised. It's all up to the seller and why would they message back for anything after they got their money,1
2305,I will never use this app again. I sold something for $75 and I know I input the correct banking information yet somehow what they had was NOT my account. eBay sent the money to that account. Bank of America said no such account existed in their system. eBay customer service told me the payment would bounce back to eBay and then they'd send it to the correct account. THAT NEVER HAPPENED. And no one could ever explain why. Thanks for nothing eBay.,1

2336,"After 25 Years of buying and selling on eBay I'm done. They're now trying to push me to PayPal instead of excepting American Express. The reason I won't use PayPal is because there is no guarantee for purchases or fraudulent purchases. Anytime I've had a dispute over a product eBay and PayPal have always sided with the seller no matter how obvious it's misrepresented product quality. Bye eBay, good luck not being competitive",1
2337,Very user friendly and backed by ebay superior customer service. Customer service where you get to talk to a live person who actually cares about whatever question or issue you have.,5

2365,Very good thanks,5
2366,Serves its purpose when using.,4
2367,I love ebay I use it often for great deals and also selling stuff,5
2368,Having to provide payment upfront before being able to bid or also anything anymore is a terrible experience and makes me want to bid less on things. All these pay upfront before I even win the item are dead in the water for me. I will not be using ebay unless this return back to how it was before.,1
2369,I opened a business account and spent much time to build it. But at the end they closed it without clearifying the reason. I really didn't go against their policy. I just needed to change my billing and bank info some several times 🤷‍♂️. 👎👎👎,1

2392,Excellent,5
2393,Excellent . I keep getting a message on my phone when I get offers items that I am interested in. The message says that my eBay app is out of date yet there is no new updates for it.,5
2394,Uses your checking account when you pick option to pay otherwise. This has cost me dearly. No live support and only deal with stupid automated responses. Cancellingbmy account after 9 years.,1
2395,EBay is letting us get scammed by their people they are sending out fake pictures of deliveries and they are not the right picture for the delivery or the address is not even right on the picture eBay you need to do your job. Get them scammers off your platform.,1

2398,Working well,5
2399,good price,5
2400,Reliable,5
2401,Generally good app. It has one very annoying quirk: On some listings when clicking on item description you get a tiny window. You need to pan left/right/up/down. Why not open a big window so it can be read humanely? Happy to help developers is the above is not clear enough,4
2402,Easy to do both transactions buy and sell no better site than EBAY,5

2449,Easy to use.,5
2450,"Great app, seems to be better optimized for phones than my PC!",5
2451,Sellers!: Do yourself a favor and stay away from ebay. They will randomly hold your funds until delivery has been confirmed and you won't have access to your money! It's absolutely ridiculous how they treat their sellers now! I've been a member in good standing for over 23 years and have sold well over 300 items successfully yet even contacting customer service does absolutely nothing to gain access to your money. I have an estimated wait time of 15 days until it's even released to my bank!,1
2452,pretty good app.,5
2453,It is the first place I look when I need anything car related or technology. However when I am trying to place an advert - it isn't always so easy to navigate the website to place an advert and the headings are too keen to make suggestions that are not pertinent to what I want to say about what I am selling. I am the best judge of what I am selling. I have had 74 years to hone my skills. 😁,4
2454,Long gone the good days of eBay. For a buyer and especially for a seller. Takes way too long to receive the payment after a sell. I get paid right away on OfferUp and LetGo. EBay is dinosaur of e-commerce sites that just keeps getting worse,2
2455,Nice,5
2456,Very easy to follow and understand.,5

I now feel more secure shopping on ebay!",5
2472,worst app in the world for sellers man i might end it all,1
2473,cant view past month items,5
2474,Worst place to sell items. Ebay charged me $414 for an item I never ended up selling.i never received any money But I still had to pay. They are a bunch of scamming theifs. It also takes an hour and jumping through a bunch of hoops to talk to a human. It's absolutely a disgrace and a horrible application to use.,1
2475,Great place to shop,5
2476,Great shopping app. You literally can find anything at a good price.,5
2477,K I can do that for your,5
2478,"Starting selling on eBay only a few months ago. You DO NOT have to have an impressive sellers page or experience in sales to earn a decent return on this platform. Considering getting ""ebay"" tattooed on my body somewhere (not kidding).",5
2479,Great!,5
2480,"Set up an account to buy and had my account suspended permanently 2 days later for absolutely no reason that i can think of and can't find out why because ebay do not disclose why they suspend people , I hadn't even had a chance to buy anything I am baffled by the whole thing , thanks ebay guess I'll have to use one of your competitors awful platform and would never recommend",1

2512,Awsome,5
2513,"Recently app has been updated and taking photos has become a pain, constantly giving errors, so I have to take pictures before doing an advert and then import them at the appropriate time. I have a modern Samsung, so it's not the phone, it's a case of not trying to fix an app that isn't broken and introducing new bugs.",1
2514,Very good for finding things thank you,5
2515,Is there no option for zoro star? this people are very frustrating and disappointing. My account was temporarily deactivate for no reason. I hate you ebay..,1

2519,what's with this buggy update? you can't take photos without it crashing. so many options are missing. I used to love using eBay app but this is a total nightmare to use.,1
2520,I used Ebay for over 10 years but their app is a nightmare to deal with. They also increased their fee and you barely have good customer service anymore!,1
2521,"Aiding and abeiting scammers, used to be a place that was worth going but no longer",1
2522,Selling can be fun!,5
2523,"These reviews, much like eBay seller reviews, are artificially enhanced. Beware: eBay no longer protects their buyers and predatory sellers are running rampant because they know this. I hope there's a class action lawsuit soon. Do not trust eBay, they've left all the buyer support to their incompetent a.i. so you get zero help with anything!",1
2524,The login no longer works for more than one week!,1
2525,Works great,5
2526,"Unless you like being scammed out of money, don't use ebay. Sellers with pricey items are targeted by overseas scammers who ship to warehouses and bin stores. They then claim your item never made it or is defective and forces you to accept return. It's a lengthy process to try to get your money! Just avoid this site completely!!",1
2527,"Unübersichtlich, teilweise fehlende Funktionen, welche jedoch eine Fehlermeldung bei Bearbeitung bestehender Angebote erzeugen. Insbesondere der Mindestbetrag für Preisvorschläge ist damit gemeint!

2538,Works as intended,5
2539,"I'm a reg. User of ebay(daily) new version showed up today. And they took away the option to save searches.

2566,Awesome!!,5
2567,The fact I can't change a tracking number as a seller on the app and can only do so on a computer is insane. Some of us don't have computers. But okay.,1

Has always been a bit patchy due to them pushing sponsored listings to the detriment of accurate search results, but since the last update if I search for something rare it changes the search results to something common and if I filter by price it removes the original search results...",1
2584,"eBay is trash now. Poor customer service is driving people away, and I can't agree more. There's a reason that eBay and PayPal are worth half what they were 2 years ago, and that's because the other retailers service is far superior. I won't use eBay ever again. No interest in providing good customer service. My prediction is bankruptcy for both eBay and PayPal before 2027. use at your own risk.",1
2585,Works perfectly. Haven't had a single issue. This app has helped me through tough times. There's always great deals to found. And selling household items in a crunch is crucial. The app hasn't let me down once.,5

2614,"Quick, stable, and pleasant to use.",5
2615,Brilliant,5
2616,Vendors often require signatures for orders. This is NOT disclosed at the time of purchase. I would just rather buy locally than have to drive to FedEx to pickup a package.,2

2631,"The peoplenon it rip you off dont send oackages. Then, customer service caters to the seller. And makes youbwait for a refund. This is the worst company I've ever had to deal with. Cater to the person selling instead of those buying. Caus3 the ones buying are qhar is making you scumbags a profit.",1
2632,Always good products at good prices. Have yet to not find what I needed. Reasonable shipping time. Really never any problems.,5
2633,"Enough with the notifications from the app. If I was interested in an item I'd be watching it. If I only viewed it I dont need to know more about it but there's no granularity between viewed items & watched items. Surely a deliberate, cynical choice by eBay because they give no **** about their customers. Also, I am OK rating the transaction but now the seller stuff is optional & I can't leave seller feedback without rating the item itself. EBay is now so desperate for feedback it's embarassing.",1
2634,One of the best online apps but it will be perfect if they let buyers out there reviews pics and videos for the items,5
2635,So far itz pulling me through,5

2637,"Great site for buying and selling, fast web page and checkout.",5
2638,"You used to be able to swipe away notifications. Which nimrod decided it'd be a good idea to add an extra 2 steps to that?? The same nimrod who took away the ability to lock the search results to UK only. Updates should make an app better, not considerably worse.",1

2641,"It's a great app, I've bought loads of stuff on it, would definitely recommend.",5
2642,"Ebay is excellent, always has been..",5
2643,EBAY went from a really good place to sell your stuff to the worst. I've been with eBay for over 10 years with a 100% seller satisfaction and because I was out of an item I asked the buyer if it was ok to cancel and they said sure. Well that is not ok with eBay and they immediately put my account to below standard level and because of that your listings sit at the bottom of the list and you stop selling. NOONE at eBay is able to help so I'm shutting down and moving to Mercari.,1
2644,Very goo,4
2645,"97percent out of a hundred with most sellers being honest and helpful wit the eBay backed money back guarantee which helped me out with a rogue seller from Russia with a watch which turned out to be a bit of pipe, contacted eBay straight away and they sorted it out excellent,English rouge used archive pictures and ripped me off ,Greek seller yamahafj1200 petrol tank with dents on the top and with careful picture angles hid them from buyers, have enjoyed buying from eBay",5

2766,Invalid Request. The entire app is an invalid Request lol. Technical difficulties now lol,1
2767,"Ebay is great! The design of the app could be updated, but overall it's a really good app.",5
2768,"I'm having a nice time 🙆 Wow! I'm Not tech smart enough for me to pick up things going on with the app 😕🫤? But, this site/app? My daughter is here nodding her head with agreement that this site has my o`ko`lei It's a safe place to be 🤷! I'm finding out about eBay and I lost Out, on alot of DVDs! It's inexpensive , brand New, and you'll find more than any other places. I personally didn't know that They have other items that I could of gotten from them all along 🤦. Mahalo eBay, from Honolulu",5
2769,Sometimes the security issues make unconfotable after changing the phone but everything is fine... Great and secure...,4
2770,"I like this app, Is so easy to use very intuitivey",5
2771,Great app,5
2772,"Easy! Not sure that it's a good thing that eBay has made it so easy to spend my money, but it is very nice to have the app.",5
2773,Great,4
2774,Delivery by 17 or 18 please,5
2775,Have to be careful but it's a treasure trove. Mostly cheaper than Amazon. 👍,4
2776,Great,5
2777,Why keep messing about with stuff. It gets harder to keep loading,1
2778,Great service and products.,5
2779,So far the app has been helpful but it would be nice if we can get to buy things from around the world and also if we could get things from African e.g Nigeria.,3
2780,"Used to be good, full of scammers and Chinese people shipping from overseas lying about being in the US now. And if you don't have access to a printer to print out a return label, you are out of luck! eBay will eat up all your cash!",1
2781,Always VERY useful 😃,5
2782,"eBay is a great platform for finding anything from car parts to birthday gifts, especially when we live in a fairly rural environment and don't have a fully functioning High Street on our doorstep. Delivery services have improved greatly over my time as a customer and it's good to have an alternative to Amazon. The site is easy to use and the one time I did have an issue with a delivery the refund came swiftly and without any hassle. Happy customer.",5
2783,Well the developers of the app have broken the search filter options making exceptionally difficult to find items you are looking for. They have also broken the categories. The app is aproching becoming next to useless.,1
2784,"Very user friendly,",5
2785,"Everything you can dream to buy is at your fingertips!!! Never an issue.. I purchase parts on a weekly basis! Great app!! After years of use still no issues, ebay for the win!!",5
2786,awesome,5
2787,"Fun to look for special items, old and new.",5
2788,"Quit bothering me, asking me over and over if I like games I bought. It doesn't matter. Shut up and quick, recommending everything I look at it's annoying",1
2789,"I love eBay app, very exciting to navigate!",5
2790,EPIC no I don't have to build a building just to sell you something now....,5
2791,Just great,5
2792,"This app with the company are scammers, all good till I needed the help of them, for the past 2 months I was trying to get the money back all I can hear ""you will get your moeny within the next 3 to 5 business days, you won the case ...."" AND NOTHING happens after this is an app that I used for over 10 years with no issue with the sellers BUT we I needed the help of the app and the company they gave me the run around without being even able to talk to a supervisor this is a fraud ..",1

2801,Always EBay gave me wonderful service. I am happy and so confident whenever I am buying things on eBay.,5

2803,Always reliable.,5
2804,Some of the items don't go deeper enough,4
2805,Easy shopping,5
2806,I love it,5
2807,"The app is well thought out and very easy to use. All the necessary steps for setting up, processing sales (including postage), payment processing, etc. are simple and clear...and the fact that private setting up and selling is currently free of charge gives it an extra star. 👌🏼😊",5
2808,I ordered a product that I did not get I received a screw I asked for my refund I sent the product back with tracking I have not received my $59.99 back do not trust eBay,1
2809,"Don't use if possible, if you are a seller you have no chance against scammers who open payment disputes. You will lose what you sold, obviously have to pay a refund, then another charge on top if you challenge it and lose. Avoid.",1
2810,Great app love it been a member of eBay since the beginning wish you could still add your bank account not just debit or credit card good you can use after pay and other payment service's but you used to be able to jump and pay for an biding item and when you won hahaha you used to be able to pay right away with your bank account even if low on funds and when you got paid you could clear debt or over draw what I'm saying used to give you time till pay day hahahaha should bring back that option.,4
2811,Brilliant.,5
2812,"Very well designed, works great",5
2813,"The app works just fine, but the company has made it impossible for me to resolve an ongoing issue. They limit you to automated customer services and make it so you can't speak to a human being. My money has been frozen in the app for nearly two months and there is no end in sight.",1
2814,"Push notifications mostly don't work anymore, causing me to miss out on ending auctions, be slow responding to offers, etc. also all the usual eBay stuff with their making sellers wait 7 days to address a claim then deciding it in the buyers favor in approximately 7 seconds, and ignorant CS reps that should probably just be replaced by AI.",1
2815,No C🥰mments 2024,5
2816,"So wonderful , really love it , amazing and more than five star",5
2817,Good,5
2818,"Better than TEMU, anyday. Just a pity GooglePay doesnt send out invoices to email. AND! NECTAR Points are being discontinued. 😭",2

2824,Always works and always has what I need to find,5

2833,Good and excellent il like it 💯,5
2834,Exceptionally good,5
2835,"Seller accepts PayPal, but app will not give the option for PayPal. Needed to try and purchase on a PC to get that option. Disgraceful.",1
2836,"Generally a good place to get stuff, but I don't like sponsored items and clearly just stores advertising.",4
2837,Great app to have . Always worth a look,4
2838,Great,5
2839,"Everything it should be,one note to sellers and buyers ,only pay or receive payment through the app so the insurance is valid",5
2840,"What is happening here, are old accounts being hacked? Suddenly accounts with good previous ratings seem to be doing shady purchases, and not paying after buying, offering to buy outside of eBay. As a seller, I am feeling less confident to sell expensive items on eBay, and doubting that eBay will protect me against scams from buyers. The average selling price has also reduced it feels, seems like people have also lost interest/ confidence in buying on ebay. @eBay: take these issues seriously",2
2841,It's eBay. 👍Enough said..,5
2842,"Easy to use no problems at all. Any issues I had which are very rare ,were solved quickly with no stress . Great app.",5
2843,"I am so broke and yet I yearn for things that aren't exactly sold where I am, I got a really nice mp3 player off this place, shipped fast and easy to use, can't wait to see if I can get more stuff off here like comic books and CDs, I miss when this stuff was readily sold in stores a little more",5
2844,"The new update puts the save search button where the old filter button was, which is just dumb. I am so used to hitting the filter button that I'm unintentionally subscribing to searchs I don't want to. Please move this subscription button, you're making the Ebay experience frustrating.",2
2845,Fast purchases,5
2846,Nice and convenient and check the items thoroughly so the consumer doesn't get taken advantage....,5
2847,Great app. I use it everyday.,5
2848,Immediately blocked after the account creation and I had to fight the chatbot to find a way to contact real customer support. And now they don't even offer to me to clarify this and restore my account. Dystopian experience.,1

2853,Works well !!!,5

2855,"Used to like Ebay. But they are getting greedy now and the fees are out of order. Listed an item for free, no upgrades or extras on the listing. Got charged just shy of £5 on a £30 sale. Need a similar app that doesnt spank you on charges",1

It's helped me my whole life, from finding foreign parts to fix my scooter in Italy so I was able to get back and forth from work, All the way to selling some of my more expensive sneakers to an Extreme collector in Texas. Ebays been with me my whole adult life Thanks Ebay !",5

2890,Airways good service!,5
2891,Great,5
2892,Muy buena,5
2893,"Possibly the rudest customer service representatives as a whole I've ever dealt with. Aggressive, won't give their name or transfer you a level up. Seems like they have been trained to do this. If there is any other option for you to sell your products on, I would recommend it. Overall, eBay only cares about the buyers. Very sad.",2
2894,eBay is just the best,5
2895,Excellent!,5
2896,Like the ease of it being so easy to search and find what I looking for.,5

2906,good...,4
2907,Easy to use and simple!,5
2908,Unfortunately they pushing people to change private selling account to business one which cost much more. They changed already fees for higher. Start selling on ebuygumm instead here where ypu don't pay a fees. Really recomended. It is time to end greedy ebay!,1
2909,"Been here for years. Both made and spent a lot here. Very happy all in all. No app is perfect, but eBay does a good job. Still the world's biggest window.",5
2910,Works as it should,5
2911,Stupid app,1

If yes please tell me how do I do it.",4

2921,These guys are #1!,5
2922,Good enough,4
2923,This is a great app so far,5
2924,Awesome great deals,5
2925,Not recommended the seller control everything and the smallest things like cancel an order you can't do it like amazon easy ots difficult and the eBay support is baaad not helpful... Amazon is waaaay better,1
2926,It is not working,1
2927,Sometimes sellers have their fitment for car parts listed wrong. Love ebay though.,4
2928,mega. Revamps are great . So easy to use and versatile too suiting multivarious needs,5
2929,Was good now AI is involved for no reason and I can't turn it off. AI does solve any problems nor is it useful. They just placed it there so they can say it's there. Which would be fine if there was a setting to turn it off. Till then ONE STAR ONLY,1
2930,"Awful experience. After using eBay for over 15 years with very few problems, I have now closed my account due to excessive scamming that goes happens on a regular basis. Been scammed and left out of pocket of over a hundred pounds and no help from eBay. I have closed my account and can only recommend people use Vinted instead. I have started to use Vinted and it's always a pleasant experience and best value for money . eBay is shocking and has stressed me in a number of ways. I'M OUT!",1
2931,reliable,5
2932,"Ebay is a horrible company, especially compared to Amazon and should only be used when you absolutely can't find an item anywhere else. They're ebay guarantee sucks and they have on multiple occasions done nothing when they're supposed to step in and have your back when you get ripped off by one of their many fraudulent sellers. I've had sellers totally rip me off and never send the item I paid for. When you contact Ebay, they'll let it expire, close it out, and ultimately do nothing for you.",1
2933,Much easier to use,5
2934,If your looking for hard to find items at a good price is great only thing that sucks customer service has dropped a lot the old day a live agent now to much with a bot I would recommend you looking at the feedbacks and how long a sales person has been there but all in all there good this is why 2 stars ebay get it right again pandemic is not as bad get your agents all back !!,2
2935,Easy to use,5
2936,Have been a fan of ebay for over 20 years! LOVE IT!,5
2937,Great platform where you get varieties of electronics.,4
2938,It's okay I wish I got a better deal cuz I buy lots of stuff,3
2939,Best app. For me. I love it.,5
2940,Great app,5
2941,Great!,5
2942,I would love to give them o they take so long to deliver your items three to four wks just Bec it's free postage. I'm really done with them b this time I have ordered one pair of guitar 3weeks ago 3 weeks ago p I'm ordered a water pump 2 wks ago one none of them has arrived so don't be caught by their free postage because it comes at a very high price there's a weight of a month ot more.. it's ridiculous and you can't even contact me oh goodbye ebay!!!,1
2943,Good shopping experience with ebay,5
2944,confusing,3
2945,Good app bra,5
2946,Great,5
2947,"The app no longer has the option to promote listings, which means no sales are coming through. As a seller you also have to manually remove the background of each photo on a listing, which means if you've taken 24 photos, you need to click in and out and edit each one. Very time consuming, and disappointing considering there is AI technology to easily resolve this. No help for sellers to receive more sales, ebay relies upon sellers accepting cheap offers. Given this, ebay fees are extortionate!!",1
2948,"Terrible customer service. They have it set up so that you cannot talk to any representative, only the robot agent. It is extremely frustrating because they will say that you can talk to a live agent and then endlessly redirect you by saying that your problem can easily be fixed by the robot, when it can't!!! They will not talk a call, they have no customer support email. Awful.",1
2949,"Very bad can't find what I wanted, eBay suspended my account then charged me I'm finding it very hard and stressful trying to fix it. So disappointed with ebay",1
2950,"Works great. I find what I am looking for. Months later: Still does a great job, and easy to use and track shipments.",5
2951,Great,4
2952,"Terrible. From a £150 sale, i got charged 35£ in fees. + Despite the buyer paying for delivery , i somehow had to also pay for buying a label. Greedy ba*&#£ds . I can't sell my property with so high fees. No one dumb enough to loose that kind of money .",1
2953,I love wishlisting items for a better time.,5
2954,"Very good App, Still enjoying eBay after 20 + years !",5
2955,My last 5 orders were counterfeits and I had to pay £3.35 postage per item to return them!!! I will never use eBay again. At least on other websites you can read product reviews instead of playing russian roulette with eBay. Also if your item is never sent to you it's a massive hurdle to get a refund done. This app should be removed from the play store it's just a scam.,1
2956,Bit of a joke when an item is listed as $3-21 dollars and the actual item is $21 but the $3 item is a cleaning cloth... This sort of deception is rampant,2
2957,I give 2 thumbs up for eBay and 5 Stars,5
2958,Dont buy here its a scam i bought 2 things and did not get it and they wont refund or respond to me. Absolutely bad service and security. If i could id give 0 stars to save ppl from buying from you,1
2959,Excellent,5
2960,Good,5
2961,Restricted my new account - refuses to elaborate. Thanks guys :),1
2962,Not a great app for sellers as it doesn't handle having multiple seller accounts.,3
2963,Great app. Easy to use and issues almost always get sorted so both parties are happy. A+,5
2964,Excellent,5
2965,"Literally unusable now. Where's half the categories gone? You click motors and all you get are car parts, can't find the actual cars category, same with a lot of other categories. Why did you change it? It was perfect having all the categories in the ""My Ebay"" section.",1
2966,Great 👍🏻,5
2967,I was a seller and we are not protected when it comes with return and buyer had issues with order and I made return ship back the item. And they item never came to my house it was expecting it to be delivered it my house but they returned it to sender and the buyer got back the item. I refunded him and I lost my own item.,1
2968,Crippling bugs and misfires. A pity.,1
2969,"When eBay make product reviews optional I'll gladly leave seller feedback again, but on the app, at time of writing, even though it says 'optional' re reviews, it really isn't - bc app will not allow you to submit just seller feedback. And then they dare to message you saying to leave seller feedback and how important it is. Fix your app or zip it",2
2970,It is good,5
2971,"It's pretty good at staying out of the way and doing what it's supposed to, no real issues",5
2972,Well recognised friendly app,5

2978,Very genuine shopping app,5
2979,The last update broke the app. Now when you click on a picture in a listing to get a larger image it crashes. Worked perfectly before for me.,1
2980,Awesome app,5
2981,Eandefol,5
2982,"I like ebay ok. It's expensive to use for selling vehicles. You are set for National and International buyers though, so it does work. I will use it for more speciality vehicles. Thanks . Rob P.",4
2983,Same suggestions for the last 5 months,1
2984,Good app,5
2985,as sad as this is going to sound I'm fairly new to eBay but I love this app it's the only place I buy anything off the internet from,5

3023,Love the prices,5
3024,"More than once I've had issues with getting my orders. Ebay always refunded when I asked. But when i need the item and it was a bargain, and I felt good about having been smart enough to wait patiently through it being delayed more than once,putting it in Papa God's hands. I thought it would come. Especially since this has happened several times through the years with Ebay. I and a friend even prayed about it in Jesus name. We were in agreement. And twice he was waiting on a package and I",2

3043,"Delivery on time and safe,they ring.nothing more.",4
3044,"As or more reliable than any other app I've used. Whether I search for hours or just a few minutes before buying I never have any issues. Easy to use, free of dumb problems, and loaded with options & tools.",5
3045,"Just having trouble with taking pictures when listing it errors, when me phone is held in landscape the camera viewer is so small it's unusable and all the pictures are square",1
3046,App told me I was logging in on another device when I've only ever logged in on my phone. Then refused to let me log into the app because of that and locked me on a screen that told me to call a phone number that didn't work.,1
3047,Absolute con now. Makes buyers pay postage fee and Makes seller pay for postage by withholding and saying it's correct. Jokers. Never selling again.. sell for 28 quid and post for 3.39 postage. Only get 23 quid. So iv earned 20 pound something pence after everything. No thanks.,1
3048,good.,5
3049,"Worst selling platform around. Don't waste your time or money with this scam service. You sell something, they take 15% and they hold your money illegally from you for a month even after 7 years of selling with them. Ebay has gone down the crapper. Their customer service is an even more laughable joke as well dont even bother with those script reading slaves that copy paste their entire conversation with you",1
3050,I .red s phone number do I can talk to someone.,2

3054,I've only recently starting using the APP and I'm finding it easy to use and quick.,5

3075,Lots of options. Cheap,5
3076,"As a concerned seller, we should be able to leave negative feedback on buyers if they are known to be abusing the money back guarantee system, yall are allowing this to happen, have been made aware by multiple sellers that it is happening, and you continue to allow it to happen, something needs to be done to further protect sellers also and not just buyers",1
3077,"I fell in love with online shopping and have used Ebay to get items for some time, sadly there were too many times I have made a purchase on one item or several that never arrived, nothing I can do as the sellers close the deal afterwards so I can't even bargain for a refund, some sellers just sell you cheap things and some just grab your and never ship the items",1

3084,I like the app but it is limited on a phone.,4
3085,"Others try to copy but few succeed. I got to say I really have enjoyed using eBay over the years. And I like how they protect buyers. I've had very few complaints on products I purchased but when something hasn't turned out as I expected eBay has always been there and the Sellers do know that eBay protects those who buy on their site. The app is easy to use and I've made a number of purchases. I also like how well it ties into PayPal. It makes buying easy, and secure.",5
3086,I will lake you delivery México too,5
3087,Muy bueno,5
3088,"Simple, secure, logic and well known",5

3112,So far it's grate,5
3113,"Great experience and really easy to use. Good refund policy and help for when stuff doesn't always go to plan how you want. Mostly good packaging from seller's, but it's hit and miss mostly. You can get completely smashed models with just newspaper for protection? £10 for postage? To second hand postage quadruple wrapped in bubble wrap in two boxes for a few quid. Over all I've really loved using eBay to get my models together. Just vote with your feet and do what you think with different people",5
3114,Little to no issues,5
3115,Ebay app is easy to navigate. I've enjoyed my experience. I love the search function.,5
3116,"Like the rest of the Internet, eBay is gradually making their experience worse. Get ready to scroll to page 5+ to find what you want because they are not afraid to be anti-helpful.",3
3117,"Have sold more than 50 items on EBay, but nothing in last few yrs. Just had more than a dozen fails trying to get reauthorized to sell because, I guess? my uploaded ""government-issued id"" is not from a nation but from US state (and states are not in the scroll through list, just nations). Using Paypal also Not worth the trouble on samsung or PIXEL phone, so unless you have a PC or WIN/apple laptop to upload docs, AVOID, If YOU plan to get CERTIFIED TO SELL in US",1
3118,Excellent and easy to use.,5
3119,"Notifications have become useless. There's no categorizing marketing notifications from actual watch list items. For many versions now, I haven't been getting notifications prior to a watched item ending, but almost daily I get notifications to bid on or to buy items I've browsed and didn't even choose to watch. Instead trying to make me buy things I don't want, how about helping me buy the things I do? Categorize notifications so I can see relevant notifications and shut off suggestions!",1
3120,Not one for saying much but I have managed to get to get some stuff delivered and left at my door as I have disabilities that I appreciate I get lucky sometimes I get a discount in that really does helps,4
3121,eBay is no good anymore every time I order something they send me the wrong items the last 4 things I ordered I have got the wrong items stay away from eBay it takes so much effort to get Ur money back as the sellers don't like to give you Ur money back.,1
3122,"It was a lot better before suggestions came. Now, in certain categories (like mobile phones) the option to just look for auctions is essentially hidden. Look, if I wanted a shop, I would open one in my browser. I want to haunt things on auctions, and such an app design, forcing you to look at items with fixed price is making ebay less interesting to me. /update 2024: app is getting worse and worse.",2
3123,I like shopping on eBay,5
3124,Easy to order.,5
3125,It's eBay,5
3126,"The fee for selling things is too much!!!!! First time seller, and I didn't know the fee took such a cut! Never sell on ebay again. Go sell your stuff on Mercari instead. I looked at Mercari, and they are more seller friendly. I wish I had switched sites.",1
3127,I buy quite a few auto parts on ebay and so far I haven't had any problems,4
3128,"Straight forward and serious, its taken me not even 1 day to sign up and post 2 items! Im amazed :)",4

3139,The app is so easy to use and always find what you want so quickly,5
3140,You can find really good prices and for the shoes there is authenticity guaranteed.,5
3141,"Search is inconsistent. Ebay is getting more scamy these days. After 16 years and tens of thousands in purchases, here is what it comes down to: The app / eBay system doesn't track correctly returns shipped with the label provided by the app / eBay site. 2* Ebay removed Concierge Support. Ebay foreign support reps talk like robots and not people who care about customers and want to help you. Finally you are forced to hand over your Bank login with full access to a sketchy outfit named ""Trustly"".",1
3142,Good,4
3143,I enjoy this Shopping ebay app so far I get my items as asap nice app love it.,5
3144,Great,5

3146,Does what it says on the tin,5
3147,Easy to use for buying on eBay.,5
3148,Generally good but recently I have been unable to leave feedback on the app itself and there's no option for me to 'submit' so I've had to use the desktop version Edit: Above issue has been sorted so it's gone back to 5 star 😊,5
3149,"I have been a customer of Ebay for many years and am extremely satisfied and happy with the products that I have purchased. I have faith and confidence that if a problem occurs I have the backing of Ebay, that they will acknowledge and resolve the issue. Satisfied customer.",5
3150,Just be aware they support online trolling. As I've complained and they only sorted the 1st problem and not the second with a repeat offender. Be sure to block anyone who seems like they may give you problems as eBay won't support you!,1
3151,I've been With ebay for many years and will continue to use,5
3152,I love this app because Ebay does not block or stop your card! It's the easiest way to get signed in and everything!keep doing your thing ebay!!,5

3157,"Great app,but unable to upgrade, please could you help! Norton.",4
3158,I prefer Epsy,4
3159,eBay has always been my favorite go to for most things in my life. Auto parts catalog is very accurate. If it says the part fits your vehicle then it will. You need to make sure to read descriptions and reviews of course.,5
3160,Always the best.,5
3161,The app is really good BUT !!! The relisting for unsold items need too be easier. Please look at this please 🙏,5
3162,I've had good experiences buying from sellers on here,4

3164,"Exceptional, tried and tested shopping platform",5
3165,Excellent,5
3166,Easy to use,5
3167,Ebay is my go to place for anything and everything,5
3168,"great deals, thorough selection of inventory for nearly everything, for discounted prices as items are used. although shipping is often more than competitors. you will find what may not be available on OfferUp and for less than you'd pay on Amazon. only grievance is I had a security breach and ebay's protocol for that was not as easy a fix as I would have hoped.",5
3169,"My item (with an estimated delivery date more than two months ago) never arrived. Tracking shows a label was printed but the item never shipped. I contacted the seller multiple times, but never got a reply. It won't let me leave a review, possibly because I was patient and gave them more time to fix it. eBay ultimately closed my request for assistance less than a week after my last attempt to contact seller because the seller hadn't responded.",2
3170,"Easy to use has good functionality . Super user friendly,self-explanatory.",5
3171,Ruined by unscrupulous Asian people. Also ebay does not give a damn about laws or human rights. Massive GDPR breaches constantly.,1
3172,"got what I need, simple",5
3173,Very good quality service Thank you packets came just in time as they said.,5
3174,"Ebay poor service, been selling items for 7 years on here. Had to refund 2 people refund this year now due to Evri, even tho the track is open still and I have a case with eBay Paclink open about the miss item I sent. But the response from eBay themselves is the seller didn't post it and has not proof. I got the blue slip from the parcel shop that's proof of postage and a tracking number, but apparently that's not acceptable! Think you have lost my business now eBay.",1
3175,"Just use vinted and actually have a stress free buying and selling experience. When selling on vinted you actually get the amount of money you list your item for, on eBay they hit you with hidden fees and transaction costs",2
3176,"Wont let me checkout, will not tell me why, the app takes for ever to load and bugs out at random times",1
3177,Buying from eBay and bidding on things has been very easy with no hassle,5
3178,Fake app they will not support you. Don't use it for india,1
3179,Great,5
3180,Latest update has changed the selling process to a step-by-step process which is frustrating as you don't always want to do everything in a predetermined order. It has also messed up the text formatting so now all my listings end up as one long paragraph with none of the spacing or formatting I spent ages doing in the item description. Surely this should be a simple thing for a company who have been around for this long.,1
3181,Don't spam me with push notifications for items not on my watchlist!,1
3182,"Easy to use, easy lay out.",5
3183,Does what it says on the tin.,4

3194,Best buys best experience,5
3195,It's efficient and easy,5
3196,"Awful, deceiving, misleading and counter-productive at best. Don't fall victim to the ""eBay Buyers Money Back Guarantee"" When you as a buyer are purhasing goods from a retailer, you figure quick and simple as if you're shopping local. Imagine having being told you must wait for a response before you can even proceed in immediate recovery of your money or merchandise not received. Yes, the red type get longer as hopefully you'll never find out. Be aware..",1
3197,hi faind very helpfull,5

3204,App is much improved since the last I used it,5
3205,I love the concept for this but I sold one item on here as a auction bid type and it charged me over half of what the final price was for nothing and wouldn't respond on what the reason was,2

3207,Great app.,5
3208,It's been awhile but in the past made lots of money.,4

3211,Great app better than the desktop site,5
3212,The process of listing an item for sale is way too lengthy. I give up every time and end up posting my items elsewhere.,1
3213,Great,5
3214,"Been on Ebay for many, many moons. I've only had 1 issue since 1995. The seller was the problem.",5
3215,"I use the app regularly and I have found wonderful deals and products. Also, I love the authenticity guarantees.",5

3222,good,4

3224,Very good,5
3225,"Now with unregistered buyers, so a plethora of scammers galore that keep costing you actual money to report and relist. Bravo, eBay. Once thought you couldn't get worse but hey-ho, look at you go. I stand corrected: report a counterfeit purchase and get told it's all fine. PoS.",1

3232,"Ebay doesn't even respond to criticism because they have no response. Their security is absolutely terrible. They try to blame everything but their own security. But their are many online stores that doesn't get hacked all the time. And if a seller rips you off. Good luck getting Ebay to do what they say they will. I was with Ebay for years,but I'm done with them. The last year I had my account hacked 8 times.",1

3320,"App is becoming less user-friendly with each update. The categories button used to be on the landing page, then it was moved to ""My Ebay"". Now it is gone completely. How can I browse?",1
3321,"They suspend accounts with no explanation, I haven't used my account and it got suspended and now their making me go out the way and contact somebody about it so i can get my account back and they treat you like a criminal, personally I'm not going to bother with ebay.",3

3333,Good app easy to use,5
3334,"I got free shipping, and the money back guarantee is nice.",5
3335,Excellent,5
3336,It is impossible to contact a customer service human or even send an email . It is Artificial Intelligence Hell ! They use a chat robot & send you no confirmation that they even received or are looking into your problem or complaint . Time to buy elsewhere !,1

3346,"I like the app but for some reason I'm getting a ""something went wrong"" when opening the app. Menus seem to work OK though and the error message seems to be just on the home page.",4
3347,"Every time you try to speak with an agent, it states technical difficulties, or there isn't an agent available. Worthless. Meanwhile, I'm getting harassed by a seller because their product they sold me did not fit the description, & I left feedback.",2
3348,"Easy to navigate and the products fits on my car,shipping is on time or early.",5
3349,I love eBay I purchased a engine from Paterson wrecking yard fast delivery thanks,5

3361,Just love everything,5
3362,"When using the eBay app I find Swiping pictures left to right,and up and down has become unbearable now. The app is far too sensitive to movement within the app. Can you please slow down the movement speed of the pages and make it better? For instance, using one handed and swiping with your thumb is a horrible experience on this app .",3
3363,Pretty straightforward 😁,4
3364,The worst,1
3365,The app is fast and easy to use. It is similar to the website experience so you wouldn't be lost if you are used to the website.,5
3366,Loved it,5

3369,Best,5
3370,They used to be good it is terrible now you can never get anybody on the phone their system put you through a loop and then abruptly hangs app on you I had a package that was not delivered they refused to help it is so untrustworthy now I will never buy anything from there again I've been using them since they opened,1
3371,CGI,5
3372,"Constant crashing, consistent java error messages, and awful layout now. As a seller, avoid it if you can. If you are a buyer... then yeah, go nuts, you're fine 👍",1
3373,Good place to buy or sell,5
3374,Best app for selling!,5
3375,"Trash app and company! Even though you sell and list something EXACTLY as advertised, mark no returns. They will allow the buyer to return it. They will arbitrarily choose the return shipping address to provide to the buyer, even if you haven't lived there for 10 years. They will not advise you of this. They will refund the seller, not give you your money or your product even when you PROVE you never got it and it was RETURNED TO THE BUYER!!! Sell on offer up or marketplace.",1
3376,"Never before have I had a website show 1 item in cart for $16, then I checkout and pay, and my receipt shows that I had $400 worth of tires added to my bill. I wish I could give less than 1 star because I have never been robbed this badly before.",1
3377,This app puts you in contact with the company or people with the product. I have been using this app for a while now and have not gotten scammed.,5

3389,"Excellent app, very helpful",5
3390,The app is very slow and freezes a lot,1
3391,"I'm able to buy special type items that I can't buy in the stores, making it my go-to place majority of the time. I can also plan ahead on those items. Sometimes, it will take 3 plus weeks to get it delivered, but it is very reliable in getting those items to me.",4

3393,Love shopping,4
3394,Good ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
3395,LOVE eBay!!,5
3396,"If everything is going well everyone's happy, but when things go wrong, that's when you really see what a company is about, & even after the seller not replying to messages about a missing parcel eBay still protects the seller & expects you to resolve the issue, even after showing them that the parcel was delivered to the wrong address, nowhere near where I live, & they still ask me to check with my neighbours? Amazon isn't perfect but they don't make you jump through hoops when things go wrong.",1
3397,Very good,5
3398,I do hear some people complaining about the cost of fees on ebay but I try to remind everyone that the cost of a Brick and mortar store Would be so much greater And ebay gives you access to the entire world to sell your goods.,5

3402,Good,3
3403,Really great well Cheap...Great Quality,5
3404,you can buy and sell on this,5
3405,"I absolutely hate how eBay estimates the delivery of an item, but the seller doesn't ship the item until the estimated delivery date. Then the item doesn't come for another week. If it isn't going to be even close to approximate, why have it. It's infuriating, and this happens every single time I buy.",1
3406,You should be able to adapt the AI description,3
3407,I only use Enay never amizon..,5
3408,Great app makes shopping easy,5
3409,Used to be a great app but for some reason there is now a lower limit on leaving buyer feedback?! I think they want you to wrote an essay of 250 characters minimum for each item you buy. Absolutely ridiculous so I won't be leaving feedback anymore,3
3410,Good apps,5
3411,"Great app , trusted , time keeping You can fined most of item needed ....",5
3412,Very good selection,5
3413,"Loved it, quick and easy to use.",5
3414,Great app because you can take a pic of something ..say at home you want to sell..or you're at a thrift store. The image will recognize what it is for you and immediately go to that item and open listings. From there you can immediately go to what it has sold for. All in all it's a wonderful app that is straightforward to use that I plan to always have available on my phone at all times.,5
3415,Best ever app,5
3416,Dangerously convenient and safe I'm not sure why it's asking about ads. I didn't see any.,5

3421,How do I change my address,5
3422,Just happy to be with ebay,5
3423,"In general, very good, functional and smoothly working platform at the user end. Saved searches results can be a bit 'idiosyncratic' but in general they are very useful and time saving. It gives notification if something you're particularly looking for is listed. Depends on how accurate/specific your search term is...and the same for the seller.",4
3424,Good deals,4
3425,"This update is an absolute nightmare. It makes listing a lot harder with loads of bugs, especially with photo cropping, etc. Why do these tech companies insist on trying to fix things that are not broken ?!",1

3427,I've never had a bad experience using the app. Every transaction has went great and it's easy to find what I'm searching for!,5

3443,very solid app easier to manage sales on than pc,5
3444,Easy to use,5
3445,The new update is awful. Not impressed. They are paying developers to ruin their app. Literally destroy it by it being completely unusable. The entire layout was destroyed. This update must have happened months ago and I was just dumb enough to click update. Ebay app developers are constantly changing things for no reason. If it works fine. Leave it. Complete joke. If you want the old app version go download apk version 6.143.1.1,1
3446,Brilliant everything you need,5
3447,I've been an eBay member for 20+ years. The app works as well as website on desk/lap-top computers. As long as you have a good signal. Having notifications sent to my cell is very helpful.,5
3448,Easy to use and helpful,5
3449,"I can do everything pretty fast on the app, prefer it over the website, the website is also great",5

3523,"I have been with Ebay for over 14 years. Very good experience including customer security and accurate description of goods and services. The only issue I have with the mobile version is its inability to save the receipt in pdf for subsequent printing; this can only be done from the browser version.

3539,"Many features straight up dont work compared to the desktop site and whatever new features get implemented only serve to give ebay larger cuts of our sales like the promotions feature (that doesnt even work on mobile just gives you an infinite load screen), like who even asked for dynamic ad rates? Its just another button with wait time to try and get you to be lazy and give them a larger cut... Also pretty sure these reviews are bought/botted no way this dysfunctional app got 4.7 stars legit.",1

3563,"Decent app but too many suggestions of similar products and not enough filters. I couldn't find filters for seller location, so (in the UK) being overwhelmed by China dispatchers was frustrating to manually scroll through. Also, by default you're subscribed to notifications about products etc which is annoying. Upload from mobile doesn't work in conjunction with desktop.",2
3564,"I am extremely frustrated with eBay as a seller. Despite being a loyal and honest seller for years, the platform has continuously failed to provide adequate support and protection. I recently encountered multiple instances where buyers exploited the system, filing false claims and demanding refunds for perfectly described and shipped items. eBay's resolution process is biased towards buyers, disregarding clear evidence I provided to support my case. I lost both the items and the money, with eBay",1

3567,"I have found eBay to be a lifesaver at times. When my wife left, me taking all four children in 2022 and demanded that I pay cash for their rent and I had no money due to a huge tax bill and approximately$50000 in daycare bills (from after taxable income), I could sell personal possessions to make sure that my Mother in Law wouldn't put them in her puppy farming operation (again for cash) or have them strip like she did my sister in law to pay her mortgage. eBay can save children's lives🙏",5

3572,"Quite satisfactory. My former review(years ago now) mentioned a lack of features in the app compared to the pc web browser version, but I can't remember now what it was that I was trying to access from my phone then, and I don't have any trouble with lack of access on my phone now, so pretty sure good changes have been made. Thanks for the service ebay much appreciated, quite a secure buying experience through you guys/using paypal, easy to make purchases without worry.",5
3573,"Do not ever sell on eBay, it's literally the worst thing you can do. Hold your funds after the customer receives the product for multiple days, but oh wait releases your funds on the day before Christmas Eve so now I won't see back until after Christmas day. Also literally tax the hell out of anything they can. Greedy and a terrible experience. Update, should have listened to my own review and quit selling with eBay. Literally the worst business to sell with.",1

3642,"Of course people are happy with this app. But you cannot change the language in a country with different language of yours. This made some issues for me, leading to suspension of my account. Now nobody can help me, because they cannot speak English when I requested to call me. Funny, but true. I hope they solve the problem with adding different/preferred languages, as well as English-speaker support teams.",3
3643,This is like an amazing high-end online Goodwill.. the best !!!!!,5
3644,App works well,5
3645,Excellent job,5
3646,As a person with ADHD among otherthings this app is my best friend when it comes to impulse buys but it is a brilliant well designed app with everything you could want and need.,5

3655,"Horrible app for a Horrible company they will charge you whatever they want for doing nothing. They will charge $12 for selling a item in transaction that never even finalized. Customer service will do absolutely nothing to help, just waste your time. If you're buying something and you get a fake product when it's advertised as a real one. You return it because it's not what you bought but you only get a partial refund. It's a joke. Ebay are a bunch of blood sucking parasites. Don't use ebay.",1
3656,Easy app to buy and sell.,5
3657,sometimes hard to speak with service(I hate dealing with ai) otherwise easy to use. feel like ebay takes a large cut which is somewhat inconvenient at times ...,4
3658,Awesome!,5
3659,Oh it'd be great if it let me check out. But I can't so as usual it's another waste of space and time. ( no..it doesn't even honor the $5 discount but you can't check out so it doesn't matter),1

3665,As a resaler I find eBay to be a valuable asset,5
3666,"So many issues with this app even after decades of being one of the largest online selling platforms. You would think the kinks would have been worked out long ago and countless innovations done since. Instead, you can't even pick your shirt size from the filter menu... among other similar UI/UX blunders. It's inexcusable this day in age for a company the size of eBay to have such a buggy app.",1
3667,Excellent,5
3668,Never had ant trouble with this site,4
3669,The experience went very well I wish it would have came with a small bottle of oil but that's okay I had some it is a good-looking compressor and it does have all new parts made in the USA I have it on the car already it is working very well good and cold I will recommend your company can you spread the word and if I need anything else I will be repurchasing from you thank you for a good product,5
3670,Don't like the upgrade can't get my icon back on screen,4
3671,Can't update my app ....why !! I'm missing out on offers,1
3672,The eBay app is very easy to use! The eBay store has many great products for sale!,5
3673,"Every time they update the app it gets worse and worse. If you're a seller and you're trying to edit photos, once you apply the edit the screen goes black and nothing happens. Not just this but the layout is constantly changing. Whoever thinks they need to change the app every couple of weeks needs to chill out.",1
3674,I Can find great offers for shoes like on my sneakerhead and I can sell shoes.,5
3675,Never let me down.,5

3685,Kgllcing,5
3686,"The app does what it does but the UI and trying to find certain options can be annoying, I changed address for a purchase at checkout but it still used my old address which is bollocks",2
3687,"eBay >Pay and Go Happily on your Way! An entirely new world of commerce has opened for me and many sellers and buyers of everything you can imagine.

I didnt. Im using the same phone. Moreover when i clicked the Verify tab, it only redirected me to the login page. Worst, when i tried contacting customer service via chat, the auto agent keeps giving me a reply that is so farfetched, i wonder if it even reads my concern. 😤",1
3712,Long time eBay shopper. No complaints.,5
3713,Easy to use. Hassle-free shopping. The majority of sellers are very keen to keep you happy. I highly recommend eBay to anyone and everyone.,5

3757,"After looking at an item that was way overpriced the app sent me a notification with a buy it now button that I could have hit by mistake as I was on the phone. This app is out of control. It doesn't even send me the one notification I want, auction about to end.",2
3758,"It's a good site when first out but now they gouge you with fees, other than high prices and lots of fees and taking a percentage of your sales it's a good site. Wish they would go back to their original ways.",4
3759,Using the app is so much easier to list items to sell than I recall from my usage many years ago. I want to walk through my house and start snapping photos and selling everything I own. It's that easy to list items now.,5

3770,Ebay is also good as well,5
3771,"For buying, the app is functional if a bit pushy. Trying to sell an item is absurdly difficult though. My eBay app literally cannot load my single listed item, nor any Offers placed for it. I have to use the desktop app instead. More annoyance for small time sellers on the app, while I imagine the big dropshipping accounts taking over the site have no issues as they likely use desktop anyway. Rapidly becoming a Temu reseller and nothing more.",1

3784,Very good experience Keep Good Work Thanks you very much eBay,5
3785,"Perfect for finding old items you want to purchase to fuel your weird obsession. My only complaint is most reviews are not real, and really throws off the authentic feel of the app. However, I've spent over a hundred dollars on items and the only issue I've had could have benefitted me but I was a good Samaritan. (I was sent something extra along with what I originally bought and sent it back because it was accidental lol)",4

Recently I had found a shirt and added it to my cart, I wasn't planning on buying the shirt right away but unfortunately it was somehow bought and I got charged on my card. I didn't press to buy it, it just happened. I'm extremely frustrated that I can't cancel the order. I know it's likely my fault but beware when ordering.",3
3797,I've found some great records on eBay!All the ones i needed from the 60s & 70s to fill in the gaps in my collections,5

3836,It is user friendly,4
3837,Hot stuff other places dont,5
3838,it would be so much better if when you made a purchase before you went to go to the full inventory you could inventory immediately what you've already previously purchased as stored so that you can remake a purchase from a good buyer that you'd already bought from able some things I've only found at once and then I wonder if I can do it again but I know I already purchased it,4
3839,I get what I want,5
3840,I did not received my order.,1
3841,Good,4
3842,Great Shopping,5
3843,Poor AI descriptions Continual tweaking by developers is fine but the use of AI descriptions is a terrible idea. The generated text is so awful eBay should blush. Still great at reaching a wide audience in general,3

3845,Love it!,5
3846,Very happy with the app.,5

3848,Excellent app,5
3849,I like using ebay but some of the vendors have awful products I understand you get what you pay for but I don't want to catch on fire the plug sparks all the time. I've reached out to the seller but my the time they answered me I couldn't do the return anymore,5
3850,Works great super convenient,5
3851,I wanted to expand my sneaker sales and tried to come back. After a few sales the fee that they charge was just not worth it. After each sale I was paying anywhere from $5-$20+ maybe more in fees. I'd rather just use StockX for less hassle or Mercari who doesn't charge fees anymore!,1

I should also point out that I don't have the ability to accept offers on items from a sale that I already purchased one of before. The seller has multiples of the same item and they sent me an offer after I already purchased two at regular price in the past, and I didn't even have an option to accept it.",3

3923,"Do yourself a huge favor and DO NOT sell for these people. They take a huge chunk of the sale, and then if it gets returned, you have to pay out of your pocket what eBay made from it plus both shipping labels. Ebay will always side with the customer buying even if they commit return fraud or have no proof of defects. I have had multiple issues with this company and the customers who know how to manipulate eBay's returns. DO NOT USE Ebay is a legitimate scam",1

3966,"I protest ebay does NOTHING to stop scammers selling on its platform, and i loose money with them. Now they are greedy and take Amex payment away. Plus the monthly $5 incentive now requires 5 times the spend amount than used it Buy direct from China. Ditch eBay. I have bought 20 x more stuff and saved so much.",1

3970,"Sometimes the description isn't clear, and leads to reordering or cancellation. Magnets ordered recently expecting 4 sets, only received 2 sets, the description said 4 pieces, surely a magnet needs two pieces per set, I was hoping for 4 sets.",4

3976,The latest update is awful. Used to be able to swipe to delete inbox messages. Now I have click several buttons to delete a message. Also when I click on an item in watchlist or inbox it usually loads the item above or under. When I scroll to the bottom of lists it likes to jump back to the top. Don't know how you make an app worse with an update,1
3977,Sold same car 4 times sold same motorbike 5 times Nobody gets left bad feedback any buyer can do what they want,1

I don't need to see items 3+ years old that I hid years ago...if you are going to 'fix' ,break, things, why not give the magical 'select all' option... completely stupid updates that are not needed cam't even place a bid now without being forced to say how you are going to pay",1

4003,I love this app,5
4004,Scammers R Us. Don't trust ebay. This is a shady company that needs to fade away. They will duck you in any way possible,1
4005,App doesn't give you any deals if you use it very often and deliveries are always late than date they give you if you buying from overseas,1
4006,"Ebay is the worst selling platform. I've waited 4 weeks for my payment to finally hit my bank. Then they take over £150 in fees! It's ridiculous and greedy. I will be taking the app from my phone, deleting my account and never using again. Absolutely ridiculous. Stick to vinted. Paid right away, and you get to keep your money. Ebay is a shambles and even when you try and ask for help, you get nothing. Very disappointed.",1

4010,Super convenient!,5
4011,The eBay app works great with no issues. I am usually on a PC but can use the app well after I got used to it. Take care God Bless,5
4012,It has it all. Everything one may need is available. The services offered by eBay are excellent.,5
4013,"Two main flaws. First when creating a listing or revising the listing using the app, it automatically enables'accepting offers' and sets it to half the value of what you set, its very hard to notice until you view your listing outside the app. Second is again while creating a listing in the app, you are forced to use Yodel for first postage choice, the only way to then change it is to then edit listing in a web browser. So as a result of these 2 things i couldn't recommend this app to anyone.",1

4058,"Go to amazon. I don't understand why I can not cancel an order created by mistake right after I made it. Then, the seller can cancel your cancelation. There is no guaranteed money back(even if they claim it is) on defects.There are a lot of shady and unprofessional dealers. I have pretty much had it with them. Amazon has always had a good refund policy or offered a way to fix the problem. I tried to give it a chance, but I see why I rarely use it every few years. You may get lucky sometimes do.",1

4064,Yeah buddy <3,5
4065,Final value fee makes it impossible. If I try to sell my $1000 phone for $430 I'm already taking a huge loss. Then eBay will take $57 out of that for a fee. Absolutely outrageous. It's highly unlikely I'll ever use this platform again.,1
4066,E tenido exelente servicio y lo recomiendo gracias,5
4067,Can use the app quiet easily as n̈ot used to computers,5
4068,It needs video and sound for me to sell,5

4087,"Stupid app asked me for payment details to be confirmed 30 secs before an auction ended. Lost out on the chance to bid, and I had used the app to purchase something just a week prior. Don't bother, not worth all the spam emails from eBay every hour.",1

4138,"Currently almost unusable for myself when trying to edit images for listings. Go to crop and save an image and just get a black screen which I have to back out of and nothing has saved.

4143,"Allows scammers to sell fake items and then try to blackmail you into giving them a good review for a refund. Why would I change my honest feedback for a refund. That to me feels like blackmail, I give them honest feedback for the item they sent, which didn't work and which I told them. I'm still to receive a refund, and it's put me off using this app in the future. I suggest people use an app that protects it consumers.",1

4187,Thank you for experience with eBay,5
4188,This new update is even worse. What is going on? I can no longer use PayPal to pay when I bid? What's with that? It'll automatically deduct payment an hour later; how about allowing me to immediately pay as I always have?,1

4197,So great,5
4198,Awesome,5
4199,"I would suggest increase watch list items, more sellers to be followed, and a combined postage option from the same seller. With over 1k+ transactions and 10+ years of purchasing experience, genuine buyer/ seller shouldn't be targeted for automated bids cancellation or account termination due to combine postage. A negative experience and broken commitment nearly resulted in app removal and seeking alternatives however customer service deserve praise for prompt solution.",5

4226,"I've been using eBay for the last several months. I was hesitant about scams, TBO. Several purchases later, I am confident in using the app. It continues to bea great experience.

I make a habit of using the smartphone and then do a final edit on the computer. Fonts and formatting are different. It's more work to make a good-looking listing. The more you tell, the more you sell. Details matter.",3

4267,Excelent!,5
4268,WHY DID I NOT GET A NOTIFICATION OF AN OFFER WHEN IT EXCEEDED MY 'MINIMUM THRESHOLD' FOR 2 DIFFERENT ITEMS THIS HAS HAPPENED !!,1
4269,No contact button on profiles. White background feature sucks. Fees are INSANE. If you search a color it does NOTHING to specify searches. Customer service is no help 90% of the time. For such a large company Im astonished at the lack of care to customers. DO BETTER.,1

4274,Does the job,5
4275,I have tried everything possible to update to newest version with no luck. I am told by Ebay to update everytime a seller offers a lower price. No problem buying at a regular price🤔. App support never replies about my problem. Very frustrating😤. Other than this one problem Ebay is fun. I know that they don't CARE but One star till my problem is resolved.,1
4276,Easy to use,5
4277,Good,3
4278,We'll designed app for efficient listing of items to sell!,5
4279,Ebay is cool,5
4280,Nearly on par with amazon,4
4281,After the new update the application it's so much harder to use especially if you are a seller. Why if you have something that it's working you try so much to ruin it. One of the biggest problems you ask to take photos with the defects/scratches of the item you are listing how can you take photos if the app crashes at every photos you try to take. In the end the update did make listing much harder than before.,1

4294,A fantastic site gives me the opportunity to keep my mind and hands occupied and wonderful prices.,5
4295,I like the app it can be a bit buggy sometimes like kicking you off the item page as you get down the list of things you are looking at.,4
4296,Way better than Amazon,5
4297,Great place to buy consoles,5
4298,eBay has made numerous accommodations and changes recently that favor buyers while sellers have less advantages and rights. It used to be a great platform to sell on but has turned into an app for buyers that sellers are forced to accept.,2
4299,My experience with ebay has always been solid. I do business with them often and have never regretted it.,5

4302,Easy to navigate and find stuff,5
4303,I tried to rise money by selling my silver bar. Managed to sell the item for 850£+ transport. As a seller you get ripped off by ebay with lack of transparency. In the end my item price after fees and extra fees and fees again got diluted to 702£. Avoid selling on ebay.,1

4315,"Gone down the 5#!ter.. This used to be a great way of selling your old items. Now! You Bearley get any views or bids. Fees are extremely high! And buyer's rights have become ridiculous, many posted items go ""missing"" and you have to repay the buyer, although tracking was issued. Avoid it like covid and keep your distance",1

4365,I'd love certain salads on ebay sellers,5
4366,I was selling on eBay but the fees have gotten so bad it's not worth selling anymore I will never sell on eBay again not worth the hassle and also if you are buying on eBay and it says it was delivered but was not for some reason you get screwed out of your money no matter how much it is there's no proof that something was delivered just because it says it was,1

4377,Normally get a little better price than Amazon. Just a little slower shipping. Watch to make sure you don't get hit with outrageous shipping fees.,5
4378,"eBay has always been concerned with clients, both sellers and buyers, but customers have always been a top priority. The app makes shopping a breeze.",5
4379,It's one of the most user friendly applications to install and start using immediately. 👍 GREAT JOB 👍,5
4380,Awesome,5
4381,Ebay is only good for buying stolen goods. All the good sellers have gone because ebay doesn't care about anyone but themselves.,1

4400,"Why does this app take up OVER 4GB?? Why does a simple UI takes up so much space?? What else is installed with it that it needs 4.3GB space? Also having to scroll thru tons of promoted items that are forced on you, and unrelated to what you searched for. Google just manipulating everyone as always. I'll never reinstall this bloated pig until they remove the unknown Trojan stuff. Use incognito browser for ebay cuz this app has several GB worth of unknown stuff on your phone to gather info",1

4410,I like it I use it for my coins,5
4411,I've gotten the best tech deals on this app and I almost always find an item cheaper here than anywhere else. I never make an online purchase without verifying ebay doesn't have it cheaper. Beats amazon a lot. Worst case scenario you wait o ce extra day over amazon. Which is worth it to me,5
4412,"Ebay allows fake silver,gold,shoes.even allows sellers to scam people over and over. They don't care because they get a cut.sellers can be great with good deals as long as post office doesn't loose it.i won't lie I've been screwed over multiple times over the years.always click item didn't arrive if you know it's not coming. But wait a couple months for international stuff sometimes.theres a few for charity sellers.it is what it is.better than dhgate or aliexpress so far.",4
4413,Absolute garbage. I will never buy anything from Ebay again! Auto corrected to the wrong address and would not let me change it.,1

4428,I had a good experience with eBay and they carried the items i like and needed,5

4432,Quick to get the app up!!,5
4433,Good 👍,5
4434,Excellent app to find great deals.,5
4435,🤘,5
4436,"The app is not so bad as to be completely unusable, but is definitely inferior to the desktop experience. In particular I dislike how the selling tab has an automatic ""to-do list"" that assumes that if you delist an item for not selling that you will, in fact, relist it with a lower price (as opposed to just donating the board game you've been already listing for very cheap). It'd be nice to just be able to delete stuff from there. Or to delete inactive listings. Not horrible, just mediocre. 3/5",3
4437,Good shopping,5
4438,Logged on 3 times in a row and still won't let me on...,2
4439,Good shopping experience! Happy eBay Shopping!,5

4449,Brilliant,5
4450,"Terrible customer service. After searching for half an hour to figure out how to talk to someone about an account suspension message on the screen, they tell me the account was suspended on a certain date, but they refuse to tell me why and then tell me they are ending the call immediately. I never received an email regarding an account suspension, and I check both my inbox and junk mail multiple times a day. The rudeness and failure to communicate is beyond frustrating.",1
4451,Great 👍,5
4452,Excellent,5
4453,Very good on they're parts,5
4454,Sellers are not accountable. They can list an out of stock item and there are no consequences if they cancel a finished sale! The app doesn't allow negative feedback even though the buyer completes a sale and gives their financial information. It's not right.,1
4455,You nailed it,5

4483,"so many security limitations that it is simply not interesting anymore to buy or sell on Ebay. Amazon is much easier especially since you can't use PayPal anymore.

4563,eBay has been my all time favorite app that I have found great and awesome affordable deals at for my recent purchases and the sellers and companies I have boughten from constantly have made me feel safe and trustful again towards apps like eBay. Ebay even has seller & buyer ratings on their profiles to see what other sellers and buyers have said about them and these ratings really help out others on eBay to know if these individuals they buy or sell too can be trusted. Got to love this app.,5

4610,Ads in Purchases feed? It was bad enough when eBay nuked the search functionality.,1
4611,"I can always find what I'm looking for, at a reasonable price",5
4612,Works how things should work,5
4613,"Looking through my purchases is more difficult now with... ""Frequently bought together"". Why do you change things without the ability to turn changes off. Making it more difficult makes me use it less often, good job.",2
4614,Brilliant buys ..no regrets ever,5
4615,Very user friendly,5
4616,My only discrepancy is that you can't shoot videos for your listings from your phone on the app.,4
4617,Have yet to receive my order . I ordered it on July 14 and can't find a phone number to call them no way to track them. They sent it to USPS and they said they didn't have an order to my tracking number 😕,1
4618,Always find a bargain,5
4619,Latest update shows ads between every item on your my purchases page. Ridiculous.,1
4620,Can't remember the last time I bought or sold on eBay but if you want to Ebay get the app,4
4621,I wish the app had features that are available on the computer version,4
4622,What a joke to try and login! How many verification steps are required?? I did the first 3 and then gave up because the app got stuck on a verify that I'm human screen and just kept repeating the same step.,1

4624,Great app. Easy to use,5
4625,Great,5
4626,I Love ebay,5
4627,It's a good app but the last 2 days it's saying my ebay needs updating and I have tried everything but can't update it tried deleting and restarting my phone and installing it again but nothing works,5
4628,"The app is great, but I don't know if this was an update or not, but for some reason, I can't slide the notification in the inbox to the left or right. I have to check all the notifications and then delete them, which is really annoying. Please fix this!!!",3
4629,Once you get this installed when you get your password set up it's every bit as convenient as your desktop.,5

4635,Please remove 'Frequently bought together' from list of purchases!!,3
4636,Love it,4
4637,By far the best buying app for me. The thing I like most is the ease and flexible payment. I've encountered payment problems on multiple other shopping websites but never on eBay. 100 recommended.👍,5
4638,"The frequently bought together implementation is garbage, please remove!!!",1
4639,"For the love of all that is good,stop messing things up!!! Swiping to remove notifications was perfect,now you have to spend even more time to clear them FFS!! And allow us to block sellers so we don't see their irrelevant results keep coming up in a search!! It's not hard but you seem to want to make it difficult for the people who keep eBay alive!! No wonder people are using other sites more and more!",1
4640,Very good,5
4641,Iam very happy to have ebay,5
4642,I need to speak to an agent Item purchased as a guest didn't arrive. Seller Workd of Books says there book is in a bad condition and won't deliver. I asked them to send a replacement. They are refusing to do that sayinis gis it's ebay problem.m,1

4651,Effing love ebay,5
4652,"Remove frequently bought together from already purchased items for gods sake. Completely usless as nobody is going to use this and is plain irritating, but im sure ebay makes money off of it so probably not going away.",1
4653,Easy to use' takes you directly where you want to look for an item.,5
4654,"Can't get a version later than 2022 from Play Store. Can't accept seller offers for EBay app tells me mine is out of date. Tried uninstalling, rebooting and installing 3 times and still the same version loads back. Couldn't even get EBay to respond to pressing on multiple Nectar point offers, for months now! What is going on and where to get an up to date app??",1
4655,"Works good but not on galaxy tab devices, icons and pictures incorrectly sized, text too small, system settings don't help",4
4656,Great platform to buy and sell product's...verry helpfull customer service as well 5☆☆☆☆☆,5
4657,"constant BS problems listings. Every time you update something, you break something else.",1
4658,"When I go to ""My purchases"", there is now a sponsored ""Frequently bought together"", advertisement crammed between literally EVERY individual purchase, creating a hideous to look at, and unenjoyable experience.",1

4669,Easy to use,5
4670,See things on Ebay I would like to purchase,5
4671,"The latest change now forces you to prepay your bid. And then ebay just charges a random card that you have on file. I liked it before where you could choose which payment method to use. And only pay if you won. They even charge you when you don't win. Due to this change, i will stop using ebay. Also ebay gives sellers your personal information so that they can advertise to you to buy from other sites that aren't ebay. This includes harassing phone calls, emails, and snail mail.",1
4672,great,5
4673,I love everything about EBay. The auctions are one of my favorite things to go onto because of the low prices you can get items for. Thanks for everything EBay!,5
4674,Good competitive prices and fast delivery without minimum limit for orders,5
4675,"**Terrible updates made** They keep making app less user friendly. Now they added ""frequently bought together"" to crowd up your purchase list They got rid of the easy left swipe option to delete notifications. And, I still cannot clear old items from my purchase list. Time to stop using ebay.",2
4676,Easy and fun,5
4677,Ebay hosts great from Every perspective.,5
4678,Very convenient,5

4682,Perfect,5
4683,Amazing experience for online shopping 10/10 would recommend,5
4684,"Please remove adverts between each item on my purchase listing. They're awkward, unwelcome & always irrelevant.",1
4685,"Remove the sponsored ads in the purchase section, please. It's distracting, and the products are not relevant. The ads being between every purchased item is also very ridiculous.",1
4686,Perfect,5
4687,Good,5
4688,Wouldn't let me update??,2
4689,Excellent,5
4690,One of the best app on World.,5

4694,Enjoy the items that ive bought,5
4695,Quick search,5
4696,"Great App, sadly the decision to add ads between every purchases entry is beyond annoying. Not sure why anyone would think this is a good idea, but that alone is -2 stars from me. *Edit: Nevermind, this is so annoying that I'll subtract 3 stars. The purchase history is useless like that. The ads take more space than the entries.",2
4697,I'm really enjoying bid on some things I've been able to save on things I use everyday! The selection is great and easy to navigate! Many choices and description of products! So much easier than other on line company and the trust is there and not on others! Shipping is quick and always get the help I'm need!,5

4704,"Love eBay motors, easy and great prices.",5
4705,"Sold is now (orders)....why exactly? Every so often your ux design folk get bored and just make pointless changes, usually detrimental.",1
4706,"This was a 4 star rating until ebay made the choice to add frequently bought together after every item in the purchased tab. It's cluttered, ugly and invasive. Now I can't just check my purchased items easily, now there's rows and rows of AI spam to ignore. After buying a yugioh card, I'm encouraged to buy a refrigerator. Right.",2
4707,I like eBay because I can get pre-owned items at good prices.,4
4708,"eBay, why on earth do I have to select and then confirm deletion of NOTIFICATIONS?? Put it back the way it was. Most of the notifications are duplicates of Messages. I need to be able to clear them quickly. Instead of making it a multi-step process, give me a DELETE ALL button",2
4709,Great experience,5

4723,Quality clothes i like this app,5
4724,Great app and deals I love it here?!!,5
4725,'Frequently bought together' lists spamming the app. Why are these now a thing? Dreadful.,1
4726,Great service,5
4727,"Done with eBay 2021, after 20 years of use. Do I want to share my bank details with eBay for them to lose? Of course not. That would be stupid. So under eBay rules I cannot sell anymore. So... I create a new bank account for eBay use... I sell something... eBay then demands my passport before it will pay out... Not likely! A bunch of crooks waiting to get hacked...",1
4728,Great app for buying and selling whatever you want . Easy to use and never freezes up on you,5
4729,It easy to use and very little trouble with eBay.,5
4730,Very clear and simple to use,5
4731,Excellent,5
4732,Very good brought lots of thing,5
4733,"They've ruined the app. Loaded with adds. Way too ""Busy"" looking and slow loading. Fortunately the eBay website remains usable. If we want high pressure, annoying, irritating advertising, we'd be using a Chinese platform like TEMU.",1
4734,Great app!,5
4735,Great,5
4736,"An easy way to sell things, a little expensive in terms of the cut that eBay takes, but the access to a market is incomparable, really.",4
4737,"Many different things to buy; sometimes they're legitimate, other times they're not, some of them are digital, in other instances, they're physical, but overall a great place to find goods.",5
4738,Always works for me. Never a problem,5
4739,Certain features are not working on the app for sellers. I get: Access blocked: eBay’s request does not comply with Google’s policies,2
4740,Cool and nice and great,5
4741,My orders have arrived on time parts wearing good condition great condition no damage done to my packaging,5
4742,Thanks 👍 keep up the good work,4
4743,Stupid ads between every purchased item.,1
4744,"Savings, and great items at reasonable prices",5
4745,Will write review when item arrives Ordering was a breeze,5
4746,I buy a lot of stuff I don't need,5
4747,Anything you could ever want from old to new is on eBay. Things that aren't made anymore... eBay has it.Great deals also. Roll Tide!!!!,5
4748,"EBAY - REMOVE THE STUPID ""FREQUENTLY BOUGHT TOGETHER"" ADS YOU JUST ADDED TO YOUR APP UNDER PURCHASES. EVERYONE HATES IT AND IT'S CLUTTERING THE APP. AWFUL UPDATE!! WHO DECIDES ON THIS NONSENSE??",1

4756,It's cheaper than Amazon for the same things,5
4757,Love how there are so many options love everything about this app and the purchase protection is a bonus,5
4758,Good,5
4759,Ebay now puts an add between each purchased item. So double the loading time and double the scrolling just to see if something you already purchased has shipped. After thousands of transactions I will be moving on. The app is no longer convenient.,1
4760,The latest update has got rid of swiping to delete notifications.... why?! This was one of the best parts of the app. It's like they've done it to cater for stupid people.,2
4761,Fast reliable and easy 👌,5
4762,Ebay is great,5
4763,Latest update moved the filters on active listings so now it's 2 clicks to see bids received items instead of one. So it's also two clicks to switch. :(,4
4764,When you take almost 15% I blame blackrock and literally think you guys are evil. I'm going to use that new platform pokemon creators are promoting,1
4765,It wasn't that intuitive to do the the 2 step sign on but it's necessary for security.,5
4766,Excellent 100%,5
4767,Good,5
4768,fantastic,5
4769,Easy to use,5
4770,"I like ebay as a service and had no complaints until the new update. As others have said, ads in purchase history is unacceptable. In addition, changes made in the Selling side of things means I now have several additional taps to do things that used to have a dedicated button or swipe. Not a fan of the UI changes at all.",3
4771,Account keeps getting suspended,1
4772,Bought so many good stuff here,5
4773,Really good,5
4774,Even move rubbish than the ebay website. Doesn't load HTML product descriptions properly. Unbelievable that such a large company can make a product so badly.,1

4784,Excellent,5
4785,Great app for purchases,5
4786,The purchases page has the worst UI. Now that little frequently bought tab right under every purchase is terrible and hard to work with. Get rid of it.,1
4787,"eBay sinks again with updates that's taken away useful features & they can't stop tinkering - adding a star rating to their feedback menu. Wanting to know out of 5 ⭐s how good what you've bought is. How would I know? I just bought it & it might be a gift. it isn't on every item, so why bother at all? My personal picture keeps vanishing & returning & they've returned the ""frequently bought together"" ads between purchases. It's a lie. it's stuff they want to push. This doesn't benefit customers",1

4800,Great quality great price and great service,5
4801,Have got frequently bought together ads between every item in the purchase list. It's a real pain. How do I remove it ???,5
4802,Super.. brilliant application,5
4803,Need an account. It's another tracking device used by Companies to data mine you by requiring an account to shop. It's a known tactic in the comm field. Scammers.,1
4804,love the app,5
4805,When I type in to a specific item or a specific brand it goes to other items and other makes it would be easier if it went to what you were looking for,4

4812,Nice,5
4813,"Had to spend a lot of time searching for 1 side, don't need both sides. Only offered left side alone, no right side, so I had to buy both sides!",4

4829,I've never had any issues.,5
4830,Why are there items for sale between purchased items now. I just want to look at my purchases not a load of adverts stuck between them. Please take it off. Waste of time asking really as eBay never read any of the comments.,1
4831,Shopping I would give it a 3 star but it really sucks selling stuff on here ebay charged me $14 just because someone made a order then cancelled,1
4832,Love it,5
4833,"They are always fair, honest and helpful",5

4837,Now with more ads! I pay you a lot of money to do nothing but side with the customer and now you want to spam my order details with junk advertising. Nobody wants that. It's now all clutters with useless ads. Thanks a lot.,1
4838,"The buy it now option should not go away as soon as someone bids on an item. I set my starting bid at what I'm willing to take for it, and apparently, I need to set a reserve price anyway if I want the buy it now option to stay available.",3

4842,"Starting today, 7/30/24, in-between every single item on my purchased list is a sponsored post of ""frequently bought together"" showing 3 to 4 random items. This needs to stop.

4852,eBay is good for anything to buy,5
4853,"I had a terrible experience with a seller and eBay's customer service. bought a $54 starter wire connector, but it never arrived. Despite contacting the seller multiple times, I got no response. When eBay's customer service intervened, they just said the tracking showed it was delivered, ignoring my situation. Their ""money back guarantee"" meant nothing. I'm out $54 and without my car part. The seller was unresponsive and unreliable. From now on, I'll shop in-store to avoid such issues",1
4854,works just fine,5
4855,Ebay is simply the BEST!!!!,5

4869,"I have been using this app for about 12 years now with almost no issues up until yesterday. A recent update has flooded the purchase section with ""Frequently bought together"" sponsored ads showing up after every purchase, making it more difficult to keep tabs on mulitple purchases.

4886,Describe in set up access describes access to use eBay on credit.,5
4887,Purchase history flooded and cluttered with ads.,1
4888,Great,4
4889,"Great app, easy to find what you are looking for. Just be careful because in the network, there are a lot of shady people. It is highly recommended to review the seller profile and raiting to avoid bad experiences.",5
4890,Works great all features I need.,5
4891,Use it daily and never a single glitch or problem of any sort,5
4892,Great job.,5
4893,"I love eBay, it's so interesting 🤔.",5
4894,I didn't get all my packages. Totally make me feel I got scam.,1
4895,"I can't order anything, due to not allowing me to check out. I spent about 2,000 on Ebay each year!",1
4896,Can't update this app if anyone can explain how to please let me know,1
4897,good prices delivery on time,5
4898,Solid great app. Really a must have for all you bargain and BOLO-ers out there.,4
4899,"Excellent app, you can pretty much buy anything (legal) you need in life from this one app alone.",5
4900,👍,5
4901,"It's been great, just one slow delivery out of several. Very satisfied!!",5
4902,"Never used or have been on Ebay. I was able to open an account & begin listing my first item on Ebay all on my phone. It was a bit difficult for me because I have ZERO experience in using Apps & no social media but, if I could figure out, anybody can!",4
4903,Good,5
4904,Easy install and easy use of app.,5
4905,"Wouldn't recommend as a selling platform. There have been occasional glitches of items that are sold being reposted without my input. This affects my seller rating, my items have been shadow-banned as a result. Disappointed and moving to another platform.",1
4906,straight forward enough,3
4907,Why paying tax on used second hand products?? I have always been baffled by that.,3
4908,"The new update is making things difficult, I do not like recommendations/ Frequently bought with on my purchase list as I find it confusing. And makes it look jumbled, When I'm looking for recent purchases. I cannot see item dispatched properly either. Stop updating this app.",1
4909,"Decent to buy from, far from decent too auction from",3
4910,"Brilliant service, lots of choices",5
4911,Great,5

4914,"No problems, easy to navigate",5
4915,Way too easy to spend my money,5
4916,Very good p experience love shopping on ebay,5
4917,"Easy to find what I'm looking for and good range of sellers, with useful reviews",5
4918,Some genius decided that adding Frequently Bought Together for EVERY purchase was a good design idea. Must have been one of those Twitter engineers.,1
4919,I always find what I'm looking for usually for a lower price,5
4920,Able to find anything your looking for,5
4921,Love it.,5
4922,Very useful 👌 thank you 😊,5
4923,22 Years all good deal,5
4924,They have everything you can think of 👍😎,5
4925,worst platform ever from a sellers standpoint. closed account for no reason at all and still won't release my funds to me. TRASH.! 111,1
4926,Wonder ful,5
4927,I don't like the sponsored ads that are now displayed when you look at your purchases. I find them very intrusive! Not to mention very cluttering. We should have the choice to have them or not.,1
4928,"after an update, my Purchases page is flooded with recommended buy ads.",1
4929,eBay has become one of the worst places to make purchases. It is almost impossible to contact eBay with problems and they do everything to protect the seller from negative feedback and don't care about the customer.,1
4930,Smooth transaction. Reliable app,5
4931,"Use this app all the time. Easy view buy. What is wrong with your app I can't get on ! Unfortunately I had to change from 5 stars to 2 ,I feel I can no longer bid on eBay with confidence anymore. I've lost confidence in eBay's seller's rating system.",2
4932,Don't recommend the app as a seller. I just got scammed out of $300 because a buyer purchased a game system from me and then proceeded to file a claim with his bank that he never received the item. Stay away and do your research. I'm not the first seller to be scammed and will not be the last.,1
4933,Awesomely useful,5
4934,Good deals fast shipping great return policy,5
4935,a1 app,5
4936,Good app to find milsurp,5
4937,Great,4
4938,The app was downloaded by Cyber criminals. I do not use eBay at all.,2
4939,"Why do i have to rate an item to leave feedback, feedback is about seller not the item, whoever thought of this is stupid.",3
4940,"Almost everything on here is more expensive than Amazon, and shipping is always slower. Selling fees have become ridiculous depending on the category.",1
4941,Easy to use,5
4942,"Why don't eBay IT team just leave the app alone, When you got a notification you just swiped it away NOW you got to tap Edit select each and every notification then tap delete then tap confirm delete, just more unnecessary changes force upon us all",1
4943,Me go to shopping,5
4944,Way easier than desktop app,5
4945,Good,5
4946,Im new to ebay,4
4947,Its my 1st time on e bay í orderd 1 item á reply came through saying there was á problem so í orderd the same item from someone else then 1st item was confirmed so ive orderd 2 nd item because u said there was á problem,5
4948,Great way to shop from home,5
4949,Great shopping,5
4950,Horrible update. Pushing ads in purchase history,1
4951,Yay.,5
4952,"As a seller or buyer, the app serves its function well.",5
4953,"New update with the ""Frequently Bought Together"" makes it unbearable to look through your purchases. I would check most days to see tracking and other info on my orders. Now, every item has a sponsored banner between them. Even if you made a purchase of 12 items in a single order, EVERY SINGLE ONE has a ""Frequently Bought Together"". As someone who uses eBay daily, it makes me want to now find a different reseller app.",1
4954,Aces all the way. Best in the biz.,5
4955,"Dropping review to 1 star; Whatever idiot at eBay HQ thought it would be a good idea to stick sponsored ads in the ""Purchases"" section needs to seriously rethink proper ways to monetize. If eBay is that desperate, it tells me that the platform is underperforming, and as both a buyer and seller maybe I ought to consider other avenues.",1
4956,Alway shop here,5
4957,"I search clothes for men. include word ""men"" in search. but the result all for women . I search for color but the filter filters only white. how funny. Better to use web",1
4958,"The rubbish underneath prior purchases is just that. If their intent was to entice into buying something supplemental, they failed miserably. Users still can't filter by feedback rating.",2
4959,Very good app,5
4960,Trychegcheck out,1
4961,eBay has become totally joke and are siding with scammers that are fake sellers and claiming item arrived while you don't receive nothing but paying over the air to 100% scammers including eBay.,1
4962,Easy shopping layer in the sun CHARLIE.,5
4963,Ive always hadgood products from here thankyou😁,5
4964,"Customer Service was AMAZING when my account was hacked! That will teach me to lock down my passwords better, but they had me all squared away in less than 10 minutes. App itself is very user-friendly and it's so easy to find/edit everything I've saved.",5
4965,Very good and handy,4
4966,Incredible buying experience. I have found many great deals time after time.,5
4967,"The update I do not like... when looking threw my purchase all I see it ""frequently bought together"" it's really annoying. Please remove that or give us an option to remove it.",3
4968,"Solid for years and getting better IMO as a seller and buyer, except would like to use the advanced seller tools on Android and not have to use Windows to use all functionality.",5
4969,Great app. Great live customer service also (really)! Had a serious issue and they were all over it with much urgency! Grateful. I'm a lifer. I have nothing but good experiences here.,5
4970,Saves previous searches even after I have gone into settings and clicked on clear search history.,1
4971,fast efficient,4
4972,The new update that is cluttering up the Purchases list with additional suggestions is dreadful. Please reverse this or provide a setting to be able to hide these suggestions from view. Less clutter = better app and user experience!,2
4973,Absolutely brilliant,5
4974,Stop overstepping with the ads. I should't be forced to see ads in-between my purchases with garbage ads. I'm just trying to see what I bought.,1
4975,"Getting better regularly but for God's sake make offers binding. Grailed does it, poshmark does it. Nothing worse than someone making an offer and waiting four days for them not to pay. Also allow us to use draft blue prints in the app",4
4976,I think the eBay app is brilliant find anything that you need,5
4977,"great app, however, the constant UI changes are quite annoying. since its updated frequently, bugs show up every once in a while and its a bit irritating",3
4978,Very good experience,5
4979,Love this,5
4980,"now we get ads in the purchase history page, and it keeps rearranging itself as you scroll down, awful design. can't dismiss notifications by swiping them any more. quit making your app worse",2
4981,Great place to fund awesome deals,5
4982,ebay is such a easy company to use and sell with,5
4983,"Wish list missing, add something to your basket, be prepared to get bombarded with notifications.",1
4984,It's easy to what you have in your basket,5
4985,I like it,5
4986,New sponsored ads in between my purchases on the app are awful. I can no longer easily track my purchases at a glance and it brings nothing to the app. I find that I don't want to use ebay as much because I know that tracking my purchases has been made more difficult than it needs to be. Amazon doesn't do this.,1
4987,"Dogshit update! 1/5 STARS! They added product listing to your ""bought"" page. Now under every item you buy it gives options to buy other things like it. It looks like a cluttered mess and doubles the amount you have to scroll to go through your items.",1
4988,I really love the products 😍..,5
4989,ive shopped on here for almost 10 years & i loved it but i was permanently suspended after trying to simply login to my account on my new computer. Customer service reps were condescending & refused to tell me why or how to fix things. It was fun while it lasted. I wish Ebay all the worst 🖕🏻,1
4990,Good,5
4991,"Most excellent!! The adult toys are decently priced.thats exactly why i decided to work for them.. why should we pay huge prices for earthly pleaeure.. they are moderately priced with most excellent engineering and build. Check them out and be haopy in life. Happy wife, happy life.",5
4992,"the updated eBay app is easy to use, it's very competitive and offers nice deals and suggestions. I like it very much! 😊",5
4993,"I have used eBay for over 15 years and there are just WAY too many ads in the app now. EBay takes nearly 15% of every sale made, so why are there so many ads everywhere? Just today I saw sponsored ads in my PURCHASES section after every purchase! Yes, one ad for every purchase! The usability of the app is utterly ruined with the sea of ads you're presented with. I think I will stop using this app and look for alternatives to eBay because it's gotten out of hand with the ads.",1
4994,"It works, that's all you need to know",4
4995,So good app,5
4996,Its Nice,5
4997,Fast easy hassle free,5
4998,Purchases now cluttered. Recent updates now includes sponsored frequently bought together for every item you have purchased. I dont need or want suggestions of what to buy. This new feature is annoying and intrusive.,2
4999,It makes my life easy,5
5000,It works well for me. Thanks,5
5001,"can't look through my purchases without pushy purchase recommendations getting in the way. Don't like that about the app I do not use ebay app to shop, but use computer instead.",1
5002,"Latest update just made it entirely unusable, I can't even open it.",1
5003,Exceptional,5
5004,"E-bay suspended my account permanently ""because of activity that we believe was putting the eBay community at risk"" and even I don't use my account seen last 7 to 8 months then how I perform activity that put e-bay at risk. What rubish service provide by e-bay.",1
5005,Alway a great experience on ebay!,5

5008,Ebay is My go to fot buying selling on line.,5
5009,Great experience with quality products..,5
5010,Doesn't have Jobs or Vacancies. Lots of categories to choose from. Although I don't think it's suitable for countries located outside of other than Europe or America,2
5011,Great,5
5012,Fairly navigable. Notifications are generally not too overly annoying. I do like the offers and bidding.,4
5013,Been with eBay around 25 years and love it,5
5014,love it,5
5015,Really awesome deals good shipping even with refunds and purchases eBay backs you up really well love shopping for anime items as well as car parts even toys for my kids that I can't find in any stores thank you eBay 😎✌️,5
5016,"The eBay marketplace needs no introduction. Perfect for niche and pre-owned items. The app is easy, stable and reliable. No issues here.",5
5017,Great service greate prices and delivery,5
5018,"Missing some very important features: permanent filters for all features so you can set once and not bother doing after every search. I only do buy now, used and will not buy from outside of USA. I have to set this after every search. Just logging in I get tons of recommendations for what I don't want or search for. Also, I search for used items and listings for broken junk comes up. It would be nice if only what you specifically search for comes up. Lots more missing but not getting into it.",1
5019,Awesome,5
5020,Very handy,5
5021,Had a bad experience with buying Roku camera,1
5022,Always been secure when purchasing a more honest client's and the convenience of having PayPal account.,4
5023,Love this app for books I have been able to locate and purchase several out of print special editions from sellers on here,5
5024,I buy things with better prices 😉,5
5025,In my opinion I am loving my ebay app,5
5026,"Very Good App would highly recommend it. Saves what you have been looking at, brings it all together when ur ready to buy the items u like updates you when the items U have viewed Price changes to save even more. 5 Star all the way.",5
5027,"For an old man like me, I find this app easy to use and of course eBay is easy to navigate as well. Win/win, I love it.",5
5028,Always so helpful and refreshing to have a home town longtime business 🙌.,5
5029,"Terrible app. Way to many fees, and hurdles for new sellers. Completed my first sale as a seller and all was going great until trying to collect my payout. Since I'm an ""Un-established"" seller they put a 5 to 30 day hold on MY money. On a $890 sale after fees became $627.33. Shame on you eBay. I'm sticking with Mercari.",1
5030,goog,2
5031,I LOVE how specific I can be in my searches on eBay and always be directed to exactly what I'm looking for - eBay is incredible!Poshmark needs to take lessons from eBay. Poshmark's search engine is a TOTAL JOKE! eBay is SO easy to use. I enjoy discovering items that may not be brand new but new-to-me and mostly offered at prices I can afford and receive pretty quickly. Terrific site!,5
5032,Too many scammers,1
5033,Added a card but their was a problem. I updated with a different card went through the whole process logging in multiple times then at the end after validating my new card it appears nothing happened and my old card is still active and my new card is nowhere to be seen. I still have an angry red message telling me I need to update my payment card????????. Not doing it again. Cancelled my listings and will uninstall this app. Not happy.,1
5034,I love buying and selling on ebay,5
5035,Easy to use and shop,5
5036,outstanding,5
5037,a lot off scams on their site and don't believe them if they said you're money is safe till you get product it's a bull $$$$$@@ story i lost $280 on a scams and all i get from eBay is the ticket is printed but not shipped yet and yes that is it they don't try to help or nothing seller just talked to me till i paid and poof he is of the face of the planet don't know how eBay can't just verify a person be for letting him sell stuff on there site maby in on it dont know,1
5038,Awesome. I can find everything I need even stuff you thought you could never find and probably wouldn't anywhere else but here,5
5039,I absolutely love the eBay app!! Easy and convenient!!,5
5040,"Easy to use, easy to see sellers ratings.",5
5041,"Works well, don't change it!",5
5042,Not all the features of the web site are present in the app. For example the web site nudges you to organize your watch list by creating new custom lists and saving listings into your new lists. But the app has no way to do the same nor accessing these custom lists.,5
5043,Love EBay it is the only way to shop.,5
5044,This is definitely a good place for resellers,5
5045,I find things I enjoy... And then I purchase them. At great prices with reasonable shipping. It's surprising what you can find sometimes.,5
5046,Best selling and buying app ever,5
5047,Very nice write now.,5

5052,Fully recommend,5
5053,Awesome,5
5054,"The algorithm of the app seems to be really efficient at working towards finding what you want or might want. Whether I've got spare money to spend or on a tight budget, I always manage to find what I need, or better, at a price that is reasonable. Furthermore, shopping or bidding on eBay can be genuinely a lot of fun as well as interesting. There have been many objects and products that are now part of my life that I didn't ever know existed before; I have eBay to thank for that.",5
5055,Doesn't ship to africa.,1
5056,Great app 👍,5
5057,EBay is one of my favorite marketplaces. I appreciate your service and your prices for the best products world wide.,5
5058,"Been using ebay for years, always find what I'm looking for. Ebay as a app updates fairly often with nice little changes, and has been very helpful towards me with sellers who aren't the most trustworthy.",5
5059,Great 👍,5
5060,Simple to use and well laid out,5
5061,Did NOT receive all items,1
5062,Please stop spamming us with notifications about love island and things like that. I need notifications off for my bids so I can't turn them off but I'm tired of seeing it. At least add the option to turn off advert notifications this is getting ridiculous.,1
5063,"Ebay is fine,it's the couriers who haven't got a clue what number 1 means and deliver to number 42. This isn't my first time a.delivery driver delivered to a random address, and I lose out.",5
5064,Love it,5
5065,Easy platform for buying and selling.,5
5066,best online app,5
5067,All good,5
5068,"Since app was updated July 10th...I am suffering repeated failures with listings. After hours of trial and error I have discovered that I am unable to save listings if I have used eBay's own ""Remove Background"" tool in app, whether they were taken via camera accessed through the app or via separate camera app. Aaargh!",1

5081,Works as required,5
5082,Got app and saved money on first purchase,5
5083,Simple and easy to use,5
5084,"Terrible experience all round, the final straw was after selling several items I had an item sent late and the customer requested a refund whilst it was in transit to him. The issue was resolved without issue, the next item I sell then has its funds on hold until item had been dispatched. It might seem trivial but I don't want to use my personal money to pay for postage that's the whole point of charging a fee for it when you sell the item.",1
5085,Always on time no issues if getting ur item or returning,5
5086,"Easy to use,and fast .",5
5087,Made a lot of money with this app,5

5101,Love it for the things I can't find anywhere else,5
5102,Great app,5
5103,"The level of horrendous sellers has risen on the eBay. I've bought many items where the seller didn't update the images, send out the item until a week after purchase, blame the buyer for the damaged item after they packaged it, etc. I've had to return many items recently due to seller negligence or misrepresentation. I try to be understanding but the attitudes I get from them is appalling. I'm finishing up my last transactions and deleting my account of 5 years.",1

5303,"For most of my selling days of eBay, eBay never charged you a fee to list a product. They only charged you if the product sold. eBay with you charging people now just to list a product, it tells me how greedy you are getting. When I seen a $5 listing price, I was taken back. You also are making products more expensive by doing so. If I create a product with my own two hands. And you want two different fees, Just for me to use your platform for that product, I'm like no. I'm selling elsewhere.",2

5431,Expensive items come on.,1
5432,"option to search by ""item and description"" not available or only on desktop? it reduced my sorting and reading descriptions to look for specific items. Boolean search doesn't work anymore either; results have items' names that i exclude. I get 1 page or less of matching results in the past, using advanced and/or Boolean search. Changing ""sort"" reduces results. Why? Not seen are offered after paid purchase. Infuriating. Have to go through all pages now, opening descriptions too.",2

5483,"The only way to stop notifications for recently viewed items is to disable notifications completely, so now I only purchase buy it now and don't bid or do anything else that requires reminders or notifications. Greed, hoping someone will buy is costing you sales. Look on your forums, and other forums online, which will show you people want the option to turn them off. If I was interested in the item I would have bought it, or added it to my watch list. GREED methinks.",1

My garage is not accurate that sellers are writing check as they know it removes their listing from results when it is compatible. Description popup is not formatted.

5534,"Here is a friendly tip. If you buy something from ebay and it is faulty or the wrong product and you leave a justified negative feedback. The seller can then harass you to remove said negative feedback. Depending on your response to stifle the harassment, the seller can entrap you and send a complaint ebay which then removes your negative feedback. And classes you as an extortionist. So make sure if you are a seller to harass those that leave negative feedback in the hope to entrap :)",1

5565,"eBay."" eBay has been my go to app. for alot of auto parts and even just to check and compare prices.♧",5
5566,Ebay in my opinion has to have the most horrible customer service hands down. All you do is get the run around from every single person you talk to. I've been dealing with the same issue as a seller for over 20 days now and keep getting told different things by different people. They say they offer seller protection but really nothing is in the sellers favor. The fees are insane you pretty much have to price your items at a 15% markup just to get the amount you intend to get.,1

Up to this problem, ebay would have 5 stars.",1
5603,Best place to buy things,5
5604,New update is a joke 😃 when you want to do feedback. You have to take a photo of the item you purchased 😂 otherwise you can't give feedback to the seller. 😂 protecting seller for selling dodgy products I bought items from eBay it didn't work I just but it in the bin . 😂 now I can not give feedback without photo 😂 but you can clearly see from my purchased list on my ebay app that I have purchased this item and I should be given feedback without image of the item. Joker 😁 .,1

I'm gonna have to take a break from using ebay for car parts (at the very least) and use rock auto as they don't do weird stuff like use Netflix as an auto parts sponsor.

A simple search for a Manual transmission vehicle brings back 70% cars that are in fact automatic. I know Ebay can filter out those vehicles, also stop letting the seller type in manual trans in the description. There should be fines or penalties for false advertising.",2

The company is increasingly pushy and doesn't offer the option to unsubscribe from ""offers"" from sellers of items you've browsed but not watched. All in all, I'm unimpressed.

5676,eBay allows its sellers to steal from their customers I would not recommend buying from overseas storefronts especially from China they will lie to you they will steal from you and Google does nothing about it I would not recommend using this app,1

5705,I like the ebay direct payment instead of the hassle of paypal,4
5706,eBay's app has gotten to the point it's unusable for some of the most important things a buyer wants. You may set up saved searches for something but the results will be so watered down by barely similar items that were paid to be shown at the top of the search results. Example a specific guitar model. They will force you to wade through hundreds of models that are the what you searched for. By the time the actual in item shows up you've given up looking due to seeing so many false flags.,1

5794,"Continues to be consistently bad. Cropping images crashes the app. Photo image quality is now horrendous when uploading using the app vs. desktop. This is either by design or due to the CDN forcing compression. Either way - you're not losing your mind, it's them and they don't seem interested in fixing it. This app is a persistent mess, I've had to go back to using desktop instead.",1

5816,"Customer service is horrible. Each agent tells you something different. Payouts dates adjust daily. Sent me a email for on demand payments, I sold something, then they told me i wasn't eligible. Why keep sending me the email then? I sold a coat for $100, they kept $46 for fees. eBay isn't what they used to be. 4 different agents told me 4 different things about my on demand eligibility. Seems like they just tell you anything to get you to list, then they take half, and hold your cut for 2 weeks.",1
5817,"I remember why i don't use ebay, this is the only place you can buy trash, literally stuff that doesn't work. You want a motherboard? you might be buying something that doesn't even work, its normal practice to list item's for parts, as in burned or broken.",1
5818,Very good Good prices and service if things need sorting out.,4
5819,"No sellee protection. I.e someone buys a new pair of shoes. Days later determines they cant sell them for more. Damages them. Files a return. Ebay corrals you into return. Tells you youll get ""partial refund"". Then tells you. Oh no refund and nothing can be done. Sellers make buyers and vice versa Ebay. Have some business ethics. Update. Now ebay has ""search manipulation"" I want toget my item sold. How is that manipulation.... ebays so down hill it's underground. Communist bs",1

5838,"I had a horrible experience as a seller on eBay. I shipped an order from India to New York, and the item got stuck in customs. Due to the delay, my account was suspended, and eBay refunded the buyer the full amount while the item was still in transit. Once it cleared customs, the buyer received both the item and the refund, and eBay refused to reimburse me the $790 they owe. I can't contact the buyer, and eBay's customer service is completely unhelpful. Now, I've lost both the item and the money",1

5840,The app is neat. Easy to use. I like how it syncs with the website for taking photos on your mobile.,5

They mixed my acct. up with an old card number and won't admit it. 6 hours showing the documentation. They still want me to pay again.I amwith E-bay from now on. 3 min. and done with eBay.

5913,App works smoothly on phone. Screw amzn,5
5914,I love the app I just feel like they always can do better,4
5915,Good,5
5916,Since the new update the search feature is absolute Garbage. Doesn't even show you results for anything close to what you typed in to search. The function works just fine on website so it is 100% an app issue. Go figure an UPDATE makes things worse.,1
5917,"Love it...you will, too.",5

5919,Rubbish customer service. It doesn't help seller and even juggling and lying to seller,1

5922,This is one of my favorite shopping apps.,5
5923,"I easily look for things on their site and buy some of them. The Sellers are Great to talk with and I am pleased to say that nobody has 'ignored me', if I have a delivery problem. The Quality of what I gave bought, including chocolate bars (!), has been excellent! Similarly, I have also received a quick rebate should a carrier not deliver to me, possibly 'lost in transit'. They are Great to deal with and I have discovered a number of Brilliant Products that you cannot buy in shops.",5
5924,Newest version doesnt let you input any payment details on the oneplus 5. Basically makes ebay unusable,1

5950,App needs updated badly.,2
5951,Useless. Lacks functionality. Just tried it again. Still useless.,1
5952,When you put something up for auction and don't get a single bid and you barely have any views from a sponsered post its pretty stupid to have to pay money if the item never sells. Ebay is shady and they will take your money not make you anything.,1
5953,Love the service,4
5954,Great deals outstanding service,5
5955,"Absolute garbage. The company, the staff, their platform. Hence why they not even top 10 in their own country. Disgraceful!.",1
5956,Best app ever,5
5957,Great,5
5958,I absolutely can not get a hold of a representative and the automated bot declined my phone call to a representative. The bot is not a real person and we the people need a real person. This automated bot makes you guys look bad and when we need actual help and can not get it because of a BOT. You guys need to start picking up that phone to help your users. This is a disgrace on your guys behalf. Especially when my item was illegally signed for in a farther away county from me! This is pitiful,1

5986,Works great,5
5987,Very good,4
5988,"Ebay has always been fantastic BUT, now you have to pay for returns without a refund on that. So financially I lose out if I return the item that is smaller than the seller says. Twice in 2 weeks this has happened. Last week I bought an item for £4.55 and needed to return it, the postage would cost me around £3.50, with no refund on the postage cost, so I cancelled the return. I get £1.05 refund after all that.

6039,I like it using this app when I need to.,4
6040,I've been a user for mostly purchasing for many years. My only major issue are sellers who won't ship to my post office box which I prefer using due to mail theft issues. Sellers should be forced to expose not shipping to PO boxes cleanly in their posting.,3
6041,"They used to back you, the customer, if you were sold something that wasn't right or didn't receive your order at all like me. eBay used to hold the sellers accountable for what they've posted but it's been almost a year and I went through all the hoops, filed a complaint about the seller, called eBay directly, they noticed the seller received the item and didn't refund me as promised. I also had messages from seller promising a discount on future orders and a refund that eBay saw. Still nothing",2
6042,Good app 👌,5
6043,"Such a stupid app, they take over half your earnings when you sell an item for themselves. Don't sell your stuff here, you get all your earnings on FB marketplace!",1
6044,As a seller this is the worst company I have ever dealt with. The buyer (or eBay) gave us the wrong address to send to. We sent to the address given to us. The buyer complained when the item did not arrive so eBay gave the buyer a full refund and then charged us a $22 dispute fee.,1
6045,"Do NOT sell on eBay. eBay recently changed their shipping labels to ""discounted"" rates. However, these ""discounted"" rates are not accurate & THREE times I have been in the negative when selling items online. If you want to sell online, sell on ANY other online storefront: Amazon, Craigslist, Facebook, etc. Do NOT sell on eBay.",1

Con- some items will be over priced but that is the market of supply and demand Pro - you can find that rare item that you are looking for - - items that are no longer made or manufactured - find that child hood item that reminds you of your youth.,5

6159,"Great app, I believe it's better than amazon. That is my view, I have being using ebay for quite some time.",5
6160,"Ebay promotes and protects scams, fraud, and thieves. I purchased a car part on 7/724, and as of 7/21, I do not have my part, and all my requests for a refund have been denied by the seller and eBay. The sellers are not required to deliver your purchased product, and eBay has no issue with that. eBay money back guarantee is also a scam, and there is no protection for the buyer.",1
6161,All my purchases have been exactly what I've wanted in the best quality and here do fast it's amazing👏,5

6174,"It works fine however it will be better if charges to a sold item are in rows rather being scattered all over making you to double check if they are accurate. Also, do not like the AI determination of counterfeit product which turns out to be wrong every single time ( in my case).",4

6195,Unbelievably bad. I DONT WANT the app it doesn't cover anything I need and I can't access watching or purchase on my ebay link. It keeps popping up with this unidentified page asking me to select various links. This could be anything a scam or anything. Just put it back to what it was before. Change for changes sake is just getting people offside.,1

6201,I really liked this vhs movie please. Thank you. Chet,5
6202,Bought something off the app and the seller sent me an empty box. eBay told me to speak to royal mail to resolve this which is ridiculous. Royal mail did their job by delivering the box they were given. The seller didn't send the item and eBay refused to honour money back guarantee for this sort of issue. I have spent a considerable amount of money with eBay and I am so disappointed how they have handled this. I won't be using them again. Plenty of other platforms to use.,1
6203,Good,5

6241,"I ordered a remote, but got delivered the wrong remote. I paid for the return. With address and name. But still have not had the parcel sent. It has been a long time. It is an oval Kogan brand. You sent 3 square. It is for a Kogan smart 55inch. I live at 91 Monroe Street Branxholme. 3302.",5
6242,Great place to buy or sell,5
6243,Updates have made this app no longer work on my phone. I get a technical difficulty message every time I try to use it.,2
6244,Very professional,5
6245,Incredibly confusing and useless app. eBay is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. Ripped me off with fees and suspended account for no reason whatsoever. Zero customer service and communication.,1
6246,I love ebay,5
6247,Great for selling easy fast setup,5

6259,Great app for doing business,4
6260,Use the app all the time it's great,5
6261,Do not believe Ebay when you read 2 to 4 days USA shipping. That's a deceptive practice they use to entice customers into thinking that if they order right away they will get their order within 4 days. Some sellers listed in the USA actually are in China it could take weeks before the item gets to the USA and a month before it arrives at your address and once you place the order is too late to cancel Ebay totally sucks deceiving customers so shameful.,1
6262,Always been Great!!! 💯😃,5
6263,Minted,5
6264,"Now very difficult to leave feedback. Screw it. I. not going to jump through the hoops to do it. Sorry sellers, eBay ruined it.",3
6265,These guys are a joke. I've been selling from 2003 and will never sell another thing on eBay. They fffff take 30%. It should be criminal for them to be in business still. Don't even bother. There's plenty of market places nowadays to us. Bye-bye ebay.,5
6266,easy to use and find best items,5
6267,This is an amazing app,4
6268,You locked my account because I travelled and logged in from somewhere else. Your automated assistant is no use at all. And now I have to waste my time to call you because of what? Someone hacked in my account? Why would they do that. To buy and pay for my staff?,1
6269,Great way to communicate with the seller and eBay. Also enjoy the notifications. Also like bids and counter offers & purchases.,5

6271,eBay buying and selling is made easy with smooth design and convenient features.,5
6272,Very easy to use for purchasing or selling,5
6273,"The app is good, but those AI descriptions are worth than useless. They just come from the item description + a bunch of waffle, and they take the place of an actual description written by the seller.",4
6274,It's always been good.,5
6275,"They allow racial abuse and harassment from buyers, I've sustained an attack and I've spoken to eBay several times and yet he is still allowed to send me vile messages through a false claim.",1
6276,Very good Very useful app,5
6277,Excellant service,5
6278,"Most products are good .however, a couple of the clothing purchased is under sized .",2
6279,Just ensure your device is secured. Ensure no one can excess your account. eBay is a great source of helpful information towards purchasing goods,5
6280,"Very bad company. I bought a Dyson fan, They advertise all-state product protection plans upon check out. ( I chose 3 year) If item is never sent by seller you have NO money back guarantee!! I have been messaging all State about this and just ignored, also eBay says nothing except protection plans are not eligible for money back guarantee. STAY AWAY FROM EBAY!",1
6281,"Best online shop , I have been using it for years and I have never had any troubles",5
6282,eBay is by far the most reliable way to shop (seek) anything for sale,5

6315,Great for selling and buying!,5
6316,"Excellent app! I have ordered several items lately and most of the deliveries are free, even with orders sometimes of ten dollars or less.

6330,"Watch out! Seller beware! if your item is running late in the mail, ebay may just take your money and refund the buyer and let them keep the item too. It happened to me, plus their customer service sucks now!",2
6331,No good,1
6332,I love the simplicity,5
6333,App is fine but the customer service is horrible. Seller sent the wrong item to wrong house and eBay refuses to give a refund and it's impossible to speak to a person. It's terrible.,1

And not receiving any of the items, And having my money transferred then simply not receiving ANYTHING!, is a definite way to prevent me from shopping on this app. It kinda sucks cause it was the last one I really use.. Now I don't know what to do about shopping online. Every time, it's money going out,but products never arriving.",1

6405,"eBay has been around for decades. Almost since the inception of home internet. They've stayed with the times, listened to feedback, and added plenty of protections for buyers/sellers. I have very few gripes with this app and they're all nitpicky UI issues that don't really happen on the browser version. Overall I'd say the eBay app is the single best peer-to-peer marketplace on the web and appstore 1000%. Love this app and will never stop using it as a buyer.",5
6406,"another update another huge issue. July 2024. This last update has completely ruined the search function. For example there's no option for choosing shoe size in a shoe search under the filter menu..saved searches for a particular size show as having results but display nothing. Try it. Any shoe search then pick a size from the top, zero results even though you can find them if you scroll through all the listings. Other searches are completely broken too. Hire better programmers and test!",1

6454,"After years of buying on ebay I decided to become a seller and it was the worst thing I could have done, customer service is an absolute joke after trying to switch my bank account they decided the would suspend my payouts for over a month and after 8 conversations with bloody bots I got absolutely no where!!!!

6458,Efficient. Quick. Good app,5
6459,I had money stolen from my personal bank account from ebay because the buyer to one of my items didn't receive it. When ebay said they had a money back guarantee I figured it was from ebay own pockets which everyone knows are deep but I was wrong. They forcefully take the money from the sellers bank without authorization. I called ebay and they told me I had to go though a whole process with the postal service before they could think about giving me my money back. I will never use Ebay again.,1
6460,The human representatives are great on the phone if you have issues...everything else is as expected.,5
6461,Easy to use,5

6468,"As a seller who's used this app for years, it's gone downhill. You get gouged for 20+% selling fees. The app is regularly unresponsive. Drafts regularly don't save and have to be completely restarted multiple times. Money hungry devs don't care. New UI update is atrocious. Also always side with the buyer for refunds, so be VERY vary about sending stuff through lettermail, as the buyer can easily scam you by claiming the package didn't arrive and get a full refund from your pocket.",1
6469,"Cool shopping app for quite a lot of people, just watch out for scammers",4
6470,WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THE UPLOADED PHOTOS????? THEY ARE ALL GETTING COMPRESSED AND ARTIFACTED. It's also not showing the photo when it's uploaded and then it crashes when you touch it. FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY.,1

6491,"eBay has been around awhile for a reason, and they show us why with the app. For buyers, this app is all you need. For sellers, there is room for improvement, however new features are continually added. For sellers, I recommend using the app in conjunction with a PC for best results, however if the app is all you have, you'll get along just fine and long enough to buy what you need to take it to the next level. Customer support is outstanding, so just reach out to them if help is needed.",5

6512,"To many scammers Multiple sellers have scammed or tried to scam me the last straw was s guy who black mailed me with my own money to change the feedback and eBay did absolutely nothing even though they had all the messages and proof, avoid eBay and use Amazon or a shopping website that actually cares about you and your money",1

6535,This app is useless when you need to get in touch with Ebay. Actually they need to get in touch with me in order to recover £3.19 from my account.

6556,"Useless, if you don't have a computer at hand and your talking to a ebay staff member and they ask you to copy and follow a link via the Internet not the app, the ebay app automatically stops your chat to ebay staff member and loads up on the ebay app not the Internet like you requested it to do. Needs a little sorting out this app so you can flick between the Internet or ebay app, depending on your needs. The app over powers your Internet So deleted for good and ebay works better.",1

6568,"Warning, do not sell on eBay. eBay itself has become Very biased and discriminatory against sellers. I as a seller with 100% positive feedback, was labelled a fraud and danger to community with no reason given then banned. This is happening throughout the eBay community and is being ignored, when trying to contact customer services you just get the AI runaround with no positive outcome.",1
6569,"It really doesn't make sense how these update are approved and released without testings. Are you waiting our feedback? I can't see my sales on the app due to ""sell you clotes for free""! All the time developers are looking to change something here just to keep them busy at work.",2

6579,Has been a very useful tool in adding extra income and for finding great deals.,5
6580,Best ever,5
6581,Love it!,5
6582,I like that I can sell basically what I want to and it's easy to understand. The only thing that I would recommend to change is the only way to get a good rating for your sells is relying on the customer to do a review on the item that they bought and if they don't do one then you don't get the necessary percentage for your rating to be a good rate. This is important because most people don't want to buy from a seller that doesn't have a high rating.,4
6583,Love it,5

6599,"Money hungry, greedy. Impossible to get any help, or speak with an actual person. Horrible customer(seller) support. For an example, I had a week to pay for my listing fees and was going to add a few more before I decided to pay up and they just all the sudden just charged my card.

6622,App works but 4 sentences isn't enough feedback? I'm not writing out an essay for every small purchase just to leave a star rating. Then sellers don't get their star rating to prove they are good sellers. So I'm just not going to use the company anymore.,3

6681,eBay is still automatically changing your buy it now listings to accept offers even if you turned it off. Filled the app with more ads and now less functional. More ads and less search results. Sends me messages every 2 or 3 days telling me to once again verify my information that I've verified a hundred times and to change my listings to offer 1 day handling and 90 day returns. It's ridiculous. No way to block these stupid messages either.,1

I never received my item.The shipper said delivered.Yet I never received .Sellers ,eBay and even credit company .Spun in circles .Nobody wanted to giveme the things I paid for. eBay guarantee you get item or money back. It was almost $500.They denied because it said delivered, I never got it. I did everything they asked. There guarantee is a lie. Stole$500 basically lies",1
6740,I don't know about this one so I guess if you want to download it you can you give you your rating so I don't get this one that much ratings,3

6766,The app can make things difficult . Also lately you just get the circle arrow on bkank page eveytime you go to a differe t page or look and do anything Very annoying Ebay needs to get it together and nake the app not only convient but also work correctly.,3
6767,"BEWARE of this app! There is NO seller protection. Only protecting buyers. I sold a package, RECORDED myself inspecting, SEALING, and shipping the package (a 6 min. video at the P.O.). Buyer received the package, REMOVED one item from the package, and 48 HOURS LATER claimed it wasn't as described. I asked the buyer to send me video of him opening the package, he said he didn't make one. I told him I have a video, then he immediately asked for a refund. AND GOT IT! Just use any other app!",1
6768,"Do NOT save your payment information on eBay. That information is not secure. Anyone with your name and email or phone number can call in, give an ""updated email address"" and get a password reset email. To make matters worse, eBay will proactively try and stop you from getting a refund through PayPal but won't actually help in any way. DELETE YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!",1
6769,"Very very bad experience guys, eBay send me wrong product and when i was returned eBay Takes too many time for Refunds near abot 4 to 5 month, so bad service.",1

6794,The eBay is one of the best things that ever happened convenience for those who are capable to go out and those have problem all under your finger touch your pattern choice pick what you like and guarantee on their PayPal thank you,5
6795,"Ebay allows you to put any misleading nonsense in the listing title (wrong storage capacity, features the item doesn't have) and doesn't take action when reported so clearly very happy with this situation. Additionally, search manipulation is prevelant with sellers listed a (say) £100 item and chucking an entirely unrelated 99p item is the same listing, to appear cheaper in the search results. A poor shopping experience for customers.",1
6796,Great variety of products,5
6797,Easy. No thought to it.,4

6802,It's been great the best,5
6803,Will not let me sign in message saying pardon for think you may be a bot .what rubbish All was working ok but not now.,2
6804,Ebay app is different to the desktop page. I would always suggest to people use both when looking. It's a very good app and to be honest it's easier to use than the desktop. But it's not the same when searching. Any saved searches are now almost a waste of time because let's say you type in sansui. Very rarely are you shown what's on sale. Or even say the same but cassette decks. It shows only others not sansui. So I would say 75 perc good?,5
6805,Awesome thanks I love it.,5
6806,"Excellent app, easy to use, and a great buying tool.",5
6807,Nice,5
6808,Nice app,5
6809,"I sell my products through several companies and none of them have this ""holding, managed payouts or daily payouts are on Tuesdays - thats not daily). I am used to sell item, customer receives item and is satisfied, company takes out their fees and then you get paid. But not with Ebay, all of the above takes place except the part when you get paid. What's up with that? I sold an item almost two weeks ago and still have to wait for another week from this day.😢",1
6810,awesome deals 😁 thanks 👍,5
6811,Separate suits and suit separates in the filter option. Also seperate sweaters and hoodies because they are not at all the same and it is annoying when sites combine them.,5

6817,Awsome fast service thanks.,5
6818,"I all way's use this app, and I'm happy with that.",5
6819,Very average app. The thing that bugs me is on the selling side. They will charge you money without telling you why until it's done. And the price limit per month is ridiculous. They also lock your bank in and won't let it go even if you have other payment methods,1
6820,"Very useful, and always with pay pal , I like it",5
6821,Good,5
6822,A great place to find hard to find stuff.,5

6826,"I mean it's bloody eBay, you get what you expect.",4
6827,The main feature I use the mobile app was followed searches. That worked for a while then broke in an update. It now works again so hooray. Works ok for listing items. Sometimes (often) images you crop on the mobile app are the original size when the item goes live.,4
6828,Good price,5
6829,The experience is great I like everything I ordered of eBay,5
6830,"Love the app unfortunately when someone outbids me my ebay glitches out and doesn't let me bid again, it just increases the bid forever without making me the winner",3

6847,"Good for shopping, but I think some of the sellers don't care if you receive your items or not when it gets lost in the post. I have just had this experience with a seller that I bought a headboard from and I did not received it because it was obviously delivered some where else or not.",4
6848,"I always find a great selection when looking. Best priced items for home remodel, clothing, craft stuff and books. Most recently I decided on a new to me purse, cute.",5

6853,Poor I need to contact a real person in customer service but I cannot do so because I can't log in which is one of the biggest reasons I am trying to reach him today I spoke to four different people and have been assured that these issues would be taken care of and I have found out that they have not,1
6854,"App is fine for buying things I want or need. But selling is a problem. Fees you pay are outrageous. Doesn't give you a option to decline return from a buyer that bought Any items. And last is if selling a lot of items and it goes over 600 bucks. You get a 1099k which sucks. I'm done selling stuff on ebay. If you really want to sell stuff, sell on marketplace or any other selling App which is probably better. Even when you promote it is like losing tons of money. Never selling on here again.",1
6855,Good sell stuff,5
6856,I Love This App A Lot,5
6857,Ebay is an amazing app to use but for me as a mechanic a sellers description can be misleading and the seller may send me the wrong product for a different application. I hope in the future this could be fixed and my relationship with eBay be maintained.,5

6864,Very good,5
6865,Very bad service. Cannot trust to delivery time frames they never on time. And no responsibility. If item gets lost or delivered to wrong address. There is not possibly to have it solved. They will automatically make it delivered with some fake traffic info. Which you can't even verify this. eBay administration is always on the side of person which have more businesses with. Stay away.,1

I get it, and it doesn't fit like it said it did, it was the correct product, it was labeled as the correct product, the pipes were bent and wouldn't even slide together, and then u couldn't send it back for a refund. I won't be using this app again.",1
6888,Ebay take so much money from sales nowadays. Its no point even using them. Not the company it used to be!,2
6889,"Don't expect to get any useful help unless you talk to customer support, which are equally useless, and seem to have no control over what really happens to my account. Completely useless response to my emails for help, and copy and pasted answers from the stupid AI help bot.",2
6890,Great for making a bit of extra cash while times are hard.,5
6891,Not Yet Sold anything. Maybe when I do my rating will be higher.,3

6934,"The shipping program is ridiculous, with increased prices sometimes upwards of several hundred dollars. Up to 6 weeks for delivery from the USA to Australia. Your parcel spends 2 weeks or more bouncing around it's Various centres before even being processed by customs. Then up to another 2 weeks before it reaches destination country. Ask questions?

6960,I don't know what's going on with this app. The app is broken again. I can't change cards during checkout or at all with PayPal. It doesn't take you to paypal to choose the payment to use What a waste of a revenue stream. That needs to get changed back.,1

7051,Improvedbuying power,5
7052,great app.,5
7053,Scalpers and scammers everywhere. Needs to let buyers block sellers from view. Spammers misusing every popular keyword clog up the search results. Bad sellers get 100% good feedback bc they get ebay to remove every negative feedback.,1

A perfect combination!❤",5

The issue I have and the reason for a one star rating is because the app no longer actually takes you to PayPal to complete your purchase. For more expensive purchases, I often times like to use the pay in 4 method PayPal offers. Since the app no longer takes you to PayPal for checkout, this option is no longer available to me or my potential buyers. Ebay, please fix this so that option is once again available to everyone",1

7203,Having to pay taxes on something I already paid taxes and want to recoup some money from is the main reason I stopped selling on eBay.

7261,Ebay has their days coming. You allow sellers to rob and steal from others and get no punishment. When the buyer leaves the correct negative feedback you allow them to have it removed. Especially if they are a big seller. I have saved screenshots to prove this as real factual evidence. So you can't deny it. It's truth. It's facts. Everyone that allows this to take place makes themselves involved with this crime. It makes every government commit crimes that allows this to take place in their coun,1

7284,Ebay has really gone to hell. It's such a hassle. It's a total waste of time to try to sell anything on this site. Not to mention buy it either. Pretty much everything from there is from China anyway and you can get it off Temu for even cheaper and if you're selling stuff well might as well go to Facebook marketplace cuz at least that way you have good customer service. I honestly don't see this company lasting too many more years.,1

7465,Very good app. Product arrives on time and not damaged.,5
7466,Why does feedback section show prices in US Dollars instead of UK Pounds. Why are you now being forced to rate every item in order to complete the Feedback ???

7485,"I've been using this app since it first came out. It has worked pretty well until the last 4 months. The last update is horrible when it comes to managing drafts. The delete feature is WAY too sensitive. You can barely touch a listing and poof! It's gone. No prompt if you are sure you would like to delete. Just gone. I'm not the only one this has happened to. It is so frustrating after doing all the work of creating a listing, researching the item, and adding photos . Please fix this Ebay!!!",5

7497,"Perfect, it's just perfect!!!",5
7498,"I love eBay. If it's not purchased from eBay, it's purchased from IKEA.😁",5
7499,"Probably one of the most unorganized, non-transparent, immoral companies a seller can deal with in business today. They lie about the % they take for fees, as they put their fee on taxes acting as it is revenue when no accounting nor IRS considers sales tax as revenue. This percentage adds up to min. Of 1% more of total revenue. They did 10 billion in total rev last year approx. So they made 10million on a fee that is not factored in for the seller 13.5%, which is 14.5 in reality👎🏼",2
7500,Very good app working well for mi,5

7508,Cheap and good,4
7509,"compared with the pc version it's fairly good. The search engine gets confused sometimes though. I tried to search for some things that are not 'main stream' and it ran to irrelevant stuff. The browser version has done this also, but it was a rare thing. Search engines need to pay attending to everything asked not just part of it.",4
7510,The app is great for buyers and sellers alike. Fees and shipping costs have skyrocketed but what hasn't I guess? Problem is these super cheap buyers looking for $50 worth of something for $5. Not even worth my time and effort. Sad part is sellers are giving in to these cheapskates and destroying the market for us who know what our products are worth. If I'm selling something w/ OBO it doesn't mean I'm stupid & desperate please take advantage of me.,4
7511,"I feel safe shoping there,I love shopping I got all I need from Ebay ❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂",5
7512,Love ebay,5

7532,"Ebay does not protect you from buying prohibited items and deleted all my drafts selling items without my approval... Apparently, it seems from a recent chat with one of their representatives told me to just try and stay away from them even though thier on their app/website... why are we not being protected before purchasing these prohibited items?!?! And since when can you not sell light bulbs on eBay, they took down my listing???",1
7533,"Made an account, set up payment, ordered an item, account got permanently suspended. They won't tell you what you did wrong, and you aren't allowed to make a new account. The app's interface is clean, I guess. Not clean enough to make up for my account getting banned for no reason, though. -- UPDATE: Sorted it out with customer service. I got banned because I was using a VPN. Got my account reinstated in 10 minutes.",3
7534,"I had given this app x5 stars,then updated about 10 mo ago,where I changed it to x3 stars,due to every update literally making the app worse. I cannot understand why all the constant updates that either 1)don't actually do anything beneficial or 2) don't fix anything, just make it 10x worse than before. Last time I complained about listing drafts not saving. Now the lowest offer amount ,under Best offer, no longer allows me to input my amount it chooses its own & picture edits won't save either",2
7535,"Great and easy in use, sometimes does glitch but quick restart usually helps it, it could be improved with a new interface something easier",5

7733,Easy to find what your looking for.,5
7734,I like that the shipping is all adding in the final amount,5
7735,Easy to navigate and good prices,5
7736,I have been an ebayer for years and have never had an issue.,5
7737,Your Refund process is incorrect,1
7738,Beware... Do not sell on this app thdy will lie to you and rob you blind! I listed a brand new $100 work light. ebay said it was free for me to list but then took nearly half of the $65 it sold for in fees i wound up with $35.,1
7739,Makes finding and purchasing items that would be difficult to get a stress free job .,5
7740,Clunky for listing and selling,3
7741,Unable to make puchases when seller offers a discount on origanal price . This has been reported but still waiting on answers ..... WHY SO ???,3
7742,"Ebay has Great products,great customer service, they are friendly and there to help. I am a repeat customer and have no complaints. Thank you",5
7743,"Easy to use, learning from the prompts and on my own was very seamless. Would recommend to anyone looking to buy or sell online",5
7744,Still better than Amazon but in general the changes to facetime search are bad here to. I know everyone in e-commerce likes to simplify the facets and filter selection available for customers but I'd rather be able to choose them myself rather than them being hidden. If the product data is there why not include it.,3
7745,Quality good products reasonable prices,5
7746,"Things within the app have been updated and different since I listing anything. But finally figured it out, and now it's easier.",5
7747,Easy to use. Loads of choice and safe to buy.,5
7748,"Absolutely stupid is running this company,They let scammers buy items and return the wrong item and still get a refund,this is just an FYI to be careful as a seller.",1
7749,Awesome so far,5
7750,Ebay is how you get things done!,5
7751,Very good,5
7752,"Easy to understand and enjoy using the app. Feedback is hard to find us the only drawback, but overall very good",4
7753,Ebay doesn't listen to feedback. The fees are exuberant with no justification. I hope eBay eventually fails and falls prey to a better item hosting service.,1
7754,Skibidi toilet,5
7755,"Sold something to someone, the person lied about the product and why they returned it. Got the item back, nothing was wrong with it. And because the buyer lied, I was charged. Ebay did nothing to help me as the seller and pretty much don't care about the seller. If you are reading this, please be careful selling on ebay and I suggest to find another platform. This company doesn't care about the seller at all.",1

7780,Great app thanks,5
7781,Trusted.,5
7782,Cool,5
7783,"Some sellers are not disclosing that there is a reserve price to be met. You bid on an item, the auction ends, you're the highest bidder, your bid is cancelled, seller relists same item again. I checked my bid history. My bids concerning these items are missing. No trace.This happens too often. I called eBay. No help. They did say that these sellers do this to avoid paying reserve fees. Don't waste time on eBay auctions. Scams. Stick with reputable sites instead. And shipping prices are too high",1

7859,"I did not enjoy this app. Not only is it annoying and unintuitive to navigate, but merely having it installed disallows me from checking my messages on ebay's website, as when i click on my account, it auto-launches the app. After a few minutes, I could not figure out how to check messages in the app, so now I have to uninstall just to be able to check my messages on the website.",1

7869,Ebay is great!,5
7870,"Now I can't pay for items Ive agreed to purchase......... This app has really went down hill. Search has starting including items unrelated to the search terms. Notifications are completely irrelevant, you'll remind me about a listing I viewed a month ago, but not a single reminder that watch list items are ending soon (notification tests pass). Do you want me to spend money or your platform or not?",1

7885,I don't remember wat my sign in is how do I get it,5
7886,Stop changing things. I really don't like the last 2 updates for listing the bubbles across the top. I want to see everything across the top like it was not have to click on something to see my selling options across the top.,1
7887,Terrible option if you want to sell anything. And even when it comes to buying everybody is just so incompetent with the smallest tasks these days. Amazon or local is the only way to go sadly,1
7888,Always great to buy products here but it can be a hassle w/vendors that advertized but never deliver the goods. Either out of stock or poor quality & often will not replace it. It cost more to shipped it back than one purchase it.,5

This is literally my first time ever using eBay because I'm getting tired of waiting on buyers from Facebook Marketplace, so I don't understand what's suspicious about this. I contacted costomer support and they refused to reinstate my account... with no explanation... everything about this is just horrible!",1
7908,Very good apps for shopping,4
7909,👍,4
7910,"I use this app a lot, used to love it, but as with a lot of apps they change things for the sake of it and make things worse, the latest (see full description) is terrible, it goes to a small viewing window were a lot of the time the words and photo's don't fit in, you can't enlarge the viewing window as it just enlarges what inside meaning you see even less, why can't you learn to leave things alone that are working fine, the person who came up with that idea is a idiot.",3
7911,I like especially the integrity of the traders who sell their wares here.,5

I had a major issue with a shoe that I bought recently and I am amazed with eBay's current customer service. In this day and age of automation, I never expected an actual human being to call me directly to gather more information in order to assist me in resolving this issue and for that I am greatly appreciative and will continue to shop on eBay with more confidence than ever!",5

7930,Good,5
7931,Make sellerrs give buyers their feedback as soon as the item is paid for. Sellers don't need to wait for the item to be delivered to give feedback or even wait for buyers to leave their feedback...,1

8068,"Search options and results are misleading. When searching, a certain number of results will be displayed that is different from what the app claims. And then, when sorting results, the app will omit results, and even has the audacity to say ""No results found"" -- what do you mean, no results found? There were 38 results before I asked you to simply arrange them by price! ""No results found"" . . . you're going to have ""no customers found"" if this isn't fixed.",2

8153,"I have used this app for years. Now it is unusable. When I try yo check out from my cart it gives me an error (99) unable to start check out. The search and sort options are a joke. This app wastes way too much of my time to do something that used to be so simple and I am real tired of getting notification about items that I look at or notification about simular items that I just bought. Here is something brainless. If I just bought one I probably don't need another one. TOTAL TRASH, UNINSTALL",1

8180,"Good services , simple and easy to use",5
8181,"Worst worst worst, I returned an item from my money although seller did sent a wrong item. I spent extra for international return. Ebay didn't returned my money even after 15 days that tracking is not available although I provided all pics and the receipt of return. And even seller didn't returned. I was new to ebay. And had worst experience Shein and temu are way better than this app. They respect and regard their customer and also trust their customer. But this ebay app is a cheat app.",1

8196,"No where in the selling side of the app, anywhere in the instructions or explanation of fees, does it explain to you that when you select buyer pays shipping, that the buyer will pay shipping, and then you will also have to pay for the label, essentially paying eBay shipping twice. The buyer pays a fee on top of the price that you charge, and then you pay the same fee for some reason even tho it has already been paid. It's taken out of your price. Even tho they paid on top of your price. Why??",3

8270,I've had some fantastic items off eBay *****👍👍👍,5
8271,I am looking for extra large apparel Military Originals,4
8272,Should be illegal to charge transactions fee on grand total including tax and shipping should be the percentage calculated off the item sold. Item sells for 232.50 Taxes and shipping bring total to $290 They charge 45$ in fees I got no problem with the cost of doing business but this is a crooked business practice. Charging a higher percentage of the final sale price by using taxes and shipping to make the final price higher. Shame on eBay. 45$ off of 232.50 is what 19.25% ora little more?,5
8273,Great company. Thank,5

This app is trust worthy, just read carefully a seller's reviews, from what I've seen, this app does care about the user in the app, definitely a good app to buy online, works just fine for me and its easy to buy both from mobile devices and from its website for computers, 100/10!",5
8392,Been using eBay for 20 something years now and still haven't found a better substitute for my impulsive online shopping. 5/5,5

8394,"App is functional but basic. I installed it to claim the app-only voucher and promptly uninstalled it again. Without tabs it is impossible to side by side compare alternatives when buying on eBay. The general UI feels laggy and slow compared to a browser, so I shall continue using my browser.",3
8395,"Simple, straightforward and effective",5
8396,Good app,5
8397,Easy to use,5
8398,Great,5
8399,No longer always bring up the PayPal review order link. Which means you might be forced to figure out how to cancel an order you wanted to use a specific payment method for and it auto used the wrong one.,1

8401,Alot of people are asking... Is the eBay app good? Well yes it is!!!,5

8403,Epic very good👅,5
8404,"eBay is such a waste of time, it takes forever and a day to list an item by having to upload one photo at a time, and scrolling through your entire gallery to find the pictures each time. They should probably take some pointers from Vinted. no wonder nobody is buying or selling by using this rubbish left behind platform!",1
8405,Perfect 💯💪🏽,5
8406,scam they don't refund my money,1
8407,Excellent,5
8408,Absolutely love eBay thank you thank you.,5
8409,Utterly stupid new update to ebay where if you make an offer on an item you are forced into paying for the item via PayPal or card. Which is forced delivery costs too even though the seller has the option for cash on collection. Ebay you really need to sort this out because I am not the only person who is getting fair annoyed with it and just resorting to Facebook marketplace. Cash is still a legal tender and you should not be enforcing methods not to be able to use it....,1
8410,Good,5
8411,Easy to use on android,5

8429,"Best app ever. I am a seller (At-Home Technologies LLC) of refurbished and upgraded (CPU, RAM, SSDs, GPU) Lenovo and DELL laptop computers. Making enough to support my four member family and the business expenses. Used to sell on Amazon very successfully until they took my and other sellers ideas and decided to do it also directly competing with their mom and pop or even larger sellers. Ruined my Amazon business as they prioritized their product in searches leaving our product on page ~7, 8, 9.",5

8445,Awesome,1
8446,When trying to send offers with a 5% discount the app states you have to send a minimum of 5% and doesn't let you send the offer even though it is 5%. It seems anything lower than 10% is not allowed now?!,1

8464,It's a shame they have allowed eBay to turn into a temp reseller app. Look for the cool things you used to find on eBay at mecari right. Cause eBay is invested in mercari.,1

8511,"This entity is bias to potential shoppers do not purchase there gift cards you will have hard time acquiring your purchase. They try to push you into credit card purchasing. Warning to the poor you need a bank card and that may pose a problem look into virtual debit cards for card safety. Low income folks should be careful of acquiring cards like Venmo.Paypal ecetera you pay fees to utilize these cards. eBay thrives on this you are better off with Ali Baba express app,Shien,or Temu.",1

8517,What is new in this updated version? Now just a few lines in what the app does since the beginning of time! New version but some function of the app are broken now!!°°,1
8518,Abysmal search engine. Have no search parameters to isolate down to a specific sport or league. Get a clutter of terrible search results when a common name is used. Quite annoyed with results with partial match as they are not even remotely close to what I'm looking for.,1
8519,Good,5
8520,It's always good,5
8521,Better that Amazon!,5
8522,Some of the products are a bit hit and miss. The description of some of the products is very miss leading . I think you need to do a little bit if spot checking and testing on the products . But over all it's not a bad app it's easy to use thanks 👍,4

8539,I wish they had an option you can tick to which items you want to buy together from your basket would make the app perfect,4
8540,"I have seen a significant decline in the quality of goods sold on eBay especially in the area of jewelery. More sellers are misrepresenting the synthetic or glass stones as being real gemstones and CZs as the new lab grown diamonds which are not the same thing. If you rightfully give the seller a negative review, the seller offers the reviewer financial incentives to change the review to a positive review rendering the review system meaningless. Very disappointing eBay. My trust is broken.",2
8541,My account was suspended right after I made my first purchase with no explanation. So I don't even know if I'll get my package and I don't know how to reinstate my account. And I don't know how to get a refund if my order doesn't come because the money WAS taken out of my account. All I was doing was purchasing a bib for my baby.,1
8542,Great experience long time eBay Plus member,5
8543,"UI translation is forced based on region/shipping address, despite system language being set to english. It's inconsistent, incomplete, and just plain annoying and can't be turned off. Edit: search queries seem to be translated too since some product searches yield 0 results despite having dozens listed.",1
8544,I really like shopping.,5

8555,I can't buy nothing on ebay. I try to add to the cart. It says try to do it again. And if I go and buy it now. It says the sell does not take offers. I erased the Ebay app. I will deal with Amazon from now on,1
8556,Its like going to a yard sell an they ask for Tax it should not be on used items but new items i would understand it makes me not want to buy anything because I buy something now than tax is 5 to +10 dollars,4
8557,Great purchases and security..,5
8558,"Makes it easy to shop. I like to find books and other hard to find items, and eBay has rarely disappointed me",5

8571,Very good,4
8572,"So far, so good! The only thing I would recommend is that eBay remove sellers that fall below a certain percentage rating and that sellers be required to provide (at all times) a tracking number. It's literally free!!",4
8573,Have been on Ebay for many years and it has always been a great experience!,5
8574,so easy to use,5

8593,If they don't rip you off double dipping by taxing USED merchandise? The taxes for that item has already been paid. They turn into deadbeats & won't stand behind their own policy by letting seller's rip you off. I've been getting the run around for 4months.,1
8594,Love ebay,5
8595,"Haven't been disappointed with any orders yet. Some orders do run late, but I think that is mostly a Post Office issue.",5
8596,eBay is such trash now you can't leave negative reviews. Buyers don't pay for their auction they win and eBay doesn't do nothing about it. I'm going back to Facebook Marketplace.,1
8597,Ebay is the best place to shop for collectibles Like them the best.,5

8621,Very good,5
8622,"App not set up for Users. eBay wants you to bid early and often, so, at the beginning of an auction you'll get a lot of alerts; at the end of the auction, one. When you look at your Watchlist you won't see any Buy It Now items in the mix. In your search results you can have items that don't match your search, but look like they are the same things. I need to be able to add items I've won to my list, but it's nearly impossible to get a receipt for item(s) you bought.",4
8623,Can usually find just about anything you need on eBay I use it for buying strange things you know you can't get anywhere else,5
8624,don't work properly… ..!!!.. developers seems to be a bit busy!! ..2024 .. still problems with app !!😠😡,1

8628,"Almost 15% in selling fees now is a joke. And of course, ebay assesses the fee including shipping and sales tax, which the seller gets no part of to begin with, ensuring they rip you off for as high of an amount as they can. Use Facebook marketplace for free whenever you can.",1

8669,Worst platform to sell. I posted a laptop ad . Somebody offered me my desired amount. But later on i found out it was a fraud buyer. I cancelled the order and posted Again I got a fraud buyer once again. I told eBay about it. They did nothing. On top of that they demanded $103.30 from me for no damn reason. I didn't get any money from any buyer. If I try to call them that is impossible. If I contact their help section that is full of garbage. Please delete eBay app as soon as possible.,1
8670,Excellent 👌👍,5
8671,"I am doing this for the first time. I've had these coins for about 17 years and so I decided to look into them and I saw quite a few that sold for alot of money.

8678,Love it,5
8679,Damn near impossible to actually communicate with ebay employees.. or anyone for assistance.,2
8680,It has improved a lot. Specially in Shipping services. It should add that all items to have the customer reviews and comments for better selection. Also should add the option to choose the reviews from 4 and 5 stars to the filter options It will be good to add a live chat like Amazon to discuss anything related to the purchase.,4

8688,"For the past month, since an update logged my out I haven't been able to log back in!!! Called customer service twice, absolutely no help... getting feed up!",1
8689,Best app ever.,5
8690,Dope,5
8691,This app is good but i would give it a 5 star if we could send invoices with it.,5
8692,This company NEVER supports you as a seller and always makes it so the seller loses out. I'm moving elsewhere I've had enough of the terrible way you handle the people who actually bring you your income. Disgusting. Avoid eBay. Its not what it used to be,1
8693,It's eBay on your phone.,5
8694,Great way to browse and buy on Ebay. Excellent experience every time. Listing fees and final value fees is what keeping me from selling on eBay,5
8695,Great app. Definitely a great side hustle. 5 stars all day!,5
8696,"Unable to sign in to app, keeps telling me there's a technical issue and to try back later? The app is up to date. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, didn't help!",2
8697,Easy to use.,5
8698,Been good Soo far. Bout 5orders deep,5

8700,Decent,3
8701,Like,5
8702,"no problems, works well",5
8703,Always have what I need,5
8704,"After 4 yrs I deleted my account because payment information disappeared, but I will make another account in a week or so . My payment information was always there, I will not stop purchasing on eBay because I'm on SSI and they have awesome stuff 👍☝️",4
8705,So worth it just got a very good Dyscon Animal Vac for $70.. eBay is killing it,5
8706,Very easy to use,5
8707,Works great. Use it all the time.,4
8708,"Well that went from a great app to an awful one real fast. After my first sale I'm apparently a risk on the site and no further details were given other than that. Thanks... another update found out it was my card issue on file wasn't the right one but now I'm stuck on a ban list, and you won't let me just pay for it through the money I made in the sale? Also I want to put a card that'll work but now I'm suspended and it won't let me. Also the email with a link to help didn't work....",1
8709,This is a great app. Never miss a deal. Find what can't be found anywhere.,5
8710,"Great price ,great deals.",5
8711,Selling and buying more fun on eBay than Amazon,5
8712,Seriously,5
8713,Always handy.,4
8714,Hot app I love it,5
8715,Extreme advertising and manipulating searches. Not showing cheap items or making very very difficult to find cheap items. The Government should take notice and fine heavily this Monopoly.,1
8716,It is totally embarrassing how badly Ebay polices their site concerning the proliferation of faked and knock off products. I just went through and found ten knock offs without even hardly searching. Items with name brands like Bose with model numbers that don't exist for items they have never manufactured. It is obvious Ebay has zero concern for the theft of consumers money and manufacturers reputation.,1
8717,Awesome,5
8718,🥰,5
8719,Plenty of good stuff,5
8720,"It didn't make me pay for making a listing, and it's really easy to find things.",5

8725,Ain't as bad as you think but haven't gotten my order yet so we'll see no meat riders here,5
8726,I don't have any gripes about it. I used to use eBay before it had an app.,3
8727,Makes it so much easier to shop through my account! Love it!,5
8728,Got really good deal. Seller marked as dispatched by evri n tracked but would not provide tracking number. Didn't receive it so I asked for tracking no. Seller just refunded. I don't believe he ever posted it cos it was sold so cheap. Ebay just allow to mark iten as dispatched even if it has not been physically posted. Can't trust the app,3
8729,excellent,5
8730,Awesome app that let's me keep track of what's happening with my account and it gets better and better .,5
8731,You get what you think cheap reliable,5
8732,OK but if you sell and take it of you have to pay them the money DONT SELL!,2
8733,Nice,5
8734,Nice,5
8735,Worst site to look for stuff can not get ahold of anyone to talk to about problems,1
8736,The gold standard for buying used stuff,4
8737,"Was a great app now after having successful sales, now can't sell, now getting declined and all for different reasons all for the same product. Each time its a different reason what an absolute joke it had become to be a seller on this app! It won't be long before this app is in trouble for finances as people are looking else where! Better apps out there now, my gain your lose 👍🏼",1
8738,None right now.,4
8739,Good,5
8740,Easy to use Easy to buy Easy to sell,5

8744,There's lots of choices,5
8745,LOVE IT 😍,5
8746,"Had my account since 2013 and this week decided to sell my first ever item, within a day it was taken down for being counterfeit (with absolutely no reasoning). I have had this product authenticated, and I bought it myself from the actual store. It is not counterfeit. Come to find out that even if you appeal it, they're automated system might just flag it again and delete my account! Looks like I will never ever be using eBay again. Great job.",1
8747,Everything goes well,4
8748,"Done with ebay. I spent at least $12,000 on ebay this year. And I also sell. Their selling fees are outrageous. But now they took away the paypal pay in 4 option. Which is the final straw for me. Watch how much ypu lose in sales from multiple people and let me know if that any idea makes any friggin sense. Off to mercari from now on",1

8759,Excellent,5
8760,"Great app, great features. If only the website version was this good.",5
8761,"This might actually be the worst app if youre trying to sell instead of buy. Just sold something for 200 and ebay somehow robbed me of $60 lmfao. I thought depop was bad but at least they gave me a shipping label and didnt rob me at gunpoint of like 30% of my payment ☠️ If youre looking to sell just go to depop or vinted instead of this app with highway robbery disguised as ""selling fees""",1
8762,Very pleased with the service.,5
8763,Good services and excellent quality and product,5
8764,I love it it's very easy and fast,5
8765,I had a tuff time sending my payment thru this morning .so I got aggravated and took purchase out basket I will not be ordering anything from eBay any more,1
8766,Very reliable and fast delivery. Thanks for the quality and service,5
8767,Excellent,5
8768,Essential in my daily routine!,5
8769,I'm not sure why the updates keep making the app worse but here we are. So many issues to list but my one bug is when trying to send multiple offers it won't let me send 5% even though it states 5% or more. It will only allow 10% offers. Really not a fan of the app.,2
8770,I like shopping here on eBay,5
8771,Very very good thanks 👍😊,5
8772,Does what it is supposed to do. Very reliable.,5
8773,"App makes it incredibly difficult to do business. It crashes often, barely loads efficiently, and causes me to miss notifications, makes it difficult to reply to customers. Then they have the nerve to charge a fee per transaction. It's like you are paying them to make your business bad. I would recommend other sites until they get their act together.",1
8774,Super,5
8775,Good,5
8776,Love my ebay,5
8777,App good. Ebay charges not so good. Although the clothes charges are great,5
8778,Always used ebay for decades now as ebay always helps with refunds or replacements. Amazon is a joke as its big warehouses but ebay uses independent sellers that use more are before and after . 5 stars ✨,5
8779,Very good,5
8780,Greedy. They keep raising the fees and now it's $2.00 to cash out. They raised the fee and then said they did it to simplify the process. It only simplified it for eBay to make more money for something that should be free,1
8781,easy to use,5
8782,EBay is awesome.,5
8783,Works as expected,5

8807,"I have been a loyal eBay seller and customer for years, however, eBay's recent policy change to no longer allow PayPal pay in 4, is an absolute slap in the face for buyers.

8835,Works well. Does what it is meant to do.,5

8846,"⚠️SELLERS BEWARE:⚠️ FEES are very high. They haven't changed or updated anything of any real note, they've just increased fees and made certain things harder to find that they want to edge out of the sellers periphery. It's no wonder so many other apps are taking ebay's place, it's only a matter of time before ebay is dead.",1

And other time, sellers, I find a little unfair when the option to put in a lower offer ,even on small. It seems they not willing to think the offer is still there. Idea for customers, buy should specify limit to save time and us have impression of false hope to buy. This seems to be getting more and more common . I can't see the point most of the time. Mr T CAMPBELL",4
8996,I'm very impressed with the ebay app,5

9005,Great,5
9006,Very Nice app,5
9007,"Change: remove fake reviews. show info for ""a seller you've bought from"" -maybe you DON'T want to deal with them again! don't allow clickbaity listings (main image different to cheaper unrelated product). duplicate listings from same seller should be hidden. time to feedback should be longer. Filter options in alphabetical order-try filtering for a phone model under phone cases omg what a nightmare. Would love a ""block seller"" option to not see their things ever.",1
9008,Great items and 9/10 Customer service,5
9009,"eBay is great i love online shopping with them, i wouldn't use anyone else as far as online shopping... And would recommend all my friends to shop with ebay online they have wonderful deals and prices... I will not shop with any other site but eBay they are the best 👍👍👍👍👍👍",5

9020,I never had any problems with the ordering my parts always got here on time,5
9021,It is absolutely outrageous that Ebay charges fees for used shoes. also it is outrageous that eBay charges a % of the postage when the postage cost is set by eBay. this was the last time I sold something on the platform. Vinted is the way forward!,1
9022,Fun and easy way to make a few extra bucks. I clean my winter stuff and set aside what I don't want n e more and list it on ebay before I take it to second hand stores anme when I do my spring cleaning fun and easy great app,5

9032,Awesome,5
9033,"How else would you view ebay on an Android. Would like to have multiple pages open, to compare items. Edit: I've been an eBay'er for many years now. Been a seller and a buyer. I see less small users and more mega sellers but that is the trend of the entire internet I suppose. A shame really. The internet, and it's services, used to be for the people but now there for the corporations. Just like real life...",4
9034,Easy in almost every way,5
9035,"BEWARE of this app having access to your camera! Someone sent me a photo of two watches they were debating buying. One was a Citizen, the other was a Bulova. Both photos had the Sam's Club price tags. A few minutes later the ebay app sent me a notification recommending I look at Citizen and Bulova watch options on eBay! I went back and looked at my messages and my friend never mentioned the names of the watches and the only suspicious thing that the ebay app had access to was my camera.",1

9041,It's a wonderful platform,5
9042,"Decent app but the developers have not enabled the ability to turn off some types/categories of notifications. So you can't just opt in to notifications regarding sales and purchases, you currently have to also opt in to marketing notifications which are obnoxious. Hopefully they will introduce notification categories.",2
9043,The mobile version is terrible. They take your money and don't care to fix anything,1

9074,"Great Android app for purchases. For selling items, you're better off creating the listing initially as a draft on the phone (upload all photos) then use the web browser on a PC to edit and submit as there are more features there.",5
9075,"Ever since whatever update that's been done, I can no longer view the description of any listing on eBay with my s22.",1
9076,eBay keeps saying upgrade to the latest version i went on playstore there is no latest version I go on play store and it says no updates needed.

9119,Good experience buying here,5
9120,Predatory to sellers allows buyers to break a product then send it back and covers it under ebay money back guarantee so seller is forced to refund. Don't sell on ebay,1

9162,Easy to use.,5
9163,What has happened to this app?? Running latest version on Moto G60s and Android 12. App opens for a few seconds then terminates! Sooo frustrating...,1
9164,"Love using this app, BUT they don't listen to their sellers. Constantly losing sales because Ebay forces ""make offer""on items priced to sell, customers send offers, get refused and walk away. Everyone wants profit, if I factor in a good price, I don't expect to get undercut by Ebay, who won't budge on its percentage and fees. Also adding a USPS priority box option took almost a week just to list 1 item. UPDATE : THEY DON'T LOOSE MONEY, I DO IF THEIR SITE CHARGES CUSTOMER LOWER FEE ON SHIPPING.",1
9165,Reliable and easy to operate,5

9206,Ok,5
9207,My favourite online shop.,5
9208,Sometimes I get emails from eBay asking for item specifics that I do not have. Most features of this app work fine but if you use two factor authentication for PayPal it throws you out into the web browser for payments which is not what I would have expected. The eBay app works fine otherwise.,4

9250,*cus they wouldn't let me do 3 & 1 ½ stars*,3
9251,Ebay has terrible service for sellers. One of of my buyers returned a different damaged item and ebay sided with him on spite of ample photographic evidence. Lost $75. Note to all buyers: ebay will side with you no matter what. Just keep stealing. Render the app unsuable and a better one will replace it.,1
9252,"Most of the time I look something up on ebay. Find good bargain, good service works for me.",5
9253,"I love eBay, it has been around longer than most other online selling platform. The majority of sellers accept bids, which offers the buyer the ability to pay the lowest price ( often across the web), not to mention you can find pretty much any and everything. My only gripe is that eBay needs to give a warning to the buyer about unfulfilled bids - which locks you into a purchase. If you don't pay, 1st ""offense"" will be a 30 day NO bidding lock, then PERMANENT NO BIDDING. A little heads-up, IMO.",4

9305,"For the most part, it's a good, simple to use system. I do not understand, however, why there is no mechanism to block dishonest sellers. Within any given category, it's usually the same scam artists, and the app would be a lot easier to use if I didn't have to sift through so many spam listings to find what I was looking for. Edit: They are now investigating fraudulent listings using AI, and it is finding egregious fraud to NOT be in violation of Ebay's terms. Ebay is not a safe place to shop.",1

9341,Selling is such a mess. I've sold 3 things total being 95 dollars in funds. I received 44 dollars and am now being charged 12 dollars for something else. The amount of money it takes is insane.,1
9342,Sucks,1
9343,My overall experience is great. I have gotten my packages fast and handled with care.,5
9344,I love ebay!! Try not to buy from private sellers and if you do ALWAYS check out their seller score!! Anything lower than a 97% don't buy!! But when buying from non private sellers look for ebay certified referbished!! You will find deals you could only dream of!! And they are like buying the product brand new!!! I've bought some AMAZING headphones at the most unbelievable prices!!,5
9345,Great soo far😄,5
9346,I do all my ordering on Ebay.,5
9347,very good 👍,5
9348,Please add an option to find out the items first on the searching list that we are looking for by those sellers who provide international shipping. It will be helpful to find out easily who can provide international shipping.,5
9349,App works great!,5
9350,It's ebay can't get better,5

9374,Seems useful to me,5
9375,More confusing to use than the website.Everything takes too long. I don't like the layouts particularly of watched and for sale goods.,4
9376,I try to buy from a deal someone sent my and it says my app is out of date. But no update shows in Google app store. Google Pixel C.,1
9377,Generally great. However the UI sometimes is harder to use than the browser based site,4
9378,"The app recently has become really poor. Viewing the items description is now very tedious and seach manipulation listings are rife ..... EBay know this, don't seem to have a care and do nothing about it. I used to turn to ebay for a lot of my shopping needs, but these days as the app is so poor and searching through the listings is so tedious, it's more of a last resort these days.",1

9387,"This app gets the job done. You want to find stuff you're looking for? Done. You want to compare similar items by different sellers? Done. Usually one expects an app to be an inferior version of a website. This one gives you so much of what you need, packed in your little phone screen. The only thing to complain about is the sellers, but the app maker has no control over that. Great job, app developers!",5
9388,Everything I've got off e bay I've been really pleased with it.,5

9433,"The newest update has now made the app literally usable. Can't send offers out to buyers. Drafts can't even be opened. Slowly and slowly, everything is just breaking on this app.",1
9434,"Good app for buyers, but bad for selling. Poor authentication process + high seller fees + eBay usually takes buyers sides on cases instead of supporting their longtime sellers. Pretty disappointing.",2
9435,Always good communication and good sellers,5
9436,Great service,5
9437,Find rare things,5
9438,Wonderful,5
9439,I have to say for making purchases ebay is good. It gives me access to a lot of stuff I couldn't find in stores. They kept sending me ad to sell and made it sound great. I started selling and trying hard to provide good customer service. I got hit by a scammer that said I didn't ship the item out. This was a bold faced lie and I had a lot of proof. Well Ebay forces a refund and does not care at all about proof. As a seller you have NO protection. I'm looking for a new site to sell on after this.,1
9440,Great for searching the value of items when on location at a sale. The phone app is also great for adding pictures to your listings. I start my listings on a computer. Then add pictures on the phone. Sends too many unwanted notifications and offers. I go to eBay generally to find pre-owned items. And I know what I'm looking for. They're suggested ads are never what I'm looking for!,4
9441,Great needs more puffco options though,5
9442,Excellent,5
9443,I like and it is nice but I can't buy in cash 😭,4
9444,"My first ever order, and it seems good",5

9446,They have everything I ever look for in media at lowest possible cost with most items still new in original packaging.,5
9447,"Works pretty swell, No issues I've noticed",5

9471,"Seller interface is terrible. You can select an option, then it reverts back to the default. This happened when I put ad rating at 2% and it switched back to 13% after I clicked off. I didn't realize it until after the item sold and I was out $50",1
9472,great website .found.life saving item,5

9476,This app is as it should be.,5
9477,Good get what I ask for every time,4
9478,eBay needs to rework there return policy. As a seller I shouldn't have to pay for shipping to and from when a buyer simply changed there mind. I understand having to cover shipping if I screw up somehow. But the no questions asked return policy is being abused by a small percent of buyers.,4
9479,Cool app,5
9480,SICK!!!!!!,5
9481,Best place to find anything you can't find in local stores. I'll always go to Ebay,5

9511,Great.,5
9512,"I deeply appreciate a community based app where items are sold from individuals. For future sales to progress, i would advise that the sellers' fees should be lowered AND not excel in the future. I highly recommend any type of thrifting that helps support another Individual.

9581,eBay has really gone hill. This app is actually trash. Seems like that is becoming more popular. Thanks for support china not usa in trade. You want to send your money over seas to support a country who is not interested in our best interests. Polluting the environment and kids in sweat shops getting paid pennies on the dollar while the big company ceoa are getting overly rich. They don't seriously care about our planet or animals who live here.,1

9600,"EU customers should stop using ebay as ebay cannot fill their custom declaration properly (the documents formed by ebay, not the seller) and as a result you will be double charged VAT and customs fees on every purchase you make.

9652,I feel like a kid in a candy shop....,5
9653,Easy to use.,5
9654,Bad 👎Useless app... Doesn't alert you until after a watched item ends... Get REAL EBAY! Edit was working fine till recent update now back to this same issue...,1
9655,The new feedback system is even more clunky and needy .it's still just a shop .if a shopkeeper hassled you this much for feedback and then made it awkward to leave it you would stop going there. Also eBay is now absolutely flooded with Chinese copy rubbish in every category. For example I buy car parts and it now takes hours of searching to find what you actually want . I used to love eBay but this and a completely broken system of putting your vehicle details in make it hard to enjoy,1
9656,Very awesome place to find what you're looking for,5
9657,very good,4
9658,Good.but dont know how deal. Is it safe card payment,4
9659,Good,5
9660,Just seems to work!,5
9661,Great,5
9662,"On the ""my ebay -> payments"" screen nothing works. I can't edit payment information, edit or delete credit cards, nothing. Doesn't work on either of my phones which are different brands so it seems like the issue on your end. Please fix..",1
9663,Downside to this app is the way the description comes up on the little silly page . Why doesn't it load a proper page with all the information you need .,5
9664,Nice,5

9693,Every item we have bought through the app has always been as it is advertised. They have always been a good price and worth the money.,5
9694,because I like to order stuff,4
9695,Awful Useless and Awful App Takes Ages To Load And Then Screen Goes Black Then Reloads Again Absolutely Rubbish ! Just spins around for ages before it loads ! Very very difficult to get app to work ! You cannot request an invoice and if your payment requires authorisation eBay cannot process the payment Absolute Unless !,1
9696,"So far quite good, I do not order from Amazon anymore. I usually go to Walmart. I have ordered from ebay a couple times with good success. Thank you.",5
9697,Incredible and outstanding,5
9698,Good app and easy to get what you want,5
9699,Excellent app!,5
9700,"Ebay is always on time and I haven't had any problems with any returns or refund, absolutely the best in the business",5
9701,Always easy to use!!,5
9702,App has been down all day unable to login keeps saying technical difficulties. Useless!,1
9703,SCAM ARTIST. Just open the eBay account shipped out my first item for $237 a collector's vintage collectors Crossley vinyl record player and when I go to wake up the next morning to track my package they canceled my account and restricted it indefinitely scam artist scam artist shame on you you don't even deserve one star,1
9704,It good 👍,4
9705,Good,5
9706,Easy to use! Good app!,5
9707,"Great clean, function and well designed app!",5
9708,Excellent,5
9709,This the site is awesome,5
9710,Ebay is not working after the update,1
9711,"eBay encourage sellers to manipulate prices by allowing various products on one listing. It's very common to have a 'screw' for a penny on £300 phone listing to be shown as the cheapest option. Usually the penny product is also unavailable. You report it to eBay - they say it's fine by them so it's encouraging cheaters to cheat. All reports are checked by,so called, AI and 100% it gets it wrong. Probably 80% listings on eBay are now flawed. It's time to go to other ways of purchase.",2
9712,Great,4
9713,Drafts is broken for selling. Gives a 'unknown error!' message,1
9714,The app has come a long way. It's easy to use and intuitive.,5
9715,Brill !!!!,4
9716,Love it favorite app to buy hard to find items.,5
9717,Fast and reliable,5
9718,"So stupid. When a seller sent me his address for a return, the app prevents me from copying the address from the message, so I have to write it out by hand like a Neanderthal. Why do this? Do you just think, what can we do to annoy the users. What is wrong with copy and paste app builders.",2
9719,Ebay is simply the best.,5
9720,😁💯👍,5
9721,Fraud is the new way to buy with Ebay.,1
9722,This app is easy to use.,4
9723,"Works very well, comparable to shopping on desktop",5
9724,Makes finding what I need at the best price so fast and easy,5
9725,I love it..Thank you for all the great information..and fast shipping.. We love it all very much.. Thank you 💝,5

9728,"Great, easy search, specified information.",1
9729,Haven't done alot. But satisfied,5
9730,Always plenty of variety and good prices .,5
9731,good,5
9732,It is grate ebay has nearly any thing you need,5
9733,"eBay is now a Scam. I have paid for multiple orders for different product where my money has been collected, held, then refunded weeks later because the listing was false. My most recent transaction left me with a partial refund for an item the seller admits to not having, no item, and less money than I started with. I'll gladly pay a few bucks more now and support Amazon.",2
9734,Ebay is great,5
9735,Awesome shopping experience and great products,5
9736,Love it,5
9737,Most of the sellers are awesome and professional. You just need to be aware not everyone is. Keep track of shipping charges and unbelievable low pricing. Deals are out there but so are the scams. eBay does a pretty good job of keeping it real and they're always easy to get in touch with if you run into the occasional scoundrel. But most of the time you get what you are looking for and with thank you notes and friendly service. And don't be afraid to ask questions. Mary's one of my favorites.,4
9738,Excellent,5
9739,YES YES,5
9740,This shows you every which way.,5
9741,No question they put in the least amount of effort they can into this app. Whatever they can do to get their money and get out while putting in the least work possible.,1
9742,Description no longer opens to the full screen. Terrible.,1
9743,"Won't let me bid because it says I have unpaid items which restricts me from bidding on certain items which I don't have any unpaid items even the automated assistance didn't find anything unpaid on my account, what's the issue here?",1
9744,Stopped sending notifications on items that are ending soon resulting in missed bids. Rubbish app.,1
9745,5 stars because I've always loved eBay and the app is super convenient and honestly easier than Amazon's with cheaper shipping than Amazon as well.,5
9746,Gooooooooood,5
9747,Great,4
9748,What you see is what you get. Quality products delivered with ease.,5
9749,I love the deals very awesome,5
9750,"Bunch of thieves. They make money out of your merchandise, and you only earn change. I made $44.92 and was only entitled to $4.83 out of MY merchandise. Mind you, I paid the deliveries out of my pocket. They charge you for each upload you want to sell, and they charge you for each sale you make, and then they ignore you when you contact them. I deactivated my account. This is some slavery thieves joint, it's why nobody take them serious nomore.",1
9751,"Great variety of sellers and options. Usually not hard to get refunds on faulty items, tho the system isn't foolproof. Overall tho, this site is great. Thank you eBay <3",4
9752,The best market internet platform,5
9753,"Worst customer I ever faced on a shopping app. Stay away, doesn't reply for weeks. Bought a phone two times, both items didn't arrive in my country; instead, they were delivered in the USA. Wasted more than 2 and a half months for trash service. International buyers, stay away or regret.",1
9754,Good app.,5
9755,It would be a good idea to have countries that ship locally as default unless it does already but i can't see the option as i have to wade through the sellers to see if its a local company.,4
9756,"20 years on eBay. Hundreds of transactions. 100% feedback score. I'm pulling my listings and closing my account. Their customer service is DEPLORABLE. That is IF you are lucky enough to actually track down a REAL HUMAN to speak with. You can't call them, or contact them directly anymore. You navigate menus, and chat bots, and IF they deem your problem worthy; they will reach out to you... and then do absolutely nothing to help you. Waste of bandwidth.",1
9757,Good 420,4
9758,The best,5
9759,"Ebay became trash, people have best offer and don't accept best offer, sellers put bad quality photos on purpose to get buyers confused. Everyone is a store now, this is not what it used to be, that's why I buy everything on Amazon now. I know the rating is not accurate, almost 5 stars when Ebay is trash right now. Are you kidding me?? I believe that these 4.7 rating is manipulated or paid for, there's no way.",1
9760,Great selling app,5
9761,Great,5
9762,Ok,5
9763,IT IS GREAT. I APPRECIATE YOU ALL.,5
9764,The reason I am giving it a 5 star is that eBay is great but certain sellers aren't some will inflate the shipping and handling prices one seller told me the post office charged him $9.00 for the shipping label which is a flat rate anywhere in united states for a pair of sneakers which I buy frequently he said why shouldn't I pay double for the items so what is ebay doing about that I've been with eBay 9 plus years not only that I brought a pair sonic Jordan's with fake suede just giving a head,5
9765,Very nice app. Great for drunk buying Hot Wheels,5
9766,Understanding of what is needed is easy to access and explained.,5
9767,great,5
9768,Awesome easy to navigate,5
9769,Good customer service,5
9770,Most are prompt with shipping,4
9771,I like ebay very good application very Save,5
9772,Buyers beware they double charge you 2 days after the original purchase then tell you to wait 14 days for the money they stole to be returned so technically week after me and my family starve to death,1
9773,Love my ebay,5
9774,"Easy to use, just read what you buy via description. Also ease of mind to use",5
9775,Just a simple experience,5
9776,I love ebay ♥️,5
9777,Fast and cheaper products,5
9778,"Way easier that I expected. 250 listing free each month is awesome. As a seller, the shipping is drastically simple compared to my experience with Mercari",5
9779,Was excited for an item but a bot beat my bid last second by 25 cents. Really?,1
9780,"I love it arrive with the price of the sellers, I will be looking for the eBay update thank you 🙏",5
9781,100% good,5
9782,Good,5
9783,"So far so good. No huge compliments For, it takes forever just to get your money to you during a transfer & through an accredited bank whom of which ebay partnered with many moons ago, PayPal Inc.",5
9784,I am new on Ebay and I love it. They keep you well informed about everything. Two 👍 up from me!,5
9785,Always the most things available and good support from ebay,5
9786,I have been buying parts off eBay for several years. I have been satisfied with them at least 95 %.,5
9787,Full of chinese counterfeit sellers and ebay know it corrupt bent orgonisation making money from criminal activity ebay getting away with this blackmarket profit. SHAME ON YOU!,1
9788,"I used to really like Ebay but the past few years have really made it unenjoyable. The last straw was when my item was ""delivered"" but I never saw it. I put in a claim and Ebay sided with the buyer which was just a punch in the gut. Trying to get help is also extremely hard, it's hidden away in several menus that feel bloated and unorganized. It's just a pain to use this app and causes such a headache.",1
9789,Fun to shop,5
9790,A O KOOL,5
9791,Its ebay whats not to like,5
9792,No tissues here,5
9793,Always had and hope to continue having a Great Experience!,5
9794,"Convenience: Users appreciate the ease of browsing, buying, and selling on the go. Notifications: Real-time alerts about deals, auctions, and order updates are highly valued. Performance Issues: Some users report occasional bugs and crashes, which can be frustrating during transactions.",5
9795,"Very varied,attention holding,interesting content.Wish I was younger and quicker on the keyboard.But even EBAY can't help there. Thank You.",4
9796,Excelente,5
9797,Not that good. 2 step login needs a lot of work. They send a notification but to what device is anyone's guess. Sucks for the seller. EBay and pay pal entitle themselves to half of any proceeds. Not worth it. I don't know how they do it. I can't afford it. Fat cats. There's also a bug when you open any message either in the app or from a notification it automatically opens a reply window that covers the message before you've read it. How am I to reply when I don't know what I'm replying to?,1
9798,App is a lot better. Don't have to deal with The PayPal scammers and the payments are straight to your bank account.,4
9799,eBay is my is my way to go for low prices and great deals.,5

9813,Good interface,5
9814,"Everything's there, returns are usually easy",4
9815,Excellent service all round,5
9816,"Good app for getting things sold pretty quickly, but not at all happy with the way palymentz work. It's way too difficult to get your money out when you need it. There's always just one more thing you need to do, one more thing that needs to clear or be verified, and one or two more days that needs to go by. There's just always something holding it up it seems. I opted for instant payouts, still took me 5 days to get my funds, this has happened more than once. Never received my funds instantly.",2
9817,I love it and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to do there shopping this way,5
9818,It is superb,4

9826,Never had a bag experience on ebay! ❤️,5
9827,Quality things u can buy,4
9828,"my only complaint, is that they only show you the good stuff on your algorithm after you made a purchase. only then does it figure out that that's what you want to buy, and shows you all that it has available.",3
9829,EBAY SAVE ME SOME MONEY!$!$,5
9830,"A tentative 1 star review. In the last couple of weeks, eBay has broken the sell function when searching for a trading card with your camera. I rely on this to make selling easier, but get constant 'something went wrong' when searching for a card. Otherwise, I do like the app, just wish that wasn't broken and that maybe it had more seller tools like the desktop site.",1
9831,Great 🙏🐺💀🤣 mwah sus 🤔,5
9832,Never had a problem with buying or returning and refunding ie top teem no probs,5
9833,There is no way to disable notifications for recently viewed items without completely disabling notifications.,1
9834,Allowing products that may seem innocent when you see it to purchase it but really a profile for a human or child to be sold or advertised,1
9835,D.J.,5
9836,Best deals and good people,5
9837,Good,4
9838,Excellent portal. I have yet to have a single glitch.,5
9839,I need to talk to an ebay advisor please.,5
9840,easy-to-use,5
9841,Tired of waiting on my sim tray said yesterday but have not even hinted on it near centreville alabama,1
9842,Pretty solid. The lack of a fifth star is how much I am contacted about items I have looked at.,4
9843,"It's my first time, but I find eBay the best Marketplace",5
9844,They held hundreds of dollars in proceeds and forced me to give them my social security number before they would release.,1
9845,Quick to search & use.,5
9846,excellent,4
9847,It's very reliable and convenient. Thank you.,5
9848,"Worst marketplace I have seen. Never had a good experience, it always has to be complicated. How is this app still alive??",1
9849,"I'm changing my review and giving a higher rating because although I've had problems with faulty components, eBay does honor their return policy and get your money back, which is good. My only gripe is the auctions. Someone will outbid you just for spite and then after the auction is over. The item gets relisted a few days. So they didn't even pay. They outbid you to be malicious with no intent on paying. It's happened 7 times in about a week. Kind of frustrating.",4
9850,easy peasy to use,5
9851,Lovin' it.,5
9852,Easy to journey through,5
9853,Fantastic,5
9854,was told i'd be getting a refund as the courier left the parcel whilst i was out and it wasn't there when i got in. then was told i of couldn't have refund as the courier company would not get back to me with details!!!,3
9855,Well I don't even use the website anymore.,5

9872,Awesome app for selling and buying! Anytime an injustice or scammer has messed with me on a purchase ebay always made it right.,5
9873,I love this app souch it gives cheap items that are good,5
9874,Excellent app. I can find almost anything I need,5
9875,Way better than it used to be. It makes it so much easier with that AI filling in the description part. It doesn't take half hour to post a single item anymore because that used to be what turned me off from eBay most of the time was if you wanted to describe your product in any type of detail for the customers it took forever to make a single post. And I have a bunch of different things I don't have multiple of certain items so I really didn't have 5 hours to put aside too much to post my stuff,5
9876,Excellent,5
9877,Good 👍 👍,4
9878,Awesome,5
9879,Happy shopping on this site,5

9884,Easy to use and reliable!,4
9885,"What? If a seller pays for the shipping, then the buyer also pays for the shipping? And then they say, ""You actually didn't pay enough"" almost 10 days later, so they charge me an extra $6. I'm not using eBay ever again, I don't know why people put up with this stuff. 0/10.",1
9886,Always good! Easy to use!,5
9887,love ebay. Any thing I want is on there and cheaper than anywhere else.,5
9888,Access to draf listings doesn't appear to work in the current version,1

9890,Excellent never had a problem Excellent customer care and just a brilliant experience,5
9891,Very helpful setting up initial item sale on platform. Made easy for someone that is not experienced with online sales,5
9892,Friend sales on it,3
9893,A+++,5
9894,Get what you purchase guarantee is a scam. I didn't get what I purchase and their decision went against me. I closed my account months ago and still not closed. Lousy customer service and company that doesn't stand up for the smaller folks.,1
9895,Ebay is simply the best!,5
9896,You get the items you looking for with minimum search Its a good easy app to navigate,5
9897,Good,5

9902,"Do yourself a favor don't use ebay, go to Amazon.",1
9903,"The app works fine for conducting commerce, but the injection of ""frequently bought together"" ads between every single line item in my purchase history has made it much more cumbersome to navigate.",2
9904,So far so good for 5 minutes of use,4
9905,"Toda cuenta nueva,que consulta, o que un vendedor cancela un pedido es suspendida, como si uno tuviera ala culpa. Ya no se puede comprar porque toda cuenta nueva es suspendida.",1

9921,Still the best out there,5
9922,Stop messing with the purchase history put it back the way it was! without other people bought suggestions! you cannot turn off! And when you look at an item put it back the way it was so you can see all the pictures not individually the way it is now.,1
9923,"Some deals are too good to be true, but even though there are some bad eggs, eBay is good about getting your money back.",4
9924,I like the options of all.items I look at and the competitive prices.,5
9925,"Absolute joke, suspend your account for sending an item back when seller sent wrong item or for opening dispute cause you havnt receieved an item",1
9926,Fun to shop,5
9927,Love it,5
9928,"Generally, the app functions very well. But the saturated ebay adverts next to every purchase you've made... that's a truly horrible new addition. You've made that part lousy to use, and I can't imagine what eBay hopes to gain from it.",2
9929,"Love it, everything cheap good price and value great stuff 💯❤",5
9930,Value for money and easily accesible.,5
9931,Easy ordering of what you want,5
9932,Great options,5
9933,Excellent,5
9934,"Make an option to turn off notifications for ""VIEWED"" items, if I cared about them I would ""WATCH"" them. Driving me crazy. Thank you for removing the ""Easy Pricing"" when selling, be nice if ""Best Offer"" would stay turned off when selling similar. App is getting better.",3
9935,I find what I need,5
9936,Wow what Parasitic practices you dictate. I wouldn't sale or buy nothing from ebay ever. Charge me to sale my own things? Makes no sense in the least. Okay. Good bye,1

9964,Works well. No issues,5
9965,"I prefer eBay because they stand behind their pledge to be there for the buyer and the seller... I've been using eBay for at least 12 years now, and the few times I've had issues with items, the seller or eBay has corrected the orders, including refunds at times!",5
9966,Very good app as a buyer however as a seller it is easier for some account functions to be performed on the desktop site and as people increasingly use their tablets and phones hopefully more functionality will be added soon,4
9967,Find hard to find things that others don't have!,5
9968,I like this shopping app it has all the thing I need,5

9973,It's good,5
9974,Great,5
9975,Nice and simple to use and you can find anything you need!!!,5
9976,These idiots banned me from their already obsolete platform for doing just nothing at all. Worst app. Maybe they are discriminating based on my country. I understand security is must to prevent scammers. But not a single innocent person should be treated like this. I don't need your service anyways. I was just checking this app after many years out of curiosity.,1
9977,Great place to get unique bits and still deal with real people,4
9978,Always have had a good experience,5

9980,Excellent,5
9981,"Just started an account. Put in a couple bids. Then a couple days ago ebay put a bidding restriction on my account. So i cant bid on anything. No email, no message and no reasoning. Called customer service and they didn't help",1

9983,They are the best for buying anything at a good price. I recommend it to anyone who wants to save.,5
9984,Yay,5
9985,I'm able to find things here that I cannot find anywhere else. The community is pretty solid as well.,5

10081,Customer service employees are worthless. They have absolutely no control over anything. Was told to give 48 hours for personal information to update to withdraw funds but had to wait at least 3 days because nobody seemed to want to help. Service has gone downhill completely. All they want to do is talk your head off and waste your time and apologize. Don't apologize help and get something done!!!,1

10095,Excellent,5
10096,"I like ebay, however, I believe there are some rules that should be brought in for sellers to make it a better experience. Sellers should not be allowed to list multiple items of significantly differing value and characteristics, since the price of the lowest value item is often linked to the item in the title, which is deceiving. Secondly, sellers should be required to provide a receipt with purchases.",3

10119,"Easy to use app, I'm never off it!",5
10120,Nice idea. But ebay needs to get with the program. So many things that can easily be fixed. If I buy an item and it hasn't been shipped I should be able to cancel or change delivery address. I know people that have lost hundreds of dollars because of this stupid feature that ebay refuses to change. What makes it worse is you can message the seller right after purchasing the item to change the address and they can say no and still ship it to the wrong address and ebay will do nothing about it.,1

10207,Since 2019 I am very happy satisfied customer of eBay. Their App has improved over the years. I still love eBay very much.

I called eBay about this problem and was informed since the transaction went through the extended protection could not be purchased. After this problem I'll never make an offer to a seller which I understand isn't the seller's fault but eBay itself. There's a very old saying cheat me once shame on you cheat me twice shame on me.,1

If I view it and do not watch it, I am not interested in an offer.",2

Their response is so slow that by time they actually react scam sellers are long gone and you're outthe $$$ (232 in my case) then after an easy check at Fedex told this Is a common scam run on ebay, yet ebay can't figure it out?? pay at Amazon or Target or any reputable store before using eBay!!!",1

10460,"I used to like the eBay app, and it works great when searching. However, I don't like the fact they've added a ""feature"" under recently purchased. I would like to just see where my packages are. I don't need to be bombarded with recommended purchases under EVERY ITEM. It's a plague and sometimes pops up when I'm trying to click on an item and it launches straight into the recommended item to purchase instead. Give us an option to disable it.",1

You can only bid on international items once, then the bid button disappears and you can't increase your bid.

10498,The app is buggy at times. Ebay as a whole has gone downhill. It's full of bad sellers. Return policies are ridiculous. Customers service is non existent.,1
10499,Easy to navigate and use.,5
10500,I seldom usebebay now. Since a court of years ago. Despite. asking via email for assistant from ebay with a seller (recognised by eBay) who was being difficult. EBay ignored those two requests and I ended losing a chair I purchased om auction. I bought another chair with another seller and it was delivered. Ik enquired if j could arrange a pick with them to pick up mu other chair. Rhr delivery man immediately said that the difficult seller had restricted opening days and hours was nightmar,1
10501,Been an ebayer for many years. Always good experience,5
10502,Very useful,5
10503,Banned me permanently for just setting up a page I didn't even list anything. Worst platform ever!!!! Tried to complain to the agent and she said her usual scripted bs and hung up on me. Avoid!!!!,1

10507,Pretty good,5
10508,Easy to order,5
10509,Never had a problem with the app. Much easier than the days of eBay's infancy with website only option. The only downside is that the app regularly asks me to rate it. I already have. F@#$ off eBay!,5
10510,"APP IS BROKEN...AGAIN! I was signed out of the app and can't sign back in - apparently I'm a bot. This is the message I receive everytime I try to sign in...

10519,So far all is good,5
10520,"Good prices, good sellers",5
10521,Ebay is giving my personal email and phone number to sellers that I bid on but did not win. Sellers are now contacting me directly. Then they make it impossible to report it or do anything about it. Quick Google search and sellers I did not buy from know where I live. Ebay is no longer secure.,1

10543,Never had a single issue that wasn't resolved perfectly.,5
10544,"Ebays the WORST! you have to sort through hundreds of things that are either empty boxes, fake,or upcharged by 20%,or at the very least cheap but need $25+ for shipping. And that is if they don't decide to ""restrict your account"" so you have to use ""buy it now""only. Do yourself a favor and shop literally anywhere else. You'll get it faster and cheaper through Walmart,target,amazon,or even Google shopping...",1

10555,"If they didn't use an algorithm to mark up the price on items that you bid on I'd say it's a good company but since they use it I don't believe that's correct and I honestly don't think that's right for the consumer.. I've had that experience buying something then have the algorithm set it up where it gets marked up increment by increment . then when you look up the other person that's bidding it's ...,,.

10634,Whoo hoo. Another update. So yea some issues still remain but my current beef is that it's not keeping up to date with your account on the app. Asking me to leave feedback when I already have. Also doesn't delete stuff after I've deleted it. Be a nice app if it actually worked.,2

10690,"Not liking this tracking service. I'm told I have a tracking number only for it to come up as an untracked service 🤔 or a service that will only update after delivery. A rather pointless experience that is certainly not improving my faith in Ebay. The local postage service seems to have dropped drastically yet postage prices have stayed the same, unless the seller uses a different delivery service, Similar apps of the same nature have a much better postage and tracking service.",2

10727,"Try to check your purchases and you're bombarded by invasive advertisements of ""Frequently Bought Together"" items, eBay blantantly trying to upsell products to its users similar to Amazon. Makes the 'My Purchase' tab completely non-user friendly! Let alone remotely attractive to look at! 👎👎👎",1
10728,Dose what it said on tin.,5
10729,"I am unable to check out on eBay since updates like another person on here, was great not any longer, I just had to turn on my laptop which I never use just to check out what I wanted to buy, pretty pissed, I use a Samsung S2 tablet, don't have a problem with any other site, or app Tiarmarie",5

10743,I have always received excelent service on ebay,5
10744,It is great for getting rid of all that unwanted stuff. The seller fees are a little extreme. So most my smaller items I sell on other platforms. Ebay I use for those pricier things bc I don't mind paying a seller cost. Ebay could work on this issue.... but outside this they are great and easy to woek...,5
10745,"Whatever you want they got it.. 🤙🤙You can get amazing buys on here, especially on a budget and most vendors will negotiate at a reasonable rate... I am very happy.",5

10766,"Gotta say I've been using the ebay app for years, and I really don't like the frequently bought items with purchases I have bought in the past. Not really a fan of that upgrade. I hope that they will go back to the original app how it was before they made this app with the frequently bought purchases. It's annoying and I am not really to thrilled about it. It's also very distracting. So I hope that they will do away with the (frequently bought together upgrade)",5

10774,It is fast and easy to use. I will recommend it to my friends 🧡,5

10776,eBay you guys got a problem and that problem is eBay is filled with scammers and you guys got a crack down on that I've been getting scammed left and right lately I'm going to Stop shopping with you guys anymore until you fix it Plus customer support really stinks they don't want to do anything you guys really need to fix that too oh and by the way the cancellation that needs to be fixed instead of making people wait you know if we want to cancel something we should without a hassle,1

I highly recommend this app to any and every collector, from just starting to seasoned pickers to savvy buyers and sellers.",5

10789,"A real scam. They allowed a transaction to be done in two orders, although sellers could not ship to my country. Now both sellers have to refund the money. Is this a serious website that you can trust? After TEMU appeared, this website will stop exist in time.",1
10790,Very easy to use,5
10791,"Overall, this is a great app for buying and selling. Albeit some of the features still require a PC/laptop which is a bit of a nuisance. But I still give it huge thumbs up!",4
10792,Great app for selling and buy products.,5

10802,"There is way too much going on now with the My Purchases screen. The ads for other items are incredibly intrusive and frankly I don't see any relation to the items I purchased and what you are suggesting other customers purchased. The screen I go to for order reviews is not the place for advertisements. I already made a purchase, give me a break!",3
10803,Been in ebay for a long time now.,5

10813,"I never recommend use this app to much bad experience customer care employee to much rude when you call him for your query and no propar management, Believe in making profit rather than custemer service company takes early payment when you call about your order company doing time pass , not give propar answer. Waste of time and waste of money .",1

10817,You can usually find what you need.,4
10818,💯,5
10819,The new update is it's very annoying when you try to look at your purchases. Every purchase has frequently brought together attached and it takes you ages to look for a purchase,2
10820,Cool stuff,5
10821,All these updates are ruining the eBay experience. If it's not broken why try to fix it. When I go to the items I've purchased there are now lines of other items people purchase with that item. If I wanted to know what others purchased I'd ask. The layout is now clunky and sometimes unresponsive. My sales no longer show and the description of an item I'm looking at now has a pop-up at the bottom of the screen rather than opening a new page..and now I can't see watched items so can't Send offers,1
10822,Love Ebay,5
10823,Always preferred ebay the prices are very good and happy to receive the items . Most are of good quality,5
10824,Very informative.,5
10825,I think ebay is one of the better web sites we seem to be getting our products a bit quicker the only change I would make is telling the customer the full price after all the charges example the gst it has improved heaps. Kind regards Julie ✨️ ☺️ 😊 😀 😉 🙂,4
10826,Won't load anything I'm selling so have to use laptop or PC. New phone so it must be the app.,5
10827,Have not had an issue with the app yet. Well done Ebay,5
10828,Fracking hate this app. I'm going to get a lawyer involved if I don't get paid.,1
10829,Works great very easy to navigate.,5
10830,"Superb. I cannot think of one problem I have had using ebay. I am late middle-aged, so if that isn't a good recommendation I don't what is. I awarded 1 star. I will immediately advance to 5 stars when the site starts selling Left-handed mobile phones.9",1

10844,"I was using this app since a lonng time. But after some updates, I noticed that the ""Purchases"" search tool does not work good as it should be as before the updates. The tool can search for a specific item that you were looking for before, but now it shows you all the items in the whole orders having that item instead of the specific one that you are looking for. Requested to fix that issue several times, but I did not receive any feedback and did not see that the tool is fixed.",1
10845,"I love eBay I also love the eBay buy and sell app. I would & always do recommend eBay online buy & sell to everyone.

10853,you lost your mind to restrict users with low activity and dormant status from selling whatever quantity of items they want to get rid of a month. i had always wished you would take an approach to prevent the same vendor from price gouging and flooding your market with repeated listings but this selling limit restricts people who don't even come close to violating your guidelines. You have me guidelines which is why i won't continue here. The safety you enforce is damaging casual users.,1
10854,couldn't get an account despite existing one? Couldn't establish new one either? Won't be using ebay again. Bought from here with account. I don't care to keep looking at ducks to buy anything.,2

11003,What in the heck is going on with this app I typically go on to search for cars and trucks and I can usually quickly navigate to search for that but you guys keep changing stuff. Further more a while back you changed the search results so that when I try to filter I have to click view all results at the bottom of a number of other listings. Change it back guys seriously new UI is garbage just help me get to the search results I want more quickly,1
11004,Thieves who are more than happy to hold your funds for as long as they see fit,2
11005,Love the experience they always do me right,5
11006,1 Star still. Just painful to navigate on my phone which is where I do 99% of my business from. So many issues. So many times. Other reviews have it all pretty well much covered,1
11007,I've been using eBay for over 20 years. I LOVE IT!!!,5
11008,The app is fine. The thing I really don't like is the pe5lost control paying. The seller can automatically go get your paying.,4

11017,Ebay charges way too much. They took $18 out of $110 in transaction fees before I even bought a shipping label which was another $12. I came out with $80 and change when the buyer paid $122,1
11018,Great job,5
11019,Good,5

11049,"Frustrating as a seller, there needs to be a system where your rewarded for bidding on something and actually paying for it maybe Some sort of system that rewards for people that pay promptly or will pay along with their bid, like a real bidding process instead of these fake bidders that don't pay, manipulating prices and doing what not I just think that instead of the normal eBay experience where you pay whatever it is 15%, you can save a lot more if you just back it w cash,card",2

11210,"I don't know what they recently did with the new update but their app is ridiculously slow. Aside from charging way too much in fees and just robbing sellers and letting scammers run rampant, I recommend finding an alternate buy/sell site. Ebay is not the same ebay as 10 years ago. It is a horrible company anymore",1

11617,Awesome,5
11618,Easy to use for sellers and buyers.,5
11619,Way better than almost all other shopping apps simply due to the filters. So many more filters to drill down than even the biggest retail store apps have.,5
11620,"If you are starting a small business, ebay IS NOT the place for it the fees are out of this world, so many subscriptions and fees that all add up to the point that ebay are making more profit off your items than you are If you can make any. For high-value items I recommend going elsewhere as they well and truly go to town on your money. I only sell rubbish I don't care about on ebay now. Ebay is slowly losing to their competitors over greed.",2

11741,Very vast availability of goods,5
11742,"Over the years (23+ as a buyer/seller), the site has progressively gotten worse and worse. The business is too busy wasting money on pointless things like useless shipping services, constant reminder of not having enough info for listing and sellers who have figured out how to get paid but dont ship an item. Let's not even get started about how a person in another country (example iran) can ship items in the US and when package arrives is amazon. Truly terrible! Use to be fun but now just sad!",1
11743,Excellent services 👌,5
11744,Good ebay nice,5

11752,Easy to use and reliable.,5
11753,Perfect,5

11786,Love it!,5
11787,Ebay does not treat sellers well and favours the buyer even when the seller is correct,1
11788,Had no problems,4
11789,"So far, so good lol The app does have the occasional -minor- errors, but they're usually resolved rather quickly ^^ It's still more convenient than the site, for sure.",5
11790,Awesome deals,5
11791,I'm just honest I like that way I add to cart things that i like but i can't buy it,5

11817,Works great!,5
11818,Ebay makes it so easy to search and buy anything you like with so many choices,5
11819,eBay stole a large amount of money from me after a sale. (Edit: Four times) Customer service is terrible and dishonest.,1
11820,PLEASE get rid of the AI search. It's inaccurate and unnecessary. Just let me search the old way or give me an option to turn it OFF.,4
11821,Ebay will not allow you to leave feedback about sellers that let you down. This means all feedback means nothing. Start doing the right thing ebay!,1
11822,I love this app💯❣️,5
11823,Nice get it,5
11824,Easy to use,5
11825,Best place for everything,5
11826,eBay needs to reverse back the inbox button for the messages. They made it complicated to find it. I don't even know why you need to repair something that is not broken.,1
11827,BEST APP EVER!!!,5
11828,Love the ease of functionality in the ebay app! It makes the listing process very straight-forward and makes being a seller fun!,5

11865,"Shop here all the time, great bunch of folks!",5

11876,Very good.,5
11877,All good,5
11878,"The message section never loads when trying to contact sellers after completing a purchase. Terrible app. If you turn off your data when you get on the contact seller page, then select message seller, the key pad will then pop up and you are able to write the message, then turn data on and press send, it should work if you go back into sent messages and open the message, you'll see it sent! How stupid, shouldnot be this hard.",1

11920,Don't use EBAY looks like China has taken over eBay and im only get half of the stuff like ( a chainsaw only got half of it so can't use it and it turn up in a wet box so i doubt it works ???,1
11921,95% of the time departure right and I like it that you can talk to the customer to seller and find out what you need to know it's not like Amazon where you left out and open field at least you can find out what you need to know,4
11922,Ebay is the Best way better than Amazon! nearly all items are cheaper. on ebay! especially when Amazon adds post and packaging and they are always trying to get you to spend more money subcibe to this subscribe that! gift rap or no gift rap this is the question don't press the wrong button or else you will get a good gift rapping at cost ! spend over so much get free postage! me stick with Ebay a much more pleasant cheaper experience!!,5
11923,Better to sell on facebook and other apps Ebay and PayPal fees are far to greedy now,1
11924,Perfect,5
11925,Since a month ago I have to run all searches twice as first gives only new listings. Today I could not give seller feedback. The submit button remained stubbornly greyed out. Overall getting to be a frustrating experience. I use the app less and less.,3

11946,Long-time experience with orders not available anywhere else in so many cases.,5
11947,All good,5
11948,"Haven't used ebay in a while but their fees make no sense now. I am fine paying a fee based on the final winning auction price but ebay adds their fee % to the total with shipping?! So if you end up selling something $9 and have buyer paying shipping the shipping could be $1 for local shipping or $11 across the county. I make no profit on shipping based on how ebay is set up now, so as an example if ebays fee is 15% they will take $1.5 or $3 fee off my $9 based on where it ships! That's not fair",1
11949,App works fine but changed too often,4
11950,Couldn't be smoother! Ty Ebay !!!,5
11951,"Awesome everything i need, and fast shipping 💯",5
11952,good overall experience with sellers and shippers.,4

12036,I love the free shipping. If it's not on ebay you can't get it.,5
12037,Held my funds for a month and a half because they couldn't find a tracking number for that long and then I called just yesterday on a whim and discussed it with the woman that somehow found the tracking number and then finally decided to release my funds to me. I've never had trouble like this before on any other app. I use 4 other selling apps... eBay is the worst when it comes to paying you.,1

12053,Excellent.,5
12054,"Not sure who's been given the keys to the app, but I don't like the recent push. Pic editor isn't awesome anymore. When I 'List My Item' on the app, it no longer refreshes the queue (I start listings on PC and complete via phone) I am impressed with the app programmers and how quickly they fix bugs. The app is excellent, and clearly eBay has their best folks on it. When something appears broken with the app, it is usually a problem on the website listing tool side. Galaxy Note 9, Android 10.",1
12055,I enjoy buying from e.bay everything is perfect,5
12056,Was sold a stolen item and have been trying to get my money back for 2+months . eBay is refusing to refund my money even though the item had authenticity guarantee and buyer protection. Ive spent hours on the phone with them and still no refund.,1
12057,great experience. 11 out of 10,5
12058,"I've not had too many problems works fine, only thing is and this is for ebay generally you do have scam items still keep watching for those",4

12063,"ebay is one the best,market place to buy and sell your products,and I'm really glad to be using it.",5
12064,Easy to list,5
12065,Great app,5
12066,Hate that the default item location is world wide. I want to have it set permanently to the UK and till you give me that freedom it's going to stay 1 star. Stop trying to manipulate your customers into buying from China. If I want to buy from China Ill set that location. I don't want to unexpectedly wait 3 weeks for an item because I wasn't diligent enough to check the location of every listing. Con artists.,1
12067,It's ok,3
12068,Always a good deal,5

12092,Amazing app♥️,5
12093,Ebay one of the best apps of all time but their fees can kick rocks. However worldwide exposure gives both buyers and sellers best chances at finding and selling what they need,4
12094,eBay is a good place to shop as it gives different options to help scale down listed items. Prices are good and buying options gives more control over what and where you buy.,5
12095,Pretty cool,5
12096,"Been buying on ebay for years easy to use. Ebay+ is really good. Safe transactions, never been let down.",5

Today I cancelled an item but was on auction on eBay because I sold it on another site but I got a pop-up message from eBay saying they might charge me a fee for cancelling the item if this ever happens it will be the last time I sell anything on eBay Once you have sold £1000 worth or 31 items you will be asked for your national insurance number which they then pass on your details to HMRC.,1

12255,Easy breezy! And have a lot of stuff!,5
12256,App works fine but eBay won't protect its sellers from people with dyslexia. So I'm taking my frustrations out on them anyway I can. Just know buyers can admit you listing says you will only be getting one but still think they are getting four. Then give you negative feedback for that... This company is useless... Just sell and make them money. They even shipped a return to my old address. $400 down the drain and they don't care. Make sure you change old addresses in like Five places ffs.,1
12257,Just good app.unleds you want messages theres no way to find that,5

Had 1 questionable transaction in all this time and ebay addressed it immediately . The feedback option is could be better . No half stars . You can't give the seller a rating different from the product. Sometimes the seller is doing their job well but the product may be less than what was desired or expected especially if it is a new product .",4

Just wish the sellers could be more honest and informative about any faults or damages concerning the items instead of quoting "" look at the images / photos as they describe the condition "" but sometimes you cannot get the whole picture due to light or glare or deception.

Mmm check it out IT.",3
12624,I loved the eBay app before the update. Now I can't find anything. I'm not even seeing my messages. WHERE ARE THEY? Why radically changing an app that worked so well? A product team that is not thinking about the impact such drastic changes would have is doomed to fail .,1

12656,"The mark of any quality retailer is how they deal with situations when things go wrong. In this regard, Ebay is the worst. They will force you into slave labour and make you work FOR FREE to jump through hoops to send back defective items in your own time and at your own cost (no allocation of costs for your time or refunds for packaging). And that's IF you manage to hunt down where their ""customer service"" are hiding. Disgraceful charlatans not worthy of you. BUY LOCAL.",1

If $44 wasn't enough for them for their fees, they added another $5 for an international fee. They atole $50 on stupid fees when I really needed the money of a $270 sale. I did all the work yet they keep 20% plus sales tax. Really? Tax the seller? Never using this again and telling all my friends the same. I'm going to Mercari.",1

12906,"Works well. Would be great if you could mark things you've already looked at, so you could filter them out of future search results. Also I should be able to leave feedback anytime. Sometimes you get busy and don't get a chance to leave feedback. Then the time has run out.",4
12907,Great site,5
12908,"The seller promised for refund. I give him negative remarks because of neglecting to pack with the minimum basic standard packing. He didn't any bubbles cushion. The item was defective during transportation Now Seller agreed for refund instead of replacement, I feel happy dealing with eBay. Even though I changed to positive, the seller still requested for positive.",4

12952,Always a great experience browsing pages of stuff,5
12953,Ebay has everything I need.,5
12954,Great in every way,5
12955,eBay was once a very useful app for buying used items. Now it's a mucky drop shipping laden hell and the people running it seem to have little issues with this. Very difficult to find a decent price for a lot of stuff on here now because drop shippers make the market double or triple other domestic sellers. Hilarious fall from grace. Most stuff is on Alixpress cheaper btw. Id only ever use this for buying from real people but theres so many drop shippers your feed is plugged with them.,1
12956,Great deals 👌,5
12957,Great,5
12958,👍,5
12959,Like 👍 it,4
12960,Great site,4
12961,"Ebay has gotten better. I used to only receive about 60% of my orders, and that is closer to 90% lately. Now about 1 of every 10 orders never arrives. Those are acceptable risks on items under $20. I just can't risk larger purchases. Maybe one day.",3

12993,"LOVE IT, EBAY AS ALWAYS.",5
12994,I've had the same account since 2003 and have finally had to give up on Ebay. This last update locked me out of my account because I used my computer to log in and now I'm completely locked out. Using the app or website tells you to call a help line. The help line tells you to go to the website. After 2 weeks of not being able to reach anyone I have completely gave up on Ebay.,2
12995,Easy to navigate. Great listings.,5
12996,In all my orders from eBay(a lot of orders) I've only had 1 negative experience. People just have to discern who is going to rip them off. I'm very happy ordering from eBay. I would recommend this site.,5

13005,Great place to shop. I have been a member for 20 years. No issues.,5
13006,"8 yeard with Ebay and Ebay will not help, even with evidence the seller has provided items not matching description, didn't resend item as they said they would. Contacting ebay you are told about timings and them not being responsible, ignoring their submissions report hasn't worked and the seller delayed for weeks saying they would resend. Apparently speaking to the seller and not being able to report it is good for the Ebay community but completely my fault and my problem - ridiculous",1
13007,There's too much scammers,3
13008,Google finance investment,5
13009,I have seen different options and they are affordable I love it I will be buying my things fromm ebay now a friend introduced me to it,5
13010,Brilliant,5
13011,Love the auction selling feature.,4
13012,Changing policy to allow a bid to be canceled last minute by the sellers has taken all the fun out of what eBay used to be. Its still a fine marketplace for used things but it is so exhausting to look through all the fakes and items mislisted. Please clean up your sellers eBay!,1
13013,😎,5
13014,"Cheap prices, fast shipping",5
13015,It's very helpful,5
13016,Very good 👍,5
13017,"OMG eBay is soooo stupid. So in the app does not have option to filter defective or for parts items that are useless for 99% of the global population,so you enter and look for something and most items you find specially in electronics are for parts and you don't have a way not to see something your not in slightest interested in seeing ,what do this dummies think the global population might be considering becoming a mobile phone or electronics repair technician?? Sooo stupid People over eBay are",1

13021,From past many weeks I couldn't able to log in ebay it is continuously asking me to verify my self with assistant to login in my account. The automated assistance sends me to login page doesn't matter what option and reply I choose to login. Finally I gave up with app and website login and moved to other options miss you ebay. Not bothered to upload many verification documents once again to use the app.,1
13022,Good,5

13024,Just try to buy items using PayPal.

13067,"One of my big reasons I use this, it's so I can search specific items that are broken in order to fix them.

13192,It's easy to use eBay and find what you want. I especially like books and use eBay as I can find a bargain or two. Many book sellers have offers such as buy one get 20% off another.,5

13206,Ebey good 👍🏻,5
13207,This app lacks a lot of the functions that are in the website. And it only takes one low I.Q. clown to falsely claim that your item doesn't work and ruin your perfect feedback rating.,1
13208,Thats good but selling charges to much,4
13209,App is glitchy since Android update. Won't let me conduct business.,2
13210,Beautiful app,5
13211,User Friendly,5
13212,"I've been a long time eBay user. Before Amazon was big ago. We've made many good value purchases over the years and still tell people ""just order it from eBay"". They, eBay , have stepped in and helped me get help with refunds from shady sellers that would not respond.",5
13213,easy gift idea,5
13214,Great app Easy to use,5
13215,I have an old set of silverware that needs to be completed and I have found everything I need to get that job done. I also have started photography and learned more about professional cameras from the sellers more than anyone.,5

13269,"I have used this app since 2001. I am STILL very happy with it. No hidden fees, no unexpected charges. USUALLY the updates are good. The bad ones are fixed quickly. 2024- finally had a bad experience with a seller AND eBay. The seller in England insisted he shipped but could offer no evidence. I conferred with him/her and they would not budge. Somehow, I indicated to eBay to close my request for refund. I got all wrapped up in trying to get this refund that 2 months passed. $45... I let it go!",5

13300,"Be very careful. They will not take any responsibilities. Their ""insurance"" does not actually cover anything.

13321,"Easier to use than main website and updates have improved it over time, but I don't like the new listing page: having to scroll down past piles of suggested products before being able to see shipping info and seller details. Also, I did post a query about the new checkout (in 2022) but gave up waiting for response. I notice you rarely reply to users' issues on their reviews. Some would say rude.",4

After reporting a seller who sold fake items and proving this claim with official manufacturer email, the eBay support team responded to the report that no eBay policies were violated by the seller, despite having a proof from the manufacturer that the product is indeed fake.

13524,"eBay it's like a seesaw, sometimes up, and sometimes down, The downside is people who sell items do not work in a timely fashion their male options seem to not make customer satisfied and that's the only thing that I see wrong with you.

13529,Forcing me to rate app while searching for items and then throwing another item in my face after checkout isn't making me want to come back. It'd be smart to remove this newly invasive feature on next update.,1

13802,Very fast app,5
13803,Great experience,5
13804,Great! 😁👍,5
13805,Selecting the payment right after making an offer is not helpful. I use Afterpay sometimes and you can't select the card during checkout. You also can't add warranties to items as you checkout so this is extremely inconvenient for buyers! Just go back to the accepted offer item to my cart and letting me checkout regularly 🙄 and let me cancel offers too!,1

13915,Great place to shop and bid for items,5
13916,You and your team from Ebay UK have no justification for the seller vetting process and run the app like a bunch of kids. A complete and utter waste of time with no way of communicating in return. I hope your app burns in hell along with any chance of you making a profit. If Google had an option to rate you in negative I would be happier.,1

I understand and was ok with this.) WHAT I WAS NOT OK WITH...was the extremely poor customer service. Supervisor told me that allowing scammers to rip sellers off ""WAS FOR MY OWN GOOD AND SAFETY."" Had another agent tell me to just close my account because $65000 in fees was nothing. Needless to say I did, and went to WhatNot.",1

14010,"Terrible for sellers. eBay abuses the sellers. If you list an authentic item on eBay, they can suspend your account for no reason even if you have evidence that the item you listed was authentic. Please don't sell on eBay trust me, you will save yourself from a headache. eBay doesn't care about it's sellers and buyers can lie and return a item for any excuse even if you have no returns on. eBay has no seller protection and the fees are terrible. Also they always side with the buyer on disputes.",1
14011,They always have everything you need,5
14012,"I love this app, I can usually find anything I want here. If the price is too high I just set the item on my watch list and wait for it to go down and then it notifies me of the price drop. Most the time I'll end up getting the item I want for a reasonable price. If your looking for an app to sell or purchase collectable items, this eBay app is one of the best you'll ever find.

A buyer leaves completely unreasonable negative feedback when I refunded them immediately? How is that balanced? 3. App notification to log in again after being logged out has a delay that's so long you need to repeat the process, which continues in this cycle. Whats going on at Ebay?

I tried to sign on and was told my account had been locked for my security, but when I tried to reset my password I was taken to a screen that was all in Chinese, which is very suspicious. I would actually like to delete my account, as I don't feel like this app or eBay in general are trustworthy.",1

14152,"I have always been an eBay fan. seems like sellers always have accurate descriptions and fast delivery. probably due to the fact that sellers are held accountable, unlike Amazon",5
14153,"Gave me an option to use the app for a credit on next purchase. Ended up being a waste of time and effort as I was never able to use the code, Contacting anyone for help is a hassle too 🙃 😅 I'd rather not waste the memory space on my phone.

But I would love it if ebay could make an option for the buyer to add their email for those who sell digitally. I lost many customers as they wouldn't respond to my messages to give me their email so I could send their item. I was really sad about this, please make it so they can add their email addresses, thank you! Other than that, ebay is wonderful!",4

14181,"eBay is still a great place shop and finding conventional affordable prices. If you can't find anywhere else, eBay is the place.

14184,Always the best.,5
14185,"The app is fine, but selling is hit or miss. Buyers will win auctions, not communicate, and not pay. As a seller all you can do is cancel the order and not even for non-payment! There is also not a way to reject returns. Ebay has become a buyer focused app. There's no accountabilty as a buyer and I say that as seller and as a buyer.",1

14207,"I have been using Ebay now for a couple of years. At first, I was skeptical as I'm not one for online shopping. However, a lot of my doubts have melted away and I purchase from sellers that I can 100% trust in. People have complained about the layout of the home screen but I don't have a problem with the layout and I think some of the reviews I've read are petty and they need to learn how to adapt to a new surrounding.",4

14226,"It is getting from the bad to worst. This app needs lessons of meditation and calmness, otherwise it makes you so upset that the head stroke is coming. Each time i open it, i feel a deep need to launch my phone from the window. Ebay is a crime against humanity. It magically removed the paypall from the paying options, while PayPal is still an option in the web version. Whoever designed this app should be sent to Mars to save humanity from his sadistic evilness",1

14263,"If I could give eBay less than one star, then I would. I was selling trading cards on the platform, 3 days after I put my listing up I was permanently suspended without warning or explanation. The only thing they told me was that my account may have ""put the community at risk"". So I can do nothing on that site. I've tried contacting support, but they haven't done anything.

Support is basically nonexistent and fees are ridiculous now. Also idiotic things like even though I have 100% positive feedback as a seller, since I had to mark couple items out of stock, ebay considers my seller performance ""below standard"" and keeps writing me about it, but guess what, I didn't even sell on ebay for about 6 months!

14440,Sorting by lowest price first makes listings disappear this is been going on for years eBay obviously has no intention of fixing this. I suspect because eBay makes a profit on percentage the more the item cost the more eBay is going to make. EBay's guaranteeing that you can't get the best deal so they can make the most money. I'm looking forward to the day eBay is replaced buy a company that isn't so predatory,1

14442,You can buy anything you want at good prices from some good sources,5
14443,Easy to follow!,5
14444,Good app but some of the latest changes have annoyed me. Why on earth are notifications now called inbox? An inbox is where messages normally reside. This design choice has made finding messages more complicated and confusing than it needs to be Sellers are no longer replying to my messages,2
14445,Amazing,5
14446,Good,4
14447,Excellent,5
14448,The best service.,5

14458,It's been very good,5
14459,Great job as always. So far no issues in a long time.,5
14460,Smooth and effortless,5
14461,You can't sell if DuckDuckGo is your search engine!,1
14462,It's good,5
14463,Don't lyk the loophole for sellers abroad basically change the settings to UK only then it changes and tricks people 3 months later you might get what you ordered. Puts me of using it now It's broken 🍌,3
14464,Very good experience,5
14465,Stop changing the app! You don't constantly need to update! It's like your intentionally making the app harder to use with every update! Here's a tip save yourself some money and just get rid of the person that makes the updates. The app was fine the way it was 20 updates ago. This is why everybody shops on amazon!,1
14466,Brillant great,5
14467,Love all the features and user friendly,5
14468,Best for me,5
14469,"Poor poor poor service, fed up with eBay's ridiculous time frames and inconclusive resolutions. Stick to Amazon.",1
14470,Good,5
14471,"I have not had any bad buys, all been good, with great sellers",5
14472,The worst platform i ever seen.. Worst customer service. I just signed up and they suspended my account for nor reason. I contacted customer service and they said we dont know the reason but we cant open your account and diconnected the call... Disgustingg..😡,1
14473,"This one time trustworthy business entity gave me no credit for an item I sold, allowed the customer to take it without payment so I had to pay the friend I was selling it for out of my own pocket. Then eBay suspended my account with accusations I thus could not respond to, and they began to take money out of my listed bank account on the basis of charges that I could not see, until I closed my bank account. eBay is criminal",1
14474,Great place to find quality parts for your car and also great electronics,5
14475,I've been using an eBay app almost 10 years I'm still hanging in if I can meet somebody I would recommend this app,5
14476,Love eBay,5
14477,Perfect,5
14478,Be ready to be robbed blind with this Trash app. It allows scamming buyers and scamming sellers to steal from you. It's not what it used to be. Want to get robbed and Ebay support will help whoever is robbing get away with the robbery. Ebay must be run by thieves. Immediately uninstall and delete if you dont want to be scammed and robbed by sketchy users working within the ebay company I bet. It's just another PayPal fiasco like in the past. Thieves work with a company stealing from the users.,1
14479,I like the Ebay app. It is Easy and Cool to use.,5
14480,If you I need it they have it,5
14481,Fun,5

14488,"I've had excellent service, fast returns excellent shipping and most items are exactly as listed. The only thing this app could help me with is the ability to put my chosen name instead of my dead name. I am Transgender Female, I hate seeing my legal name",5

14490,Good like,5
14491,Been using ebay for years have purchased and sold a lot of stuff the app is great never an issue if you get things insured. Its the people on the app that can sometimes be an issue but mostly they are good juat use the rating system 100- 95 % sellers only,5
14492,"The notifications are out of control. The search results are littered with repeats and ads for more expensive versions. Still somewhat usable, but getting less so every time.",1

14538,"I love eBay. Honestly, so far, I have rebuilt my car and motorcycle. Most of the stuff that I buy comes from this site. Shipping is always fast and easy. I've never had to return anything, so I don't know about that process Im still loving and using the app daily. Great job ebay",5

14594,Variety of choices,5
14595,"Usually such a great app but I've dropped it in other star, the reason why is because your automatic payments when you make an offer on an item is ruining the buyers experience, people might not want to pay for the item in one go they might want to put it on a PayPal pay in 3 scheme or added to their Paypal credit.",2
14596,Absolutely love it❣️,5
14597,Efficient,4
14598,Is it so good,5
14599,To many none paying buyers. Ebay allows guess checkout making it I possible to contact buyers and collect payment it seems. Ebay rips sellers off.,1
14600,Doesn't show all results. Is a bugger to use to try and find the best deals. Sort by lowest is useless due to all the trash out there & then sort by highest & scroll down & you won't even get to the results for the stuff you're looking for. Just show us ALL of the results!!!!!,1

14630,Thank you,5
14631,The only function of this app is to redirect your search from the browser to this pos bloatware where it holds your search result hostage until you waste your time updating the app. The best use case for this app is to delete it and keep it deleted on all devices for the rest of time.,1

14794,"On PC, I can search ""gold"" in ""fine jewellery"" catagory. On phone, this is a near impossible task. As usual, the preface to working on a mobile app, is having missing chromosomes. Multibillion dollar companies are always the least innovative, cancerous additions to any economy.",1

14797,Shopping on here was so easy and less stressful thanks eBay,5
14798,"Go back to the way you just had the ap. To where you can see a sellers feedback, without going into the item to see it.

14818,"Perfect for my purchases! I love the Ebay app. It saves things I like, sorts according to categories, saves sellers and purchases. I like being able to save stuff but I wish there was a notepad feature in ebay so I could save hunting notes without tripping the discount feature. P.S. the tracking feature. I can't tell, as an end user, if the shipping feature is not staying current or the sellers drag their feet about shipping.",5

14878,Love eBay it's the best shopping app I have ! Xxx,5
14879,"Great for buyers, horrible place for sellers. Fees are way too high. The % off the sale is crazy and on top of that, they even take a portion of your shipping charges, forcing you to dip into your already small profit to ship the item. Seller is almost giving merchandise away. I will be removing all items I'm selling and going somewhere else. EBAY will burn out soon as no one can sell here anymore.",1
14880,Easy to search for products.,5
14881,"It's terrible, please put it back the way it was,thank you.",1
14882,The sellers are terrible. Buyers are terrible. Ebay only defends the buyer. Ebay is trash anymore,1
14883,I love ebay!!! It's the only way to shop. I've only had a few issues and I've been shopping through ebay since around 2020!!! Ordered anything from car parts to stickers to bed frames just about everything. My favorite is clothes. Fishing supplies,5

14895,Legit platform,5
14896,I would have given them five stars more accountable for the warranties on the products I understand there's a shipment of return calls on the term warranty but there's also a product warranty they need to press that about some automotive parts from them several times and they were very good parts and next thing I know that month later it breaks down two months later it breaks down and I don't have any money left. I will say this specially Auto parts certain things tools stuff like that,4
14897,Finding my favorite teams players are fun,5
14898,Exceptional website,5
14899,Excellent app 👍,5
14900,"Essentially, it goes like this: You buy an item from Ebay, and it does not arrive for a month, you file a claim. They contact the seller, then put a HOLD for another couple days to ""Let the seller figure it out."" You contact the seller yourself and they direct you to Ebay. You call Ebay support, but ofcourse theres nothing they can do. They transfer you to a different team. And of course, there's no compensation for transaction fees on your card or the month wait on an important component.",1
14901,Excellent,5
14902,"I use ebay all the time for buying. Its great option for buying. I do wish the fee was a little lower. Makes it a little harder for selling. One option to fix would be to have the buyer split the selling fee and I think it would be easier on the seller. But yeah, great app to buy on.",5

14963,Ebay always has what I want. It's the original and the most experienced at resourcing items of common to rare in nature. It may even entice its viewers to rabit-holes in which they might find new items of fascinating attributes or bizzare trinkets that boggle ones mind! I love it!,5

15014,"Watch out selling on eBay. I understand they have to charge fees but I only received 50$ for an 80$ sale. Because of ""transaction fees"" and ""advertising fees"". Just a heads up. The ""free"" advertising promotions are not ""free"".",1
15015,"Good for finding deals, not for selling. Ebay is definitely good for finding things at decent prices. It might even be better than Goodwill in a few years, given how Goodwill keeps jacking up their prices. The problem with Ebay against Mercari is that it is not good for selling. Most of the time, you won't make much of a profit from selling things because of the shipping, label fees, and taxes.",3
15016,I like the app and use it alot just wish it did save all my items looked at and keep reminding me what I looked and letting me know how many been sold and should be getting mine before sold out.,5

15020,It been very good. I had brought a lot stuff from them.i just love ebay,5
15021,You got a lot of bugs on this app. Says I got 4 notifications when I have none. If I go to the desktop and look at ebay it shows how much I have sold. On the app it's at least £50 out. It's basic. But honestly ebay needs to have a good look at it's self. Ebay tracking for postage is diabolical. That never updates on the app. I would scrap this app and start again. I mean your making how much out of people? Fees are to high. The app is rubbish. You don't give sellers no backing. Honestly scrap,2

The only way to provide more benefit to the app would be the ability to open tabs.

15102,I like turtles.,5
15103,Best,5
15104,Best App ever I spend more time on this app than any other LOVE IT ❤️,5
15105,"Compared with my previous 2nd hand experience with taobao, xianyu, this app is so user unfriendly!! Cant imagine this is an app in 2024.... so old fashioned and not seamless at all!",1
15106,Very great,5
15107,Too fast!,5
15108,Awesome finds,5
15109,I love this app,5
15110,Easy to navigate and loaded with quality products.,5

15112,Easy to use!,5
15113,Great app to save money,5
15114,There are so many options for so many items. Very pleased.,5
15115,Great,5
15116,Great shipping that is normally very quick. Competitive and Cheap pricing.,5
15117,I like when you contact somebody the dealer or whomever is you're buying from that way there's no direct contact with that person but only through the app this gives me peace of mind and if they say something's going to show up on time it will show up are they getting in touch with you through the app and let you know it'll be a certain day or time and I like to be kept in the loop thank you for sharing.,5
15118,Excellent for both selling and purchasing!,5
15119,Can not get a actual person in chat unless you try to cancel account. Previous cars in garage have been erased. Search vehicle in garage and it sends you to only new overpriced parts. If you add a filter it eliminates specific vehicle search and asks you to finish adding vehicle that is already in your garage. Not very user friendly at all. And customer service is scarce at best. Have been a member since 2008. And never had this much trouble trying to search for a part.,1
15120,Just started it first day,4
15121,The app always gives a wide variety of item to pick from.The shipping is quit convenient as well no hasle as long as the seller is active i like the app i've bought many items from here i would recommend to others to try it because its worth it.,5

15128,"Yeah man ebay is ridiculously amazing and cool. Whenever I want an old toy from my childhood, parts for my car, a tree frog mounted in a frame for my gf, or a pack of 100 resistors for electronic projects, ebay ALWAYS has my back.",5
15129,LITERALLY NO OPTION TO SEE MY MESSAGES????,1
15130,Very happy,5
15131,Its so easy to order and to receive what you can't even imagine eBay may have. Things arrive a day before the due date sometimes.,5
15132,The app is without question a five star rating I use eBay a lot and have never had any trouble with it you can find anything you want on eBay,5
15133,I like it. Very easy app to work with,5
15134,"Used to be great, but like all websites it's now cluttered with Chinese junk. I might as well go to the Mexican flea market and buy it from them...",4

15142,"Worse app to purchase off of. They help sellers scam people. I bought transmission solenoids off a seller named (chinthy) careful with this seller. I had parts installed on the cars transmission, and it ended up destroying my transmission, and eBay support declined to help. The seller never responded after saying they would help. They just lied and scammed me out. 5/23/24 up to this day, nor the seller nor ebay have reached to help. It's very stressful during these hard time",1

15150,Good stuff,5
15151,I was so impressed with the support team they were there for me when I had an issue with one of sellers I'm not going throughout details but I got all my problems solved and I want to thank them very much. you guys are awesome.,5
15152,Making it impossible to use for sellers. eBay is researching day by day to make it almost impossible to use We never had the option to search for any sales record Now we can't see any messages The worst team of eBay is who is working for this eBay app .They don't have ideas or they are not capable of doing their job,1
15153,Every thing I ordered was good,5
15154,Works. You bid. You buy. But damn those last minute snipers. They are the bane of my experience on this application,4

15162,"I hate this, it's so stupid, all the times I've bought stuff on eBay it either gets sent back to the seller or it just won't send to my address! I've only bought like 5 things form here and only one of them came without problems, I currently bought something and it won't send to my location, saying it's wrong and I need to pay a redelivering fee! I just payed $40+ for something and it won't except my card! Or any card! My address is right everything is right! But no! This sucks!",1
15163,So far im happy with service!!!!!,4
15164,"I prefer ebay to all and any market sites. I am a stanch anti-communist and counter revolutionary. I have plenty of reason to oppose Google and all of its satellite companies, but I am not rich and love to save money on those not-every-day items. I highly recommend this online store.",5
15165,E BAY HAS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHAT SO EVERY. THEY PROTECT ANYONE WILLING TO ABUSE THIER SYSTEM. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO RESON AT LL TO USE EBAY. IT IS FULL OF SCAMMERS BOTH BUYING AND SELLING... I REPEAT. THERE IS NO ONE YOU CAN TALK TO... ABSOLUTELY ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT E BAY DO NOT USE EBAY... GO SELL AND BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE. E BAY IS TERRIBLE.,1
15166,Great app,5

15206,Great app. Easy to use & lots of products to browse & buy from. Value for money products. I can use clearpay too.,5
15207,Scammers have infiltrated the site using sensitive info on its customers to send emails with phone numbers or links that unsuspecting victims call and click on. Impersonation of Norton & PayPal are the two that was sent to me by AudioSavings. Reporting the activity to Ebay's email has left me feeling nothing has been done. The site will continue to fill with scammers like the dating apps. But now all your sensitive info is there as you purchase unknowingly from the scammer.,1
15208,Great service provided by enay and same gors for the app. It just works as it should.,5

15213,"Made a sale, eBay put a month hold on the funds until the buyers confirmed it was delivered. Buyers confirm they recives the order. Contacted support to lift the hold. despite them having access to the internal chats and a rep confirming they had read the messages seeing the buyers confirming they recieved the order, they extended the hold because I didn't have tracking on the order. Frustrating and extremely stupid.",1
15214,"High cost to sellers, the customer service page does not work currently, and a promo on my end doesn't want to be applied.",1
15215,Easy to find what i need.,5
15216,very easy to order,5

15233,Ebay is always reliable and secure!,5
15234,Love it.,5
15235,If you plan on selling with ebay you will regret ever making such decision. Thier fees is the worst ever. They charge you for everything and find every opportunity to reap you off. Try other sites if you want to sell. Ebay is not it. Thier policy only favor buyers. They don't care what u think all they care is making thier money. Ebay is the worst selling platform. This is for the large scale sellers. Run and don't take the risk.,1
15236,Amazing,5
15237,Very informative,5
15238,"Removing the ability to search by or remove locations was enough for me, it made this mostly useless, if I want to be able to filter by EU and avoid waiting for Chinese delivery time that's my decision not eBay's. That's enough of eBay, deleted 😆",1

15244,awesomeness,5
15245,Ebay international shipping is the worst shipping around. Takes over a month to receive packages from the USA. My wife receives stuff from China faster. Like week's faster. Packages sit at international shipping hub for week's. Before they are shipped to Canada. The app is good . Shipping times are horrible,1
15246,Easy to use large variety of recycled clothing at bargain prices and much more items galore,5

15263,"app doesnt work on chromebook np matter how many time you delete and reload or update, this has been happening to many ppl for years with zero help from ebay,,,,,,",1
15264,Horrible update and new app layout... Navigation is clunky and awkward. When clicking on items the screen is cluttered with items that are irrelevant to the listing.... Keep it simple eBay! This update is a cluttered mess. Developers trying to justify their jobs I guess. Update: 2024... Again a jobs worth has updated the app and there is no longer a 'messages' option for sellers. App is very focused at buyers only. Horrible for a seller to use and keep track of everything.,1
15265,This is the HOTTEST APP EVER IT'S ON FIRE 🔥 I MYSELF REALLY WANT TO THANK Y'ALL EBAY,5

15274,I've found a lot of items I was looking for and items I wasn't looking for. The prices have been reasonable and I've found more items on here than on Amazon. I'm going to keep the eBay app for a long time.,5
15275,My go to store online I always get the right part the first time Everytime I do like to check and double check also make it a point to contact the seller first before purchase to verify the correct application on sizes or dimensions always trust eBay has been my favorite shopping online for years since 1999,5

15297,"eBay is a scam. They charge a 20% final value fee if you sell something, they don't protect sellers when there's clearly unreasonable buyers, and the entire eBay experience is terrible from start to beginning.

15345,Enjoy being able to find what I need fairly easy most of the time!,5
15346,Smooth interface. Has everything I need. No complaints.,5
15347,I used to use ebay constantly but unfortunately a few of my transactions lately haven't gone great. I'm very remote and shipping times are long which is fine. The problem is the difficulty getting it sorted when the item doesn't arrive. There's a time limit to when the can start a claim which is shorted than our shipping times. So far I've only lost a little bit of money but who knows. Called customer service and they told me they'd reopen the transaction to make a claim but nothing so far.,1

15359,Great platform,5
15360,Easy and fast,5
15361,"Updates to the app continues to make it worse. Once you get use to the dumb way it works, update again. If you have 100 items & you make a change on #83, and want to continue to the next item, it goes back to #1 then you to scroll all the way down. One update finally got it right on this issue for only a month, update changed it again. New way to load pictures went backwards, and harder to get pictures up from phone. They can't leave what works. STOP WITH THE UPDATES!",1
15362,incompetent software developers can not even make their software to work after update. .... they are perfect in making making sure that people stop using their services.,1

15375,"Been using this app for about a year. After my experience today I don't ever think I'm going to use it again. Did you know that if you make an offer and someone sends a counter offer to you, there is a big button in the email they send you, if you accidentally tap it you are contractually obligated to pay that. There's no way off cancelling, I called the people and they gave me the most backwards answers and told me there's nothing they can do. It's like talking to a greedy gpt swindler.",1

15462,Since I wasn't allowed to give Ebay Phones a bad review. I'll leave it here. Do Not buy refurbished phones. I was left with a terrible battery. Even if they're willing to replace it.

Very difficult trying to do so. That's why I gave this app only 2 stars. At least I can still shop, place bids, etc. Les Update: something changed. Now I can leave feedback. A bit of problem recently trying to access items that I bid on. But received several messages informing me that upgrades were being performed.",3

I guess I've been missing out for sure. So far only 3 refunds, but done in due time and with integrity. The tracking systems for items purchased can get an overhaul in efficiency though. But it's a system of many different delivery and shipping services worldwide all tied together so they're doing what's within their power to do so👍🏼👍🏼",5

I was told it was now mine and the sellers problem. Even though I was promised by customer service, they would help me. I won't be using this service again. There are so many better ones available these days. Don't support a trash corporation who doesn't care if you are actually taken care of.",1

15544,"Don't fix what isn't broken! In previous versions of this app, menu items were at the top which freed the bottom for scrolling. Now that it's on the bottom every now and then as I'm scrolling up my thumb hits one of the other things and I lose my place and have to start all over again which is a real PIA. The second issue is getting suggestions and ads for things I don't have favored/saved/hearted, that's really getting to be annoying.",1

15575,I love it,5
15576,It's great fast delivery and free which is great,5

15600,Very helpful,5
15601,"Terrible app. Half of the time it just takes you to an endless loading screen like when trying to contact buyers, half of which claim to be Australian sellers with items in stock but are actually dropshipping from Aliexpress and ebay does nothing about it or offers any compensation when the claimed 2 day shipping time is far exceeded. Pathetic.",1
15602,eBay is awesome whatever I want or need I can find it on eBay some item I could never get in town . With eBay I can even find them from across the world . 😎😎😎,5
15603,"Always satisfied. I been able to find, almost everything I need and delivered on time.",5
15604,I love ebay,5
15605,"This app has been perfect until very recently. So, every time I add new items, I take pictures from my phone and always take pics of items in groups, then delete the pics after they're posted. Now, every time I go to select photos it shows every picture I have taken and deleted whether they be personal or for eBay, and it makes finding the pictures more difficult going through everything instead of what is just there.",2
15606,App works well and the upload via mobile button works again,5
15607,If you like shopping or just want a great deal then this application is for you. Is easy to use and has excellent resources. Happy hunting!,5

15611,Nothing but good sellers so far. No complaints as of yet.,5
15612,"I love how I can use my app by managing my watchlist, sellers, and searches more efficiently! With the Google Chrome Browser on my Android Phone and my Windows 11 Laptop, I feel like they're a little bit disorganized because the Browser on my phone doesn't have saved sellers or a way for me to look for more of my saved searches like the app on my phone! I also like the screen size on my app because I think the screen size on my Laptop is too big and the words are too small and hard to read!!",5
15613,Great app What a way to shop,5
15614,"Simple, as it should be. Keep.it.simple.",5
15615,It's ok but now since these updates the tracking has gotten even slower than ever now I have to wait for a package nearly two weeks before I ever receive it. This eBay tracking has never been like this before please fix it and I will rate it 5 stars again and thank you 🙂,3
15616,excellent,5
15617,Installed then uninstalled within 30minutes. First item search came up with about 70% of the sellers being scammers. I work too hard for my money to be worrying if it's a fraudulent listing.,1

15623,"Editing my review, which was formerly 5 stars because the app randomly opens a dialog that mandates positive feedback in the Play store, or negative feedback in the app, with no way to exit the dialogue without giving feedback. Also it seems impossible to find QR codes for shipping as a seller inside the app and must use desktop mode in a browser.",1

15644,"Very good app, been using it for years appreciate it alot",5
15645,Good,5
15646,"Simple. It does what is supposed to do well. Filters could be more advanced and precise, though. But I guess those are a couple of very particular needs of mine 😅. In my particular experience, eBay's filters are a lot better than Amazon's, for instance. But as anything, eBay's filters could be improved, starting with some form of really good AI that help sellers list their products well enough so filters can perform better. I'd love to have a switch that shows eBay Certified Refurbished only 😍",5
15647,An amazing App that let's you navigate easily through Ebay.,5
15648,Been using for years with no issues.,5
15649,Ebay is good,5

15652,"I love using it specially that it link to your nectar card. You can almost find everything there. The only one point that need a work on is the feedback of the product and if you buy same item in higher quantity e.g. 5 pieces, why do I need to give five feedback.",4
15653,Good service,5
15654,"Terrible app, it Charges you hidden fees and taxes you like crazy for every sale and then it puts your account on hold for absolutely no reason so you cant even use the app.",1

15665,I use this to find adopt me pets and they do really good prices and i am planning on buying as i was to get richer on adopt but the app is just goood by itself because most of the time if your looking for something and you think its on ebay it most likey is on ebay as you can find anything and everything u can find online things or things for your bedroom or things for your kitchen but i mostly find it helpful for roblox as i can find things i want so ebay if somthing you should have - mercedes,4

15725,"I use a ton of shopping apps because it makes my life easier. the eBay app is my favorite out of all of them because every category has a ton of filters. All the shopping apps have a lot of garbage on them, but the eBay app is the only one that has enough filters to ensure you don't waste a ton of time wading through the garbage. You can filter out what you don't want to see, purchase what you need to, and get on with your life.",5
15726,Great website 👍👌😎,5
15727,It's ok for now,5
15728,More for less and ontime.,5
15729,Not worth selling on.,2
15730,Easy to use,5
15731,Ebay fees are out of control (increased yet again) and are taking away any margin sellers have. Corporate greed is out of control forcing me and others to look at other platforms. App should have more settings like that of the website. Horrible business model.,1

15740,"Here we go again, COME ONNNNN EBAY! Why when you update, do you feel the need to update things that were already working perfectly. The send message function just loads, and loads, and loads, the top 2 buttons, 3 dots and back arrow are also non functional. I've updated all software, uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Really handy not being able to send messages to customers and sellers!!!!",2
15741,Easy to use.always works.,5
15742,Stop messing with this app. Every other update completely destroys the ease of the search & sorting in the cars & trucks section of ebay motors. Leave it the way it was!!,1
15743,I'm very good I definitely loved it out,5
15744,"Always use the app to update listings, very easy to use.",5

15773,A+,5
15774,"As a buyer it's great as a seller not so much too many fees you have to have un-fare prices if I sell a product with $10 I got to make it 15 just so I can pay the transaction fee sales tax promotion fee and for the shipping label, on average any product I sell from 10 to 15 will pay out on avarge to five or seven too many freaking fees.",4

15776,Nice app for eBay purchases.,5
15777,"Excellent marketplace if you shop online, even hard to find items, used and or bidding is allowed. Just a good deal all round. A true marketplace I'd say is where you can snag a good at a negotiated price and that's Ebay...",5
15778,I love e-bay...,5
15779,Definitely my favorite application,5
15780,Works great for me !,5
15781,"It's ok, but as a seller, I'm constantly losing buyers because they can't request an invoice from the seller in the app. Also, the fact that you have to click open the description box, which 99% of people don't, so there are constant questions, and probably would help so many seller and buyers with INAD if it was just there. Fix those and the app would work a lot better.",1
15782,Love ebay and the amount of things you can buy,5
15783,Amazing,5
15784,Always have what I need.,5
15785,Very helpful and great product quality,5
15786,The fact they allow auction sniping makes them dogshit. Whoever has better internet connection and more time on their hands wins essentially.,1

15826,"New updates make it less easy to use. Extra steps have been added. *Edit* Its gotten worse. Making an OFFER requires you to first log into PayPal and prepay your offer. Will not open PayPal app, slowly opens in a browser. Additionally NEW update forces new UI that is unable to be edited. The left side of the screen is ALWAYS used to display Home, My eBay, Search, inbox, and selling. This takes up precious screen space. App stopped working on some devices.

15845,Stop automatically putting auto offer on my listings. Gets on my nerves everytime I have to go in each listing to cancel it.,3
15846,Terrible customer service and slow shipping. Don't waste your time on Ebay and just go to Amazon and get your item shipped to your house in a day! Very disappointed with Ebay they basically robbed me of 665$ on a order gone wrong with a faulty seller. They rewarded the seller for breaking Ebay rules and I had to pay. Terrible experience!,1

15899,"Quick, efficient and clear on items",5
15900,Basically gave over my entire identity and bank info. So much verification. Yet I sold some stuff. Buyer scammed me and returned a different item and eBay do not care.

15981,"If you're selling, the fees are ridiculous and ""no returns"" just deters some from buying because ebay will let anyone return anything for any reason. Its a joke. Seller pays double shipping on a no return listing because ebay says go ahead. Return was unjustified. Sell it privately or elsewhere.",1
15982,Easy to use. Get to choose my item and price I'm willing to pay. Way cheaper than the shops.,4
15983,Okay could be better I remember when you would get $5 reward for on time shipping or if something was late,5
15984,"The ""Full Item Description"" should already be on the same page as the photos and item details. It is very confusing and frustrating having to tap on ""full item description"" for each and every item that I look at. Get rid of having to do this.

It's okay though, I haven't had any problems like this on Amazon. Good luck on sales.",1
16012,Nice and easy .,5
16013,"It's Ebay. If you are a buyer, it's ok. Even better than ok. If you're a seller, it's horrible. After the 14% plus 9% to promote an 40-cent standard, add fee not great. But then they take the fees off the total. So if there is tax where your buyer lives. You pay your fee off that. Plus if you charge shipping. Guess what your fee is also taken off that. Now sell your item. If you don't want to wait 4 days to get the money. Ebay is there to help you out. Get your money instant. For 1.5 % fee.",2

16139,"Absolutely horrible. Cannot customize listings and ebay ""managing"" money is awful. I didn't mind paying the PayPal percent per transaction for the security PayPal offers and my being able to have the funds available to me by my PayPal debit card. Ebay should allow US (the Sellers that you make money from on OUR sales) to choose how and by who we are paid for our sale of goods. 05/17/2024 update: eBay still sucks. Don't know how anyone can be employed here or any fool buy eBay stock 💩",2

16143,Love eBay Every I have gotten from eBay over the years has been as advertised and quick shipping It's when I got outside of eBay or Amazon that I have problems These platforms keep sellers honest and I appreciate it . I do support other outside businesses But after getting Jipped a few times I now try to vet all sellers outside of the protection of eBay and Amazon Each platform or business has its own strong points and both have their own specialty items Love Ebay,5

16154,Updates suck.,1
16155,Doesnt work half of the time. 4 years later and there are still plenty of issues. I can no longer use the website for the additional features. It just opens up the app. So I end up deleting the app just so I can check on sale progress. Redownload the app and can not log back in.,1
16156,Easy use!!!,5
16157,Super,5
16158,"Ah. Where to start. Well ebay is slowly dying because they have completely forgotten what made them great and have successfully destroyed most of what made them great. You used to be able to find really cool obscure stuff from pretty reputable sellers. Now the search function is totally broken, theres nothing but china junk and ebay has little regard for customer retention. The app affords no possibility of contacting ebay directly with issues on purpose, and they mishandle all cases.",1

16169,"Not sure why they've made it impossible to copy a tracking number, can't even message a seller about a late item, seriously, fix the goddamn app and stop being so stingy! Amazon never has any issues! Is the app made in China too? Still can't check the goddamn tracking within the app and can't copy the door code, is this app made for idiots? App is so broken! Did you guys pay an intern to make this?",1

16206,WHY DOES A NEW SEARCH INCLUDE THINGS I SEARCHED FOR IN THE PAST? THAT IS SO FRUSTRATING AND POINTLESS! Do i need to make a new account every time i look for a different item? Tracking MUST be opt-in by default! The current way is disgusting and creepy. Or that would be too simple i guess.,1

16221,"Why do these companies think rounded edges & smaller font sizes equals an ""update""??",1
16222,"forced updates always piss me off, especially when the revised app isn't as easy to use as the previous version... which is the case with the latest (May 2024). layout change is harder to navigate, view is less clear. why developers think it's a good idea to do this kinda thing when it results in a less accessible and less easy to use app, I dunno. generally app is not always easy to use, and not as functional as the website.",2
16223,Be careful with the sellers. Sometimes the add make offer and then they do not accept nothing...or dont answer customers inquiries. Viapalmbeach is a good example.,5

16269,These companies are the biggest scammers in 2024. I don't use this stupid company for selling items. Someone made an account using my email and a different number and eBay keeps sending me emails asking me to pay some fees. At least take verification from people to make seller accounts.,1

16311,So after 12 years I find the eBay android app to be good. The app compliments the website with notifications and alerts. The watch lists and saved searches allow me to track items of interest.

16312,the best 👌,5

16332,I've been an eBay buyer for a couple of years now and enjoy buying things off of here at a low cost and getting my things right at my door. It's easy to set up an account and everything is in safe hands by eBay.,5
16333,Since update can't contact seller. Just keeps trying to load continually,1
16334,"always good deals, even at 3 in the morning.",5
16335,Excellent!!!,5
16336,good,4
16337,"every transaction is awesome! After a couple years, and SINCE ebay is using there own shipping hub, items are taking 2x longer. I've been buying from other retailers and it's much faster.",5
16338,It's pretty good for thrift shopping on the fly. Br careful though,4
16339,Love purchasing things off of eBay.,5
16340,I find eBay essential for founding Collectible items in games,5
16341,"eBay used to be brilliant, and I used to use it every day. Unfortunately, your logarithms are terrible, I search items and items I am NOT looking for appear in my search, poor, very poor Ebay. Your logarithms do not work. With every update the app is getting worse. Won't be long before I switch to another auction site.",1
16342,great app,5
16343,Relevant description. Clear payment options.,5
16344,Great app. Keeps all my goodies where I can quickly find them. Safe and secure purchases. Ebay money back guarantee and great sellers. I love using Ebay! What happens to my ebay bucks?,5

16346,Good,5
16347,YOUR PRICES TO HI AND HARD TO EXCHANGE AND U DONT CARE IVE BEEN THEIR. LOTS. THANK U.,1
16348,Easy to navigate,5
16349,A++++,5
16350,Excellent!,4
16351,Great ap,5
16352,For the most part I've had a great experience on eBay do you get a few sellers do sometimes put up false advertisement but that is not eBay's fault and typically if I do have a problem eBay is quick to jump in and help,5
16353,The saved searches are useful and the app is surprisingly good for creating ads.,4
16354,The app allows for quick and easy access to items I am looking for.,5
16355,Great Web site .,5
16356,"It was great before the forced update. Now it's very slow to load. I need to contact a couple of sellers, but the contact pages just won't load at all. Can you please fix it? 🙏 Also the type now excruciatingly tiny. People have to be able to see it! 😩",3
16357,"The app for a while had a white screen and keeps saying ""invalid token"" can you please fix this ASAP as I'm trying to sell things on there to get some extra cash together for my flat. Thanks :)",1
16358,Great!!!,5
16359,I love it,5
16360,I find everything I look for every time! Even 26 year old audi parts I can't find anywhere else,5
16361,"Slow at times, but I think it is my location.",5
16362,"Edit: they actually fixed the issue I complained about. The app is fine, but why does it vibrate when you click the tracking number? It's already not useful that it only copies the tracking number. Vibrating just makes it annoying.",4
16363,Ebay I just love it i can get stuff I want and more stuff,5
16364,The menu bar at the bottom is horrible. Bring back the hamburger menu in the corner that opens to the side. This bottons at the bottom trend ruins the usability of the app.,1
16365,Mega,5
16366,"Great app. Issues stopped and I'm able to sell and buy. Only complaint is I can't store more items on my watch list and saved items, but then I'm just being a typical window-shopper. Some good sellers to buy from on here but just be mindful.",5
16367,Awesome,5
16368,Its been great to find things I need. Or a radio I can't find at most sight's.,5
16369,Barfkto,5
16370,"Sold 1 thing on ebay and I'll never do it again. The amount of money they take from you in fees is outrageous, and how unclear all of the charges are and amount of time it takes to even get in your bank account is not worth it. I don't know where I am going to sell at next but will never be on ebay again.",1
16371,Nice and good,5
16372,Very Good and affordable,5
16373,Great app.Would recommend,5

16376,Always can look for a game or anything I'm looking for they are awesome to help with the shipment thank you,5
16377,Buy and sell,5
16378,"Always understood that as a buyer you would be supported if there were dodgy sellers. Unfortunately this doesn't appear to be the case anymore, despite proving evidence of a refund the seller just closed the case and eBay have turned around and said that's that. I have used it for years and any issues eBay always stepped in but clearly policies have changed now and its now down to sellers instead. Deleting account and shopping elsewhere so I don't lose more money.",1
16379,Awful experience with buyers. eBay promote fraudulent activity and negate on the decisions shared by their customer service team. I will no longer use this business,1
16380,"The interface changes every now and then, but the ebay community is a very stable and good one",5
16381,Great way to buy and sell,5
16382,Fast hassle free.,5
16383,"What on earth is going on with eBay? Now I find I have to add a review of the item purchased in order to leave feedback. I am not here to act as a reviewer for second-hand books so the seller misses out on good feedback. Some proper idiots working behind the scenes here, every recent ""tweak"" has been regressive.",1
16384,Everything works perfectly. 30ish years later and it's still the best shopping site.,5
16385,Think I been shopping here more then Amazon lately. Ebay really stepped up thier game. Loving this app.,5
16386,This is a good app and I can get new honeywell panels for a little price and weather radios,5
16387,"I'm taking all of my items off of ebay their policies are absolutely one sided. If your not a buyer, your not liked. Just look at the return policies? Buyer sent back a switch they obviously damaged and swapped out the joycons. But since I said no returns in the first place. They won't do damn thing about it. I'm done.",1
16388,Really like ebay,5
16389,Love it,5

16394,The site and app are great. I don't have to get on a PC to do anything.,5
16395,Easy to us,4
16396,I have never had so much trouble returning a product before eBay must not have live people because I can't get one on the phone and I been 3 hours working on return and still haven't gotten it done or still don't know how to do it I will never use ebay again,2
16397,Convenient to buy online.,5
16398,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE STOP UPDATING THE APP WITH LESS OPTIMAL FEATURES. YOUR APP IS GOING BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS. THE EASE OF USING THE APP SHOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGES, AT LEAST DON'T MAKE THE EXISTING POSITIVES FUNCTIONS OF YOUR APP NEGATIVE WHILE ADDING UNHELPFUL UPDATES.",1

16406,"Go to your local pawn shop because ebay seriously is not the place to be, if you plan on selling anything just remember ebay charges tax fees transfer wages, after the buy pays sales tax you have to pay sales tax? TAX FOR WHAT!!! They charge fees for selling for ads they have fees for literally everything. And plus the shipping is unbelievable its just a big giant headache! U make no money... buying things is even more crazy.. soon they be cut off and i cant wait.. karma💪",1

16412,"Ebay changed around their classification categories, and now I can't find any of categories I used to search.",2
16413,Good app. Quick and simple.,5
16414,The worst application ever. Failure in delivery. No money return. No logical responses from customer care and they are not doing any effort to help. I've lost my money and I didn't recommend anyone to buy from it.,1

16434,Great app easy to use,5
16435,"Used the website to buy books. Somehow, *something* happened around my account where I am now permanently suspended. 🙃 They cannot tell me why, not even a single inkling, lest it ""tip off"" a potential hack. 😒 Don't give your info to this company - they can just nuke your account for no reason and keep your info to themselves.",1
16436,Joy,5
16437,"Dont like being forced to update on a functional application but OK. Maybe update your anti-scammer system first before anything else, since they block you from giving them feedback on purpose so that you can't report many faulty items.",1

16460,"as a buyer I am very satisfied, I work as a carpenter, and I bought all the tool kit through ebay, plus household appliances, telephones and much more. I don't know the exact amount, but for sure I have purchased goods of over £8000+, and I have never had any problems...",5
16461,"This app is so dodgy! I have bidded on and won two phones this month, and both times, after the auction ended for me, other buyers were able to bid for another minute or two, until I was eventually outbid and lost the auction. I reported this to eBay, and all the help I got was them telling me to try using a computer instead. Obviously, if I COULD do that, I would. How about fix your broken app instead??",1
16462,Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
16463,I have used the app many times. It is easy and dynamic.,5
16464,Awesome app. It is very easy to navigate. 5 Stars.,5

16484,"be very careful whit this, scammers will do anything to steal from you . they tried and tried until they finally did it and ebay will just close the case and there will nothing to do I'm switching to Amazon it seems more safe and at least there's not so many scammers I used ebay for more than 2 years I'm never using this again they are incompetent and they just don't care I lost 110 dollars and although I'd not much,I'm never trusting this again the scammers are well organized 00000 ⭐",1

16487,It's very good,5
16488,"It's great to give real people money for good products over bezos whenever possible. I use this eBay often and for, Tools gifts, camp gear, car parts, electronics, antiques, movies, musical instruments, lots of discounted resale items. often the same products on Amazon but for less. Iv had maybe 2 negative outcomes in the 8 or 10 years I've used the app, just keep an eye on the rating and if the seller has a return policy. Lots of great people on eBay trying there best to do it right.",5
16489,Terrible customer service. Would not recommend. Ebay has a 22 billion dollar market capitalization and does not have a call center to help customers.,3
16490,App is essential when you wanna bid or stay on top of items your browsing for. Always signed in and in real time.,5
16491,I love it I got so many amazing stuff off of it I suggest using this four things you can't find anywhere else,5

16498,Never let me down great app,5
16499,"I cant leave a good review when they don't get rid of scam accounts. its a good app, but they just let people get scammed all the time. really unfortunate. i shop here all the time and know what to look for but im always concerned that one day i will miss something. be careful.",2
16500,Great!,5
16501,I love how Ebay checks items and sellers out to prevent fraud,5
16502,Probably not he BBC est App ever released.......,5
16503,Very good quality very nice stuff quickly dispatched,5
16504,Fantastic app! Thanks for providing a better and fair marketing platform for millions of people around the globe!,5
16505,It is easy to look for what you want,4
16506,"Returns allows seller to lie, say label sent when they haven't. You lose money. No option to get intervention from ebay even though it says there is. Scammer's dream. Also nags for feedback if you say you like the app.",1
16507,Exelent,5
16508,May 2024 update removes the ability to lock the sort and filter settings. They reset to default with every search. Please make this option available again.,3
16509,Easy to use,5
16510,"Easy to sell stuff but I think they take too much of a cut. It is super protective and I feel safe so the payment is worth it most times. It's generally around 13% with an additional 7% to ""boost""",4
16511,Great website if looking for good bargains.,5
16512,Good goods 👌,5
16513,"Terrrible app requres frequent updates. Must be unstable, I guess eBay get their app developers from temu?",1

16515,Why does this keep stopping me from buying stuff? Will use amazon instead,1
16516,"Worst update ever. Cannot copy the Tracking number out of the Sold Items detail - why not? Plus, adding a row of 5 icons of commonly used functions on bottom of screen is pointless, as these icons still exist otherwise. Who writes this lousy software???",1

16530,"NO 1 like EBAY the best place to shop what I need, 100 % Positive👈😉",5
16531,Great 👍,5
16532,eBay is a great site. What I will say about this app is in the last couple months 2024 it will send me an alert about a deal for an item that I am not even watching. It will be something I looked at but the wrong size or different not the item I am looking for. the app will not stop sending me a alert that the price has dropped on a item that I am not watching. They are trying to sale more stuff and trying to suggest what they think. I Hate that. Targeting with an algorithm.,2
16533,Love eBay for instance there's some things that I have found on eBay that haven't even seen anywhere else in years and everywhere I would look haven't been able to find these items for the longest I was using Amazon but after they would hack my stuff over and over again and just couldn't find some of the stuff I was looking for there switched to eBay Etsy and wish since the switch to these three from Amazon not one disappointment,5
16534,Great quality and great service,5
16535,Very fast,5
16536,works great so far. no issues.,5
16537,Still Excellent. But American Seller's still need to sort Postal rates out. To Expensive.,5

16545,"Starting to hate this company, y'all ain't ready when it comes to customer service. Worst experience shopping on this app. You don't know how to solve a anything on that stupid platform",1
16546,Why move catagories from the perfectly functioning side bar? Why remove the side bar? Are you stupid? You must be if you think I'm going to continue using this app after moving things around for no reason. And forcing people to update to use the app? Yeah.. no.. f you.,1
16547,"I love doing business on eBay one thing I recommend is adding fonts, colors and texts size to the description. I know you can do this on computer but I prefer mobile app more.",5

I asked her if there are higher ups that I can contact to solve this issue but she didn't give me any answer and now I can't make any orders at all .. worst customer service ever,1

16625,It's been a long time since I sold anything on ebay and it's like a whole different site now. It's all so easy it basically does the work for you. Even shipping was taking care of for the most part,5
16626,It's a great application,5
16627,Good service and friendly peoples,5
16628,I can not get into my ebay.,1
16629,a fair platform I enjoy it,5
16630,Useful.,5
16631,Good,5
16632,I hate forced updates - the app won't even open until you update it! This is a constant thing with the app,1
16633,Tracking functionality is not good. I had to go to email and manually find the courier's website to search for up to date tracking information.,2
16634,Very good,5
16635,"Great ap. Fast, easy, does what it's supposed to.",5
16636,I like this apps it's works great.,5

16641,Great app love the new features,5
16642,Excellent,5
16643,"Ebay is an excellent company to do business with . I have been ordering off and on, and I'm well pleased with them.",5
16644,I like to use eBay platform,5
16645,"I'm being informed, I need to update the app, current version on my Android 13 phone is 6.159.0.1 My phone won't update",4
16646,"No matter what, they have it@",5
16647,"""An update on your order""?!? C'mon, fix the email titles so I can see at a glance which purchase the email goes with. The email titles never should have changed in the first place! Long-saved searches are returning garbage results that should not have passed the filters that were set.",1
16648,eBay is so helpful.,5
16649,For all those HARD to find items 🙏🏻 thank you eBay fam.,5
16650,Good,5
16651,Graet app,5
16652,"Account restricted for no reason for 2 YEARS?!? Apparently because I had no selling activity that meant my seller activity fell ""Below Standard"" Requested for my account details to be removed (address, bank details etc) and apparently that can't be done. Surely a GDPR breach. Hideous service.",1
16653,Ebay has exceeded expectations,5
16654,EBay the great place to find anything that you're looking for,5
16655,Good thanks.,5
16656,"The new update as of 14/5/24 is frigging terrible. There was nothing wrong with the old app version. The UI sucks & doesn't feel or look nice, and is far more confusion than the simple menu drop down setup from before. Worst thing I've found so far, when you go to leave feedback it doesn't save your comment from feedback to feedback making you have to re-type it everytime. Whoever programmed and okayed the new update suck, they suck alot. 2 stars for functionality, that is all you get.",2
16657,Another forced downgrade. Big box across the bottom of screen useless. Fix the problem of surching the whole world instead of UK you can't manage to do. I don't think the designers live in the real world of using eBay more the world of an artist that hasn't a clue. Where's the button that says never instead of maybe later.,1
16658,Hope it lasts forever,5
16659,New update has bugs makes it so you cannot contact sellers,1
16660,"""Your ebay app is out of date"" error when reviewing offer to purchase. Latest app version installed. Tried cache/data clear, uninstall, restart and install same red banner error.",1
16661,Very Good! 👍,5
16662,"Easy to use, covers everything.",5

16668,Excellent,5
16669,Ez to use,5
16670,Amazing customer service i had a problem with a product i bought they sorted it out and even give me a refund on top of a new battery for the product im new to ebay but so far so good,5
16671,Love it all great!,5
16672,So far great,5
16673,Almost perfect except seller fees are extortionate and offers absolutely no seller protection whatsoever.,3
16674,A tool to quickly review articles on sale before sitting in front of a PC to do the detailed work.,5
16675,Very good,5
16676,It's not what it use to be because now they more accommodating for the sellers instead of the buyers and the reason for that is because if you make a offer and what if the seller takes his time and you commetted to buying and you need the item asap you would have to not only wait but you will be waiting linger if you decide to order another one if the offer don't work. INCONVENIENCE FOR THE BUYERS!,1
16677,Only just downloaded the app today but so far so good,3
16678,"Works fine for me, no problem with it.",5
16679,"It is one of my best apps, and my go to apps. Three thumbs up.😎😎😎",5
16680,"Completely ruined the app, which idiot decided to move the control tabs to the bottom?? UI ruined, it wasn't broken & no fix was needed. Old version is far superior, vertical tab on the left of the app screen was the best form of navigation. WHY THE HELL DID YOU REMOVE THE COPY TRACKING NUMBER DETAILS? Before you click the tracking number, it auto copies this so you can enter this on tracking website for more details, now can't even copy the text. New app must've been designed by a blind bat.",1
16681,You don't ever know,3
16682,Super,5
16683,Great 👍,5
16684,I was REQUIRED to update the app. the update moved everything around and it's harder to navigate. I'd rather have the pre-updated version.. thanks for complicating things.. you lost a star.,4
16685,"I just bought new cosmetic product on eBay for $20 LESS than Amazon's price - free postage w/30 return option. Amazon move over, you have a direct competitor willing to sell at cheaper prices.",5
16686,Every time you need to use ebay - something does not work. Customer support is a joke. It's time for someone other selling platform to take over,1
16687,Outstanding,5
16688,"Promos don't activate. I've lost literally thousands of nectar points because the promo offers won't activate, e-bay has ignored my complaints.",2
16689,I love shopping on this website.,5
16690,They have good transformers sellers.,4
16691,"App stopped working on my android phone and then on my ipad too. Can't sign out on phone and won't let me do anything. Won't sign me in on ipad, loads for ages and then shows an error message. What's going on?",1

16695,"It's reliable just like amazon, workers are crim... s.",5

16697,Can't order through app as it can no longer post to my address so must go online to buy items,4
16698,"Confusing,did not respond well",1
16699,Excellent shopping app,5
16700,Love it,5
16701,"The app displays a watch list, which is convenient because I don't always have the money to shop online, or there may be something out of stock. They send you notifications when they restock. Free shipping. I give it 5/5 stars!!",5
16702,"I haven't changed my mind. I love this app! This apphase very nice stuff, at a reasonable price. Customer' service are excellent at their job! Very professional and kind. Thank you for everything you do for us!!",5
16703,Fair experience,5

16726,amazing! I can do eBay stuff real easy with the eBay app 👍,5

16731,"Good set up, clear fonts for instruction I would never change that it would bamboozle ur customers & prob end-up bankrupting you.

16737,Very easy to use the app.,5
16738,Searching for best price a nightmare. Long and Fruitless. Not worth one star.,1
16739,The app is good I think leaving feed is a very good idea,4
16740,Amazing platform to buy or sell. User friendly. It's probably one of the first websites to start an online store.,5
16741,"Love the eBay app, so convenient and easy to use.",5
16742,"Horrible site for buyers, no customer service. Terrible people. Buyers beware. 2 separate purchases that were not delivered but NO REFUND. They don't care, ripoff.",1
16743,Great,5
16744,"Similar to the Amazon and Asda shopping apps, it's bursting at the seams with sponsored content; rows upon rows of the stuff even in the listings themselves, making it very hard to find the information you're looking for. Abysmal to use and navigate now. Edit: It keeps re-enabling Watch content reminders shortly after turning it off so you always get message spammed whether you want it or not. Absolute charlatans; won't be using eBay again.",1
16745,Best place to buy coins!,5
16746,Brilliant,5
16747,A great go to option which covers everything,4
16748,Ebay gives you a good choice of everything you could think of with good prices great app 👍,5
16749,Just a good app...no fuss no muss,5

16753,Exercellent app,5
16754,"So far algds, no problems and if there is a problem Ebay sorts it out, thankyou. 💜☮️💜",5
16755,Garbage intrusive inconvenient unwanted,1
16756,"Fees are extortionate, I got a random charge of 3.99 for putting something on for sale even though i supposedly had 999 free listings, then when my item sold for £45 plus postage at 2.50 they took a percentage of the whole amount not just the item but the postage as well then said I earned 38 from the sale once the postage was taken out and then paid me 35 so in all I made £31 and eBay made £11.50. Beware there are hidden costs they do not make you aware of.",1
16757,"The machine works , so why change it",1
16758,"App works great, not so much for my bank account but thats a different story.",5
16759,Nice,5
16760,Been goof for me so far. Wish the fees were a little less but it is what it is,5
16761,Great fun,5
16762,Stop moving things around. pick a place and leave it. I don't want to relearn a new configuration every time you force me to update this app.,5
16763,Can't get update,1
16764,Fantastic app,5
16765,So far so good,5
16766,kenapa nd boleh jual item oii bodo pny ebay,1
16767,I love ebay,5
16768,"Done upload as instructed & ebay still won't open, it keeps telling me to update.",1
16769,All Good,4
16770,Good app,5
16771,This is the most beautiful designed shopping app I have seen so far. The only problem is the number of inferior products. I returned and trashed a few over the years. A lot of people chose to sell their damaged products as new products.,4
16772,"Why is this app?? Has to update constantly, can't remember me when I try to use it... not very dependable.",1
16773,"May24Update APP is completely gone and unuseable now. 2 items visible in cart,PER SCREEN ROLL, in a massive phone screen,it is clear app is designed by completely incompetent people who have 0 idea what they doing and making the app worse which each update. Also item pictures cover WHOLE SCREEN. Small thumbnails are no more, browsing is 90% Slower due to massive pictures and thumbnails. Clicking ""Lowest Price"" filter means nothing as all SPONSORED sales now. It is now 100% fubar.",1
16774,eBay works good. Good deals on stuff.,5
16775,Nonexistent the app disappeared and now i cant use it total pos,2
16776,Great app,5

16779,Never have had an issue,5
16780,alows me to find things that you cant normaly get on Amazon. updated now cant find the options like in old app,1
16781,"Not as good after update. Cant find purchases, account info etc.",4
16782,Unable to load.,1
16783,Great place 2 shop,5
16784,Have had good success with all the vendors I've ordered from on ebay. Seems like they hold customer support and satisfaction as a very important goal and standard.,5
16785,"I don't have any room to delete the apps I use to add this update,",1
16786,"Very easy to use, and trust worthy!!",5
16787,Another forced update app,1
16788,Amazing service,5
16789,Good shopping,5
16790,Good,5
16791,I love ebay,5
16792,"This app stinks , idk know whats happening with the sellers on this platform but I'm tired of it and the stupid mailman that keeps delivering my package to the wrong door",1
16793,Forced me to update and then sign in again when I was going to check my desired auctions and could have lost them all completely just because of this. There were over five I was bidding on. Was displeased and disappointed in Ebay for not having regard for this.,1
16794,To many changes,1
16795,"The app itself is ""okay"", but the company has removed many options for sellers. For one, it's now impossible to make changes to final shipping weight/package size, so if your initial estimate was under, USPS deducts the balance from your bank account instead of charging your ebay balance. If it's over, then you need to send partial refunds to buyers - this effects your seller rating. People complain about shipping cost being ""too high"", but it's impossible to correct. Seller for 2 decades.",3
16796,So far so good,5
16797,Ebay would be a better selling app if scammers didn't have a way to automatically get their money back without proof that their item was broken or didn't match the ad.,3
16798,Good,5
16799,They made me update my account (which I use weekly) and now I lost everything. I'm done with fee-bay.,1
16800,eBay has the best prices and the cheapest and fastest shipping.,5
16801,I hadn't used eBay in over 10 years and I was able to quickly list and sell a couple of items. I'll probably use it again.,5
16802,I love eBay they protect ur purchases and u get ur items pretty quickly,5
16803,I'm drowning lot of the stuff that was stolen from my place,5
16804,Ok,5

16809,I'm happy with ebay,5
16810,Good service,5
16811,The best of both worlds,5
16812,Not happy about being forced to update. May just delete my account. Save myself some money. And they just did it again. A big reason why I seldom shop eBay anymore.,1
16813,😖,1
16814,what a wonderful app!!,5
16815,Very helpfull and resorcefull,5
16816,Always find something good,5
16817,Nice to find what I'm looking for.,5
16818,"And again - why do they do it? Why does every update have to make it worse than the last. How does making things difficult earn you more money? Just make it work and then leave it alone! And what's going on with AI built descriptions? Suddenly everything is perfect, trustworthy, ideal, unique, quality etc etc. Descriptions are just not believable any more. Perhaps sellers pay even if they don't sell?? --- Like most app providers, ebay wants their app to be a bit worse with every update.",1
16819,"Worse than temu. Bid time changing constantly from 1 week to 1 hour, 2 days to 5 minutes, impossible",1
16820,Good,5
16821,Forced updates? I try to be so proprietary blob free . Cmon man. Cornpop level BS,1

16866,"Frauds and data thieves. I've been selling on here for years, never a bad mark or strike against me, still none. They banned my account permanently because my mother, on a completely unrelated account to mine, got banned and they banned me for being related to her. There was no information provided to them that would indicate I was even related to her so they acquired this info from other means. Not to mention they actually used it as justification to ban me. My business is going to offerup now",1
16867,Solid app! The best bidding app out there. One thing I really wish they had was a dark mode feature for Windows PC. It's quite bright at night time when my lights are off in my room.,5
16868,I've not had a bad experience with eBay. It's so simple and easy to use that I'm not even sure how to evaluate it. I have always received what I was ordered and ur was exactly as the seller described,5

16912,"Trusty shopping. Good customer service. Please, take care of Chinese companies. Because the users can have problems with the Chinese companies. The Chinese products have bad quality . I had bought a product on wish app. They have told me that these products do not exist in Stock. They have been run out. But they did not give my money back. You may think to keep away from China and Chinese products.",5
16913,Great app 👌,4
16914,My ebay is aleays on time ! My orders always arrive and im happy with my Ebay.,5
16915,Sellers fees have become wayyyyyyy to high. Just sold an item that totalled $263 and ended up with $183 BEFORE paying for shipping and packing.... Overall I ended up with maybe $140 for a $250 part Will no longer be buying or selling off of eBay. There is no reason eBay should be making almost $100 on someone sale for doing absolutely nothing. I hope people see this review and get the same idea because eBay is bending the people over who keep their business running and it's sick,1
16916,Very good service,4
16917,Easy to use,4
16918,"It's my go-to app when I'm looking for just about any and everything you could want. I've never had a problem with receiving whatever I ended up purchasing. Every seller I have dealt with has been very punctual and sells their items at really great prices.

16953,Great app. Easy to use!,5
16954,"The eBay app is perfectly functional. No real problems with the UI from a buyer or seller's perspective. The only feature I'd like to see in the future is the ability to manage multiple sign in options, although this probably won't be a feature requested by most users. I happen to have two eBay seller accounts, so having to manually sign into and out of each account every time I need to switch accounts can be a bit of a hassle (especially with 2FA being enabled on each account).",4

16969,I really think I have found something really good here! I Love it!,4
16970,Update review 5/12/2024: So another update that has made the app LESS functional. When will Ebay figure out how to stop making their app worse with every update! Why do you guys keep making it harder to navigate the car search in your app??? Why do I need to go through multiple layers just to search a specific make or model? What if I want to see ALL makes models and body styles?? Stop ruining your app with useless updates that make navigating it more confusing.,1

16992,"Ebay bidding system is garbage, and needs to have an extended bidding timer when someone ups the bid at the last minute. This is ridiculous. Also, don't tell people what they need to over bid to win. That makes its way to easy to steal bids from people.",1

17001,"Please stay away from this app. eBay is not what it used to be. Out of the last 9 orders I have made, I have had to force eBay to step in and give me refunds for 4 of them. The sellers will no longer ship the stuff or communicate with you. They will ignore your messages and just make you force a refund, which I don't get. I am through with ebay. They better step it up, or they need to close it down. Personally I couldn't care less, because I will never ever use eBay again. Freaking joke. 👎",1

17024,"Update 5.2024: eBay fees are too high. Check out ""Whatnot or Mercari"" for lower fees. Fill out product details, and everything disappears. It happens all the time. Now I'm getting non-stop errors while editing listings. It's increasingly difficult to talk to a rep, yet their fees keep going up? The app sucks, and all images are low res. Parsing errors mid listing, random errors while editing fixed price listings. Very time consuming and frustrating",1

17094,It's just great,5
17095,"Great app, but like any amazing tool, learn the quirks and do your homework. Been full time on ebay after being laid off recently, it's singlehandedly turned my whole situation around because the work you put in as a seller pays off, ebay support has been attentive during issues and generally as long as you learn the rules you'll be taken care off. Overall as a buyer and seller ebay is the best app no question.",4
17096,I love it alot there's alot of nice things to view and purchase and great prices,5

17113,Good app,5
17114,"Absolutely terrible selling or buying service to now use in recent days. No wonder why many sellers or buyers are moving to other platforms. Terrible experience with customer service, refuse to remove unjust negative feedback or to remove abusive buyers accounts. Not to mention having to fight for months on end just to recieve a refund. Won't be using eBay again, a shame after using it for over 10 years.",1

17127,"Selling on eBay was OK at first. A few months ago I complained to support about the fees on ebay being to high. After talking with support my sales went from 2 or 3 a week to zero. I called support because I put a subtitle on my listing and was charged a subtitle fee. That is correct, a fee for a subtitle. Add that to the promotion, the final value fee and the cost of shipping supplies. Example. I sold something for $40. The $40 went to ebay to cover the fees on other listings.",2

17149,"Bunch of products brought in from who knows where. If you have a bad experience and decide to write out a negative review stating what happened, the seller will just refund your stuff and appeal the negative review so they can keep a positive look.. That's not how that should go. Why not replace items with working items instead of offering partial refunds...or idk make a product that works! Ebay is so frustrating.",1

That is appalling and, frankly, an example of eBay using its market power to extort users. Sad thing is this won't change, but slowly creep up until you're selling your items as a mere hobby. eBay are now beginning to match pawn shop prices in Australia, which is truly saying something.",2

I believe there's even more of a shift to buy (insert country here). Let's say Canada, for example. :) Other than that, I'd say kudos for a great site. And app.",4

17271,Brilliant service and prices.Thanks,5
17272,I love ebay,5
17273,"Buying is easy and hassle free, you name it; you can find it.",5
17274,Always amazes me when a major app like eBay has fundamental problems with the most basic things. Search by price? Doesn't work. Just does nothing. Amazing this made it to release.,1
17275,I really love ebay so far I've used it and I hope I get sales soon,5
17276,Ebay global shipping is a scam. They overcharge you and sit on your items for weeks at a time before they even ship it to you. Tracking only works within the USA. Once it leaves the USA there is no tracking. Brutal.,1
17277,Perfect,5
17278,Fabulous 👌 👏 👍,5
17279,Ebay charges fees on taxes. They fees are already high and now the sellers have to pay fees on taxes. If continue like that eBay will disappear.,1
17280,"Good app, keeps a track of all items bought, sold , the usual. Still a good place to do business. 5*****",4
17281,Why do product descriptions now open in a tiny window??,2
17282,Easy to use and good prices,5
17283,"Exalliant hassle free buy sell app,top of line service Gem Mnt 10.",5
17284,"Very bad for sellers NO support NO help. Only buyers get priority. Remember, there won't be any buyers without sellers! Vinted is much better option.",2
17285,I have great experience with this app. Thank you,5
17286,"Navigating this app can be a nightmare. Sometimes when pressing the back arrow, which I'd expect to at least go to my main eBay account screen if there's no history, the app exists. In some cases there's no way to navigate to your account so all you can do is exit it.",2
17287,It's very user friendly.,5
17288,“15% fee? Are you kidding me? That’s an insane transaction fee! ⚠️” No sir!,1
17289,"You can find anything at a good price on this app, I mainly use it for buying cds but it has everything a person needs.",5
17290,"Don't use eBay. I sold an item, it was authenticated and sent to buyer, then my account was mysteriously suspended, and I'm never going to be paid what I'm owed. They are a scam and a rip-off. I've tried to get an explanation MULTIPLE times, but their customer service is the WORST. They steal your money. Beware of eBay.",1
17291,Always works and easy to navigate,5
17292,Excellent,5
17293,So far so good. Couple hard to deal with sellers but mostly positive,5
17294,I like buying from Ebay it's easy and straight forward,5
17295,Awesome 👌,5
17296,eBay has become a joke first of all they allow scam sellers on there then they give the seller more time even tho they bin caught out then they force the buyer to pay for returns even tho is the seller is the one who mucked everything up not only that they made it impossible to contact eBay,1
17297,Good,5
17298,I have loved everything I have ordered came on time and in great shape with mo.problems,5
17299,Elite,5
17300,I have loved using Ebay for many years. Unfortunately twice in the past 6 weeks l have had 2 sellers think they can scam me by sending the wrong item and then offering a partial refund. Thus they send out a piece of garbage that doesn't cost them much then offer a part refund expecting you to keep the garbage item while they steal your money. I no longer have trust in Ebay I'm afraid.,3
17301,"Always good, no problems at all with my orders, good discounts off suppliers. Easy to use app.",5
17302,Has been very positive lately.Today app disappeared off phone.Hopped around and eBay reinstalled it and access reviewed my purchases and now am very happy.Although I appear to be unable to delete a accidentally downloaded eBay Kenya app.It is unacceptable this kind of harassment is probly the wedge that keeps my privacy open to decades long hackers.,5

17342,"I always shop on eBay, it's been a successfully personal shopping experience for me. The eBay app is the game changer, it's very helpful in online shopping.",5
17343,I love to browse all the deals!! It makes shopping easy!!,5
17344,The app is great but beware buying anything that ships from China they supply fake tracking numbers and defraud customers and unfortunately eBay can't tell between the legitimate and the frauds,5
17345,Kept saying I needed the most recent app so I had to.uninstall and re-install,5
17346,ebay is very profesinal and the shippig has always been on time but for some reson they let aliexpress sell on there website and temu alote off overseas sellers for ebay so you know what that means we are not keeping the money in our country for our economy its going out of our country to alote off overseas sellers if it was me i would restrict have overseas sellers and if there is a problem with the product you buy ebay will say its the sellers responailty and the seller says its ebays problem.,3
17347,Awesome online shopping,5

17351,Brilliant 👏 and so easy to find what you need to find,5
17352,I love the purchase security,5
17353,"I've only rated 3 stars because the app changes way too much for me with every update. With ebay buying and selling being so popular the app could almost be classed as ""essential"" so it's pretty much impossible to stop using it. Most features are decent and easy to use but I really don't like the new way that the item description pops up from the bottom of the screen instead of opening in a new screen. I find it difficult use depending on how the seller has formatted their description.",3
17354,As long an you make sure the seller is genuine. Then your in good hands,5
17355,Very expensive prices with taxes,1
17356,Updated to most recent app. Can't find the Seller Hub or product research page! I have to search for it everytime via HELP page!! This is riduculous. Your taking up another 51+ mb of space on my phone and making it convoluted to find what I need on the app. Why is this hidden???!!!,1
17357,"It makes it so much easier to access Ebay, and it's so convenient.",5
17358,"An e-commerce platform stuck in the early 2000s. The products are just as uninteresting as the platform itself, and tons of knockoff.",1
17359,Love ebay,5
17360,Good app love to use,5
17361,Gyat,5
17362,"It showed me exactly what the products provided. Helped make my choice. Sometimes shopping has to be a ""choose and hope you made the right decision""!!! With this app that is not the case. Your questions are answered as you are making your decision.....",5
17363,"Very good, thanks",4
17364,I love the way I put my make and model. And everything I need for that vehicle come out on my screen. From a/c kit I'm taking the whole kit complete make over and insurance is way eazyer then the one amazon offer.,5
17365,Just one problem with an unscrupulous seller tarnished an otherwise great track record of hundreds of purchases with ebay. I highly recommend Ebay. Excellent variety of items. Its awesome !,5

17406,Always a error on my selling part of the app now's. Not good.,3
17407,"Poor business model. They pride themselves on taking from the poor and giving to the rich. It used to be a place for sellers, now its just for their 2.8 billion yearly in profit, and thats net income, not total revenue. 13.5% they take for each sale to make a redicilous profit. I'm not sure how any small business is supposed to profit after getting raked over the coals like that. They get billions in profit, however.",1
17408,Keeps you updated,5
17409,The app has not been working lately.,3
17410,Great place to buy,5
17411,"I'm an avid toy collector and compared to every other auction service, ebay is the best. I've had my share of ebay mishaps but ebay has always worked with me to correct any issue. I will always recommend ebay first when it comes to the random wants and needs you can't find anywhere else.",5

17417,Useless...on Android you cant increase the maximum bid....I cant beleive that this exists for so long and yet they are unable to make a good app or an app that can do this basci things.,1
17418,Excellent,5
17419,I guess they let people cancel auctions if they don't sell at desired prices now and won't do anything about it. No wonder nobody uses ebay anymore,1
17420,Normally see things related to past orders... usually pretty good at being the right item and ebay sellers aren't bad at getting items shipped.,4

17461,Work's like a charm,5
17462,I use it all the time. The problem now is that if i dont like something they dont habe an option to take it off. So i keep seeing a racket with a crack in it or a game box but no game over and over. Then the person with the cracked racket will offer me a deal on it even tho i did not indicate that I wanted it. It would be so helpful if the list was cleared of all the faulty stuff.,3

17480,I have gotten good deals.,5
17481,Super!,5
17482,Not impressed with the fact that ebay decides on your language by IP. There should be an option to choose which language YOU prefer. It use to be that the client could choose but they changed this. All emails re notifications etc are now in a language I don't speak. Fix it.,2
17483,Always find what I'm looking for,5

17508,"As much as i have ordered from ebay with no issues all of a sudden they are letting sellers scam people now by using these random 'so called' tracking companies..I recently ordered just to have the seller say prodduct was shipped using an Aquiline tracking number, these numbers can't actually be tracked and doesn't give you any idea of whose the company that is actually transporting your package..Your basically screwed waiting on your package to just magically float into your mailbox. good luck",1
17509,2 sellers in a row. 1 lied. 1 never shipped item. There's no avenue to contact eBay with a problem. eBay will always side with the seller. Called me a liar. eBay will never be as good as Amazon. Your policy's don't protect the buyer. Your sellers are unethical and then eBay lets them assault to buyer. I never received one item. Started a refund. I got charged shipping for an item not shipped.,1

17531,How come whenever I filter lowest price to highest 75% of the entries dissappear but when I filter highest to lowest they all stay and when I scroll down to the bottom there are entries that have been removed in the lowest to highest filter..... it feels like you are trying to hide lower priced entries.... almost like you are trying to only show entries that have somehow payed eBay off🤔,2

UPS lost my package (didn't have pic of package in front of door ECT) UPS is waiting to hear back from eBay to sign something so that UPS can replace my package. I've heard nothing it's been close to a month and im out of 139-159. I was hoping to make it one of the two only online shops I use but not too sure now. It's May and no change has happened",1

17613,App has been slowly getting better update after update but it's completely stupid that the item description isn't full screen but only half of the screen now. You can't see most of the descriptions and are forced to go through the web or on the computer. Not exactly convenient from the last updates. Looks like I'll be downgrading before it was broken.,4

I was just looking to buy party decor for my upcoming birthday but instead didn't get to buy anything either due to the suspension. I don't know why or what I did to get suspended off the app but what ever reason they had was really stupid.,1

17623,Good,5
17624,"I have several products for sale, they have been for long time and they only have 1 or 2 views. How is that possible, with eBay being a platform with millions of users around the world and my products have international shipping and I used all the # tags posible I tried to pay for promotion and increase visits to my products and it turns out that it is not possible until you have sold a certain amount of products, this is completely ridiculous.",1

17645,"STOP CHANGING THINGS UNECESSARILY. The new menu change is TERRIBLE. Bring back the menu icon on the top left. At least give us the option to do so.

17653,"Has become a really bad site, most items listed as UK are actually from hongkong or China. Incorrect information from sellers about being in the UK but check sellers location and it's always hongkong. Ebay seems to be doing nothing to stop this. 🔴Update on eBay, be very careful when buying on the site and don't believe the money back guarantee because eBay just say you won't be getting one🔴 In my opinion eBay has become a dishonest company that only cares about money and not the customer.",1

When i listed an item, someone was able to buy it from me, but eBay held the money from me until i could furthur prove it was me. This meant showing my ID and putting my bank information in AGAIN. I did all of that but then eBay told me that i was not 18+ so i could not use eBay. Instead of letting me do it then keeping all my money",2

17717,"Absolute trash. Fees have gotten ridiculously higher & they suspended my account without no explanation, and I have done absolutely nothing wrong. I can't even communicate with a real person to understand if I was hacked or what. They just keep answering all my requests to contact them with a generic email telling me that my account is suspended with no exact reason as to why. Save yourself time & sell elsewhere, not worth all the extensive protocol they require now just to sell used goods.",1

This has happened twice with no explanation and won't let you fight it. Just shop on Amazon, theyll let you shop & actually purchase items. Ebay has always been a garbage place and now they're just collecting your info and then banning you so they can sell your info elsewhere. Hopefully they get the TikTok treatment and get banned in the US.",1

17817,"They allow scammers to scam sellers when Its an issue that involves ebay. If I have a problem with a scammer stealing my items forcing me to pay for a return label just for the buyer not to ship back and block me, the corrent answer is NOT just shrug it off. Absolutely scummy way to run a selling site. They always side with the scammer. A buyer can return an item back damaged and ebay will STILL side with them. Why they dont have decent policies in place is absolutely beyond half of us.",1

Maybe only setback is too many notifications popping up - trying to flog you something you recently took a look at. Be good if there was some way this could be turned off. I know you can. Unfortunately though, it seems when doing so, 2 step verification will be lost. Something which is necessary for security and peace of mind.",4

17864,"They will ban you without even saying anything, even if you spent 3 hours going back and forth with the customer service, they will literally not tell you what you did wrong nor the supervisor. The communication within this company was the worst experience I have ever experienced in my life, and I am not overreacting. This was my literal experience. The people on Twitter won't even help neither, so at every moment they could ban you without saying any reason. But the community is awesome. So yea",1
17865,It's always enjoyable searching for bargains. I have never had to return a faulty item yet. I find that sellers on eBay are great at answering any questions and positive feedback means more than it is worth for them to upset anyone with bad service.,5

Keeps alerting me for saved searches that don't have any results, can't delete saved searches, many things can't be done on the app at all and you have to find a desktop, postage setup is unnecessarily complicated, many people no longer leave any feedback for some reason.

17939,It's Good,5
17940,It's a good app for looking for something u are needing,4

17956,Always use Ebay for parts and I always find what I am looking for.,5
17957,Great range of product selection. Vehicle part association feature is nice and works pretty well. They need to work on customer support whenever you have a discrepancy. Very difficult to get a hold of the them and resolution takes too long. Selling costs are pretty high for what they actually do for you. Sold a item for $1735 and they took $235 after they charged $79 forrevision that had no bidders yet and $9.99 to promote traffic that didn't incrrase views. Fraud recovery is very slow becareful,4

18181,All good and easy to use on my phone,5
18182,"As a top rated plus seller, I can no longer recommend selling on their site. I made the choice to close my store subscription and pause selling. THEY CONTINUALLY KEEP CHARGING MY CARD and refuse to stop. Knowing that they do this, I will not be back. My bank said they will deal with it.",1
18183,"eBay works as it should. It's often the best place to find unusual things for sale, it at least get an idea of price. The customer support usually functions very well. I prefer it to Amazon because the sellers are more independent as long as they follow the terms of service.",5
18184,Brilliant,5
18185,App is good,3

18197,Wonderful app... Very easy to navigate!,5
18198,Awesome knives for price!,5
18199,"They do have a lot of older products that people sell but my major issue with people selling these products is that they're ridiculously overcharging prices, especially for DVDs that they are asking for $75 to $100 per DVD that has a very low rating. I don't see how anyone is going to be able to sell their movies at outrageous prices. The only ones I can see buying them are people who want to add them to their collection. eBay is only good for vintage products but most guys don't do refunds. 💸",1
18200,"Easy, intuitive shopping for almost ANYTHING that you can even conceive of! Many excellent merchants that offer free shipping and free returns. And eBay itself stands behind the products sold on this platform. Excellent all-around experience!",5
18201,Very exceptional.,5
18202,Ebay is the best site to order from I've been ordering from ebay many years and is the only site i have never had any problems with,5

18206,"When I go to My Ebay -> Saved -> Searches -> New Results Only, there is a series of rows for each saved search, and before I could easily and conveniently scroll horizontally across the listings within each row and go down all the rows of my saved searches. But I guess since whatever recent update, every time I try to scroll, it swipes across to the tab named the ""Sellers"" tab, and I have to swipe back into the ""Saved"" tab, which is where I was before. This is really inconvenient and frustrating",3
18207,Very user friendly.,5
18208,Sick,5
18209,Always a pleasure,5
18210,Never have had a problem. Only lost80.00 on a purchase of a deflator. Seller never responded.l just gave up. I still like eBay.,5
18211,Great,5
18212,Blocks communication details in messages forcing you to communicate via ebay. Better off just purchasing items directly from the manufacturer.,1
18213,"Great prices, everything I ordered was exactly if not better than I expected I recommend using this app. If you like saving money that is on name brand products",5
18214,I have always had an easy time navigating this app and shopping through it.,5
18215,"I love this app! There are ALWAYS at least a few items of interest in my specific areas of interest. The PRICES best most any popular retail store, and the SERVICE and DELIVERY options them all. eBay is not your average retailer, the suppliers rate second to none with the hiccups in quality of individual retailers virtually non-existent. Communication from initial exchange is at such an abundance of excellence that you'll likely do as I've done - skip the ""BIG NAMES"" & HEAD HERE FIRST! ENJOY!",5
18216,Exelente,5
18217,Very good app,5
18218,Great app for getting a bargain price for the paticular item you're searching for.,5

18226,Good 👍,5
18227,Good stuff,4
18228,This company deserves to be shut down. Irredeemable. Evil to its very core.,1
18229,Great place to find unique pieces to purchase,4
18230,I really do enjoy the app but I hate how it tells me about items that I looked at one time in my notifications,5
18231,The ability to pay via PayPal gives me a sense of confidence while making purchases on ebay. I've been shopping on this site for years and I can usually find a deal,5
18232,The fees are enormous. I am literally being taxed to death by ebay and the US government. Not worth the pain to sell here.,1
18233,Awesome,5
18234,EBAY!!! I ENJOY BIDDING ON STUFF I DON'T NEED. BEATS AMAZON BY A LONG SHOT. LOTS OF DISCOUNTS. ESPECIALLY FOR INSTRUMENTS.,5
18235,Easy payment easy sourcing easy listing quick payment,5
18236,Excellent,5
18237,"I stay away from eBay. There are lots of other sites I use. It's full of scammers. I was almost a victim of a $2500.00 loss. A seller sold me a coin & luckily before I paid I looked at his previous sales & noticed the coin I had just won had been sold over and over again. He had been doing this consistently for over a year. When I complained, nothing was done. Beware!!",1
18238,Bad service,1
18239,Ease to use,5
18240,Haven't had very may problems just don't like usps it to slow.,4
18241,Super easy to use!,5
18242,Able to find and purchase immediately!,5
18243,"EBay has all the stuff I need and LOVE what a BEAUITIFUL application better than wish, better than Ali express, better than cute, what more can I say when I need something I go straight to EBAY FOR ALL MY NEEDS from stereos, to DVD players, to CD players, mixers, wigs,etc. Whatever I need I can buy it and the sellers rushes my items to me real quick, I never have to wait long. THANKS EBAY FOR A WONDERFUL, SPLENDOUS, GREAT, APPLICATION. I JUST LOVE IT.",5
18244,Awesome!,5
18245,"Horrible company. Scammers buy listings for single items, I send a confirmation message before shipping, when they reply that they never read (pretend not to read) & expect full 100 CT packs for single item price they cancel get a refund & then they leave neg/neutral feedback. eBay let's these reviews stand even though Ive done nothing wrong & buyer was refunded. I'm punished for being honest. I bought 3 lots & I'm putting 3 homes there when they sell later this year I'm done with eBay for good.",1
18246,🥹OMG itz eBay😂,5

18252,Nice deals,4
18253,The delivery is always a surprise. Sometimes is good sometimes they put inside of the bin.,3
18254,They will milk you for anything they can if you sell,1
18255,Great,5
18256,"Ebay no longer allows payments through PayPal. If you are selling, you have to give them your bank info, and they hold your money till they can confirm delivery. So ebay takes the payment and immediately takes taxes and their fees then they hold your money in their bank until they can confirm delivery. This could take 4 to 7 days! Imagine all the sales on eBay they could be collecting interest on millions of dollars of other people's money. What a scam.",1
18257,Easy to use,5
18258,Great thing,5
18259,Used eBay for many years and then suddenly they reset password after my account was supposedly hacked. The help then to regain my account has been none existent. Automated replies and links but lacking real people. If I could rate in the minus I would. My advice to anyone who's thinking of joining eBay is don't do it as help in regaining my account is none existent. There are many different apps with better help when you need it so I would make use of them.,1
18260,Nice 👌🏼,5

18302,"Being a seller on eBay has become more difficult and less profitable over the years. Listing fee, plus 12.8% final value fee, plus a ""regulatory operating fee"" of 0.42%, plus the postage (which is included in the percentage calculations)? If you sell something for £88.39 including £3.39 postage, eBay takes a huge £15.38 bite out of it. Rethink buying or selling on here and use other apps because eBay, as a company, has become too greedy!!",1

18363,emails not marked as read anymore and only half shows the email. Please look at other comments on here.if you edit a listing ebay automatically puts your item in for best offer really frustrating. it also puts items on auto relist you get charged for that. i dont trust this app for listing it marks your items for listings that cause charges. you cant untick auto relist unless you are on the mainsite. App to restrictive. Can't see sent emails ??? From myself,1

18440,Last couple updates have made app worse - 'bids and offers' page now inundated with expired offers from sellers so it's really difficult to find your actual bids. Please change whatever you did back. Still has face melting UI bugs. You shouldn't have to scroll the whole way back down the list of results after clicking on one. Even more pointless updates and now randomly deleting tens of drafts I had saved for a day I could photograph every item at once. Abysmal for sellers.,1

I save that money by using eBay in combination with telesim &/or flickpedia and watch whatever I want when I want without any sneaky marketing tactics to worry about ! YOUR WELCOME 🤗",4

18477,I was sold an Amazon echo first generation and when I tried to set it up it wouldn't connect. I had to call Amazon for help getting it set up and I was told to return it because it was reported as stolen. I had no way to ship it back so I lost my money and have a stolen item in my home. I couldn't find a way to tell eBay this either.,1

18592,The best,5
18593,Wide range of items and products on offer. Reliable shipping and competitive prices to boot.,5
18594,Whenever I try to do things on the browser it throws me into the app need to be completely separate.,2
18595,"Considering my love the website version, this app isn't bad. Watchlist is nice, saved searches is good, messages and notifications are nice as well. Item pages aren't bad, but not the greatest. Feels like it takes time to properly find everything on the page at times, but overall it's great for a sized down version. My only gripe, are the search results. Doesn't show all results and gives results that have nothing to do with the searched item I'm looking for. That needs improvement.",4
18596,Rather than just saying that you have updated the app it would be nice to know what you have actually updated. If it is just for performance and security features then why was it's not implemented before.,3

18611,Sold only a few private items around my house selling fees are like paying VAT buyers can make up any story and eBay holds your money on others products not related to the dispute if you sell a second hand item eBay thinks the warranty should be the same as new items Waste loads of time on ridiculous made stories,1

The price was great, but I viewed the seller's other items and something was wrong. The prices were all too good to be true. The store showed 100% rating, from around 150+ sales. They're based in China. The reviews sounded too similar. Something wasn't right. It seems that E-Bay can't protect us customers from fraudsters. Not ok.",1

Then the buyer took what they wanted out of the kit and then asked for a refund which eBay gave back in full! Then eBay wants to charge me $30 to pay to get it back! So don't ever buy or sell anything on eBay!!!",1

18748,"eBay USED to be a good place to do business. Now it's a joke. Too much shill bidding activity for any good people that just want to conduct an honest auction. There's also too much allowance for listing items outside of the stated categories. For example, having children sized fashion items mixed in with the adult listings. Shill bidding is particularly awful. Sellers just need to clean up their act and eBay needs to actually pretend to care.",1
18749,So far so good,5

18817,"The app is user-friendly, but it lacks some crucial features. Not being able to delist or relist multiple items at once is inconvenient for sellers with large inventories. Also, adjusting prices for items with variations isn't possible within the app. Additionally, there's no option to manage multiple accounts seamlessly. It's incredibly beneficial to be able to add and manage multiple accounts within the app & receive notifications for each account individually. Please implement these features",3

18917,"I was about to rate this 5 star but I started to cancel and order and it told me it that it was ""too late to cancel the order"" and told me I had to contact the seller. It means that the seller doesn't have to be actively selling to access their payments; which also means that my money is possibly sitting somewhere and some lazy person is going to take their sweet precious time sending my order. It's poor design and management in one package. Pisses me off.",1

19097,"Ebay is generally good, but they need better ways to deter or punish sellers for not honouring an order/auction.",3

19102,Listing that have more than one item if I have bought from it I am not able to view I hope this issue can be fixed soon.,1
19103,Very 👍,5
19104,I truly wish I could give it 5 STAR I Truly wish I could I use it daily I buy sell alone but when I recently sold something I talked with buyer before the purchase as I always do so buyers aware of item in detail and even after that and c buyer changed mind once he got it wouldn't test it just said he knew wasn't real I've tested everything my grandma was geologist but ebay let them steal back money and waste my time snd lost real buyers dhame on EBAY VERY HURT,2
19105,This is one of the best apps! It provides some better options on every single update!,5
19106,The app is very functional but lacks some tools for search and filter that are a much better experience on the desktop version,4
19107,Good,5
19108,"Want to sell something? Ebay charges for that, then Did you ship the item? Ebay will charge you %15 for that. Was there sales tax? Then Ebay will charge you another %15 for that. Ebays fees are not based off your sale price but the total price of the item, shipping cost and taxes. Enjoy paying tax on your tax ad I certainly won't be anymore. Bought several items, sold one item for about 150 and lost 35 to fees after adding shipping and sales tax. Not worth it.",1
19109,Good thanks pleasure 😊,3
19110,Great to use,4
19111,Its very reliable,4
19112,My account got suspended and I talk to a assistant and they wouldn't tell me what i did to get suspended and they were like you shouldn't make a new account cause it will probably also be suspended and that I shouldn't make one with a new email either I'm so mad because I can't buy anything now and if I could give this app less than one star I would,1

19138,If only i can give a negative star this app deserved it Worst costumer service .. The removed my listing many times even though a certificate of authenticity is included while they approved a lot of fakes items without any proof of authenticity. Worst worst worst app ever. It is the worst. They banned me from buying and listing items. Other seeling platforms are more reliable than ebay,1

19140,Does everything I need it too. Very new user friendly.,5
19141,love ebay buying dolls on ebay teresa,5
19142,Not very happy with eBay lately. Not very good for buyers and a nightmare if you sell items on there.,1
19143,As a seller this is a disgraceful place to sell. Very untrustworthy staff and full of scammers. This has caused nothing but stress and financial loss from the start. Stay well away from this place.,1
19144,"Terrible bate and switch - no vouchers section on ""my ebay"" though they instruct you to go there to find the voucher they promised you to get you to download this trash app.",1

19166,Very good,4
19167,"Search needs improvement. Seems eBay favors returning as many results as possible loosely related to the search criteria over fewer more precise results based on the specific search criteria. Also saved searches do not always return all relevant results. Means one must scroll through irrelevant items, and refresh searches to find missed items.",2
19168,I love this app but is should be a easy process to make a seller account,5

19203,"Better try amazon, the help here is fully automated. So if you get any issues with a fraudulent seller, there is no one that can help you out. I lost 400 dollars on a item sold by a fraudulent seller, saying that i did not return the item, but I have the proof that I did. And suspiciously the adress Romania and arrived in 3 days? I dont know, this app is not safe anymore, better stay with amazon",1

19205,Great place to buy what you want for less,5
19206,"****UPDATE **** This app is now a complete and utter waste of time , half the pages you click on just give you an exclamation mark saying something about Java , customer service if you can call it that , are a waste of time . Why don't they tell us anything ! Why do they keep F-ing about with it ? Just get used to it and they change it . If most people use it to buy or sell stuff why are these 2 options not first in the menu . I've got two different ratings , 1 for 2462 and another for 2603 !!",1

19227,👍,5
19228,Very easy to use for both buying and selling.,5
19229,Not at all interested in helping small sellers build a business they overcharge and will literally steal money from you and lie claiming mistakes incured in shipping and there is no way to dispute with them. Apparently this must be some sort of agreement with the postal service as they will falsify these claims and also ignore any proof showing otherwise. Stay far away from this platform if you are hoping to build anything from scratch.,1
19230,eBay stole from me - suspended my account after id posted a sale. Hasn't sent my payout so effectively they've stolen from me. Avoid eBay use the other much better and fee free options,1
19231,Easy transaction. Good business practices. Congratulations.,5

19235,"autobid is genuinely one of the most user-unfriendly features i've come across. it isn't available on mobile (not that i would use it) but you also aren't told what the max amount the autobid is set to. i have better things to do with my time than fight against bots, which you already have to do everywhere else online. i will not be bidding on anything until this feature is removed.",1

19250,Great prices and good quality.,5
19251,Works good.,5
19252,Very easy to use even for a Dinosaur.,4
19253,Solid ebay experience,5
19254,Fee's of course knock down the score. eBay letting buyers get away with anything with the item not as described button takes away from the score. The fact that eBay allows buyers to leave negative feedback for issues like USPS being late Is lame. Now the fact that eBay charges fees on shipping and in the future eBay wants to make it standard that they are going to show the discounted shipping rate to buyers. eBay wants sellers to offer shipping at discounted rates to sellers but charge fees,2
19255,"I can't find good help with trying to get my money back from sellers that have not shipped my items out, and eBay will not help because it doesn't fit any of the help options that are available to choose from",1

19274,Excellent seller fast shipping..haven't been disappointed as yet ...great work,5
19275,Horrible design. I don't own a car but eBay wants to sell me auto parts!? Developers should hand their apps to someone who has never used them and see first hand how bad their apps are designed.,2
19276,It's been very exceptional and easily manageable,5

19296,"Their ""guaranteed fit"" for cars is an absolute joke, do not trust it. Cost me hundreds to install a ""guaranteed part"" and will cost hundreds more just to replace, reinstall the right part and then just have a wrong/chinese fit headlight sitting around until I dump it. Obviously it takes more than 30 days to do all that so the ""guarantee"" is useless. Filing report with BB.",1

19305,Everything on good time for delivery thanks,4
19306,"Sick of fees and incompetent customers. eBay is fine if you're retired, and it's all you have to do. Other than that, forget it.

19307,No problem at all,5

19322,Month 2 selling with them about 1/4 the auctions have no pay buyers. Then ebay let's you relist for free but then hits you for the full auction charge when I had to take an item down when I had to take some time off even though the item had been up way too long because of no pay buyers that they don't enforce any rules with. 0 out of 5 stars until you set some standards and rules for buyers,1
19323,It's easy to use!,5
19324,EBay is very good place market to shopping for all you need so I love Ebay,5
19325,Been seeing a lot of sellers lately canceling sales and relisting if they don't get the price they were after even without a reserve set. Pretty scammy that this is an allowed practice after someone purchases something,2
19326,Honest,5
19327,Bought awesome things on Ebay,5
19328,Just awesome.,5
19329,"Everything in one place! Watch list, is especially helpful! I know when price is reduced or I want to view similar items. What current bids are being made or if the item sold.

19372,"Ebay is such a scam. They maliciously keep all your old addresses and give them priority to mail to so you never receive your items you pay for, unless you download this app. They have no customer service, so you can just get screwed over and over. So irritating to use and take up space on your phone. Never again. I hate you eBay",1
19373,Ebay isn't ebay anymore . You can't contact costumer service . Now they charge extra for everything. Don't buy here . Go to Amazon or Walmart.,1

19388,"I have sold and used eBay for years! however, so frustratingly I had a return, that I never received back. thus putting me in the negative by quite a bit. and so my count was so restricted by eBay, after being a seller with unlimited selling capabilities for quite some time. but I cannot justify losing out on both my valuable product, and also the money for that item! what's worse is because of the restriction I can't pay for the items even that were in my card that I had won at auction! UNFAIR",1

19433,"I wish I could give them 0 star. Today I installed this app and paid them 55$ for my order. Right now after almost 8 hours I received an email that your account has been permanently suspended just because of activity that we believe was putting the eBay community at risk. I mean what the hell is going on? And the beautiful part is, there is no refund of my payment. I wish I could meet the guy in person who suspended my account and will tell him that now this is the real risk you are facing 🤬🤬",1

19473,"It stores my search so i don't have to type again, I simply open and boom there is what am searching for even something related.",5
19474,"ebay just seems to have people that say it fits your vehicle and doesn't any more. after returns, if they go through will delete this again and not be back. I stopped using a few yrs ago, cause things would only last a few months if not at all.",1
19475,"Unnecessarily confusing. Awful. I dont want it, yet it keeps being foisted on me.",1
19476,Spend far too much on this app. Beware with using PayPal it will add costs to the checkout price which sucks!!!,3
19477,"It's easy to use; the prices are always better than retail; I never need to go into a store, so dealing with crowds are over. With ebay there is no need to worry about less than honest Sellers.",5

19482,good,5
19483,🛑 🛑 🛑 🛑 STOP STOP STOP 😠 😠 😠 😠 😠 DONT SALE ON EBAY Way to many fees and charged both the buyer and seller a shipping fee. So the buyer payed 1095 but after the fees the seller only got 796 and was charged for shipping when the buyer paid to for the shipping. The seller payed more for shipping then the buyer. They take forever to give you your money never again never again,5

19493,"This app has performed perfectly on all of the Samsung phones I have used it on including note 20 ultra, Fold 4 and S23 ultra.

19504,Only ever had one error with ebay..seller lost order. Got payment back.,5
19505,Does everything I would expect and sends timely notifications. One of the few apps on which it's easy to complete all my transactions without needing to go back to my laptop. On my wishlist is the ability to bulk delete stuff I've searched for.,5
19506,Timely delivery.,5
19507,Nice shopping but tax and fee is too expensive,4
19508,Easy to use.,5
19509,"Very easy-to-use, excellent design",5
19510,"Why bother updating if not listening to users??? Ten years ago this App was great, then you broke it, every update since has broken even more. I use dark mode due to failing eyesight but now regardless of device used expanding the description is always blinding me with white backgrounds, use a phone or tablet in landscape mode and now we are forced to not only be blinded by the bright white backgrounds but we now have to pinch and zoom to see the whole description...AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

19525,Don't give your money to eBay unless you get your jollies by having your money stolen.,1
19526,Professional,5
19527,I'm an older gentleman. So I remember when eBay was still a little mom and pop. It's coming a long way and I have always enjoyed the service and never had a problem.,5
19528,eBay's money back guaranteed is a joke. When I filed a claim I was told by eBay that the seller was to contact me with in three days. I was never contacted by the seller. I called back to let every know and I get told that they are requesting my refund and with in 30 minutes I was denied because the seller said it was delivered. Now I'm with out struts and shocks for my car and out 134 dollars and some change because every doesn't stand behind their customer,2
19529,Awful layout on a tablet much better on a computer.,1
19530,"Really enjoy it. They seem to have everything I need, thank you and God Bless.",5
19531,"I would like to know why have you blocked me from buying anything on eBay? I cannot buy anything on eBay anymore, why is this?

19559,So easy,5
19560,"The app sure does make listing something MUCH easier than it ever was before. I've only just started using it again, and I was shocked at just how quickly I was able to list an item! You can take a picture of an item, have the app do a quick search, and it will find it, describe it, and if you didn't have certain adjustments you wanted to make, you could hit a button and list it right there. The AI they have does the description, which is one of the parts I hated the most, and it's really good!",5
19561,Very good deals,5
19562,"Good, although everything looks 4 improvement.",4

19605,Very good. Very very good.,5
19606,Alles super,5

19664,Ordered off eBay for about 15 years now while running a computer repair business with the leadership of one my best friends while living together . We did it from our home at the time and was successful and we ordered a ton of parts and supplies using eBay. So I'm over all pleased with them all though it's declined in the last years because of scammers and the computer service resolving issues where we bought items from sellers and we got non working products so it started not being reliable.,3
19665,I buy a lot of stuff of eBay,5
19666,"Ebay is amazingly awesome!!! Not to mention, very helpful when help is needed, also, Ebay is extraordinary at accommodating me when something is amiss with an order or I just simply wish to return it.

19721,As a buyer there is so much choice. It's easy to use All round great marketplace app,4
19722,"I haven't used ebay for 15+ years and just started recently using it again. Ebay was money hungry back then, but now it's a whole other animal. Fees, on top of other fees, stacked on top of more fees. And if you want anything to actually sell and get views, better promote it, only after, you guessed it, pay MORE FEES, all this on top of the lovely taxation the gov has forced sellers to pay. A time will come when ebay is dethroned and I for one, can't wait. Greedy Lil jerks.",1

Still dont have my product. One of ebay customer service said to contact carrirer which said usps did but ESUS is not a valid tracking for them so I cant find out where my package is. Im moving on to amazon, ebay is no help at all",1

Finally made it better after a lot of years and a prior update you change the description section to a small pop up box? I'm done figuring you guys out. You're strange people. Stop changing things just for fun. Having the whole item page was good. Zooming out bc it defaulted to zoomed in was stupid but that doesn't mean we want slow, small and lack of detail.

19821,Always have what I am looking for.,5
19822,This whole seller platform is absolute garbage. Time to move on to Mercari or Poshmark. eBay just isn't what it used to be. They treat their sellers like garbage.,1
19823,Given that Ebay now has a money back guarantee I've never been scammed and everything arrives as advertised.,5
19824,"Disgusting place to sell. Using this platform for a long time for selling now had some buyers sending back damaged and different items. The customer service dont care. Once you are selling, they dont care. Buyers can send back whatever they want, they wont give a ..... You lose money and lose your items.",1

19837,"This gabage app asked me to write a review for the app while trying to accept on offer, and when I got back to accept the counter offer on an item it had been sold out from under me. Burn in the 7th layer of hell you corporate scum.",1

19841,"Ebay customer service is atrocious. I had someone break an item when they received it, and they wanted me to refund them, ebay are making me refund them even though it was their fault. There is no way to contact eBay because all they have is a robot CS, which may I add, Is useless. They also have crazy hidden fees, I sold something for £45 and ended up with just over £35. Terrible marketplace, do not recommend.",1

19857,Nice and easy to use..Love it..!!!!!!!,5
19858,Cant delete the credit through this app,1
19859,"The app is easy to use and makes bidding/buying pretty easy. My biggest complaints come with how you can (or can't) easily manage things in the app. Adding things to your watch list js easy, but removing them doesn't always work, and becomes an exercise in repetition. The same applies to deleting missed/lost items from your history, some I've deleted 3 or 4 times but next time I open the app they are back. It's rather frustrating",3
19860,"I always find what I am looking for, purchase it at a reasonable price, it arrives quickly, and performs as intended. I am using the app more than ever, a year later. I get all kinds of great things here, and I am completely satisfied. Update April '24: I still feel this way, and haunt more categories of tools, supplies, etc. for which I rely on eBay and this useful app.",5

19868,Everything you would ever need ..,5
19869,"5 minutes left on an auction, I am the high bidder, the whole bids and offers page goes blank and says I'm not bidding on anything. Or on the app if you accept a offer sent to you it makes you pay full price and you have to cancel the order and do it over on a pc. Ebay you are a heartless greedy company that takes advantage of the poor; fix your app! You can afford it!",1
19870,Very good. Will I get a msg on my phone when it is shipped out?,5
19871,Great value,5
19872,It just gets worse first of all mercari Is absolutely free.They have gotten rid of all the cellar fees.It don't cost a dime they don't take a dollar.Ebay a huge entity ten times bigger than them Makes me pay to promote my item and only allows me to promote my item if traffic in my store is consistent So I haven't had much sales lately.Not that much traffic.So I had to take time to work on other things but my stores up there Now they took away that function for Mr here I come mercari,1
19873,Easy to use and options are plenty.,4
19874,I feel that the app is very user friendly,5
19875,"is a great app but the updates are slowly ruining the experience, fir example you can't copy item titles anymore from the listing to search it up on the internet. another issue is the description box is a tiny pop up and was better before, now it's janky and hard to copy stuff from",2
19876,A five star app to buy and sell on.,5
19877,"Works as expected, with no issues over the last year or two.",5

19885,"Easy to use, makes online purchasing more convenient",5
19886,"After I successfully purchased an item on ebay which i cherisded so much, and the seller sent it to ebay but ebay failed to deliver the items to me after one month of waiting and tracking the packed, I finally saw it was delivered to someone else and only for ebay to write to me that they will issue me a refund after I raise a complain. I am think ebay I unfair and am tempted to believe a worker at eBay saw my items and liked it and decided to divert it.",1
19887,Great stuff,5
19888,Bought item. Seller sent wrong item. Asked for a return. Return was approved but wasn't provided a return label. Called eBay and was told it would be sent by seller as per their policy since they sent wrong item. Seller never was and now eBay is saying I won't get a refund because I never sent the item back... Make it make sense....,1
19889,"You can find anything and everything on this app and usually for a cheap price, both brand new and used plus eBay protects most everything if you've got any issues. I'd recommend this app for everybody, however here's a quick tip, look at the fine print to see if whomever your buying the product from does or doesn't have shipping and handling on it happy looking and have a very blessed day. I hope this helps you out!!",5
19890,👍 👌 great,5
19891,"☆☆☆ BEWARE ☆☆☆ I had been selling on ebay for well over 10 years. As a Top Rated Seller...Sold thousands of items. Then this year I sold a Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max - 512GB - Deep Purple (Unlocked) NEW...The buyer lied and said I sent them an empty box.. Ebay told me I had nothing to worry about since I was protected by seller protection and had been an Ebay seller so long with thousands of items sold...WEEKS LATER EBAY SIDED WITH THE BUYER AND SAID I OWED THEM $1,200.00 I WAS STUNNED.",1
19892,Love ❤️ it,5

19905,Value for money good app reviews the comitd and do a good search before baying also check out the person Selling items too,4
19906,They basically broke the app with this update today. Can no longer find drafts for items and then when you try to copy a listing to list an item it says error item can't be found also.,1
19907,Keep getting errors when trying to list something. 'An error occurred' I got the app so I didn't have to use the computer to list something. Super annoying bug. Please fix.,3
19908,I absolutely love eBay,5
19909,"App wants me to call a number and speak to someone and give them my information just to log in. I have my email and strong unique password, plus secure 2FA, not SMS. What is this nonsense I guess they don't want me to install the app.",1

19919,"Absolutely terrible app, my account got restricted twice and Ebay decided to not help me at all, and said I violated much of the guidelines. I've done nothing, I haven't even bought anything. Just go to marketplace or mercari if you don't want to lose your account.",1
19920,"Used to be stable. The last few days it started 'forgetting' my purchase list, showing me half of my items or even things from ages ago. Loads slow... searches create endless loops with the same items showing again and again and again. Look at item and go back to search and poof parameters are gone. Offers list: crashfest. Filters: brand option gone. Watch list: cannot be edited (browser). Ebay please hire developers where there is actual skill not just cost cut.",1
19921,great,5

19931,Amazing service and experience,5
19932,"eBay is allowing grifters to use fake shipping numbers to pretend they ever sent a package. I received a ""delivery confirmation"" within 28 hours of making the order for a dresser. Highly unlikely that these people paid for overnight shipping. Look up ""Aquiline"" if you are curious. eBay allows them to defraud buyers and refuses to give me a refund. I am not spending money with eBay again. I am contacting various advocates to cause them as much heat as possible.",1
19933,Wow,5
19934,"They charge you WAY TO MUCH TO SELL YOUR STUFF. NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO PAY CRAZY SELLING FEES, TO TOP IT OFF, IF YOU DON'T PAY TO PROMOTE YOUR LISTING, AT $2.99 PER LISTING, YOUR ITEMS WILL NOT GET ANY VIEWS! WELL, MAYBE 1 OR 2 IN A MONTH, BUT YOU GET ABSOLUTELY NO WATCHERS! FUNNY HOW AS SOON AS YOU PAY THE ADDITIONAL PROMOTION FEE, BAM, GUESS WHAT? ALL A SUDDEN PEOPLE ARE VIEWING YOUR ITEMS AND WATCHING IT TOO. ITS A RIP OFF. ONLY GOOD IF YOU PRICE YOUR ITEM HIGH AND BUYER PAYS SHIPPING!",1
