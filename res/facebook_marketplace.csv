0,3,Facebook Market Place ReviewI have used Facebook Market Place for mostly getting rid of stuff I do not use anymore and it has been successful so far. Just to say it is not as successful for selling stuff where you get money for it unless it is very cheap. There appears spams on it as well so be mindful of who you deal with. Good luck with your selling n buying!
1,1,"Random market place deletionsHad yard sale ad deleted as not actually selling an item so rewrote the ad listing items, also deleted. Only reason given is doesn't follow commerce policy yet nothing violates their policies. There are pages of similar yard, garage, estate and barn sale ads and I can't find out why mine was deleted. Maddening. Show details"
2,1,Can't post garage sale addTry again and again to post an ad for a garage sale. Just wouldn't let me go it! Pathetic!
3,5,"Exceptional!I placed a trade after careful analysis and forecasted a steady price increase as per market indicators. To my surprise, the trade instantly went south, and all my investment evaporated within moments. Comparing the price and behavior on other broker's platforms, it was clear the fluctuation was uncharacteristic of the normal market trends, pointing towards a possible deliberate manipulation by GLOBAL FX and my account was locked. made research for help and came across a Mustang support team who helped me get back my money and account unlocked. Victims who are interested can contact them via mustangggrc@gmail.com. Once again, thanks Mustang. Show details"
4,1,"Facebook Market Place full of scammersFacebook doesn't care about scammers on their site. Multiple fake accounts claiming to be me and products listed on marketplace by scammer giving out my actual address. Reported numerous times and got family/friends to report for me too but they were not removed as they didn't go against ""Community Standards"" Facebook needs more control and stricter rules as to who can sell on MP. I used to love MP now I'm scared and I fear for the safety of my children."
5,1,"SCAM SCAM WONDERFOLD KIDS WAGON ...2 OR 4 SEAT WITH EXTRAS FOR PARENTS COFFEE CUPSScam scam scam scam "" wonderfold wagon for kids"" scam scam scam

I have been reporting to marketplace via their online system for weeks now on a daily basis but the scammers continue to post ""Wonderfold wagons 2 or 4 seat in multiple colours for children"" daily
The scam is so obvious
Always appears in pm so it appears it is not originating in aust
The seller has always recently joined marketplace in 2024 with no profile
The photos show s... Read more"
6,1,"Facebook the real criminalsSo Facebook are uick to police any comment or advert from user based upon their so called community standards Half the time this is totally wrong which is a joke
However the best is all the adverts for illegal activities they are accepting money for ie counterfeit money drugs fake items
Guess it you pay suddenly things aren't wrong or illegal
Why are they allowed to advertise illegal items for a start
It's hypocrisy at its best
See screenshots below advertising counterfeit notes and fake drivers licenses"
7,1,"Trying to sell an item is impossibleTried to sell some shoes on Facebook marketplace and was told by Facebook admin that the ad wasn’t suitable to be placed on their site no reason given, I have had the same problem before with them.
I don’t know what they expect from a seller but they really get on my nerves, I have never had this problem selling on Gumtree. They make my blood boil.
So be warned if you are trying to sell an item. Show details"
8,2,"Be a whole lot better if it actually searched areaSearch on marketplace do not even come close to searching the selected area. I have a very limited area I can travel, but when selecting within a 5 mile radius, I'll get results from +60 miles away. How can such a huge company have such a horrible search.... wish there was a better choice. Show details"
9,1,"Marketplace and Facebook are a nightmare to deal withTrying to sell a few secondhand athletics items and the posts keep getting removed. These items were bought from stores not online so they aren't fake items. I have great reviews from selling and buying.

I put in a request to review but get completely ignored.

Meanwhile FB keeps letting scammers post items including so many ads from domestic pet breeders selling animals as they say these purebred / ""designer"" crossbred puppies are up for ""adoption"". These people are just money hungry backyard breeders! Show details"
10,1,Ban Facebook marketplace in AustralianI request the Australian Govt. Under the consumer's protection law to ban Facebook marketplace. Nowadays 99% sellers are scammers whos intention is to loot money of genuine buyers or at least make them vulnerable to cyber attacks. Being a cyber sec pro. I know its super easy to identify scamming adv. and their profiles and to block them. There are so many ways to implement but Meta won't take a solid step as they would lose millions of users. Can we please spread the word and start by raising a petition. Thank you. Show details
11,1,Can’t rate bad behaviour by sellersYou can’t review a seller after they have removed an item for sale. Have had a couple of bad experiences with sellers and there is no way to rate the seller once they remove item and even if you purchased the item.
12,1,Facebook Harvey Norman Cheap Laptop ScamFacebook Harvey Norman cheap laptops is a scam that will swindle you out of your money and nothing can be done about it because there is no contact phone number or chat support to contact Facebook Australia and make a formal complaint about Facebook Marketplace and their lack of protection for everyday Australians. Facebook and Gumtree need to be held accountable and their owners need to suffer financial penalties and be sent to prison as a deterence for all these Facebook and Gumtree Scams that swindle the Australian people. The federal government needs to take action immediately
13,1,UnrealisticUnrealistic. People who sell Antiques. On market place. At ridiculous prices. An Antique is only an Antique if it’s not fiddled and kept original not Wattyl Estapol and then. Asking a kings ransom. Or making it as hard as absolutely possible to view the item. Show details
14,1,"Facebook Marketplace the lowest of the low seller platforms !Be warned Facebook Marketplace is full of sponsored paid scam, counterfeit & other illegal items listings!, scammers , time wasters, non-repliers, fake & malicious feedback , lowballers etc. It is the lowest of the low seller & buyer platforms world wide .

Facebook a steaming pile of diabolical excrement. Its what you get when you put a bunch of know it all programmers who aren't accountable to anyone in charge of a global online company.

Good luck if you need help with anything on Facebook ( including Marketplace) because your only support option is the algorithm!"
