0,"review rating: there are a lot of fake people. either they write "" is it available"", or "" i am interested"", BUT then after that they never respond. on a desktop or somewhere else is there a button that they might easily accidentally push? it gets annoying to have so many people inquire about your producr but then they never respond back. hard to say if they are fake people or what. it takes time away from your hands too. 

also is there any way in a phone or iphone to look up a person by their profile name for easier look up?it would be easier for buying too or selling lets say that person not familiar too much with offer up but they asked you to let them know if you have more items of what you sold them to let them know. 

and is there in settings to unblock people? once their blocked is there anyway to look them up of anyway of finding out who you've blocked. because then in the future you find a post they posted to sell but can't offer because we blocked them. yea maybe that one time theh said they were coming but never showed up so we blocked them, but then who knows maybe that person was real and not fake but had an emergency. so now has a post. wish there was a setting to see all the people you have blocked to unblock?",5
1,"Need to make some changes: There needs to be a way to remove more than one saved item at a time on boards, you have to remove them one by one and it forgets the spot you are at and goes to the top automatically. Also stop sending me more picks for you notifications it can confuse you into thinking you have an actual message or change the color from orange to another color keep messaging the same or make it red. Also make a way to remove my phone number I change my number and now I can’t access unless OfferUp sends me a verification even after I log in. I have email and password I would like to remove my number for my privacy I should have a option but once you use a number you have to keep using one. Meanwhile if you never use one you don’t need to use it as a verification. And stop asking me do I love the app it’s annoying you guys don’t even add features or changes but ask me constantly. Also a way to search by ratings and by how long they been on the app because so many scammers are making profiles the same day and are posting ridiculous offers. Also a better way to narrow down what I want to buy example if I’m looking for an iPhone 11 the 11 pro or pro max models show up when I’m looking for a specific item instead of just putting them in a melting pot make it a way I can specify exactly the item I need. Make some changes and the app would be much better it’s a decent app besides things I just named. Love the fact I can look nationwide very good feature.",3
2,"Great app!! Customer service needs work.: Offer up is an excellent app. It’s very easy to use. It’s fun to use! Customer Service however— needs a little work as of December 2017. I had an issue with a paid for feature called “bumps” which put your items above other sellers ads so your items are seen first. It’s a really nice feature. I paid for two but only received one. So I sent an email to the address listed on the app. I didn’t get a reply, so about a week later I sent another email. I still didn’t get a reply. Then by chance while using the app, a question came on screen asking if I liked the app or something on those lines. I explained my situation regarding the issue and how there had been no reply. I asked to please have Customer Service contact me. Within a week or two the issue was fixed. It was frustrating to not find customer service contact info on the app (most apps have this) causing me to have to go search for it here where apps are sold. There’s a “frequently asked questions” area on the app, but no email address or contact form. It was also frustrating not getting a reply. About a week after the issue had been fixed, (they didn’t tell me, I just happened to find out) customer service finally contacted me. At that point I no longer needed help. It would be great if there was a contact form or email address on the app and getting a reply would be good as well. That aside, it’s a great app for buying and selling items. I found it very easy to use!",3
3,"Customer service is down to a automatic replying program even when being sexually assaulted: I had someone pretend to be interested in an item only to try to get me to meet them at a bar when I told them I was married and my husband would meet them for the sale they changed their mind and I asked why they said openly they were trying to get me alone in a dark place and when I said they would be reported they said they would just make another profile. When I notified offer up 3 times and even demanded a supervisor or real person I got the same auto reply even as a reply to my follow up to the auto reply, “we are sorry and can see when this happens as frustrating.  We will open an investigation but you won’t be able to see the results we suggest blocking them”.  So they say they will open an investigation but you won’t know what happens and to block them so you won’t know if they were removed.   I also had a item I was selling that recently jumped in value and had a bunch of people call me derogatory names (not the small ones) when I sold it to the first person to pay. I reported. What did offer up reply?  “We are sorry this can be frustrating we will open a report but you won’t be able to see the results. We suggest blocking them”.   Serious you charge 13% for using the shipping service yet you earn nothing as there seems to not be a single human working there even when they e become the new sexual rapists Craigslist

Btw they ask you to email them. They never reply",2
4,"No contact information for customer support: I almost feel like I should give them one star but I’ve been able to do a couple of successful transactions on offer up hence the two stars. Been trying to send a message to customer support but it keeps directing me to their help page which just has a bunch of topics that are not specific. I don’t know if it’s because the app is poorly made that’s why it doesn’t have an option to send more pictures in the messaging page which forces you to send your phone number to a seller if you want more pictures of an item you are interested in. This is especially problematic and contradictory since offerup discourages members from exchanging phone numbers. But how can one get a more detailed description of an item? Or are we supposed to simply take the seller’s word about the product. I tried reaching customer service to make inquiries but it kept taking me back to the help page which like I said simply covers a bunch of topics and leaves no specific information on how to contact anyone one. The closest I got were links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. Some people like me are not on any of those platforms for personal reasons and I find it puzzling that offer up will rely on social media outlets to communicate about some sensitive matters with its consumers. I hope someone from offer up reads this and looks into the matter or better still contact me. This write up was a last resort to trying and reach out to someone from offer up",2
5,"Updates: Edited review: The messaging is still glitchy with latest update, but is no longer the most annoying thing on the app, so in a sense congratulations I guess?? Since the latest update, the ""Watching"" section has changed to creating boards, I'm assuming to compete with Pinterest, which is completely unnecessary. In consequence, the coding got changed and now I have over 300 ""saves"" I have to delete in the ""Quick Save"" of things I saved over 2 years ago that have since been sold or unlisted. This wouldn't be as annoying if as soon as something was ""unhearted"" it didn't go back to the top of the list, which it now currently does. Whoever did the coding for this section obviously doesn't use it or doesn't care if it's clean with only available items or has an insane amount of downtime on their hands.

Not sure why but a few days after an update it gets glitchy. For example, the last update was 5/9/17 and now I can't share an item. The messaging portion of the app needs help. Maybe start from scratch, I don't know, but it's always glitchy, recent update or not. It doesn't automatically load a new message especially when you're in that thread, you have to go out and go back in the thread. I get the cash register noise and I have to go to the messages page and slide down to refresh messages to get the new ones to come through. Especially annoying when you're trying to coordinate with a buyer/seller.",3
6,"So many advertisements and targeted content.: I’ve used Offerup for a couple years and have been very pleased with the selling aspect, however this last year or so has changed my opinion of the app enough to submit an updated review. I get notifications frequently from Offerup itself urging me to post more items, bump a listing, or update my preferences. It’s very annoying and turning of notifications only stops you from receiving message notifications, these keep coming through. Also you can no longer search for something without it completely ruining your browsing experience. The targeted advertising is atrocious. Search for a refrigerator? After you go back to regular browse there’s a half dozen ads per scroll regarding refrigerators and even when searching by most recent magically people are only selling refrigerators. It’s total trash. The app used to be about helping people sell their items, but they have recently sacrificed user experience for targeted ad’s and freemium services.

**UPDATE**

Now there are phantom notifications telling you someone has messaged you, recommended items, etc and even when you clear them from your notifications, the app icon has a notification badge that does not go away regardless if there is a notification or not. That means you won’t know if a notification is real unless you open the app and see, instead of, you know, giving you a notification when you have a message…",2
7,"Terrible App: Update : this app is trash! Complete trash. Still bots and scammers galore and now they are banning accounts with the vague explanation of community guidelines. Stay away at all cost! I’ve been back on the app no more than 3 days and I’ve been banned. Lol. I wrote and email asking some questions about selling an item and that’s the first response I received back. Maybe I broke guidelines in the email? Who knows? Who cares at this point? Will never use this app again. Would rate -5 stars if I could. 

The app itself it's ok. 1.99 to bump an item is flat out crazy though. What if the item you're selling is $5? Lol. Bumps should be free everyday or every other day. Something reasonable. The purpose is for the consumer to post and sell. If the consumer starts to feel that their items are being drowned out then why not go somewhere else and post? I'm sure they're are a few of these apps out now. I'm no computer person but I get the feeling this app is flooded with spammers/bots. I will receive messages from three different people basically making the same offer to me. None of them respond back when messaged. Not sure how the posting works either. I can scroll down for maybe 2-3 seconds and I see the same items again. At first I thought I was mistaken but it happens everytime I sign on. I don't see my item listed when I scroll either. Overall the app does what it says it does. Hopefully it doesn't turn into another Craigslist. Seems they are on their way though.",1
8,"Data mining app with limited functionality: If you’re looking for a basic app that collects your data, and limited functionality, this is for you. Examples of things that don’t work well: 1) when you want to end a listing, you’re required to say who you sold it to, or that you sold it elsewhere. Sometimes I just don’t want to sell it. Should be an option to not provide them more data. Furthermore you have to separately archive the item - seems like it should be done automatically or have the option to archive more than 1 at a time, as a basic function. 2) when there’s a rude user messaging you, and you report them, it goes into the ether. They can’t tell you how it’s resolved. You’d think they can look into the problem and let you know how they handled the issue. Seems like a basic courtesy. 3) you can’t turn off notifications for their “helpful” suggestions. I want notifications of other users who are messaging me, not “suggested” promotional items from OfferUp. When I escalated this issue, the response was to turn off all my notifications, which turns off notifications from other users too. When I pushed back saying there should be an option to stop those “helpful suggestions” notifications, they kept reiterating that the app isn’t designed that way. Again seems like they do not care about the end user experience and simply want to funnel you into basic pathways so they can collect as much data collection as possible.",1
9,"Not a 5-star app for buyers: If you’re an upper middle class woman who wants to sell things locally but is paranoid that Craigslist is dangerous, that the buyers will either kill you or Trojan-horse your email or social security number somehow, this app was clearly created for you. As a buyer, this app is terrible. The problematic behavior is now on the seller side. You inquire about an item and no one responds. This has happened to me with one item after another, and I’m asking specific details about the items, not using the generic insta-response “Is it still available?” There are items here that have been posted for *years*. Items that were posted in the last day or two where the seller doesn’t respond. Why are sellers ghosting people trying to give them money? In all seriousness, are the items posted fake? There’s no shortage of ads.

The designers of this thing have got to regulate sellers somehow. Time limits on posts that have to be manually renewed. Seller accounts that, if they do not respond or mark their items as sold, are warned and then shut down. Even better, allow shoppers, not just buyers who have completed transactions, to rate sellers.

The app seems to work OK functionally. I understand that to pay the bills they feel they have to place ads and sell your data. But this is a step down, not up from what’s already been available. I will be happy to use other alternatives, including older ones.",2
10,"WORST APP TO SELL ON: I started on OfferUp selling stuff about one month ago. I’ve been shipping out stuff people got my products and to this day I’ve still received absolutely no money from OfferUp. I’ve absolutely been totally disgusted with the fact that I ship out my product,  the people get it it’s delivered I get emails from OfferUp saying it’s delivered and yet I still to this day have not had any money deposited into my account shows no transactions on my account no shipping transactions on my account which is all ridiculous then I get notices sometimes after a package has been delivered and I’ve got an email saying it was delivered but it shows it was canceled for some reason not the buyer and not the seller neither one of us have canceled the transaction but yet it says it was canceled after the person got my product ..I have sent 20-30  messages to customer support and I have gotten none no money no support no nothing worse app ever to sell anything on!! The least you could do offer up is let us know why we’re having an issue like this what needs to be done to get it fixed and how long it’s gonna take to get fixed and when I will get my money you have my customers money you have my money what’s up???? Baker, lisa",5
11,"What would make OfferUP TEN TIMES BETTER.: OfferUP would be ten times better i if everyone was a verified member and there wasn’t allowed any fakes or frauds. Usually my inventory would be flying for sale, but recently it’s been laying going nowhere due to all these fake people mole on here like collectors and whomever else that don’t belong on here, I haven’t made a sale on here because it seems as if someone is telling people not to buy anything, it’s just not the same, I can tell you this, is make this site one hundred percent better if given the opportunity but Opportunity has been taken away like most of our civil rights Americans give away each day. I’m a fighter and a person who stands up for what I believe in, I’m not someone who just takes the easy way out, those people are all the people who were the mistakes coming in. I’m 36 looking for a job, profession I know I can build and help rise, so if any job opportunities are available please let me know, sorry I can’t see my writing for some reason but how fully this finds someone with authority or in charge of hiring or building OfferUP to be a much better site, I’m sure your fully capable of doing it yourself but a little help from the right person(s) would never hurt. God bless and stand up for your rights, don’t ever sell out. Thankyou",5
12,"Worse selling site since upgrade: Was an excellent selling site. It was! No more! They took over Let go and has issues. Then about month ago they tried to upgrade the site. I said tried. For no reason you are logged out of the site even when you’re on the site. You will post something and think it’s available for viewing but you’re the only one who can see the listing. Now I have to post then sign out look up the listing and seeing it is available for viewing. Usually I have to post 3,4,5 times before it shows up for viewing. I change one little word so I can track which one shows up. Couple days ago I found out everything I had posted was wiped out from viewing. Only I could see the listings. I only found out because a returning customer asked where everything went. After reposting several listings I was suddenly logged out again. When I logged back on everything I just posted was gone. Again nothing could be view. Couple hours later listings could be viewed. It was everything that was posted prior to the letgo takeover. Some listings were removed weeks ago they were back. Listings that were sold and removed were back and listed as available. I could write and write for hours about the issues with this site. Furthermore There is no way to contact a human only through email and usually you get a lame apology and no useful information and that takes days for that lousy response. If you have stuff to sell use a different site even if it costs more.",1
13,"Integration: The one thing that should have been at the top of the priority list is giving existing clients access to a support staff! Not done! Reading worthless articles is annoying! Just go ahead and tell me... I will never be able to access my letgo chats again right? This will ruin my legal case! As well as my chances of completing a deal with someone that I have no idea how to contact any longer! Both apps were very good for their purposes! Quite similar too! Why you think it is more important to explain how to list or buy on OfferUp, is a mystery! Frankly, anyone who has done anything on one, will have no difficulty doing so on the other! With the lack of proactive intelligence used and important details left out, I have to say that this merger might go down as the absolute worst integration of two companies/services/information in history! The simple fact that the items about which you chose to educate everyone, are completely mundane and self explanatory, really sheds light on how low budget the operation will be from here on out! This idiocy has really screwed me up! I guess I’m done! The only positive is, I now only have to delete my account from only one place! I can’t help but picture your boardrooms filled with children with crayons, attempting to coordinate and plan out this merger! I’ll stop drilling home the obvious now. You guys have got to be quite embarrassed already!  For the 5-10 people who haven’t used either. You’ll enjoy the app!",2
14,"This app has gone to crap!: Update: I didn’t think the app could get worse but it has. This time directly attributed to the app management team rather than the users like i stated in my original post. They decided to add add to the app. I mean the worst kind of ads. The app already had tons of ads in your messages, at the bottom of the search, a bunch of fake ad listings that took you to the internet, but for whatever reason, they now added ads double ads that pop up on your screen after viewing an item. You close one and then you have to wait on an other ads timer before you can return to your search query, I am deleting this app definitively this time. 

Original: 

When it launched and up until 3 maybe 4 years ago it was flawless, it was mostly if not all user to user selling. I’m not sure when but OfferUp has now been riddled with stores flooding the listings with thousands of their inventory so whenever you search something now, you go through pages and pages of stores inventory’s selling at premiums offering fake credit that ach draws from your account weekly bi weekly or even monthly, the catch? Paying monthly you pay double the price, weekly 1.3 and bi weekly 1.6 the price. I’ve never done it but I spoke to a few of them about their financing options. So if you are trying to get an item at a budget price from another seller, it will take about 10 to 20 times longer just scouring the pages of filth from these stores",1
15,"It was a good app…: This app is the best by far to buy and sell. When I first got this app, it was just you chatting with actual owners of used items. However, the feed is now flooded with stores selling their products on the app. That’s not a bad thing of course, but if you’re like me seeking for actual owners willing to sell a particular item cheaper than these businesses, searching and finding such item becomes very difficult because all you see are stores selling the same item because they upload so much of that same item. It would be great if I can toggle between seeing items by businesses or individuals or both. Update: This problem still persists and is even worse. Went to search for an iPhone model and all I could see were almost same pictures on almost every post from the same user handful of users. These businesses spam the results to where it’s difficult to find others. It’s very aggravating. At least they shouldn’t be allowed to upload so many of the same item - it’s spamming. My suggest like before, there should be some form of identifier which shows that a user is business with an actual brick and mortar store. And there should be a way to toggle between the results from these stores or regular people or both. They’ve been a lot of other changes that have been made that not beneficial to us as users. However, this is all I care about the most",2
16,"Better than C***gslist, but the algorithm is aggressive: At its core function of buying of and selling used things, the app is great.  Since communication goes through the app there seem to be more user vetting so less creeps and sketchy communication than on CL. I haven’t used the pay-through-the-app function, but that seems like a nice feature if you’re worried about getting scammed, especially if you’re getting your purchase shipped to you rather than in person. 

However, the algorithm that this app uses to create your home “feed” is obnoxiously aggressive. Click on a random thing out of curiosity or mild interest and then 85% of your feed becomes that exact (or extremely similar) thing.  There is also a frustrating amount of the tiles/listings that are paid ads or take you to an outside website. I get they have to pay their bills somehow, but it’s too much. Fortunately they are relatively easy to spot. 

The most annoying thing though is the notifications: similar to the aggressive algorithm, I’m still getting notifications in my inbox for “___ related items for you!” for stuff I searched for 6 months ago and am no longer interested in. (I already bought my kid a baseball glove 3 months ago, Thanks). And there seems to be no way to edit or delete your search related notifications. Seems like an easy fix, Offer Up!",3
17,"Worst app for selling: I sold an item through this app with no problems. But when I tried to sell my tv (just a regular old boring tv) they removed my post for violating “intangible items” policies. I read all of the articles on their policies and guidelines, and found absolutely nothing that I could have violated. I also couldn’t find any specific information about what is considered a violation or why my listing was specifically removed. 

I reposted it so many times with different (improved) pictures, slightly different description, etc. I’m a very thorough person with attention to detail so I did ensure that I met all guidelines, used good photos, included adequate descriptions, etc. And I was selling a tangible item that would be picked up immediately upon purchase. At one point, I had multiple people willing to buy the tv and then they took down the listing and all the conversations. So I simply can’t sell this item at all with no explanation and no way to contact customer service. Super frustrating. I’m deleting the app because of this. It’s simply not worth it when your posts are just deleted for no reason at any point in time. 

Sellers beware: if you use this app, save all your listings in your notes app and contact your buyers immediately on some other platform (like discord) because if your listing is removed, there is literally no way to contact your buyers again. Or just be smart and use an actually functional buying/selling app.",1
18,"One more try: I’m going to rate 3 stars cause I haven’t used it yet, I hope they improve it,cause last time it was real bad ,I been using this app for the longest, I use to post an item for sale and sell it in couple of days top, as the years pass the selling was getting harder , since they split it , the pay subscription gets more attention  than the free one,the years I study this app, as the years pass the free app die basically you get kick  to the corner, I check my views everyday in hot items and views were the same for a month that’s when I decide to build my own , and yes super successfull, but I like to post my products in a lot of places  them hold on I sold something omg! Just came in ,well that was a great start , and I really think the app improves in a lot of ways, I’m not saying this because the sale , I been messing around w it and posting got super fast, it got more relax , before I used to stress everytime  I was posting cause it was taking for ever,so far it’s good plus a sale while I’m writing the posting  ? You can see improvement already so let’s sell so items ! Now let’s c the charges that’s another thing I’m worried about but I keep y’all  posted I will update this review thank u but I recommend it , it has improved technically and costumer care are on point we been communicating and they respond real quick",3
19,"I loved the app but…: I loved this app and appreciated how the developers has created this app. There’s so much interesting and exciting stuffs to buy for good deals. However my experience with the sellers is otherwise unpleasant. There’s many experiences that I find it unappreciative and I understand there is a lot of odd people out there to work with. For example, I saw the new item and made an offer, the seller did respond but with very strange and ominous message which I immediately find it to be suspicious. I told that seller I decided to not proceed ahead with the deal due to uncomfortable of that message. I was blunt about this to the seller then that person sent me horrendous messages. I ignored that person the right away. 

Also when I made an offer, the sellers are obliged to let users know about their offers already sold or take down the posts. I’m sick and tired of seeing so many similar vehicles sellers posted even after they claimed they sold it. I told this girl in Worcester after she posted white Impala on offer up after she told me she has already sold it then few weeks later, posted the exact same car. I made an offer with suspicious and she claimed it’s sold ‘again’. I told her about the same thing weeks before, she said she never do such a thing like that. 

This is the problem. The “sellers” like her should be banned from offer up for gaming around with the users. It’s not cool. I will change the rating when it’s being improved.",1
