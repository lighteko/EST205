0,"review rating: there are a lot of fake people. either they write "" is it available"", or "" i am interested"", BUT then after that they never respond. on a desktop or somewhere else is there a button that they might easily accidentally push? it gets annoying to have so many people inquire about your producr but then they never respond back. hard to say if they are fake people or what. it takes time away from your hands too. 

also is there any way in a phone or iphone to look up a person by their profile name for easier look up?it would be easier for buying too or selling lets say that person not familiar too much with offer up but they asked you to let them know if you have more items of what you sold them to let them know. 

and is there in settings to unblock people? once their blocked is there anyway to look them up of anyway of finding out who you've blocked. because then in the future you find a post they posted to sell but can't offer because we blocked them. yea maybe that one time theh said they were coming but never showed up so we blocked them, but then who knows maybe that person was real and not fake but had an emergency. so now has a post. wish there was a setting to see all the people you have blocked to unblock?",5
1,"Need to make some changes: There needs to be a way to remove more than one saved item at a time on boards, you have to remove them one by one and it forgets the spot you are at and goes to the top automatically. Also stop sending me more picks for you notifications it can confuse you into thinking you have an actual message or change the color from orange to another color keep messaging the same or make it red. Also make a way to remove my phone number I change my number and now I can’t access unless OfferUp sends me a verification even after I log in. I have email and password I would like to remove my number for my privacy I should have a option but once you use a number you have to keep using one. Meanwhile if you never use one you don’t need to use it as a verification. And stop asking me do I love the app it’s annoying you guys don’t even add features or changes but ask me constantly. Also a way to search by ratings and by how long they been on the app because so many scammers are making profiles the same day and are posting ridiculous offers. Also a better way to narrow down what I want to buy example if I’m looking for an iPhone 11 the 11 pro or pro max models show up when I’m looking for a specific item instead of just putting them in a melting pot make it a way I can specify exactly the item I need. Make some changes and the app would be much better it’s a decent app besides things I just named. Love the fact I can look nationwide very good feature.",3
2,"Great app!! Customer service needs work.: Offer up is an excellent app. It’s very easy to use. It’s fun to use! Customer Service however— needs a little work as of December 2017. I had an issue with a paid for feature called “bumps” which put your items above other sellers ads so your items are seen first. It’s a really nice feature. I paid for two but only received one. So I sent an email to the address listed on the app. I didn’t get a reply, so about a week later I sent another email. I still didn’t get a reply. Then by chance while using the app, a question came on screen asking if I liked the app or something on those lines. I explained my situation regarding the issue and how there had been no reply. I asked to please have Customer Service contact me. Within a week or two the issue was fixed. It was frustrating to not find customer service contact info on the app (most apps have this) causing me to have to go search for it here where apps are sold. There’s a “frequently asked questions” area on the app, but no email address or contact form. It was also frustrating not getting a reply. About a week after the issue had been fixed, (they didn’t tell me, I just happened to find out) customer service finally contacted me. At that point I no longer needed help. It would be great if there was a contact form or email address on the app and getting a reply would be good as well. That aside, it’s a great app for buying and selling items. I found it very easy to use!",3
3,"Customer service is down to a automatic replying program even when being sexually assaulted: I had someone pretend to be interested in an item only to try to get me to meet them at a bar when I told them I was married and my husband would meet them for the sale they changed their mind and I asked why they said openly they were trying to get me alone in a dark place and when I said they would be reported they said they would just make another profile. When I notified offer up 3 times and even demanded a supervisor or real person I got the same auto reply even as a reply to my follow up to the auto reply, “we are sorry and can see when this happens as frustrating.  We will open an investigation but you won’t be able to see the results we suggest blocking them”.  So they say they will open an investigation but you won’t know what happens and to block them so you won’t know if they were removed.   I also had a item I was selling that recently jumped in value and had a bunch of people call me derogatory names (not the small ones) when I sold it to the first person to pay. I reported. What did offer up reply?  “We are sorry this can be frustrating we will open a report but you won’t be able to see the results. We suggest blocking them”.   Serious you charge 13% for using the shipping service yet you earn nothing as there seems to not be a single human working there even when they e become the new sexual rapists Craigslist

Btw they ask you to email them. They never reply",2
4,"No contact information for customer support: I almost feel like I should give them one star but I’ve been able to do a couple of successful transactions on offer up hence the two stars. Been trying to send a message to customer support but it keeps directing me to their help page which just has a bunch of topics that are not specific. I don’t know if it’s because the app is poorly made that’s why it doesn’t have an option to send more pictures in the messaging page which forces you to send your phone number to a seller if you want more pictures of an item you are interested in. This is especially problematic and contradictory since offerup discourages members from exchanging phone numbers. But how can one get a more detailed description of an item? Or are we supposed to simply take the seller’s word about the product. I tried reaching customer service to make inquiries but it kept taking me back to the help page which like I said simply covers a bunch of topics and leaves no specific information on how to contact anyone one. The closest I got were links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. Some people like me are not on any of those platforms for personal reasons and I find it puzzling that offer up will rely on social media outlets to communicate about some sensitive matters with its consumers. I hope someone from offer up reads this and looks into the matter or better still contact me. This write up was a last resort to trying and reach out to someone from offer up",2
5,"Updates: Edited review: The messaging is still glitchy with latest update, but is no longer the most annoying thing on the app, so in a sense congratulations I guess?? Since the latest update, the ""Watching"" section has changed to creating boards, I'm assuming to compete with Pinterest, which is completely unnecessary. In consequence, the coding got changed and now I have over 300 ""saves"" I have to delete in the ""Quick Save"" of things I saved over 2 years ago that have since been sold or unlisted. This wouldn't be as annoying if as soon as something was ""unhearted"" it didn't go back to the top of the list, which it now currently does. Whoever did the coding for this section obviously doesn't use it or doesn't care if it's clean with only available items or has an insane amount of downtime on their hands.

Not sure why but a few days after an update it gets glitchy. For example, the last update was 5/9/17 and now I can't share an item. The messaging portion of the app needs help. Maybe start from scratch, I don't know, but it's always glitchy, recent update or not. It doesn't automatically load a new message especially when you're in that thread, you have to go out and go back in the thread. I get the cash register noise and I have to go to the messages page and slide down to refresh messages to get the new ones to come through. Especially annoying when you're trying to coordinate with a buyer/seller.",3
6,"So many advertisements and targeted content.: I’ve used Offerup for a couple years and have been very pleased with the selling aspect, however this last year or so has changed my opinion of the app enough to submit an updated review. I get notifications frequently from Offerup itself urging me to post more items, bump a listing, or update my preferences. It’s very annoying and turning of notifications only stops you from receiving message notifications, these keep coming through. Also you can no longer search for something without it completely ruining your browsing experience. The targeted advertising is atrocious. Search for a refrigerator? After you go back to regular browse there’s a half dozen ads per scroll regarding refrigerators and even when searching by most recent magically people are only selling refrigerators. It’s total trash. The app used to be about helping people sell their items, but they have recently sacrificed user experience for targeted ad’s and freemium services.

**UPDATE**

Now there are phantom notifications telling you someone has messaged you, recommended items, etc and even when you clear them from your notifications, the app icon has a notification badge that does not go away regardless if there is a notification or not. That means you won’t know if a notification is real unless you open the app and see, instead of, you know, giving you a notification when you have a message…",2
7,"Terrible App: Update : this app is trash! Complete trash. Still bots and scammers galore and now they are banning accounts with the vague explanation of community guidelines. Stay away at all cost! I’ve been back on the app no more than 3 days and I’ve been banned. Lol. I wrote and email asking some questions about selling an item and that’s the first response I received back. Maybe I broke guidelines in the email? Who knows? Who cares at this point? Will never use this app again. Would rate -5 stars if I could. 

The app itself it's ok. 1.99 to bump an item is flat out crazy though. What if the item you're selling is $5? Lol. Bumps should be free everyday or every other day. Something reasonable. The purpose is for the consumer to post and sell. If the consumer starts to feel that their items are being drowned out then why not go somewhere else and post? I'm sure they're are a few of these apps out now. I'm no computer person but I get the feeling this app is flooded with spammers/bots. I will receive messages from three different people basically making the same offer to me. None of them respond back when messaged. Not sure how the posting works either. I can scroll down for maybe 2-3 seconds and I see the same items again. At first I thought I was mistaken but it happens everytime I sign on. I don't see my item listed when I scroll either. Overall the app does what it says it does. Hopefully it doesn't turn into another Craigslist. Seems they are on their way though.",1
8,"Data mining app with limited functionality: If you’re looking for a basic app that collects your data, and limited functionality, this is for you. Examples of things that don’t work well: 1) when you want to end a listing, you’re required to say who you sold it to, or that you sold it elsewhere. Sometimes I just don’t want to sell it. Should be an option to not provide them more data. Furthermore you have to separately archive the item - seems like it should be done automatically or have the option to archive more than 1 at a time, as a basic function. 2) when there’s a rude user messaging you, and you report them, it goes into the ether. They can’t tell you how it’s resolved. You’d think they can look into the problem and let you know how they handled the issue. Seems like a basic courtesy. 3) you can’t turn off notifications for their “helpful” suggestions. I want notifications of other users who are messaging me, not “suggested” promotional items from OfferUp. When I escalated this issue, the response was to turn off all my notifications, which turns off notifications from other users too. When I pushed back saying there should be an option to stop those “helpful suggestions” notifications, they kept reiterating that the app isn’t designed that way. Again seems like they do not care about the end user experience and simply want to funnel you into basic pathways so they can collect as much data collection as possible.",1
9,"Not a 5-star app for buyers: If you’re an upper middle class woman who wants to sell things locally but is paranoid that Craigslist is dangerous, that the buyers will either kill you or Trojan-horse your email or social security number somehow, this app was clearly created for you. As a buyer, this app is terrible. The problematic behavior is now on the seller side. You inquire about an item and no one responds. This has happened to me with one item after another, and I’m asking specific details about the items, not using the generic insta-response “Is it still available?” There are items here that have been posted for *years*. Items that were posted in the last day or two where the seller doesn’t respond. Why are sellers ghosting people trying to give them money? In all seriousness, are the items posted fake? There’s no shortage of ads.

The designers of this thing have got to regulate sellers somehow. Time limits on posts that have to be manually renewed. Seller accounts that, if they do not respond or mark their items as sold, are warned and then shut down. Even better, allow shoppers, not just buyers who have completed transactions, to rate sellers.

The app seems to work OK functionally. I understand that to pay the bills they feel they have to place ads and sell your data. But this is a step down, not up from what’s already been available. I will be happy to use other alternatives, including older ones.",2
10,"WORST APP TO SELL ON: I started on OfferUp selling stuff about one month ago. I’ve been shipping out stuff people got my products and to this day I’ve still received absolutely no money from OfferUp. I’ve absolutely been totally disgusted with the fact that I ship out my product,  the people get it it’s delivered I get emails from OfferUp saying it’s delivered and yet I still to this day have not had any money deposited into my account shows no transactions on my account no shipping transactions on my account which is all ridiculous then I get notices sometimes after a package has been delivered and I’ve got an email saying it was delivered but it shows it was canceled for some reason not the buyer and not the seller neither one of us have canceled the transaction but yet it says it was canceled after the person got my product ..I have sent 20-30  messages to customer support and I have gotten none no money no support no nothing worse app ever to sell anything on!! The least you could do offer up is let us know why we’re having an issue like this what needs to be done to get it fixed and how long it’s gonna take to get fixed and when I will get my money you have my customers money you have my money what’s up???? Baker, lisa",5
11,"What would make OfferUP TEN TIMES BETTER.: OfferUP would be ten times better i if everyone was a verified member and there wasn’t allowed any fakes or frauds. Usually my inventory would be flying for sale, but recently it’s been laying going nowhere due to all these fake people mole on here like collectors and whomever else that don’t belong on here, I haven’t made a sale on here because it seems as if someone is telling people not to buy anything, it’s just not the same, I can tell you this, is make this site one hundred percent better if given the opportunity but Opportunity has been taken away like most of our civil rights Americans give away each day. I’m a fighter and a person who stands up for what I believe in, I’m not someone who just takes the easy way out, those people are all the people who were the mistakes coming in. I’m 36 looking for a job, profession I know I can build and help rise, so if any job opportunities are available please let me know, sorry I can’t see my writing for some reason but how fully this finds someone with authority or in charge of hiring or building OfferUP to be a much better site, I’m sure your fully capable of doing it yourself but a little help from the right person(s) would never hurt. God bless and stand up for your rights, don’t ever sell out. Thankyou",5
12,"Worse selling site since upgrade: Was an excellent selling site. It was! No more! They took over Let go and has issues. Then about month ago they tried to upgrade the site. I said tried. For no reason you are logged out of the site even when you’re on the site. You will post something and think it’s available for viewing but you’re the only one who can see the listing. Now I have to post then sign out look up the listing and seeing it is available for viewing. Usually I have to post 3,4,5 times before it shows up for viewing. I change one little word so I can track which one shows up. Couple days ago I found out everything I had posted was wiped out from viewing. Only I could see the listings. I only found out because a returning customer asked where everything went. After reposting several listings I was suddenly logged out again. When I logged back on everything I just posted was gone. Again nothing could be view. Couple hours later listings could be viewed. It was everything that was posted prior to the letgo takeover. Some listings were removed weeks ago they were back. Listings that were sold and removed were back and listed as available. I could write and write for hours about the issues with this site. Furthermore There is no way to contact a human only through email and usually you get a lame apology and no useful information and that takes days for that lousy response. If you have stuff to sell use a different site even if it costs more.",1
13,"Integration: The one thing that should have been at the top of the priority list is giving existing clients access to a support staff! Not done! Reading worthless articles is annoying! Just go ahead and tell me... I will never be able to access my letgo chats again right? This will ruin my legal case! As well as my chances of completing a deal with someone that I have no idea how to contact any longer! Both apps were very good for their purposes! Quite similar too! Why you think it is more important to explain how to list or buy on OfferUp, is a mystery! Frankly, anyone who has done anything on one, will have no difficulty doing so on the other! With the lack of proactive intelligence used and important details left out, I have to say that this merger might go down as the absolute worst integration of two companies/services/information in history! The simple fact that the items about which you chose to educate everyone, are completely mundane and self explanatory, really sheds light on how low budget the operation will be from here on out! This idiocy has really screwed me up! I guess I’m done! The only positive is, I now only have to delete my account from only one place! I can’t help but picture your boardrooms filled with children with crayons, attempting to coordinate and plan out this merger! I’ll stop drilling home the obvious now. You guys have got to be quite embarrassed already!  For the 5-10 people who haven’t used either. You’ll enjoy the app!",2
14,"This app has gone to crap!: Update: I didn’t think the app could get worse but it has. This time directly attributed to the app management team rather than the users like i stated in my original post. They decided to add add to the app. I mean the worst kind of ads. The app already had tons of ads in your messages, at the bottom of the search, a bunch of fake ad listings that took you to the internet, but for whatever reason, they now added ads double ads that pop up on your screen after viewing an item. You close one and then you have to wait on an other ads timer before you can return to your search query, I am deleting this app definitively this time. 

Original: 

When it launched and up until 3 maybe 4 years ago it was flawless, it was mostly if not all user to user selling. I’m not sure when but OfferUp has now been riddled with stores flooding the listings with thousands of their inventory so whenever you search something now, you go through pages and pages of stores inventory’s selling at premiums offering fake credit that ach draws from your account weekly bi weekly or even monthly, the catch? Paying monthly you pay double the price, weekly 1.3 and bi weekly 1.6 the price. I’ve never done it but I spoke to a few of them about their financing options. So if you are trying to get an item at a budget price from another seller, it will take about 10 to 20 times longer just scouring the pages of filth from these stores",1
15,"It was a good app…: This app is the best by far to buy and sell. When I first got this app, it was just you chatting with actual owners of used items. However, the feed is now flooded with stores selling their products on the app. That’s not a bad thing of course, but if you’re like me seeking for actual owners willing to sell a particular item cheaper than these businesses, searching and finding such item becomes very difficult because all you see are stores selling the same item because they upload so much of that same item. It would be great if I can toggle between seeing items by businesses or individuals or both. Update: This problem still persists and is even worse. Went to search for an iPhone model and all I could see were almost same pictures on almost every post from the same user handful of users. These businesses spam the results to where it’s difficult to find others. It’s very aggravating. At least they shouldn’t be allowed to upload so many of the same item - it’s spamming. My suggest like before, there should be some form of identifier which shows that a user is business with an actual brick and mortar store. And there should be a way to toggle between the results from these stores or regular people or both. They’ve been a lot of other changes that have been made that not beneficial to us as users. However, this is all I care about the most",2
16,"Better than C***gslist, but the algorithm is aggressive: At its core function of buying of and selling used things, the app is great.  Since communication goes through the app there seem to be more user vetting so less creeps and sketchy communication than on CL. I haven’t used the pay-through-the-app function, but that seems like a nice feature if you’re worried about getting scammed, especially if you’re getting your purchase shipped to you rather than in person. 

However, the algorithm that this app uses to create your home “feed” is obnoxiously aggressive. Click on a random thing out of curiosity or mild interest and then 85% of your feed becomes that exact (or extremely similar) thing.  There is also a frustrating amount of the tiles/listings that are paid ads or take you to an outside website. I get they have to pay their bills somehow, but it’s too much. Fortunately they are relatively easy to spot. 

The most annoying thing though is the notifications: similar to the aggressive algorithm, I’m still getting notifications in my inbox for “___ related items for you!” for stuff I searched for 6 months ago and am no longer interested in. (I already bought my kid a baseball glove 3 months ago, Thanks). And there seems to be no way to edit or delete your search related notifications. Seems like an easy fix, Offer Up!",3
17,"Worst app for selling: I sold an item through this app with no problems. But when I tried to sell my tv (just a regular old boring tv) they removed my post for violating “intangible items” policies. I read all of the articles on their policies and guidelines, and found absolutely nothing that I could have violated. I also couldn’t find any specific information about what is considered a violation or why my listing was specifically removed. 

I reposted it so many times with different (improved) pictures, slightly different description, etc. I’m a very thorough person with attention to detail so I did ensure that I met all guidelines, used good photos, included adequate descriptions, etc. And I was selling a tangible item that would be picked up immediately upon purchase. At one point, I had multiple people willing to buy the tv and then they took down the listing and all the conversations. So I simply can’t sell this item at all with no explanation and no way to contact customer service. Super frustrating. I’m deleting the app because of this. It’s simply not worth it when your posts are just deleted for no reason at any point in time. 

Sellers beware: if you use this app, save all your listings in your notes app and contact your buyers immediately on some other platform (like discord) because if your listing is removed, there is literally no way to contact your buyers again. Or just be smart and use an actually functional buying/selling app.",1
18,"One more try: I’m going to rate 3 stars cause I haven’t used it yet, I hope they improve it,cause last time it was real bad ,I been using this app for the longest, I use to post an item for sale and sell it in couple of days top, as the years pass the selling was getting harder , since they split it , the pay subscription gets more attention  than the free one,the years I study this app, as the years pass the free app die basically you get kick  to the corner, I check my views everyday in hot items and views were the same for a month that’s when I decide to build my own , and yes super successfull, but I like to post my products in a lot of places  them hold on I sold something omg! Just came in ,well that was a great start , and I really think the app improves in a lot of ways, I’m not saying this because the sale , I been messing around w it and posting got super fast, it got more relax , before I used to stress everytime  I was posting cause it was taking for ever,so far it’s good plus a sale while I’m writing the posting  ? You can see improvement already so let’s sell so items ! Now let’s c the charges that’s another thing I’m worried about but I keep y’all  posted I will update this review thank u but I recommend it , it has improved technically and costumer care are on point we been communicating and they respond real quick",3
19,"I loved the app but…: I loved this app and appreciated how the developers has created this app. There’s so much interesting and exciting stuffs to buy for good deals. However my experience with the sellers is otherwise unpleasant. There’s many experiences that I find it unappreciative and I understand there is a lot of odd people out there to work with. For example, I saw the new item and made an offer, the seller did respond but with very strange and ominous message which I immediately find it to be suspicious. I told that seller I decided to not proceed ahead with the deal due to uncomfortable of that message. I was blunt about this to the seller then that person sent me horrendous messages. I ignored that person the right away. 

Also when I made an offer, the sellers are obliged to let users know about their offers already sold or take down the posts. I’m sick and tired of seeing so many similar vehicles sellers posted even after they claimed they sold it. I told this girl in Worcester after she posted white Impala on offer up after she told me she has already sold it then few weeks later, posted the exact same car. I made an offer with suspicious and she claimed it’s sold ‘again’. I told her about the same thing weeks before, she said she never do such a thing like that. 

This is the problem. The “sellers” like her should be banned from offer up for gaming around with the users. It’s not cool. I will change the rating when it’s being improved.",1
20,"Great Resource: I have only been on the site for about a month and already I have made some good contacts. I have purchased the sleeper live seat of my dreams here and have received excellent advice about my flea problem with my cats. I also enjoy many of the discussions about current topics is interest such as the gun legislation in the Congress now, the school shootings and more local problems such as crime and ineffective police response. I felt isolated here in West Broward after moving from the ocean coast, but I have felt more connected by visiting this site often. I have recommended it to several friends in various areas here in South Florida and a few have joined. I think anyone who wants to feel more connected to their neighbors will enjoy the site. The only complaint I have is the annoying number of ads for services. One post is enough to gauge interest but we see multiple posts in one day. In a week it gets more than annoying. Sometimes I even close the site because I get sick of seeing these ads. I hope the people responsible for monitoring NextDoor will take measure to control the number of repeated posts by service providers. There is no doubt that they will lose some users if they do not.",5
21,"Let Go of Let-Go: Sure, I’ll rate the app, since your automated system asked. 
Frankly it pretty well is 1/2 as good as it used to be. Since merging w let go it obviously observed a bunch of undesirable “let go” traits. 
The biggest one that irritates me is the way the posts are displayed in the feed. The old OfferUp search and layout was pleasing to the eye and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Even worse now the app changes the pictures for the listings by cropping the images so you can’t even make out exactly what is being posted for sale. AND to make this issue a problem even further is that once you click on a listing to see what it is the image is cropped even more. What good does it do to take clear close-up images for our listings if the app is going to pear the image down so buyers won’t even click on our listings cause they can’t tell what the product even is. I have screen shots I’m willing to show and discuss further if anyone were to care and contact me regarding this issue which will surely eventually drive users away if a decline hasn’t already been noticed. We’ll, or rather you’ll see I guess. 
The other gripe I have is of how painstaking it is to edit our favorites lists/boards. Can you please make that way less annoying. 
I have enjoyed OfferUp for years, I would like to keep enjoying using it. Please revert back to your old ways and let go of all things Let Go.",2
22,"OfferUp Inc. BAD BUSINESS: ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PLANET ✔️ The actual platform for buying / selling is ok but Facebook Marketplace is way more active and useful. I had been using OfferUp for multiple years and had 30+ five star reviews on my profile until they disabled my account for an “unknown violation.” I sent multiple emails (since they don’t offer any live phone support) asking for help and clarification to which I only received the same automated response or even no response at all. Honestly, if they’re deleting good high quality active sellers like me who have nothing but 100% positive feedback ratings on pretty much every selling platform available than it’s only a matter of time before they’re completely irrelevant. Besides, there app is completely inundated with forced viewing ads now which is extremely annoying and distasteful. If you want to use it, be my guest but having been selling semi-professionally for 10+ years, there are a lot of better options available. The app will work ok until you have a problem (and you will have a problem eventually) then they’ll ghost you because they haven’t invested any of that revenue from all the ads they’re forcing you to watch into providing quality customer service which shouldn’t always come first from any type of business. Lastly, this is the first review I’ve ever taken the time to write, that’s how bad of a business OfferUp Inc. is… Not Trustworthy",1
23,"My location also Scammers: I live in a rural area and the location it shows is not correct. The main reason I wrote this review is because since I'm in a rural area and all there happens to show on my feed for this so called ""selling"" app is fake people who don't even live around my area. They also decided to put their fake phone number on the selling item and want you to message them on that. I was hoping to find some people around my area actually selling stuff on here, but sadly I haven't found one real person on this app. Forget the one star it doesn't deserve stars for the fakeness this portrays 
Edit: I had to put in my input about selling on this app. Now I never thought I was going to use this app to sell something but I did and I shouldn't have. Now I have experienced selling stuff on other apps and this one is plain stupid. I don't know who the genius behind this app thought it was a good idea to make it where if you add a debit card the funds are not available for 5 business days. Now this app decides you have to have the money in your account for their app. Now all this does is create a more annoying problem and that's waiting for your money to hit your debit card or bank account. It's already frustrating enough that they hold your money on the app instead of automatically transferring to your debit card. I don't recommend selling on this app nor am I EVER selling on this app again. Does not deserve a star",1
24,"Finally an App For Everyone!: This is a great app for buying and selling. It is easy to use and a great tool for people from all walks of life. I use it everyday. I look around my house (especially my garage) and half of the Item came from OfferUp. And nothing looks second hand, the products listed are virtually always new or like-new. I have been a user for going on 8 years and I have yet to have a bad experience. That’s why I had to take the time to write this review today. And believe me I am telling my friends and family the same thing. Whether I am buying for myself, my friends/family, or my business I highly recommend this App. As for selling, this app has proven to be a life saver. When I’m low on cash I simply post a few more items or lower my asking price maybe 10% and Boom. Someone wants to meet and give me money for what I no longer want. And since most people are both buyers and sellers, I have personally witnessed mutual respect for both parties. I can’t stress enough how this app is useful in so many ways to everyone. I mean ask yourself… do you like cars, electronics, tools, clothes, toys, or MONEY. If you answered yes to any of those than do yourself a favor and download OfferUp right now!",5
25,"DON’T GET SCAMMED!: OfferUp is willfully allowing scams to be promoted on their platform. These scams can be found listed in every category, but mostly the cars and trucks category. The scams say something along the lines of “2008 Toyota Tundra AWDWheels Perfect conditions.” These degenerate scammers then try to take communications outside of OfferUp by listing their email in the description and saying it only costs $1000. What a steal! Poor innocent seniors and adults as well are being cheated out of their money because OfferUp provides a platform for these scammers to flourish in, without doing anything to remove their items. A good recommendation would be that you can only list a car for sale if you become a TruYou member. That would eliminate a lot of scammers easily. I do not support OfferUp because they could care less about these evil people trying to lure innocent buyers into thinking they are getting a good deal, but then ghost them, and there is no way to get your money back. It’s pretty much guaranteed that if a deal seems too good to be true, it is! Check the sellers page for what they have for sale, and you will most likely see 60-80 listings for the same exact item, just listed all over America so they can attract innocent victims nationwide. 

OfferUp is letting this happen. With no way to punish the scammers or track them, it’s not worth supporting. I opened the app and was greeted by almost 20 different scams just on the home page. This is a crap app.",1
26,"Terrible Application: I’ve used this app for quite a while. It’s my last ditch effort to find used and stolen items I cannot find on Craigslist. There is indeed a user rating system, but it’s worthless. And there is no time limit on postings. I often find posts which are 5-8 years old. Responses are difficult to receive as many tweekers post stuff and then they disappear. Most likely because the seller is in jail. The communication skills of most users are slim to none. If you don’t enable notifications, you will receive messages while browsing which you cannot close unless you close the app and restart it. When you report a user for anything, you get a worthless canned response. Recently, the app makes you watch ads after closing a post you reviewed and you must watch it to continue browsing. Like on Twitter, most of the users are inactive and administrators have no interest in differentiating between current and active accounts. Also, they constantly remind you to not coordinate a sale or purchase outside of the app under the auspices of safety. They constantly warn you how unsafe it is to use phone numbers and PayPal. It’s really just fear-mongering in order for them to make more money. I’m sure I left something out. I encourage users to hold the administrators accountable. Try it out, leave negative feedback, and hopefully they will get the message and change some things. In my my experience, they will not.",1
27,"I love the app: It’s perfect for selling your outdated items, unused items or reselling new and used items for sellers who can answer back quickly and who can have customers meet up with them quickly.  If you answer and can meet them at their earliest convenienc you will sell a lot of items fast!  People want a deal so be sure you price a little higher than you actually plan to sell it for in order to make money on the item.  Otherwise price it as firm by pressing button on the setup portion that says price firm so people realize you are not going lower.  You can see what is trending/selling that month in emails OfferUp sends you if you sign up for their push notifications or ask for emailed tips from offer up.  Different things tend to be trending every month.  One thing that always goes fast is electronics/cell phones/computers/ and have decent profit for seller.  If you are selling books and have there are probably better places to sell them than on here.  The app is responsive to questions and answers the?’s I send via email fast.  Just make sure if you are shopping you do it in the timeframe they set out. Read the policies and follow the protocols/rules quickly and you will succeed.",5
28,Used to be great.: I’m writing because I’m so disappointed after they changed the format to only show you stuff you have clicked on and not what each individual is offering at the time they post it. As a result I only get to see a small fraction of items and not everything available for sale like you would get to see on Craig’s List for example. Often times I’ll click on something because I can’t see it clearly and I’m curious what it is. Then it turns out to be something dumb like golf clubs and I don’t golf. But with their new algorithm they show me a bunch of different golf clubs for sale. The worst part about this is they repeat the list of items you have already looked at every hundred or so items. I can only browse for 10 minutes then it goes to the top of the list of items I already viewed some items change if I click on stuff because they shove those similar items down your throat after clicking on something but that’s when I put my phone down. I used to hang out looking at random stuff people were selling for hours. I found it very interesting and entertaining. I’ve bought and sold over a hundred items on this app. I wish they would go back to the old way. I liked looking at random stuff and I sometimes found something I forgot I needed but anymore it’s so limited and restrictive I feel like moving on to a different app just out of frustration and boredom.,2
29,"OfferUp no more: Update 9/4/23: account removed due to posting prohibited items, curtain rod, lamp, etc. I sent an email asking why my listings were automatically removed before even posting and they closed the account. I’ve heard many ppl having this same issue. I’ve contacted support every time so I have nothing to hide. 

Yet they let businesses spam the page with multiple fake accounts. Unless you buy to promote I guess they don't want you posting.  Used OfferUp 7 yrs, I’ve placed a lot of free items that maybe someone can use, if not they would go in the trash… good items, I just no longer have use for them. Never had an issue until now, my post keeps getting flagged for a tension curtain rod, it says it’s against the guidelines and not to use internet photos. These are my photos taken in my home, I bought the thing and am trying to see if anyone can use it, FREE of course, it says must have product available and photo of actual product available, it is the product I only have 1 to give away. So they let the app get taken over by businesses with multiple accounts spamming the page that legit people their posts don’t even show up. Contacting support has been useless they send a standard email with a whole list of reasons your post might have gone against policy. Are curtain tension rods to hang a laundry curtain illegal now?? It served me well and wanted to see if someone can use. Time to go elsewhere",1
30,"Poor customer support.: I reported many suspicious postings, cars in particular, and all the responses I got from customer support were generic, ready written texts. No action was taken since the suspicious posts continued. I'm looking to get an inexpensive car for my daughter and I keep coming across the same car under different posters in different locations. When I ask the seller for more info I get a response asking for my email address. I reported all of this with no action taken. It seems OfferUp doesn't care about the safety of its members. After a full month now nothing has changed. I keep reporting suspicious posters and keep getting this generic, auto response same wording responses from OfferUp. It is very easy to see these suspicious posts, the ones for selling cars with ridiculous asking prices in particular and the ones which ask for your email address. Even after flagging the suspicious posts, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist in order to see them, nothing is done! Another month went by and unfortunately nothing has changed. The malicious, suspicious posts continue. I report some of them but these posts continue under different ""sellers"". It is beyond me to understand why offerup doesn't delete these posts as soon as they appear. It is so obvious to recognize these suspicious posts. Anybody who's looking for a car beware!!!",2
31,"What a joke: This company banned my account.    They say I broke their terms and services numerous times.  What did I do?   I have no clue.    I post just like anyone else and don’t do anything to upset people.    If anything I have been harassed numerous times on this app.   This is also the second time I have been contacted about breaking terms.  The first time I lost my info to my offerup account and the email to recover it.   So I created a new account.    They came after me for two accounts.   I explained it and they deleted the old account.     
    When I ask the offerup support they only tell me my account has been removed and banned.    When I ask for what I get the same automated response that says I have been banned for violating the terms and my account has been removed.   No specifics nothing.   
    A friend had the same thing happen and he tried to talk with them and they did the same thing.   No information on what was done wrong, just sending the terms and lawyer talk about what you can and cannot do.    

    Here is the joke.   I have seen numerous people breaking the terms for years and years.   One account is for a local furniture store.    They post everything in their store a duplicate posts without removing.    Duplicate posts of the same item is a violation of the terms.    Their account disappears and then one month later it’s back.   Meanwhile I’m doing my best to follow the rules and I get banned.",1
32,"Great app: I do find I use this app quite a bit as second hand stuff is usually cheaper than buying new. Usually. All item interactions are grouped into sections which is convenient when you’re looking through multiple items or sellers.  I do get annoyed at many of the sellers though as they often don’t respond so if I’m looking for an item I have to message 8-10 people just to get a response. The rating system is also fixed. You can’t review someone unless the seller marks you as the buyer. In essence I’ve had questionable interactions and then do not get marked as the seller I assume so I don’t provide any negative feedback. I don’t sell many things but their posting system is very straightforward to post an item. Although, if you have the item up for a while, it seems better to archive and reupload as even “reposting” doesn’t update the time stamp. I think post from “6 months ago” or even “more than a year” are probably overlooked due to time. It would be nice if reposting updated that date so it still seems fresh and for sale. They have a verification system for truyou members which I tend to use for all my interactions buying or selling. It’s not that if you don’t have it I won’t buy or sell something but it’s something so simple so why wouldn’t you?",4
33,"Beware of Promotional Fees w/Glitches: I’ve been using OfferUp for many years, e.g. paying for their  promotional services for some of my for sale items. Recently, for the first and only time, I’ve had a technical issue where their app would not promote the 7 products I paid $7.99 for a 3-day promotion. I emailed CS, they gave me some recommendations but nothing worked. I even requested for the paid promotion to be modified so something will be promoted that weekend. My plan was to wait to the following peak weekend and try again. I even asked CS could the credit be transferred, they told me No. Although the promotion was showing on their end, it was not on my end or when customers viewed the items for sale. By the end of Day2 and services were not rendered, I just wanted a refund. They were clear I still had to pay for the service although it was never promoted. Instead of recognizing there was a technical issue with their app, I didn’t want the money back, I just wanted the unused service moved to after the glitch was fixed, would’ve been a win-win situation.  Now I have to take more time to contact my bank, open a claim when they could’ve just fixed the issue on their end. I will still use your services, but not sure of the promotion fees. I waited over a week to file a claim and 2-weeks to write a review. I was really hoping CS resolved it. Very disappointing they wouldn’t assist me further.",1
34,"I love and hate this app!!!: I love to meet in person and buy or sell. But I have never been able to buy things and have it shipped to me. I tried to get an answer and talking to a person is impossible. I’ve missed out on many items at a bargain that I’m forced to buy from somewhere else. I want to spend money on offer shipping but can’t. I do love the shipping program. I save money. eBay shipping is pricey especially when using priority, offer up uses priority but bigger boxes and heavier weights are divide into small med large. The boxes are bigger than usps flat rate and cheaper. It cost 9$ for a flat rate envelope and only 3$ through offer up.  The most thing I hate on offer up is all the fraud some ppl try to do. There has got to be a better way to screen for fraudulent sellers and more response from offer up to fix it. If they tell you to send money other than offer up it’s a scam. I’ve had some say they’ll deliver it because they happen to be in my area even if they are from out of state, then they say I’m on my way just send partial payment and just give the other half on delivery. They never come. And no one will reimburse you. That’s the good of eBay they will screen through the transaction and flag it. Other than that offer up is great. Best for local pickup and selling!",3
35,"Great platform with some flaws: I love the app, however, there are still some flaws in the way the services work. For instance, with shipping, some things are misleading and put the seller in an awkward and uncomfortable position. If you drop off a package at the post office without having it scanned in and receiving a receipt using the OfferUp provided prepaid shipping label, and then get notified later that your transaction was canceled because it was sent late. The shipping label does not deactivate, and your package will still be sent. However, the buyer at this point will have already been refunded. You’ll get a notification in the app that states if you already dropped off the package at the post office, you’ll still get paid. After a couple days and you don’t get paid or hear back from OU, naturally you’ll figure out how to contact customer service (for me it was not easy to find a phone number, but I did), to which they’ll say you need a receipt from dropping off the package, otherwise it’s up to you as the seller to contact the buyer and work out how to get paid. Luckily in my case the buyer was honest enough to send me an electronic payment, but they easily could have just said no, and there would have been no way to do anything about it, not even leave a negative review because the sale was cancelled.",3
36,"Terrible/non existent customer service: Up until recently I loved offer up and have used the app frequently to purchase and sell items with great success. Last week things were
Still normal but I decided to utilize the apps quick purchase and shipment opportunities to purchase some items from sellers in different states. I was able to purchase three items and two of them have shipped successfully through the app. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse when I was trying to communicate and purchase an item with a seller this week. Every time I went to submit a payment through their app with my card info it said my card was blocked. I called my bank and they said all of my accounts were not blocked and had more than enough amount of funds. I went to try another card and the same error happened. I tried logging out of my account and re logging in to see if it would fix the error and now it won’t let me log in to my account at all! The most frustrating thing is I have two sellers I need to
Stay in touch with to make sure I successfully receive their items that I paid for!!! I’ve called offerup numerous times and have been left with a non existent voicemail that says “any messages left at this number will not be received” I’ve also emailed offer up twice with no response. Please fix this problem
This is beyond ridiculous!!!!!",2
37,"Letgo worked. Offer up doesn’t.: I would sell things so quickly on Letgo. If something didn’t sell there was always interest. I would get messages all the time. Once this switched to Offer up that all ended. I’ve even payed 8$ twice to try to promote an item that easily sold on Letgo with no bite! I ended up selling on Craigslist. Also there is no customer support. They charged me twice for an item promotion and when I tried to reach out to someone to correct the issue I just got a random email not addressing the problem then a survey email right after asking if the problem was solved. Are they all robots over there? What is going on? The time isn’t even worth the effort anymore. Don’t promote items if you are going to use this app. It does nothing. Two stars because I have sold a few items. But I rarely check this app as I have better ones I’m on now. Really missed Letgo. I felt like they were more about keeping things local. So more people saw your posts. Anyway not a fan.

Update:
After posting this review I was contacted by customer service and my issues were resolved so I will add a star for that. I received a refund and I’m happy about that. But I still feel like since Letgo changed to offer up I get less views. I guess because there are more users and more people promoting their products.",3
38,"I WAS SCAMMED ! DO NOT USE !!!!: i posted a phone for sale and a woman texted me inquiring about buying a cell phone from me and insisted on me using PayPal so once she got my information she told me that she sent me $180 and that I needed to Check my email FOR an email from PayPal , The email from PayPal was stating that the money had been deducted from the woman’s account and sent to my account but it hadn’t been deposited into my PayPal until I sent a tracking number for the shipment of the phone to a specific email and  once I did that immediately the $180 would deposit into my PayPal which never happens ! 
Once I left my post office with the tracking number i attempted to send the tracking number to the email and the email bounced back two times telling me that the email that I was sending the tracking number to did not exist, so then I went to the PayPal FAQ’s and I clicked on “ I see a payment but why haven’t I received it “ q question and they said that I had been a victim of a scam because people are able to create a forged PayPal email stating that you have been sent money but you need to send a tracking number in order for your money to deposit !!! so do not use this app because people are scamming with PayPal !! i literally wasted my MONEY and time and LOST MY PHONE AND there’s NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT !!!!! IM SO UNHAPPY IF I COULD PRESS CHARGES I WOULD !",2
39,"Terrible customer service + not functioning app: I had been wondering why I couldn’t ship on offerup but never researched it till a few days ago. I found some helpful hints online under the help section and I tried them all but it still wouldn’t give me an option to ship my items, so I sent a dm to offerup support and the lady was very responsive and helpful. But she still couldn’t find out why it wouldn’t let me ship so she transferred me over to an account specialist who was supposed to contact me through email, which he did, ONCE. He said his name was Arwin and he asked me if my items I wanted to ship met the criteria so I responded and said yes but it still won’t let me ship. This was THREE days ago. I sent another email after my response just in case my other one didn’t go through but still no response from Arwin. The next day I sent yet another email asking for assistance and still no reply. He emailed me ONE TIME and left it at that. I’m transferring all my items over to a different selling app because Offerups customer service is absolute trash. If they want people to use their app they should think twice about having better service and actually answer and help their customers. I read some reviews after that and saw that this wasn’t the first time they’ve done this. If they want to keep customers they should try harder and have respect for them because I was shown no respect and will never use offerup again.",1
40,"Love the app but a few notes: Let me start by saying I love this app. It’s been so fun selling on here especially during covid since my hours got cut quite a bit. I really like the look of the new update and the new categories/detail options are nice. There are a few things I wish were better though. 

First, when I set the location for my listing it always changes after i press publish. It’s SO annoying! I’ll have to edit the listing 2-3 times to make it stay correct and now its been like 4-5 times per listing since the update. Second, I like the new categories and I like that you can list the material. I think it’d be cool if we could then filter listings by those things. I’d like to be able to click on ""Wood"" and then only have things made of wood show up. And then speaking of filters, it’s great that you can sort to have the nearest listings appear first but it’s utterly useless since listings never expire. If you sort it that way you’ll just get a whole bunch of stuff listed 2 years ago from now inactive accounts. But yea all of these things are pretty minor. Overall a great app. Mainly wish the location thing wouldn’t change after i publish my listing.",5
41,"Do not use this app!: Do not use this app! They favor buyers way too much. Here is what happened to me, they took my item away and did not give me the money for it; just because the buyer opens up a buyer protection case. The fact is that the buyer who I talked to said he did not really like the color of the headphones and do not want it anymore. My item matched 100% to the name and I even have pictures on the listing. I sell a lot of stuff on many apps or EBay. When the buyer opens the buyer’s protection, he claims that my item is a counterfeit without any proofs. 
The item I sell is 100% authentic; they come in with serial number both on the box and on the headphones itself. I have sold many Beats Headphones, and it never happened like this! This is very unfair to the sellers, buyers can just say my item is counterfeit without any proofs and my $300 item gets taken away? If this is the case, I will never sell or buy with Offerup ever again. My item is legit, it comes in with the original box from Beats and it has the serial number on both the box and the headphones itself. This is totally unacceptable, I understand if buyer does not like the item, but at least I would want the item to be returned to me. Also there are too many scams people, low ballers, and difficult people to deal with in this app. I would be better of just sell on EBay. Offerup also has high fees with you ship your item. I will never use this app to buy or sell again!",1
42,Glad its free: There is a reason craigslist reigns supreme. Yeah craigslist might charge you $5 for some ads but for me it is totally worth it to avoid all the spam and bogus reply’s to my adds. Offer Up is free and it is easy to upload/creat an ad. I just find it frustrating that lots of information is not required on this platform as it is on craigslist and I feel that I get a lot more fraudulent responses to my ads than compared to craigslist. Offer Up could be seriously improved to surpass craigslist if they gave it just a few more tweaks. How about this for an idea: requiring every user to pay a fee to “join” and then make all the postings free. Just a thought. I am so over all the spam and fake responses or bot calls from ads though. It would be really nice if there was a place to post items for sale that had the traffic that either Offer Up or craigslist offers but does a really good job of screening users to avoid all the unnecessary non-sense. Also it would be nice if vehicle ads were required to provide the VIN number as validation or authentication for posting an ad. It wouldn’t need to be on display for all to see but hopefully it would cut down on the fake ads. Also for vehicles please make mileage a requirement for posting. When I am shopping for a vehicle I want to know how many miles it has on it.,2
43,"Where did all my items go!?: In the beginning I loved the app.  I kept very busy selling. After a month it slowed down considerably. I asked multiple tech reps if there is a problem with customers viewing my offers. The reps said they did something to my account and business would pick up for a very short time. Presently, I have lots of well priced new Halloween costumes for sale and they aren’t moving!  I created another account and searched for similar items that I’m selling. Out of the 175 items I am selling, I am only able to view about 30% of the items listed. This was when I narrowed the search parameters down to a 10 mile radius. That percentage was significantly less the further I set out my search radius. In addition, I’m having to deal with a high number of not serious buyers. I waste a lot of time answering questions with zero payout. 

UPDATE
OfferUp also consistently jacks up the sellers fee and keeps it secret. Just a short time ago they charged only 7.9%, then it was 10%, then $2 for any sale under $20... now the fees for anything over $20 is 13%!  There are better sites like Facebook marketplace where I get much more business and little to no fees!  Even eBay is better than this app!!!!!!!!!!!  I only use this app to advertise and if I have no other alternative to make a sale. I will start to sell only locally from now on as well. OfferUp was getting less and less from me but now they are getting zero!",1
44,"Don’t sell here. App is buggy. No live support.: I downloaded OfferUp to sell a bunch of stuff before I moved. They removed all my posts without notice, and every time I tried to post another item I kept getting an error. So all my posts were taken down, and I can’t post any new ones, so I literally can’t use the app to sell anything. And the only live support I could find after searching their entire website, was shipping support. I was about ready to call shipping support after I continued to have issues verifying my phone number via text message and issues posting a new item, but when they removed all my items, I said F this I’m going to download LetGo (which I recommend). Before all that happened, though, I was getting good views and messages, and sold 2 items! So I invested more time and energy into making a good ad for each one of my items, including good photos, item descriptions, and price researching. So now I have all these really nice ads, and people are interested, then they all get taken down without notice, and I can’t post new ones. Neat. I guess the one good thing OfferUp taught me was to write my ads in Notes and to save my photos, instead of storing everything on the app, which means you’ll lose everything when they randomly decide to remove all your posts! Therefore, I just wouldn’t waste your precious time trying to sell anything on this app, and I’d recommend LetGo. Thank you for reading.",1
45,"I miss LetGo!!!: First off, I never leave reviews especially write them. But I miss the old app LetGo. It was a lot more user friendly. I had my own little side hustle using that app with buying and selling electronics. But now OfferUP bought it out I’m
guessing and it’s not as organized, shows items you search but they end up all over the place. Stuff posted for sale from months ago or from different states, even when I change the filters to have it local only and have newest first. Also, I’d give it maybe 3 stars. But I’ve posted stuff for sale, sending and receiving messages. Now all of a sudden I can’t message anyone because that stupid TruVerify box comes up. When Ove already verified my FB, Email, Phone Number, and took a selfie of myself. What else do I need? So now I can’t even continue to speak with potential buyers. Last thing is on LetGo I took pride in my account, and how much business I was doing, but since it switched over my 5 star customer rating, various positive reviews, and the items that I had sold showing the quality of the stuff I presented for buyers didn’t transfer to the new app. So now I have to start all over again after working for hard to build up a Good, positive, trustworthy reputation for people to see. I wish they would bring LetGo back, or make OfferUP the same way.",2
46,"Terrible when you need assistance: I used Offer Up for about two years. I had mostly good interactions, about 60% of people will inquire then disappear but that’s nothing against the Offer Up App. My issue is customer service. It’s non-existent when you need help. They make it nearly impossible to contact them when there’s an issue with the app. I had a terrible experience with a seller last year who ripped me off on an electric bike that was missing pieces. I sent a detailed message to offer up and asked for assistance. They did nothing except tell me that they take issues seriously and would look into it. Nothing happened and the seller still has an active account. Then as a seller, my account with two years experience and five stars was deleted because I posted something with hemp oil in it, hemp oil! Not THC or CBD. They locked me out of the account and never emailed me to let me know. I thought my account was hacked but thought it has to be the muscle rub. I tried for two days to contact support but there’s no support. I was so upset. Facebook Marketplace is so much better and if you have issues, there’s actually human beings to assist. I lost so much respect for Offer Up after realizing they avoid customers like the plague. They could have at least reached out to me when I posted the muscle rub with hemp oil, and they could have suspended the seller who ripped me off for the bicycle, but they did neither of those.",1
47,"3 year user: I've been using this app for 3 years now and I there are definitely some pros using this app, but also some cons that I believe could be fixed yet Offer Up doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.I don't need to go in to detail about the pros because everyone else seems to have let you know. I will say this though; its a great app that lets you make some extra cash due to it being a very popular app making it a great platform to sell from. 
Con: 1. No call no shows; if you're looking to dabble in the offer up community please don't be someone that hits that buy now button when you're not a serious buyer. This happens so much it makes me want to give up and start selling on eBay. I believe Offer Up could somehow make it where they have to give a deposit when pressing that buy now button. That would seal the deal. For example : 
Last night I made plans for someone to meet me in a walmart parking lot. We messaged each other while on the way, they said they were a few minutes away and i ended up waiting over an hour in that parking lot only to figure out they weren't going to show up. I'm already bored writing out this review, so this is all i'm giving you. Thats all you need to know really anyways.",4
48,Worst app: No customer service and get scammed all the time. I tried too buy an item did not violate any community guidelines and got my account disabled. I know I didn’t violate the community guidelines because I mentioned the item too a colleague since I couldn’t buy it and he decided too buy it for himself. He just tried too buy it and got he’s account disabled. Every person I mentioned the item too had the account disabled without reason. It happened too a couple of people and I’m supposed too believe that just because they wanted too buy the item they would get their account disabled. Don’t do shipping on offer up. Half of the items are trying too scam you or worse. They hacked offer up and now me and a couple of friend had their accounts disabled. When I mentioned this too the customer service staff they said that I violated the community guidelines and offered no type of solution I was the one in the wrong without a reason. I guess getting you’re site hacked and being a victim makes you the person at fault for everything. Didn’t even try too figure out why my account got disabled no type of customer service or support for me or any of my colleagues. Very bad costumer service and very bad security. I would not recommend this app too anybody. Find some other app will be safer and you won’t have too worry about being scammed or hacked.,1
49,"Offer Up Flaws: I honestly really like offer up. I use it a lot. Posting things is really made simple. It’s very easy to search and communicate with other buyers/sellers. In fact you could go through a whole transaction without ever exchanging personal information. The reason for my 3 Star, comes because of the flaws I find on offer up. Simple things that I think the app makers could fix. First when you save or favorite something it goes on a board. I like that you can create boards for different searches. But when it gets to cleaning up those boards, it’s a pain in the bottom. You have to go thru every item you’ve saved and individually delete them off of your board. There isn’t any way to mass delete. Or edit, and select what you don’t want. In this day and age, that should be fairly simple to add to this app, but after years, nothing. The next thing is the whole “hide” messages or “archive” posts. There isn’t an option to simply just delete them. I’m done with it, I don’t want it there, I should be able to delete them. In conclusion offer up is great, but those are its downsides IMO. I wish they’d fix it, change it, make it better.",5
50,"TruYou Verification is now REQUIRED: Given the number of data breaches we’ve seen over the years from much more established institutions, I don’t see the need to upload your Driver’s License or Identification Card simply to verify that you’re a person as being relevant to buy or sell. OfferUp has verified my email and my phone number and that should be good enough. In addition, you can chat directly with sellers or buyers so they’ll immediately get feedback on whether or not uou’re a real person or if you’re truly local or if they want something shipped to their cousin who just happens to be a prince. On top of that, people can see your public profile shich tells them how many items you’ve bought and sold and how your well your interactions went based on a five star system. Bottom line, there are plenty of ways to ensure the person you’re talking to is human. 

None of which is a guarantee that you’re NOT going to be scammed but that’s the risk you take. TBH, gettin “scammed” is relative to each person’s experience with a particlar sale, i.e. selling something cheaper than what you had intended, buying something that broke after a few day/weeks, etc. Again, it’s a risk but you should know that you’re taking that risk by buying something from another person. YMMV. 

Until this REQUIREMENT is lifted or removed, I will not be using their platform. I really miss LetGo.",1
51,"Love the Concept… but: I love the concept, and have purchased many great items which is not only cheaper but reusing helps me reduce my contribution to the mass produced capitalistic waste of goods choking our planet. I wish there was a better monitoring system. There are so many stores on here with ads for furniture, appliances, clothing - and I don’t mean the actual officially generated ads that keep this app free, I mean stores posing as people. I also have to mention the algorithm. It needs to be adjusted. I like being shown similar items that I want - but there should be a way to see how long you’re on that post once open. Sometimes I click on something because I can’t tell what it is from the tiny pic (and often bizarre camera angles and zoom-ins) and immediately go back because it’s something I don’t want - the algorithm still personalizes my feed, showing me more of those things. Lastly, I wish you could pick a setting to view the post feed. The way they’re arranged the pics are so tiny and it’s hard to make them out. If there was an option to choose how to view; 3 across, 2 across, 1 across - it would be so much easier to see - plus I would no longer have to click on it to see it and my algorithm wouldn’t get messed up!",3
52,"Review: I am a dedicated follower on this app.  I mostly enjoy using it & on my regular account I have many deducted followers too.  I have had ALOT of issues lately.  Apparently someone reported my regular account I post under that I was “scamming” them, which is total nonsense.  Unfortunately some customers or potential customers do this because they don’t get what they want etc.  and this is 1 main issue I have which this app is that it blocks/bans the account without investigating whether the accusation is true.  I had to contact this app 3 times since starting to fix my account.  This last time which has been in the last few days, offer up has I guess reviewed my account which is Piece of the 🧩 with almost 900 followers and over 7 thousand sales, and they sent a email saying they “fixed it” which it looks like it is reinstated however we had to send two emails now because it isn’t fixed it still won’t let me log in for some reason.  So I’m addressing offer up on this forum now so maybe it can be “completely fixed”.  My husband posts as well so we are using his now which is this profile “William” but I would very much like to issue concerning pei e of the puzzle to be resolved & quickly.  Thank you for your time.",3
53,Customer service really takes their time: I have been an OfferUp customer for about 5-6 years and I had a second account with them that got stolen. I wasn’t able to get my account back because they changed the number and at that point I just didn’t care enough because I only used my primary account and didn’t have any important info on the second one. Months later I’m getting no views and no one is responding to my messages. Instead of contacting me or letting me know anything they just banned my account because it looks like whoever stole my second account was trying to scam people. In all my 6 years of having offer up and keeping my account at 5 stars not once have I tried to scam someone and the least they could have done is contacted me. On top of it they pretty much blocked my whole IP address because no other account works for me I even tried it on a friends account and I find it ridiculous that they went to this extent without even letting me know. At least if you’re going to do this let the account owner know so I’m not sitting here like an idiot posting things and wondering why no one is messaging me. On top of it they will still send me messages on how I should promote my items in order to get more views?? I’ve emailed them 5 days ago with no reply don’t bother using this app if you want to be made to look stupid.,1
54,"What a mess this company is currently: Tried again a year later (after my initial review below) and their validation process is still broken. What a mess. Bummer, at one point (years ago), this had been a really great app.

———————
3 strikes, and I’ve given up and deleted your app: 1) I received an email from these guys saying they had archived/hidden the items I’m selling since my account was not verified. At no point had they ever previously asked me to verify my account, but now I no longer have a way to interact with the sellers that were interested in my items. 2) I tried to verify my account, but was told that my phone number is not valid. My phone number is perfectly valid, test your buggy verification process before forcing it on people. 3) I replied to their email, just to be told they can’t figure out how I am - I’M REPLYING TO YOUR EMAIL!!!! Given that they are incompetent in every interaction with them I’ve given up and deleted their app. Time to try Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or whatever other app may fill the void as these guys drive their customers away. I’ve previously sold many items through this app, over many years. It truly was once a five star app, but apparently it’s been handed off to an utterly incompetent (mis)management team at this point. They appear to be doing all they can to drive customers away, even well established ones.",1
55,"Small issues but love it overall...: One thing I have an issue with is the saved items feature. I’d like an easier way to delete multiple posts at a time & multiple categories I no longer use. If the app could have a way 2 remind you when a post u liked is still available at the amount of time u were able to preselect it would be very useful in negotiating a price when an item hasn’t sold 4 a month or more. Also, when saving items, it’d be more useful if the categories were arranged in order of last used not first created or alphabetically. This way of u are searching 4 a lamp, but created a “Lamps” category last year when u were looking 4 one, once u saved a recent post in the “Lamp” category it stayed on top until u saved 2 another list. This way u don’t need 2 scroll down 2 find your lamp category each time, or end up creating a new “Lamps 2021” category 2 avoid the hassle. It’s all about the save/delete options 4 me. Just one more thing, maybe have a user preference of whether u want the app 2 auto delete items you’ve saved once they seller removes the post or sells the item. That would be so awesome !!! Otherwise I love it! Thx so much 😊",4
56,"Used to love offerup, but...: I used to love offerup, I used it frequently to buy and sell cars for my car business, and I didn’t mind much when they started to charge $5 per ad but for the past year or so it’s basically impossible to use offerup to buy or sell vehicles. I literally did a count and out of 100 vehicle ads over 80% were scam ads. I get that you can’t possibly stop all scammers but you guys can at least TRY and do something especially if you are charging money for ads. I have seen way too many, VERY obvious scam accounts that have been open for several years with literally 20,30+ duplicate vehicle scam ads. Also most of them are from the other side of the country? There is absolutely no reason why a huge tech company cannot come up with an incredibly simple solution to at least do something about the incredibly obvious scam accounts with dozens of duplicate ads that are taking up literally 80-90% of the vehicle section. I have done my part in flagging the scam ads and accounts, but you guys failed to do your part by removing them, since I have seen the same ads and accounts that I have flagged numerous times, several days and even weeks later. Also I have written in several emails to your “staff”, if you can even call them that and it left me even more frustrated than I was before. Well done.",2
57,"OfferUp Suggestions: OfferUp is great, I love it and it has been great buying and selling things on it. My three suggestions to make this a better experience would be to 1) fix how images are shown in OfferUp. I take a wide angle picture, and somehow it ends up getting cut off (even when you click on it to show the “full” picture). It’s quite annoying when trying to zoom in just right only to find that half your image is missing on the edges. 2)The app UI for the Description field is a bit wonky whenever the text becomes long enough to require the scroll feature. It is very hard to make my cursor line fall where I want it to. If I tap on one spot in the text, it will often scroll/zoom to a completely different location. If I try to use the long press space bar function on my phone to move cursor, the text glitches if attempting to scroll up or down. I have an Apple iPhone, and usually never have this issue when typing. 3) If there is a way to create and filter cars to show “Sold by Dealership” vs “Sold by Owner” or something along those lines, it would be really helpful. Please fix and then it’ll be that much more awesome!!!",5
58,"Getting item canceled probably by the seller or offer up.: So i wanted to buy some shoes and while i was verifying some answers the guy told me “when your ready offer” i felt like it was a scam i offered the money next thing you know i waited a couple minutes then a message pops up saying the item was canceled by the seller i had this happen 3 to 4 times already i was accused for violating community guidelines which the person probably lied about and “offer up” agreed to that, my money wasn't sent back to me so i guess the seller was a scammer the seller probably has this kept going since the day he posted the shoes in my balance i only have 91 dollars. I bought it for shipping the guy declined to not meetup so I'm guessing he wanted the money online i already sent a message to offer up. Offerup is like facebook marketplace really not certified need more security to make sure on what happens to the item or the money i am really upset and don't want anybody experiencing this right now what I'm experiencing. The shoe was going around for 300 i wanted to offer 250 he agreed to it and total was 271 from sales taxes and shipping. Messaged popped up about offer up looking on the review the people that review items on offerup aren’t really authentic on what they do they agree to everything i have 3 accounts now disabled and cant get in them never using this app again.",1
59,"Decent sellers app: I was on this when it was Letgo. I never really sold anything that required mailing until OfferUp & agree that the OfferUp fee of 12.9% is very high. Especially when you factor in having to pay for shipping, the seller won’t make much. It’s because of their rate that I tend to list all of my items locally. I also gave it only 4 stars because there is a lot of shadiness on this app. Much more than Letgo had previously. Examples: I posted an item, then less than 4 seconds later came a comment (from what I can only assume was a foreign computer “i want to buy your [insert item from my listing verbatim] for $10 only. Is it still offered up?”  If I checked the profile, it was created that month, no history or verification. Another thing that happened soon after I posted my profile photo was 1) I got hit on by someone trying to buy an item & 2) someone who claimed he was a 16yo kid asked me to drive the $100 item, 40 mins away for an extra $20. Again, he had just joined this month, so I voiced my concern & never heard back. I feel there should be a better system in place to protect users from scam artists. We’ve joined the site to offload some items, not get scammed or taken advantage of.",4
60,"I love offerup!: I have recently started using it a few months ago and have made about $1,000 in 3 months! Im a single mom so it helps out a lot! Its a great way to declutter and even get rid of stuff for free that you dont care for at all. I also sell everything from my front door and just tell people to leave the money under the mat!! I have not ONCE been ripped off! Im glad to know I can trust people Ive even sold something for $100 and they left the $ under the mat. Ive also met some great people for when I have to meet them for bigger things like a treadmill. I plan to keep using offerup I also buy on it as well. There are some lowballers and laggers but that's normal so it doesn't bother me I just ignore them. Offerup is very addictive as well. The only thing I dont like is how you cant permanently delete anything you can only hide it. I also wish they would make a section for advertising. Sort of like craigslist. I’ve also had buyers give me an extra dollar of two and one time I wanted to buy two candles from bath n body so I asked the lady to leave them at my door and I left her the money under my mat and she did (: love this app !!",5
61,"Not a “Buy it now” platform 👎: I do not like the purchasing format for this app. Sellers list their items like any other marketplace type app, but when I clicked to purchase several different items from different buyers, it did not place the purchase for the item but instead submitted an “offer to purchase” to the seller who apparently then has to accept the offer before you are actually committing to buy. In the three different instances where I tried to purchase a product that was listed for sale at the price that it was listed for, I did not get any response or acknowledgment from the seller of that product so my offer to purchase ended up expiring and I could not buy the product listed at the price it was listed for. What’s the point of a marketplace platform where a seller can list an item and a buyer who wants to purchase it for the listed price is not even given the option because the seller is too lazy to acknowledge or accept the offer? This app is going to loose credibility by not holding sellers accountable to commit to their listings. FYI this isn’t a direct purchasing app but some loose make an offer, seller isnt committed to sell a listed product type of app. I’m going to be sticking with eBay, Marketplace or Mercari as those places I have and can actually purchase a listed product from a seller.",2
62,"Contact their Twitter support if problems!: It’s a fantastic app, and I get better results when listing something than I do on LetGo (which is still a great app itself) , but during my first week using it, I was randomly struck with the inability that a lot of other people have experienced where I couldn’t see where my listings were, nor reply to people or buy from them. What you need to do if you want to get ANY response from them is contact their twitter support. You can simply Google this and it’ll pop up. I contacted them and was met with a representative named George, about 7 hours later after sending a Direct Message. He asked me for my account email and then informed me that it was a bug within their app and he had it fixed and back to normal within like 2 minutes. He had me confirm that it was working again and I have had no problems since. I do agree that the customer service is very poor but contacting their Twitter Support seemed to have done the job just fine, however having to seek out a Twitter account rather than using their default customer service email option is VERY unprofessional. OfferUp if you see this, you need to LISTEN to your customers. This is absurd seeing how so many unfortunate people are struggling with such a simple app.",3
63,"Really disappointed: Well I bought a 1000 dollar laptop for 400 dollars using their shipping service, I thought we’ll great deal no problem, I would’ve never in my life thought that the buyer takes the hit for mistakes that usps makes. Turns out usps delivered my laptop to another house in my neighborhood, and they are claiming they didn’t receive anything, no surprise big flashy box with a computer of course they aren’t going to say they got it. I thought oh well since I never received anything I’ll just file the claim with OfferUp and get my money back. Turn out that’s not the case packages that are lost or never delivered are the buyers concern they pay the sellers and give the buyer the middle finger and let you to deal with usps. To put into perspective what you need to deal with well, you don’t pick what insurance goes on the package OfferUp does that and you pay a flat rate. Usps insures packages up to 100 dollars and OfferUp let you buy things up to 750 with shipping, this means as a buyer you are expected to take the hit for usps mistakes which believe me are plenty and happen more often than you would think given they are one of the worths mail carriers in the country. Super unsatisfied I put in the saving I had for a laptop to start school and now I’m left without it and have to pay 340 dollars because usps only gave me 100 back.",1
64,"Can’t sell anything on this app: This app is just horrible. A majority of sellers I try to message about their item’s availability never respond. I’m trying to sell my iPhone 6 and I tried promoting my listings with real money but I barely get anyone interested. Even if someone offers some money or I try to offer money it gets canceled automatically even though I’m verified for payments. I tried emailing OfferUp about it but i still got no response. There are a lot of flakers that will act like they are interested in my phone and I arrange to meet them the next day. But when I’m getting ready and I message them that I’m about to leave they say they no longer want the phone. I always report them for wasting my time as I had to turn down other offers to get through with the meet ups. Then when I message those people asking if they are still interested I get no response. No one is ever serious ok this app. They either never respond to me asking if they are still selling their product, they cancel the meet up last minute, or they just stop replying. I’m just going to delete my account on this app because it’s just wasting my time. I sold a phone on Mercari in under 24h compared to the 3 weeks I had my iPhone 6 up on OfferUp. This app is just full of scammers and OfferUp won’t let me buy anything because it keeps canceling my offers. Never using this app again",1
65,"Great Concept... Horribly Executed. Don’t waste your time.: OfferUp could be great, but instead, anyone can report any person or item and there are no checks and balances. Once your account is reported and banned, the device you were using will apparently never work with the app again. After months of not being able to see the items I posted, my husband offered to let me use his account to post the items. Behold! Once he signed into his account on my phone, his account was suddenly banned! He had three buyers in the process of setting up meetings for his own items and can no longer contact them. 

When we try to contact support, no one will reply to emails or Tweets. Not only would MY account have no reason to be banned (really, I posted vintage jars and a teddy bear cookie jar), but the fact that my husband’s account was immediately banned upon logging in on my device furthers my opinion that OfferUp is a complete joke. There are plenty of reviews and community forum posts about people being screwed over by OfferUp’s obscene banning system, and ridiculous practice of auto-banning any account signed into in a device with a banned MAC address. 

Save yourself some serious headache and stick to Letgo and Facebook Marketplace. OfferUp apparently grew too big for their britches too quickly and can no longer manage or support their app and its users. Stay far, far away.",1
66,"Pay to win???: 1. This app used to be great like a year or two ago but I don’t know what changed but they became super greedy. They made some dumb**s membership where it makes the app seem pay to win because of the features that come with it. 
2. The ads they had where they’d pop up randomly and have a link to a site if you clicked on it was fine but now the ads that pop up on your screen and make you wait like 5 seconds is super annoying. I don’t get why they changed it to force ads down our throat.
3. Dealerships and business running the app is very overwhelming and annoying the main selling point when offerup was first made was that you’re buying from normal everyday people for things where you can talk to them and haggle the price etc…. This is not possible with the ridiculous amounts of business and dealership listings on this app. I think if they want their stuff advertised they should pay offerup to do it and not be able to create tons and tons of listing for one item that the business is trying to sell. 
3/5 stars is because I still use this app and have been for a long time and have had a good experience, but I just do not like the direction this app is going.",3
67,"Sooo disssssssaaaappppooooiiiinnnnttttedddd: Apologizing now if any spelling errors:

Just like the title im so disappointed in offerup for nooooo reason that i was advised of by the app, they just completely blocked me or banned me. Whats that all about that i know of I  haven't been rude or done things i shouldn't. The worst I've done is forget to answer a msg right away or said no thanks to an offer . At least if I would of had an explanation or reason but I came in one day and things were off . Ive been trying to purchase things but I guess people are not getting my messages and im sure not getting any or views. Ive been using offer up since June 2015 and always have a pleasant buying experience or selling, hence the 5⭐️ ratings that have never gone down. Ive emailed two times and supposedly im suppose to get an email right away and nothing I've verified my account with my choice of verification forms. I don't mind if you just want to kick loyal/long time app users off but at least give an explanation, I literally loved this app and loved looking at things to buy or save to show my friends and family “oh hey didn't you say you wanted this” I went over prohibited items and none are on my posts reviewed guidelines and nothing at least i realize makes sense to just ban me. How upsetting honestly especially when its an app you always recommend to everyone to use vs. so and so .",1
68,"Wonderful Idea undercut by annoying UI: First of all the platform and idea are fantastic. I have made money and given myself something to do with all my excess crap which is great. Woo yay and all that. 

My problems are nitpicks but if fixed I believe they would make the experience tremendously more enjoyable. First of all change the messaging system so the newest message -you- sent snaps to the top. As it is now it doesn’t move in the order until both people see the message. Very annoying when messaging sixteen people at once. 

Also it desperately needs better, more customizable search functionality. I want to be able to search a radius, a specific category and subcategory and a specific price all at the same time. Right now I can pick one large category and either “newest” or “closest”. I want a precision junk buying experience. Not a “scrolling past more cat hair than table for half an hour” junk buying experience. Making your users feel like they’re awash with too many options can make them feel overwhelmed. It’s a sea of junk I just wanna be able to narrow it done a bit, capiche?",5
69,"Account Deleted without reason: Terrible! I’ve been a flawless buyer and seller for many years now on OfferUp! Over 100 5 Star ratings. I have been greatly helpful to their customer service reporting constant fraudulent activity in the past. Suddenly my account is banned again. My account has been deleted randomly in the past. Once when I hadn’t even been on the platform for weeks. Each time I reach out to their support team to reinstate my account, the message back I get from an actual agent is that my account was “blocked in error” and they would reinstate right away. This time they say I violated community guidelines so my account is just cancelled for good. I have no idea for what! They just send automatic generic messages not indicating anything specific I have done. I haven’t even bought or sold anything in WEEKS!! The account block just happened randomly one morning without warning or explanation. Beware if you are looking into this app, they now have many complaints with the BBB and other various websites note similar issues with this platform. There is obviously a serious problem with their account monitoring system that seems to be widespread over the last several months specifically. Hopefully I can get in touch with an actual human who can help me and NOT automated genetic and vague messages.",1
70,"Unfair Customer Service: I’ve been a seller with OfferUp for many years now, i had a 4 and a half star rating from around 10+ buyers. This app was amazing at first, it was very basic and easy to sell but ever since this collaboration with Letgo it’s never been the same (for me at least). After i updated my app (which was the one with Letgo) it said my account has been deactivated, so i emailed there customer service asking “why was my account deleted, i’ve done nothing wrong so i’m sure it was a mistake on your end”. They responded quickly the next day saying they’ll see what happened to my account and said “we’ll respond as soon as we can”. Literally a month passes and they finally respond saying that i violated community guidelines without saying what i specially did wrong and (since i was tired of waiting i made another account to keep selling) that i wasn’t allowed to have a new account. I’ve sent 2 emails over the course of a month asking what do i specifically do wrong and i haven’t gotten a response. I’ve been a long time member of this app and as of late i find this disappointing and very unfair because i still don’t know what i did wrong to this day. If your interested in just buying without worrying about their customer service this app is remarkable but if your a seller like me, BEWARE!!!",1
71,"Very unfair and rude: I’ve been with OfferUp since 2016, and I am one of the top sellers/buyers on this app. I have over 20 reviews and all of my reviews are 5 stars with great feedbacks. I’ve never scammed anyone, nor did I ever break any “Terms of use” or “Terms of Service.” About a month ago, I was aiming to sell an iPhone and out of the blues I couldn’t get any views on my new items I post, nor was I able to read anyone’s message forwarded towards me. At first I assumed it was a glitch. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled, changed my password, and tried to see if anyone had the same issue. Once I found out they banned my account, I tried to contact them in many ways, with more than one email. As soon as I wrote a bad review on here they began to reply and quickly asked to resolve the issue. I asked them why they banned my account in the first place, they said it was because I (supposedly posted an item more than once (which I didn’t.) Anyways, the issue was resolved for a month and they banned my account again a few days go for no reason whatsoever! I lost on my sales and I even tried emailing them to ask them why they banned my account, they didn’t bother to even reply.

72,"Not Bad, But Be Careful: My first meet up was regarding a PA System that someone had told me they were interested in. I was selling it for $150 and they guy offered me $100. I told him I would meet him at $125. He said he did not have the extra $25 and that he was hoping to get it and give it as a donation to a church in Haiti. Because of his good intent, I not only agreed on $100, but I threw in a microphone and microphone stand. We met up and I loaded the microphone stand that was in my rear seat in his truck. I opened my trunk and when he saw the speakers he said they were too small. I told him they were the same ones he saw in the picture and he continued on with how they had to be big because it was for a big church and yada yada yada. I believe he was trying to bring me down on the price thinking that I would after having driven all the way to meet him. I took my stand back and left. Minutes after, I began to get texts from people in his same area wanting to low ball me. I really do not need the money that badly, which is why I was willing to come down so much when I perceived it to be for a good cause, but I refuse to be taken for a sucker. I would rather donate it than sell it to a scammer.",4
73,"Was good until they started shipping: Used the app all the time before the shipping feature. Tried it out for the first time. Mailed item right away and customer received it. Deposit was pending for three weeks without being placed in my account. App requested personal info multiple times for one transaction including address, bank account info and social security number. Not sure why they need this info multiple times for every deposit. I Sent multiple e mails for support to find out what the delay was. First 3 responses claimed the hold up was on the banks end. Finally on the 4th email got a response that the items sold were fraudulent and another claim was made  they would suspend the account and contact the authorities. So guilty until proven innocent. I have a great reputation for selling and buying. It’s really shocking how instead of doing a investigation they just take the buyer side without any notice to the seller. They did release my funds because I complained. But that was after I sent multiple emails and threatened to post on social media. Beware. If you get a buyer trying to scam you will be screwed.",5
74,"Offer up review: Yes I love offer up how easy it is to use, my only disappointment would be (which has nothing to do with OfferUp) is the many flaky people that, don’t show up, don’t communicate. 
Some ask a million questions when I write very detailed descriptions of my items that I’m selling and they ask obvious questions that I have described in detail. Just the flaky behavior of people that have no integrity or manners.
 I haven’t complained to offer up, maybe I should but I don’t want it to be something that comes back at me. I have good ratings, I respond quickly, always show up ahead of time even wait up to 45 minutes for those that are running late, some just never show up (rude) and don’t communicate. I’m a very understanding nice person so if they just said for whatever reason they can’t make it I’ll understand and go back home. I know there’s really nothing that offer up can do, because we can’t control other people‘s behaviors but if you have any suggestions that I might do when people behave badly please let me know.
P.S. Fortunately the majority of the people I deal with are GREAT!
 Thank you, Kathy",5
75,"Poor programming: I listed a set of items for sale and got several replies to it. The posting process is longer than other sites/apps because I encountered error after error. I posted the item the first time and it didn’t even show up. I posted it again, successfully that time. I came back 30-45 minutes later and it wanted me to “bump” my item up in the listings. This isn’t a new mechanic, but I was surprised to see that after such a short time. Out of curiosity, I went to find my item before bumping it and it was absolutely buried about a half dozen pages from the top. I ended up selling it on Facebook Merketplace because of this poor app mechanic. If you don’t live on this app, your item will quickly disappear in the chaos. 

After I deleted the item, I got an email from Offerup, asking me if I sold it to one of the people I spoke to or sold the item elsewhere. I clicked elsewhere and encountered numerous errors again, resulting it the program only offering the option to choose the person I had spoken to on the app. Not sure if this is just more of the buggy nature of this app’s programming, or if it’s an attempt at dishonest statistic gathering. Either way, this app seems like a decent deal if you’re a buyer, but not a seller.",2

The delivery and sale has been agreed upon and been completed by all parties involved and payment has been sent to me via this App. Using brand new iPhone 11 in downtown Seattle with 300 download speed. Upon clicking the cash out button it says to update the app the latest version. I click the one button on the the apps screen to do so, Apple App Store opens and there’s no update or new version. It just takes me back to the same error page in the offer up app which just takes me back to the App Store where there is no evidence of change or direction. I’m in a cycle of being unable to cash out to my bank account and I’ve been checking everyday for this bug or update to be fixed or recognized for 2 weeks. The app is now unusable for me. I guess your just holding or keeping my $78 after me putting in the time to use your service, drive to the post office, etc.  It’s too bad because I have plenty to post but am actually uninterested in using this app any further. OfferUp, many of your users don’t feel safe or reassured. Many of us are uncomfortable or disappointed either while using the App or after the apps purpose is supposedly fulfilled. Doesn’t encourage people to click or download this much further. I’d appreciate some help from this company.",1
77,"Too many scammers: I previously had Let Go but was obviously forced to get this new app, due to the merger/buyout, if I wanted to continue selling though this outlet. I do use other selling apps as well (Poshmark & Mercari) but it’s nice to have an app that also allows local pickup, especially for larger items. However, since the update, the majority of “interested buyers” are actually scammers. Luckily it’s typically fairly easy to detect these scammers (new account, asking for your phone # to communicate, etc), although some are a little less obvious initially. Unfortunately that’s 90% of the messages received... scams. You would think this company would require a little more to verify your account before you can begin conducting business. There are several verification methods in place, they just aren’t required. Anyone can make up and verify an email address then start scamming! For the record, I’ve sold numerous items through Let Go, Poshmark and Mercari. I’ve now sold one item on Offer Up, but that’s only after reporting and blocking likely 20+ scammers. The app functions decently, they just need a better scam deterrent process. I’ve also provided this feedback directly through the app. Happy selling/buying! Just be cautious!",3
78,Thank You: I tried Wish Local when I first learned how to sell online it was a nightmare a complete scam I had to call Sheriffs office . Beware if thinking of doing Anything on Wish. Then I tried Offer Up number 1 u made it easy for a non technical person to use it is so user friendly I love the way u have boxes that pop up when for example someone wants u to call them on there phone u tell us Beware cuz u have made it so u only have to message through u and I like that very much& my life situation is so bad right now ( 1- my husband of 43 years passed away)& offer up has made it possible for me to try to get rid of over 60 years of living that I no long have a place for. I have met only very nice people which is a blessing so Thank You Offer Up I have only 1 question I know it's just me & im not seeing it how do I reach customer service if there is a problem the easiest fastest way . I'm sure u have it or told me when I first opened and because u are so user friendly I know I can find it  Thank You Offer Up for helping me when I have needed it the most I tell everyone they should get this app. Sincerely Kim,5
79,"2-in one nonstop shop: So this used to be 2 separate apps: LetGo and Offer Up. Yes, the ads are super annoying but the convenience of it all is second to none. I am glad they offer shipping options now so it kind of opens up your options for stuff. If there were a few things I would change, it would be these: use PayPal for payments that require shipping, a reliable buyer protection financial source where your  purchase is guaranteed if you don’t receive your item, the item is damaged, not the same thing, as in the description, etc. Also, instead of sending offers to the person for them to accept, it’s better to just have a function for a buy it now option. There should also be a few filters when browsing, like listings from newest to oldest, and vice-versa, keyword searches, brands, colors, price ranges, relevant listings, and MOST importantly, the date the item was listed. All in all it’s a great app and I have not only purchased stuff on here before, I have sold as well and I have even found services such as my a/c guy who put in a new system AND someone that sells brand new and sealed mattresses.",4
80,"Terrific app/service!: I am not someone who “writes reviews” of products or services very often, at all.  Not really something I care enough to do, honestly. But, every once in a while, something will come along that genuinely impresses me so much that I feel like I should share that experience with others who may be considering that “thing”.  So, here’s what I posted to my FB page back in October when I was first introduced to this great app.

(October 12, 2017  -  Gardena, CA)   Allow me to sing the praises of “Offer Up”.  This is probably the best app that I have ever used.  Two and a half hours ago I had three items to sell from my storage unit.  Didn’t know what I was going to do.  The CSR at Public Storage suggested I try Offer Up.  I’d never heard of it before, but I downloaded it, and put up adds for the items I wanted to sell.  Within :45 minutes, I had Well over 150 views, and multiple request to buy!  All items were sold and picked up within an hour and twenty minutes!   Wow!  Such a blessing.  I’m amazed at how fast, simple, and effective that experience was.  👍🏼👏🏼😁",5
81,"App doesn’t work with a VPN: The app will let you search and read messages while a VPN is enabled, but not respond to messages or post. I had to figure this out through trial and error though. I always use a VPN, and so I have to disable it just to use this app now, which I hate. So if you use a VPN at all times, you’re out of luck. Fix that and I’ll change the 1 star.

Also they ban an item based on keywords and you cannot appeal; it’s all automated. For example, the buttstock of a rifle (literally just a piece of polymer) had my item delisted, even though a buttstock is not against the rules they posted. Selling firearms is of course banned, but a plastic buttstock? Not against the rules whatsoever.  Yet, their poor algorithm doesn’t know the difference. Annoying but not as big of a deal as the VPN.

Also I find it hilarious that they list paintball and airsoft guns as “dangerous items.” Yeah, they might cause a tiny bruise; wouldn’t want that technology to get into the wrong hands would we? Also equally hilarious is that a giant butcher knife is not a dangerous item, but a hunting knife is, as if they stab differently or something. Only someone with the IQ of a brick wall thinks a knife is any less dangerous based on where it’s supposed to be used. Yeah it’s their site and they can do whatever dumb stuff they want, just like I can make fun of them for it.",1
82,"This app is GARBAGE: I first started to use this app so I could resell my stock pile but it’s always something with offer up. I’m apparently violating their community guidelines constantly yet I see other people selling the exact same things. It really doesn’t make sense. I usually get my account back within 24-48 hours. I’m only writing this review today because they gave me my account back however all of my items were deleted. I started to post my items all over again & I put some laundry detergent up, some shampoos & conditioners, makeup (only posted like 6 items). Checked back like 5 hours later I’m banned again. I emailed them & they stated I violated community guidelines & am now banned. They told me they reserve the right to remove items or profiles at its own discretion with or without previous warning or education efforts. Meaning they did no research & just banned me for maybe false reports or what have you. This app is ridiculous. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to recover my account. Selling my stockpile items should not be this difficult. It’s literally just household items. Use this app at your own risk because once you’ve been banned permanently, that’s it. You can’t make another account. Very displeased with this app & I would not recommend.",1
83,WHY OFFERUP WHY? I Gave the platform my all!: I have used this platform for years now! Especially during these tough times with stores being closed and money needed to be made I always stood by it. HOWEVER LATELY HAS BEEN RIDICULOUS. I have always sold authentic items and been a honest seller. My page has been cut off and support is honestly terrible. No way to contact anyone with OFFERUP. No notification on any item or reasoning. HOWEVER if it’s deemed to be fake or unauthentic it’s taken down yet other sellers hundreds of people have fraudulent posts or fake items. A post which was ART was the only post I received a notification for when it has HAND PAINTED BY ME. After these notifications my entire page has been disabled. I have worked hard for my scoring/reputation never doing anyone wrong or Mis-using the platform. YET I CANT EVEN GET A RESPONSE OR EASILY FIND A WAY TO GET TO THE ISSUE. WHY IS THIS EVEN AN ISSUE? Maybe a blessing in disguise seeing that I have recently found other platforms like letgo. So I will give them a try seeing that is the only reason. During these times this is about the worse for this happen to me I had 2-3 sales pending and now I look bad and missed out money when it’s tremendously needed. OfferUp I USED TO LOVE YOU!,2
84,"BAD BUSINESS!!..: HORRIBLE customer service, you can only email and they message you back days later, I’ve been having an issue with getting a payment from them for an item I sold using the proper methods and procedures they list for you to ship items out. First they told me I used my own label and they couldnt pay me because of it (which I didnt, I used the prepaid shipping label they sent me), then they told me it wasnt delivered at all, when I sent them proof from tracking that it had been delivered with THE SAME TRACKING FROM THE LABEL THEY SENT ME..Then one person messaged me saying its confirmed it was received and then someone else messages me saying it wasnt received, when I have the tracking info saying it was delivered and spoke to my customer directly and they confirmed it was delivered and was very happy with their purchase..Then OfferUp cancels my transaction AFTER the sale was final and I’ve been going back and forth with them via email for DAYS, sending screenshots of all my proof, but they’re still telling me I cant get paid. This is ridiculous, I’m removing my profile from the site and I am giving a bad review to ANYBODY who asks me about this app/company!!..they do really bad business, I wouldnt suggest ANYONE to deal with them as far as selling, they’ll take your money so dont do it!!..",1
85,"Bring back Let Go: Since the app Let Go was merged with Offer Up, it is absolutely dreadful. I used Let Go frequently, I was a top shopper and top seller. It was thrifting locally, at its best. I loved it. Since the change this app is drowning in business posts now though and filled with excessive advertisements. The app was ideal when it was neighbor to neighbor sales or neighbor to neighbor give aways, in local areas, not business affiliated. I don’t use a thrifting app to shop at businesses, it defeats the purpose of thrifting. Now on Offer Up posts are rare from locals selling, among the sea of business posts, when they are found the posts for items you are interested in are so far outdated (we’re talking years). When reaching out to sellers now the rate of response is nonexistent. I had hoped once merged these mishaps would be rectified over time and cleaned up but it has remained the same, since the merge. It was a major loss when Let Go changed to Offer Up and overall the experience now compared to what it used to be is very disappointing. I no longer use this app at all sadly, solely as a result of the merge and the changes that came with that. This app needs to be cleaned up and businesses removed. Go back to locals thrifting to locals and keep it cleaned up and current, with active sellers.",1
86,"Waste of time: Offer up used to be a good and solid base for selling items. But since they merged with LetGo, it’s been issue, after issue, with them. I’ve been having many recurring technical problems while trying to sell my items. One day it’s good. Then suddenly.. I can’t post, I can’t see my item on the home page. I don’t get any views, I don’t get any messages coming in, and it doesn’t even alert me when they do come in, causing me to loose the interested buyer most of the time. Lately, I’ve been spending a large amount of my time e-mailing offer up (since you can’t talk to a live person), very often. And then, having to wait a whole business day (during the week, more if it’s a weekend) to get a bogus response. Telling me to try their “different tricks that might work” like, switching from your phone internet to wireless, rebooting your phone, signing in and out of your account, and even deleting and re-installing the application. I’ve done every single thing over, and over again, causing me to waste so much time and money. I wish they would fix their bugs and return to being the quick and easy to use application they used to be. I’m just very disappointed, and exhausted of doing the whole song and dance, just to be able to sell something.",1
87,"Was good now not good: I’d give offer up negative stars if I could.  At one point offer-up was great.  I use to sell on offer-up.  I had fifteen five star ratings.  My Facebook, phone number, email, shipping and billing address were all confirmed, basically four out of five things confirmed.  But then one day I could no longer list an item for sell or message a buyer until I joined ‘TruYou’.  TruYou is not a required thing on offer up.  TruYou is verifying your identity by uploading a drivers license, state ID, or passport.   I do not have an ID at the moment and im aware is something I need to take care of but since the pandemic offices have been closed, have reopened but with a three month wait list to schedule an appointment.  I have friends on offer up and I see other people on offer up who have not confirmed anything and they are selling things.  I contacted support and was told I have to upload a government ID before I can use the site.  Therefore, Offer-Up makes no sense, I have fifteen five star ratings from selling innocent items such as dressers, storage containers, bags, statues, etc., four out of five confirmed things on my profile, get others with nothing confirmed to one or two things confirmed and able to sell and buy so why am I not allowed to.  Joining TruYou is a option.",1
88,"Poor User Interface: App itself is fine. The user interface is what makes me so averse to using this. Swiping left, right, up, and down is difficult and not smooth. I have to swipe so ever slowly and swipe over half the screen in order to achieve the swiping result. This makes browsing difficult, and I find myself quitting the app after browsing 1-2 items maximum. 

Editing the description within the app is also very wonky. Instead of highlighting one word, double tapping highlights the entire paragraph. Dragging the cursor will then highlight the ENTIRE description. Anything that involves highlighting, moving cursor, copying, cutting, pasting, and editing is overall wonky and extremely frustrating. This is why everyone writes few words in the description and call it a day. These poorly editing function makes the quality of all description items poorer than other selling apps such as Poshmark or Mercari.  

The appearance is also a little outdated. Considering that OfferUp is one of the most highly used selling apps on App Store, the user experience is quite unenjoyable. I feel like I mostly post just because I want to sell some of my old items, but don’t use this for actually shopping or browsing.",2
89,"Frustrating experience and expensive promote options: I didn’t have much luck with this app. The browsing experience is painful. Say you want to search for something and there are no listings. It won’t tell you there’s nothing available, instead it throws a bunch of irrelevant results. Even when there is and you prefer to find something that is pick-up only.  The “pick-up only” filter does nothing. It will just give you irrelevant results AND links to things that ship. Wish it could just be flat out honest and say that there are no results AND then give alternatives. And also make the ads more obvious. It feels so deceptive. 

The promote plan is also CRAZY!!!!! expensive. You pay $20 a month to promote ONE (!!!!!!) item. I’ve wasted about $60 trying to sell something in pristine condition, good pictures, reasonable price and nothing. One month I didn’t receive a SINGLE inquiry, yet they took my $20 bucks. I reached out to OfferUp and there was nothing they could do and that I had to take it up with Apple. What a convenient way to divert complaints. There is absolutely no value. I wouldn’t waste my money or time with this app. Considering how many people are poor these days and trying to sell stuff, there is no value whatsoever with their business model.",1
90,"This app is a joke!: I would give this app 0 stars if I could. I reported a listing of the seller named “Gutta” selling iPhones for cheap prices, but yet she stated in her listings (all) that she only accepts cash app or Apple Pay which is against Offer Up’s guidelines. Then I posted a listing of her account and listings warning others not to buy from her so I can prevent people from getting scammed. But here’s what HAPPENS. I get an email from Offer Up 10 min later saying my listing got taken down since it violated their community guidelines but yet they continue to let the scammer (Gutta) keep her listings on for sale still when she says she only accepts cash app or Apple Pay which is a red flag she’s a scammer. If you’re gonna silence someone, at least silence the scammers and not the person trying to prevent others from getting scammed. This app is a complete joke, I see at least 10 scams a day from low life losers like “Gutta” who is pretending to sell iPhones but yet trying to scam people. She even screenshoted some of the pictures from a different listing because you could see the pictures were cropped and I messaged her about it and called her out, and she told me that she was selling the phone for a friend which is a complete lie. DON’T USE THIS APP, the scammers have more rights than the actual honest people on this complete joke app.",1
91,"Worst selling app: Beside worst selling app, they have the worst customer service. When someone purposely report your listings because they must got nothing to do, offerup just deleted your post without reviewing. I constantly have to contact them to review my listings and restored multiple times. After they got all your personal informations, they banned you without explanation, receive no email notification, no warning, no reply, nothing. Don’t waste your time or give out your informations to this app. It’s a scam app!

Update: finally got a response from them that my account was close due to repeatedly posting prohibited items which violate their posting rules. As I mentioned up there my listings constantly were flagged and I contact them which they restored after reviewing it that it’s actually not prohibited items. Well, they surely have poor systems. How can you restored all the listings after reviewed that is not prohibited items and then deleted their account stating that it repeatedly listing prohibited items? 
Don’t waste your time selling stuff in this app, if you don’t accept low balls offer then they can just lie and report all your listings that it is prohibited items and your account will be suspended without them even reviewing if it’s actually prohibited items or not. They have very lazy workers!",1
92,"Too many no-shows: Too many no shows, looky-loos, scammers, bots, trolls, ghosting. I have to wade through 30-40 people who continually ask about availability then disappear without a second thought, just to get to the decent people using the app who actually follow through with their purchase. Those are the buyers who arrive on time at the appointed place ready to buy. There are the people who negotiate a lower price then disappear altogether. Most people on the app treat it like a garage sale where everything should go for $1 or less. Or say they want to buy an item but can’t complete the transaction for two weeks and I’m supposed to hold the item for them until they dane to pick it up. No thanks. I see why so many people would rather throw away their items than to deal with such people. I’m finding it’s not worth it myself to sell. I donated to a charity shop over 1000 items rather than go through such stupidity as I encounter. Let these so called buyers go to a shop and ask an employee to hold something for them for 2 weeks. Let’s see how far they get. Or wait a month after a sale is announced at a store and expect the item they want to still be there and still be on sale. Good luck!",2
93,"Overall Disappointed: I have had an account on OfferUp for a few years now. I had a previous one linked to an old email, but switched it and made a new account because I deleted that old email. That previous account had no issues. However this new account somehow was taken down without warning. The terms of agreement I thought said if I “violate guidelines” then I’d be flagged or something similar. However I randomly got an email saying I “violated guidelines” and therefore my account was deactivated. I emailed asking why or to see what, if any, violations I committed. I was never answered, until a few weeks later I got another email saying I can reopen my account by simply logging back in. Why would OfferUp not send a warning or tell you what/if you violated any guidelines? I haven’t bought any items from anyone on the platform in months, and the only item I was selling was a motorcycle. I feel someone could just simply spam report anyones account, and have them taken off the platform with no reason. You’re much better off just selling on Craigslist. Got my bike sold, and didn’t get my profile taken down on that platform. 10/10 Craigslist 6/10 OfferUp…. Just disappointed",2
94,"Overall a good app, needs some fixing though: My husband and I have had offer up for a few years now, never had an issue selling anything or sending/receiving messages from people who would like to purchase something I posted. For about a year now, I noticed when I message someone I would never get a reply back(both my husband and I have separate accounts) I understand not everyone will write back or is even active on their account anymore, but one time we were trying to purchase a golf cart for us and our kids during the pandemic. We both messaged over 40 people(maybe more) and not ONE people wrote back to either one of us. I contacted the costumer support and they said they fixed it but doesn’t seem like they did. I have posted things up to sell and my normal posts are baby stuff or kid stuff and I normally always get a message from a couple people who are interested. These items have been up for months and no one has messaged me(or I’m not getting the messages at all) they need to fix this issue. It’s almost pointless for me to have this app because of it. It’s going on alittle over a year and nothing.",3
95,"Horrible scammers and developers don’t do anything about them: The concept of the app is good. I’ve been using for years but there are an Enormous amount of Scammers on the app. I report them all repeatedly. I have even contacted support trying to get the scammers off the app because offer up does nothing. I had one scammer just make a new profile every day. Same wording in ad same phone number and same photos. I kept reporting them and Offer up never did do anything.  I have bought several things with buy it now and then just never heard from seller again. Eventually offer refunds the money but still what a hassle. The scammers all want you to pay outside the app and always have a deal to good to be true. Most want cash app. Not sure why that says about cash app. I’ve stopped using it because apparently it’s the money app of choice with scammers. 
I have gotten some really good deal and the things I’ve bought and received have been great. Shame that 80-90% are just scams. Shame that Offer up doesn’t seem to do anything about the scammers. Sooo. Buyer beware obviously. If it seems too good to be true it definitely is. And never pay outside the app no matter what sad story the seller gives.",2
96,"Good but needs improvement: I’ve had the app for a decent amount of time but it has its issues. Recently there’s been a rise in people who ask for payment outside of offerup, which is automatically a red flag since there’s very little a person can do if they pay outside of offerup since the seller can just delete their account if they decide to not send the thing somebody paid for. There’s also a decent amount of people who will post items and never respond when people ask to buy them. It’s not a big issue so much as it is annoying. There’s also price gouging when it comes to certain items. I’ve been trying to buy a used Nintendo switch for a good amount of time and due to the fact that they’ve literally been sold out, people will try to resell them for more than they’re actually worth. Sellers on offerup will set a price of $400 and above for switches which only sell for $300 at an actual store. This practice is actually pretty ridiculous and screws over people who end buying one even though they paid more than it’s even worth. It’s still a good app and there’s still a lot of good items you can find, but the issues I mentioned above should be addressed",3
97,"Inconsistent and not trustworthy: This app looks great. The problem is that it has so much inconsistency in what you can and cannot post that it creates more frustration than satisfaction. I had a post removed that I created based on other posts that were still on and not removed. The first time I emailed the company about it, they told me it was an error and put the post right back on. It was removed yet again by someone else! They don’t seem to know what they’re doing!
As for being untrustworthy: The majority of the people that were contacting me to buy items came from very far away and had every excuse in the book to try to lower the price to something so ridiculous that they were practically getting the item for free! The level of low ballers is significant. At least half the people or more did not show up to buy their products when they said they would (you are probably in better luck if you ship items out). One guy picked up a refrigerator that was working perfectly and, a few hours after he got it home, had the audacity to let me know that it was not working and that he wanted his money back. 
10 to 20% of the people will be respectful and will be a pleasure to deal with. The rest will simply give you a headache. There are much better apps or programs out there.",1
98,"Fundamentals Not Working: I’ve heard good things about Offer Up, and I’ve got some things I want to sell, so I decided to try it out.  I’m sorry to say that my initial impression is not very good; I could not get past Step 1 of my first post.  The application let me select photos from my library, but it won’t actually do anything with them.  When I attempt to move on to Step 2 the application tells me that I must select photos first.  I tried several times and can’t figure out a way to get past that initial screen.  I’ve been told that it does work if you take the picture with the application open, but that’s an ugly solution for me.  I’m selling an elliptical trainer, which is large, heavy, and in a difficult location in the garage.  To get the pictures which I already have on my iPad, I had to wheel it out of the garage, move the car from the driveway, and then move the LARGE trainer to different positions so I could get good pictures.  Then I had to stuff it back into the garage as out-of-the-way as I could.  I’m not inclined to repeat that experience, so Offer Up does me no good.  The ability to add pictures is fundamental when selling on-line.  This sort of problem really is a show stopper.",2
99,"Full of surprises. New version not as good as the old one which allowe for previews.: I have been using Offerup for a couple of years. Beware!
You have to be careful as this app is full of scammers! (Just to give you an example, look under Toyota Tacoma and you will see ads offering the same truck in several US cities asking around $1200, for a much more expensive truck!) The interesting part is that the company behind the app does not seem to care. I have been notifying them about this situation for the past several months and all they do is take down the item, but the scammers are not suspended.
Scammers appear as having a couple of years of being members, etc. with confirmed phones, which point out to a possible inside job. Many now show selling other items like used shoes, lol... several if not many ads, specially on the cars section are extremelly old, ( I saw one the other day from 5 years ago!). Many of them are duplicates, and I have reportes some ads with 2 dozen entries!
Another qwirk is that you try to filter items for local pick up and the filter does not work....!
Perhaps, one star is what they deserve for being disrespectful toward the public they pretend to serve!",2
100,"Minor issue: I’ve been using offerup for 4 years as a means to bring customers to a non-profit thrift store that I manage.  It’s an excellent app for that purpose, better than all the rest.  There is one issue, which I believe, if addressed, will make OfferUp “heads and tales” above the rest, and that’s this:

When I post a large number of items, there’s no easy and quick way to “mark as sold,” or archive a number of items at one time, either on my phone, or on my computer.  In order to archive an item on the computer, it’s actually more time consuming than on my phone.  Right now I have thousands of items I want to archive, and instead of taking a couple of minutes, like it should, it’s going to take me several days.  I believe this can be remedied by having a “checkable” list, in which I can select a number of items at one time, then click an archive or “mark as sold” button, in a similar way that I delete my emails.  I hope this is helpful to the developers.  I will continue to use OffeUp on a daily basis.",5
101,"Garbage Customer Support: The concept is great but when a problem occurs the customer support just snowballs it into far worse problems. My account was hacked and I was able to get it back. I did so in communication with OfferUp support. However, it deleted all of my items for sale and now it lets me list items. But it never actually lists them. After 3 days of having no views on my car listing I had my roommates look for the listing and it’s not there. Every time I try to post an item it send me an email regarding suspicious activity, makes me reset my password, and deletes my listed items! This happened 4 separate times yesterday. I have been in contact with support three times now in two days. They confirmed the account was secure once again but won’t let me go on with selling any items. Absolute garbage customer support. The above issues were a few weeks ago. After multiple days of dealing with the problem with support it was handled. But GUESS WHAT. The account was hacked again and it changed the email address on the account. I have raised numerous concerns with support regarding the security of my account and their response has been to lock me out of my own account and NOW SOMEONE ELSE HAS IT.  Horrible horrible horrible security and support.",1
102,"Geat App, Not So Great Buyers: The app itself is great. The people however, are not so great. I have had multiple people that I have tried to negotiate a price with that think I’m just out of my mind for suggesting a counter offer to their low offers. My profile says I’m willing to negotiate, it doesn’t mean that I am going to just give away something, when I know the value it holds. I have also had several people that I’ve negotiated a price with, or countered a price to finally come to an agreement on and ultimately once we either begin to schedule a time to meet up or agree to sell something for their offer and then they just stop responding. Don’t get me wrong, I have actually sold things through here that went super smoothly. It’s just really irritating that on a bartering app, a lot of people don’t want to barter or that I waste my time/lose other offers by starting a negotiation with one person that can go back and forth over the course of a week+ only to get to the point where I think I’ve made a sale and then the other person just flakes out.",5
103,"I’ve never felt more unsafe selling something online: I’ve sold 2 things on the go without any issue, but after that is I’ve only gotten scammers. There are some people who just want your cash app before meeting,And when you don’t give it to them before you even go to meet up they no longer want whatever you are selling. Cash app is notorious for being easy to hack so that in itself gives off bad vibes. People will make times to meet up with you and never show up and then ask to come to your house instead because their car broke down originally and now they feel bad. Do not believe them. I’ve even had one person who had no prior conversation with me, then continue to text me over and over again that she was at my house and knocking at my door and asking why I wasn’t answering. Never even gave my address and of course there wasn’t anyone knocking at my door but that’s creepy nonetheless. I feel like there’s so many safer options to selling your old things. Call me paranoid but I’ve never had an experience like this on craigslist, Poshmark, or any app similar. I will not be using this out from now on. I’ve never had a reason to write with a review for an app before, until now. But I felt that’s Safety is such a big issue that I had to write one to warn others.",1
104,"Used to love it. Not so much anymore.: After a recent update I stopped being able to access albums in my phone photos. I did all of the things that are coming in the age of technology. Turn it off and back on. Found the help center, looked up technical issues and followed the steps. Afterwards I sent a message per their “if you’ve followed these steps and the problem still remains” type of instructions. I provided a fairly detailed description of what was going on. Phone flashes when I tap the link to search albums along with all of the steps that I’d taken. The “tech support” reply was a cut and paste from the same tech article from the help center. As a business owner I’m already frustrated, I tried to give a very detailed description of my issue and the reply was super generic and unhelpful. I did it so that I could say that I complied. It did not fix anything just like it hadn’t before. So I’ve wasted time. The only other “suggestion” they had was to screenshot the issue. I could screen record it but not screenshot a failed click on a link and a phone that flashes. It happens instantly. Nothing much more to be done. I’m not going to chase my tail. Fix your app glitch please.",2
105,"Saved Items List Need Work!: This is a request that you create a more user friendly interface with the saved items list. For one, they are extremely hard to sort through. I have a list of 3000 quick saved items ( I don’t have time to make special lists for everything I save, that’s not how people want to use the app… too much work!) , if I want to see something far down the list it feels impossible because if I scroll all the way down to see something, after I click it, the app jumps right back to the top of the list, then I have to scroll all the way down again if I want to see something else. I wish there were a search engine within the quick save list so I can search my save list. I’d also like the ability to sort by date I added to saved list or by date the item was listed or by department category or by price. 

And to delete items off the save list is slow and hard to press the tiny delete button and I hate that after I delete one item, it jumps back to the top of the list making it impossible to delete old items. I wish I could delete multiple at a time. 

And I hate the list view! I want it to look like the original listings where I can see a larger picture of the item.",1
106,"Very sad and upset app user!: I have been a user of this app for about three years now. I've made plenty of sales & I have over 172+ 5 star ratings! I love this app to buy and sell. It's amazing ! Up until about 2 weeks ago when I wasn't getting any offers on my items or responses to offers I was sending. It was confusing. I made new accounts thinking it was just my account. I've deleted the app and reinstalled even changed my password & nothing. I've used my husbands IPhone, iPad, home computer and NOTHING! I've sent MULTIPLE messages through their app and website explaining what’s goin on with my account and if they can fix It within the last couple of weeks and haven't gotten any response. I'm a loyal user and I feel this is very unfair as I didn't receive any notice or email that maybe my profile was banned? It's ridiculous I use this app daily to find things I need daily for myself and family and for them to just ban me for no good reason is stupid. I follow the rules and I am friendly when using the app. This is soooooo NOT fair.. :(",5
107,"A suggestion for the next app update!!!: Will the developers please weed out “sold items” from ALL search results and enable an option where you can select to view only “SOLD ITEMS”. And also be able to  type something in the search bar and select ‘search title or heading’ ? Of course for all items but in my situation it is in reference to “FREE ITEMS” often items listed with a “$0” are AUTOMATICALLY  miscategorized under items that are “FREE” and also in the search results lists items that are in fact not free have the word “free” in the item description like, “item is not free”. It would really help filter out other listings and another suggestion is to have the item price listed in one of the bottom corners of the thumbnail for each listing so you don’t have to click each items picture just to see their price. As well when creating a list for people to specifically put in the free category as-well, and for those who have not put a price who’s items aren’t free but want offers, there should also be a section for “Offers”...",5
108,"Great app !: I do both Buying and selling is pretty good sometime i just see what people are selling layout is good run into a few flakes they call them and low ballers but you got to expect that sometimed people are busy or  maybe 
Forget or whatever just exept it and move on.i like the way you can make an offer and ask questions and you can be notified and reply when you can . I would recomend this app .the only thing i wish they had a few other things that might make it evan better ,like when your veiwing all the pictures you have to click on it for a price like if there a bunch of one thing and you want to spend between a certain range or a be able to set distance for  travel, and maybe a view more of the wall catagory's maybe a wanted , or have an biding
System or auction bid on items a place for low ballers lol! Also freebe. Sections and maybe a trading zone to put stuff up for possible trade or have an option to check mark trade or no trade green light or something anyways i could probably thank of 1000 differant things , put its good and havent had any problems maybe sometimes it sits and spins for an internet connection but anyways recomend it !",3
109,"Need help with account!! Support team is horrible!!: I've been an OfferUp user and have ALWAYS had the same email address, account, & account name for years now. Last month in July I received a notification from OfferUp saying my email address is invalid and to update it, which I don't understand why at all. So as I follow the procedure to attempt to update my email address, I'm not receiving any verification message to my email to complete the verification process.
Also, I can't send or receive messages from potential buyers or sellers & every item I have for sell is archived (which I did not do) and I can't unarchive them whatsoever. Having these problems, I emailed OfferUp the exact issues I'm having along with a few screenshots, just for their support team to email me back threatening to permanently close my account if I didn't reference the 'correct' email & account! | emailed OfferUp's support team directly from my email attached to my OfferUp account. I even sent emails of OfferUp emailing me with Nift gift cards for completing deal transactions on the app. I don’t want to change my account email and need help knowing why all of a sudden OfferUp is saying my email address is invalid. I also would like to keep using OfferUp. Can someone please help me?!!",1
110,"Good idea, poor management: This app has potential to be really effective in the reselling/buying market. They do not have a system designed to hold BUYERS accountable for following through on agreed meetup times (which they could do by penalizing buyers by having their accounts banned or frozen after repeat offenses.) 

I have wasted more time, energy and GAS from flakes who do not show up. I have started to use the REPORT feature and.. do you know what you get?? A USELESS automated email with tips from OfferUp telling YOU the SELLER - who showed up - on what YOU should do to get people to SHOW UP on the agreed date/time. You should see the messaging chain where the seller goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to ensure the meet time and agreement is settled on. 

I’ve decided this app has not been worth my time (and I’m hearing others feel the same too) and will just donate my items and delete the app. Oh.. and whatever you do.. do NOT pay to promote your items. It’s a COMPLETE waste of money. I’ve done it several times and your item will delay on showing up on the feed AND you get BARELY any views. I am a professional photographer and know how to market items with lighting etc etc so don’t let the admins of this app gaslight you into making you the problem with your marketing.",1
111,"Could be good: So I am coming back to this app from a time that it was separate from Letgo app. It functioned alright for that time.  I realize there are more complexities to this current platform in order to handle shipping and pro seller member abilities along with safeguards. Unfortunately the application just does not want to work for me when I wish to complete simple tasks like saving an item or asking a question to name the phew big problems. I’ve kept updated versions every time, but keep getting an app error screen when I wish to do anything other than a search query. Makes it unusable. This forces me to use it online which I do not prefer for many reasons. The searches I wish had more filters to cut down the waisted time of clicking on items that I could avoid given there enough initial viewing information or a more details search filter to weed out tons of useless clicks on items that I’m not looking for or are too old. People don’t like writing back I’ve found, so it’s hard enough to use the app anyways if so much energy goes to searching and saving only to never hear from anyone. Makes the app need to be that much better due to the people using it impacts much. Tired of scam items as well, but what you gonna do.",1
112,"Awesome: Most of the time I am very happy with offer up only once did I get a really bad deal and I should have unrolled the carpet but it was in a public parking play area and she assured me that it was in pristine condition and I trusted her because I didn’t wanna enroll a great big living room rug and when I got it home and had green bubble gum all over it, so I learned a tough lesson there and that is to unroll everything and look everything over but I have gotten so many wonderful deals on this site and almost everybody some people I have made angry because I asked them to come down but for the most part, everyone knows that that’s just what you do on this site and usually there are those people who are willing to work with you and it means so much. I am disabled and I live on my Social Security disability and quite honestly when I pay rent I have $40 left and that’s for gas that’s for any other bills, so when I’m able to find someone willing to help, I consider it a blessing from above. thank you offer up!",5
113,"Post Aren’t Getting any views! Help!!: Well, to start OfferUp for me is the best app to buy and sell thing locally in the area. It has helped me make a little extra $$ for things that I don’t use anymore. I love this app a lot, however, just this week I’ve been having this glitch of some sort that what ever I upload a Offer, I get no views. At first I was like “oh, probably there aren’t many people on at this time”, but I left the post on for a while and still have 0 views!! I don’t know what to do and I need help to resolve this problem.

—Update—
Edit: Went to tell my problem with the Email they provided when responding to me. I replied on Monday right away and wrote what was my problem. Once I did that it said it is being reviewed by a support staff in which I was happy. However, it’s been now 5 days since I last heard from them. I have a feeling that they are ignoring my problem in which I feel pretty sad as I want to get back into selling things. OfferUp is a good service overall just pretty sad that my problem isn’t taken seriously.",5
114,"No Comparison with Marketplace: So many things could be done to improve this app. After using Facebook marketplace I hate scrolling through OfferUp.
1. You can’t see the specific location of an item until you go into the listing. Suppose you live in jersey which is within 30 miles of NYC, but don’t want to pay the tolls etc to get into NYC to buy something. I don’t want to have to click on every single listing just to find out it is indeed in NYC!
2. No way to mark an item as “pending”. This would help a ton with those repetitive “is this item available?” messages. 
3. The layout of the listings in the feed makes it hard to determine which ones are ADS that will take you out of the app 🤦🏼‍♀️. Seriously, so annoying.
4. Also I don’t know if anyone else has this issue, but I routinely miss the message notifications. They just don’t feed consistently to my home screen the way they should. It’s very hit and miss and when you’re moving and trying to sell everything it’s crucial to get back to people asap! Now when I have active listings I constantly check the app to see if I’ve missed anything.",3
115,"Love the app but promote plus is scam…: Well, I’ve used this app over and over for months, well the thing is I’ve posted cars on there, something like once every month or two. However, when I first made my account and did the subscription it works just fine, after two months I wasn’t posting anything so I decided to cancel my subscription. After a month when I came back to renew my subscription it took my money and it gave me an “unknown error” so I tried doing everything and nothing would work, I decided to speak with customer service and they told me that they can’t do anything about it and the best thing they can do is give me a free “3 day promote” so I was like that’s ridiculous, I decided to contact Apple and get a refund which thankfully I was able to. However, I thought this was just a small error, after a month I tried to do the same promotion but yet it gave me the same error, so I decided to make a new account from a different phone with a different iCloud account, it works, but as soon as I cancel my subscription that error pops up again when I try to renew it. My review will stay at 1 star until this get fixed, I’ve contacting them multiple times and they still have not fixed this error.",1
116,"Great, but needs improvement: App works well, but I have a few things that really frustrate me. I’ve turned all of my notifications in the app to off, but still get the “new offers!” notification every morning at 8 am. I’d turn the sound off in my phone settings, but want to know as soon as I receive messages from people in the app. Anyhow, I hope that’s fixed at some point, because I have to delete the app when I know I want to sleep in😂.
I’d use the the website for everything, but it won’t let me rate items I’ve bought or sold unless I have the app (also frustrating).
The other big issue I have is no matter what, every time I scroll on the app, if my finger touches an ad it will open a new page for whatever is being sold . I never actually click them though!!! So I end up with 10 pages of pop up windows in my browser when I’m not interested in them at all and then get spammed with advertising on OfferUp because they think I wanted that item. I’m sure OfferUp makes $ on each advertising “click”, so I feel like it’s pretty shady. The app is great otherwise and I’ve used it for buying and selling, but these annoyances put a bad taste in my mouth.",2
117,"Business owners and saved items 👎🏾: I liked the app a lot when I first started using it but then I ran into a few issues that pushed me away. The first issue was that if I saved a item and it was later sold, it would still exist in my list. On top of that, if I wanted to delete it, I had to do so one by one. I feel that either being able to delete multiple items at once or having the option to automatically remove saved items if they are sold, would be a major improvement. My second issue is business owners, usually if I am on the app looking for something I’m not trying to go to a store to buy it and pay taxes. That being said, I feel we should have the option to hide posts from businesses like furniture or appliance stores or at least limit the amount of posts they have. If you do a search right now for couches in the Round Rock, Texas area you will be flooded with post from local businesses and the same pictures over and over. This gets old really quick and honestly is the reason I stopped using offer up all together. Just a few suggestions/comments.",3
118,"Annoyed by the display of the pictures: While I browse, I see a decent picture in the lineup, but when I click on it to view the details and a picture gets bigger, the picture on the details page gets cut off really bad, forcing me to click on the picture again to see the full picture. And it is annoying how there are no simple ways to leave the full size view of the pic: you I can’t do a simple slide down to force it down, I have to do more work than the natural slide of my thumb (while browsing on iPad at least). Another inconvenience I experience is not being able to swipe to go back to leave the details page of a specific item. Literally every other app allows the simple swipe from left to go back, but this app I have to actually go and press the back arrow on the top left of the page (again, primarily an inconvenience being on big iPad where my range of motion is limited while I am in a comfortable position). 

I haven’t bought anything on this specific app yet, but assuming it is good since I had used LetGo before the merger. I just would like easier browsing abilities please!",3
119,"Useless unless you pay.: This app is useless u less you are willing to shell out money every month for their “premium” service. For the average person who just wants to sell some of their stuff once in a while, your posting will never see the light of day. It gives you the option of “boost” your post which really just seems to be a fancy way of saying “we will absolutely bury your post so no one sees it unless you pay us money…”

I used this app to try and sell a bass guitar and a few nice knives that I never used. I didn’t want to pay them because it’s not like I am selling stuff all the time or run an e-store or something, so I just used the free account. In 2 weeks, one of my posts got ZERO views. Not only that, but when I would try and search for my post, it was nowhere to be found. The bass guitar post got the most views, but it was less than 50 views in over 2 weeks. They seriously hamstring your listings if you choose to not give them extra money to “boost” your stuff. Not to mention, when you search for things, the only posts you can really see are “boosted” listings. So everyone is on here just spending money to list their stuff. Such a waste and not worth it at all. I’ll just stick to craigslist.",1
120,"Solid App - Get Ready for Takeover/Buyout time: We will all miss each other soon enough when we will tell stories of how we all met by selling a dusty pile of baseball cards to this person, or how we found some furniture in front of a neighbors house and sold it to a person (now my friend) on OfferUp for a 500% ROI. Yup, the old days are still here people… I mean, this app freezes at least 10 times per day on my pixel 7 pro and boots me right off. But I know that it’s not just me this is happening to. It’s everyone! And it’s fun! It’s a great app! The mgmt team for OfferUp does a great job vetting out the crooks and the dark nights from infiltrating is good folk. So, I will miss you all when this turns into an Instagram. Just wait….by the way this is just my guess I do not have nor do I know any person that is hired or even let alone I don’t know anyone remotely qualified to do the job that these nerds do behind these apps. I love all of them though! Okay well, offer sells for 10billion! Hahah just kidding totally joking.",5
121,"The app has been ruined: Offer up has been ruined by the the developers incessant push for you to spend on premium. I understand they can't run it for free but that's what the ads were for, or so I thought. Never mind that they make it so that you ""accidentally"" click on the ads when you're scrolling, never mind that they introduced ads that play in the middle of you looking at a post, and never mind the ads that are made to look like genuine posts but are just an ad in disguise, no. I also understand that people constantly selling locally and making a profit should pay for the service of the app, I get all of that. It's me, the person trying to buy the item, why should I have to pay for premium, why is it that I send a message and have no reply a week later when I see that the person has been active within the last day or even hour. The buyer, we're the ones giving your platform its value and you went and ruined that user experience that makes me leave to mercari or just buy retail all together. You guys clearly don't know your base and there will be another app that comes along and replaces you just like you came along and replaced Craigslist, until then, this app will be useless.",1
122,"Sellers Beware: To all the people who plan on selling items on OfferUp. OfferUp fails to provide accessible guidelines within their selling prompts when you’re attempting to post an item for sale. Please be aware that they have the power to “Shadow Ban” you from selling anything on their app. Their erroneous algorithm will pick up key words that it does not like and will “shadow ban” you from selling any items. “Shadow banning” is when OfferUp algorithm decides that it doesn’t like you, so it secretly hides your sale items. If you notice your item’s performance drops off to zero views, you have been “shadow banned”. 

I went through every prompt through the posting process to see if I missed anything. I DID NOT MISS ANYTHING. OfferUp fails to provide any links or terms regarding their posting guidelines.
Ultimately, they’re setting up sellers for failure.
I’ve seen many other people talk about how they built their 5 star sellers profile, only to be banned by the algorithm… PLEASE BE AWARE before you began selling here… VERY POOR customer service as well…. No contact phone numbers… smart of them, as I’m sure they’d be overwhelmed by dissatisfied customers… by only using ticket system disputes, they are able to provide cookie cutter responses to all dissatisfied users…",1
123,"From 5 Stars Letgo App to this 1 Star Junk: Before offerup, I used to use Letgo for a couple years. It was the best app out there in my opinion. I used to sell things with little to no having to promote my stuff. Now, this new OfferUp is nothing but junk and a corrupted app. If you’re not willing to “promote” your stuff and pay extra, forget about selling something. Not only this app is getting money from their users by bombarding us with ads on their system, but also they will shadow ban your stuff and hide them from the public if you did not promote them. Ok, let’s say they don’t hide your stuff but they’re barely showing them to the public if not, not at all. All business here. Like I said before, are used to sell many things on let’s go but ever since this wish to offer up I haven’t sold a thing and we’re talking about a few months now. I made sure to communicate this to Customer Service and the only response I had was “thank you for your feedback.” These people don’t care about its users, they only care about the money you will pay to them by promoting your stuff. And even if you promote your stuff you’re well not guaranteed that you’re not going to sell them. So it’s a win-win for them. Such a corrupted app.",1
124,"There needs to be more of a closer check on those who have accounts.: I liked it when OfferUp and LetGo were 2 separate Apps. But they had a problem in common, that still plagues Offer Up. People who create Accounts, but don’t monitor them when they list an Item For Sale. I had looked into some items before they APPS merged, and after it just became OfferUp. This is a Red Flag for People running a scam, And I think you so be more vigilant with these accounts. Now, granted; this might be 10% of those who sign up But it made me go to your competitors for the items I was looking for. The People with legitimate accounts that I have bought from, were great People and I had no problems with them, except for one. He had listed a car last February 2020, and I bought it, but he didn’t leave a review of me; and I was unable to review him. And yes, this was on the OfferUp APP. Other than that, I do enjoy OfferUp; and have recommended it to others. That is why I rated 3 Stars because of some People not responding back, and possible scam.",5
125,"Serious technical flaws: I’ve had my account “locked” several times, with no warning, no explanation, and no way of knowing something was wrong! I would simply stop getting responses from people. All messages show “delivered”, yet no one was responding. The first time this happened I finally reached out to their tech support, and all I got was “It appears a technical issue caused your account to enter a locked state. We’ve made some changes that have resolved the issue.”  But still no progress, finally after multiple days of back and forth they fixed the issue and I could message people again. Then, out of the blue, after having multiple threads with sellers, complete silence again. Nothing at all in the app indicating there’s a problem, no email explaining to me there’s a problem, seemingly all ok, but no responses. I finally got ahold of tech support again and yet again, no explanation other than “It appears a technical issue caused your account to enter a locked state. We’ve made some changes that have resolved the issue.” It’s shocking that an app this widely used is so terrible at the basics. I finally got fed up and listed everything on Facebook, where I’m selling my items fast without any issues.",1
126,"Deletes Account without Cause or Notice: Absolutely useless. I was looking for LetGo, which I had heard about from a friend, and found that LetGo had become OfferUp. I downloaded the app about 3 days ago, and was initially pleased with the interface and setup of the app. I perused listed merchandise, like you do, mostly just looking but I was prepared to jump on a good deal if I saw one, although I noticed many listings were months or even years old. Yesterday, the app gave an error message on startup, saying something went wrong and to log out and log back in. I logged out as suggested, but when I tried to log in, it told me my account had been “deactivated for violating community standards.” I’ve neither bought nor sold anything, nor messaged anyone through the app or my account. I took a few minutes to look up the problem online and see if anyone else had had similar trouble, and I found I was not alone in my frustration and that other folks who had had a functioning account for years with no issues were suddenly deactivated with the same message as mine. Idk if anyone should even bother fixing this rather than simply scrapping the entire thing and starting from scratch. 00/10 not worth your time.",1
127,"Good App, Some Features Need Improvement: I love the service and variety that OfferUp provides. I have bought many many different items through this app. There are a couple of things that should be improved: first, the updates for the app are too sparingly provided (most of the time I have to open the app to be notified about new items in my saved searches and the shipping prices are not currently updated to post office required prices so I have had two purchases cancelled by sellers due to wrong shipping prices on the app). Second, there should be a way for buyers to cancel a purchase, and currently there is no recourse for a buyer who may struggle with getting responses from a seller (I speak from experience where a couple of times an item was marked as shipped by the seller and the item actually hadn’t been physically mailed nor could I get ahold of the seller. Instead I had to wait for OfferUp or the seller to cancel the order). Last, I wish there was more monitoring of the app because I have seen numerous inappropriate or suspicious posts weekly (and I report them whenever possible, however it takes time for them to be taken down).",3
128,"Customer service can be better.: The app is a little clunky to use as a buyer or a seller. Once you’ve searched for something, it’ll send you notifications for similar items for months later without permission. 
The 1 star is because their customer service experience is horrible. I tried to post a tv (and I’ve posted tvs in the past) for a local sale and they rejected my listing, and with the rejection sent me a vague set of listing guidelines that the tv didn’t fall under. I emailed their customer service with a full copy of the listing and asked them why it was rejected and what I should change to be able to repost it, and they responded by terminating my account. 
I didn’t realize my account was terminated until the next day when I couldn’t log in, got the password successfully reset, and after logging in there was a pop up notifying me the account no longer existed. The corresponding email I finally found said that the account was terminated because the tv listing didn’t follow their guidelines. BUT! The listing was never live because the app rejected it, and I reached out to their team for support. Instead of support, they’ve got me posting on Facebook/next door marketplaces and Craigslist instead.",1
129,"Crap App: offerup used to be good back in the beginning when they had something to prove, now they're just another crap app that will eventually fade off into the sunset just like letgo. I used this app for several years and built up nearly 100 perfect 5 star ratings because I always put others first in every purchase and buying transaction I made on this app. I forgot that i had set up my account as dual authentication and ended up changing phone numbers because of a crazy chick that was stocking me and then when i tried to log into my offerup account on the new ph. it blocked me out of the account. Have tried contacting offerup via multiple online sources and have always been met with a deaf ear. So disappointed to know that a multi-billion dollar app doesn't in any way care about their customers. I guess this does however open up a great opportunity for app developers who want to get rich by putting their customers first. Just build a similar app and then actually respond to your customers in a genuine way that helps them to resolve their issues. I've pretty much made the decision to push these kind of reviews out to multiple sources including many app developer forums until someone else launches a better app, which shouldn't be long.",1
130,Old listings: Offer Up drives me crazy! I like it but 2 things are in need of modefication ! 1st delete all those old listings! I go an look at something I’m interested in and then I see it was offered 2 yrs ago or 5 yrs ago! Now who is gong to still have that thing from that long ago and chances are they have forgotten it or they never check in with offer up anymore. - #2 put the price listing on the outside of the item being  offered. It drives me crazy when I look at something I like and I have to open it to to get the price… then discover it’s way too expensive for me! So yah get the prices listed on top so a buyer  doesn’t have to waste precious time! And last but not least I don’t know about other platforms or devices but with Apple iPhone the back arrow takes someone back to very beginning of the search and then you have to start scrolling over again to get back down the list to where you left off. That’s a real drag! Other than that it’s a pretty cool site with lots of unique neat items no one else has.,4
131,"12.9% Seller Fees!: This app is simple Which I do like. Much better than Craigslist. But when you  have a buyer who makes a purchase that requires shipping, and they insist on paying through the Offer Up method of payment, beware that your funds will be held much much longer then what they claim.  I sold watches on February 03, 2022. I shipped them off the very next day. The buyer received it on February 7th. You must wait 2 days until after the buyer receives it before Offer Up releases the payment. But wait just because they say 2 days they really mean much much longer. 2 days go by, no status of payment processing just says pending. On the 14th it says payment has been sent to your bank. But the date is forwarded to 16th since it’s the weekend. It’s now the 17th I check my bank no payment. I check offer up it says the bank will receive payment on the 18th. Well ok so I’m thinking one more day. NO! They say bank will take up to 4-5 days to process payment on their end! On top of this they take 12.9% of sale. So from now on , I tell buyers that if I have to ship, it will only be thru PayPal, or Venmo.",3
132,"It’s so bad I had to write a review: I never write reviews for anything, shopping or apps because usually it’s not that bad but this latest update is so atrocious I just had to. The app is now clunky and difficult to navigate. To get to any category or to look at my saved items it’s multiple steps and too much effort to search for the simplest of things. I don’t want a broad category to be broken down even further, for instance if I’m looking in toys/games I don’t care to narrow it down even further & take even more steps to just get to the category. There’s no free section which is awful, especially with covid you’d think they would want to make free items more accessible for people instead of harder to find. The settings don’t stay saved, every time I go into the app it puts my distance further away and always allows the setting for items to be shipped to me. This is not what I previously had set so it’s just ignoring my own profile settings! I used to use the app every day, multiple times a day but will now be deleting and going back to Craigslist. I’m extremely disappointed that the OfferUp team would have ever put this out as a legitimate update as it seems like it should be a school project for a 13 year old on how to make an app!",1
133,"Disappointed with customer support: First of all if I can give offer up zero stars I would. I recently joined offer up roughly two weeks ago and not even a day in my account was banned. I was excited because I finally was in the process of selling an item and after making arrangements with the buyer I was waiting for the final details so we can meet up, I suddenly stopped receiving messages. The items I posted on offer up were no longer there so I signed out of my account thinking it was a glitch. I tried signing back in, but it said “logged out” whenever i would input my login information. I contacted customer support through twitter and after waiting 5 hours my account was up and running, but everything I had once uploaded was gone. Frustrated of having to upload everything all over again I went ahead and just went on with it. A week later the exact same thing happened again everything I put up for sale was gone. I tried contacting offer up customer support again and up to this day I have no heard anything back from them!! I don’t know what in the world I’m doing that offer up would just ban me from doing business on their app. It’s frustrating that I can’t get a reply back from them at all..",1
134,"Works but need improvement: It’s an online marketplace and it does the necessary things to be such. Issues I’ve found with it seem to be that there’s no way to set the only notification you receive as messages. I constantly get these stupid “we found related items for you” alerts in my inbox that I couldn’t care less about. The red notification icon on the app doesn’t go away either unless you go in the app, obviously this is a way to get people to come back to the app and view ads. Of course, this is a scummy tactic, but companies are going to do what is good for shareholders so screw the consumer. Additionally, the shipping options are so limited, I don’t even bother to offer shipping on my items. I know it’s not a limitation of shipping services because eBay and Facebook Marketplace have no issue in that regard (obviously they have other problems, but less so than OfferUp). Like any online marketplace, a fee will be charged for certain purchases. I would be perfectly happy with it on shipping orders if I was able to put in the actual dimensions or weight, but I’m not and the five or so preset options can’t possibly work for every item.",2
135,Greedy sales platform: They take nearly 13% + they try to do whatever they can to nickel and dime their customers. They have a max monthly post limit and + they constantly have data reporting issues (issues when trying to see how many views your items get) . Their sales rules are strict and they try to get every penny from their sellers and offer no incentives for top sellers. At one point I had a massive account and then my account was banned with no reasonable explanation. They allow you to gain followers but no way for you to communicate with those followers. (No option to post stories etc). Honestly glad to be off this platform as it is visibly sinking and cannot compete with other apps such as Poshmark and mercari. Plus most of the customers just low ball or scam with crappy goods and their seller protection is not good at all. Save your time and start an account elsewhere. They don’t even listen to feedback from their top sellers. At some point I had over 5k sales and 5k followers. Any suggestions you have for them just gets ignored. It’s a shame because this app was the top years ago. Sad to see it ruined by corporate greed and I’m assuming lack of experience from leadership within the organization.,1
136,"Offer up review: It’s a great idea, love having it on my smart phone. I can receive messages without having to be tied down. Unfortunately many of folks who make offers are low ball offers. Usually 20-50% of asking price. I sell 5 items elsewhere for each one on Offer Up. 
I’ve been a member since 2013. But when I changed my email address had to start over. Offer Up doesn’t allow transfers from one address to a new address. So all my positive buying l/selling history is gone and I look like a new untested member. The program is easy to load up the first time only. If you want to edit the ad you must update or add photos. The program holds photos from other ads. Then must delete all pics to add correct pics again. 

I’ve suggested to staff at Offer Up to have an automatic ad expiration date. So many ads I reply to are very old and get no reply. The item was sold or owner gave up trying but doesn’t delete the ad. 
Just tried to send my review you asked for. I must enter a nick name. I put in my handle Irish Mike. Program tells me it’s already taken pick another.",4
137,"Great when things go well: The concept of OfferUp is amazing & when a transaction works out, I can’t say enough positive things about the experience. 
Unfortunately there are many people selling on OfferUp who apparently don’t understand nor do they practice simple rules of etiquette. I think there’s a huge problem with sellers not being timely in their responses to buyers & sellers don’t mark their items sold. 
I’ve had many unfortunate experiences where a definite agreement has been reached with a seller & actually been on my way to the agreed upon meeting place, only to find it’s been sold before I could get there! 
There’s also a huge issue with potential buyers not showing up to buy what they’ve agreed upon. This is so unbelievably inconsiderate & rude! Is this what our society has come to?
I don’t know what can be done by OfferUp in response to these issues-there are many of us who feel extremely frustrated & are starting to report people. It makes one hesitate to keep using this service, which could be so amazing!",5
138,"Getting to full of scammers: I used to be able to find all kinds of good things on here. But offerup appears to have stopped policing their users. There’s one user in specific: “the phone guys lacey“ who has posted thousands and thousands of items for every kind of electronics phones, tablets, watches, headphones, almost anything electronic. But it is so clear from the offering that nobody could have all of these devices. These have to be just never taking down old items or always re-posting old pictures with new descriptions. they just tell you “what are you interested in? We have everything“ in other words. They are just using OfferUp as an inexpensive advertising platform.

 it has made it so I could just can’t find anything anymore on the app. This is a stupid simple thing to fix offer up just limit the total number of items to like 50 maybe 100 that people can post I tried scrolling down to the end of all the items that this user has, and after 30 minutes, I gave up, my hand was cramped. You’re letting one user completely ruin the experience for all other people searching or selling in this area.",2
139,"Best app, worst service.: That’s how I would summarize this application. I have tried letgo, Mercari, 5miles, you name it, I have tried. This is by far the easiest to use and the one I get to sell or buy things the easiest. I plainly love it.
However, the customer service is non existent, you better not run into any issues with the app or you are on your own. I have seen the developer reply here to other reviews to email them, i have done so, it never works. I even went to the extent of creating a twitter account to reach them on social media, which I got an answer from, but it was only to be told I was being forwarded to customer service and that was that, no more replies from Rob or Nicole or Santa. I have been unable to use the offerup for a month and a half, that is ridiculous! I have 120 5 star ratings and I have tried using family members accounts and they stopped working too. We have tried also creating support tickets from their accounts, and it is unbelievable the lack of professionalism. I cannot believe apple allows applications without proper customer service to be ran under them. 
Hence my 2 star rating, this offerup due to its poor customer service is simply put should not be allowed in the apple store, is not up to apple standards.",1
140,"Revert back to previous version, new UI is getting worse: Revert back to the previous version with the notifications button next to the inbox and no job listings. I started using offerup to get away to all the clutter of Craigslist. 

The notifications button was moved to the far upper right corner of the app, why? I toggle between my inbox and notification constantly. Terrible UI change. 

Another terrible UI change is putting the “jobs” button next to the for sale button. I can’t count how many times I’ve unknowingly tapped the jobs button while looking for sale items. It’s very frustrating to see listings of job and not the for sale items I’m looking for. 

Also, why isn’t there a “save previous settings” feature? It’s ridiculous how I need to re-input my search parameters almost everytime I relaunch the app. Why do I need to keep setting back to “local” and why does it keep resetting my distance parameters?! Again, very annoying.

In addition, the “x” button to clear the search field doesn’t not work! Please fix and don’t do what Craigslist did by removing the “x” that pops up if you want to clear a search query. No one has the patients to wait for the delete button to remove autocorrect typos letter by letter one at a time. That’s just inefficient. 

I began using offerup years ago because it was a simple and clean app that had a better UI than Craigslist. Every update seems to be inching closer to Craigslist.",5
141,"Ok to sell locally, zero support so shipping nationwide is a problem: Its ok to post locally and depending on your locality (how many people live in 30 miles radius etc) expect to sell some things reasonably quickly. Customer support takes well over 60 hours to reach (all channels - app, email, twitter, same result). Shipping nationwide is a whole new problem - they send you label and if postage is off even by a cent as you will find out at the post office you have to cancel a sale and negotiate new postage. If you pay for shipping at the post office and get a new label then OfferUp system does not have new tracking number so they consider item unshipped and cancel the sale and return money to the buyer even if the buyer already received the item and since customer service in unreachable you sent a free gift to someone. I would not recommend using nationwide shipping especially for something expensive since you are completely at the mercy of a buyer no matter now many “reviews” this buyer has and absolutely zero support from OfferUp.
OfferUp support states that in this case you deal with buyer directly once transaction was cancelled to see if you can get paid directly for the item you already shipped. Sellers beware.",1
142,"Enter at your own risk!: I want to start off by saying that this app has and always will be one of the worst second hand/trading apps on the App Store. Secondly, the fact that they bought letgo and didn’t take any of the queues from them to make a better app goes a long way to show the laziness of the developers. Thirdly, the amount of scammers who will flood every single category with the same listing, that lets be honest, are all scams,, is absolutely ridiculous. It makes looking for anything you want to find an absolute chore because you have to sift through hundreds of completely unrelated adds. Not to mention that there are hundreds of ads that aren’t even people trying to sell things, these are companies that pay for listings on this app to get you to buy their ridiculous products at ridiculous prices. Yet another lapse of judgement and detriment to the characters of the developers. All in all, this app is a no go and a dud with so little to actually gain from it that its just a loss. This app is a huge money grab, has no maintenance, thousands of scammers and scams from the developers themselves, and not worth your time. I would shop of Craigslist before I ever used this app again.",2
143,"Bad bad if you’re a seller okay if you just buy: Like the title says; I wouldn’t recommend selling on here. I’ve used ebay, depop and poshmark primarily decided to list a few items on here. Anything that’s face to face is usually a good encounter, but prepare for the constant messaging “is this still available” or “ I want to buy this” then hearing no response ever again. Then you get people wanting you to take 30$ off plus change the shipping option. Nice, eh? Finally you get the people Who actually buy items but then don’t read the description or title or even look at the photos and decide they want a refund. You already have to wait up to 10 days for them to receive and they have 2 days to “inspect”. Any issue or claim filed will always go in the buyers favor. I know people say that abou PayPal but I’ve had a few cases on PayPal where they’ve gone in my favor as a seller plus PayPal at least allows you to submit evidence. OfferUp doesn’t and only goes on the buyers words period. It’s frustration, not worth it and they take 12.9% where places like I mentioned (ebay depop poshmark) take only 10%. Will never use OfferUp again to sell and probably only to buy if it’s something incredibly specific. Work on your customer service please, OfferUp.",1
144,"Doesn’t post my items Shawdowbans listings: Every time I use this app to sale something you get idiots that like to leave you on play, meaning they will say they would like to buy something but then don’t message back or, show up to the place to meet up! That’s not the only issue I have had a problem with one other user on OfferUp that we know each other and don’t like one another so she finds stupidly annoying reasons to report my listings, aka if I accidentally put a item that I listed the other seller that has stocked me will report my listing and I then have to reach out to OfferUp customer service support and, report her. OfferUp also shadow bans items or, there app has been really glitches lately. Overall this app I would give more stars if the customer service was better and more easily available to fix issues with other sellers and able to address stockers that create problems and, issues. If you’re trying to make a living saleing stuff this app isn’t the place as you will feel me out people think they can get items for free or, pay little to nothing for your items you’re selling. You’re better off using eBay, Mercari, de pop Poshmark. Overall a F- I give this app!",1
145,"Great app, but sooo many ads: I want to say that after COVID, they added so many ads. I get that OfferUp is a business and they need to make a profit by selling ads, but I think they’ve added way too many. It almost seems like they want to force you to purchase the premium subscription, which is a whole other issue as well. You’re paying $7.99 for what? I don’t see how anyone would sign up for that if they are selling a few things from their garage. I would say most of the users on the app are looking for a deal and the almost $100 yearly price for premium subscription defeats the purpose. $7.99 would be beneficial for someone who owned a business and would have extra benefits such as analytics. If the app offered a more reasonable price such a .99 for an ad free experience, that’s something I’d definitely consider. On another note most of the ads look like postings, so it just shows how the developers are keeping the ad clients in mind by click baiting the user and ruining the customers experience. Other than that, I think everything else about the app is awesome.",3
146,Nice way to sale and buy thing: I been using this app for about a year or so and I like it . I got it to sell my stuff I don’t use but it seem I been buying more then selling funny right. Anyways the only issue I have with this app is when I’m trying to sell my airsoft rifle battery-operated it keeps on taking it down something about not meeting guidelines did it several times already and it keeps on taking it down.   I described as that airsoft battery operated Toy  seems like other people I talk to who used the app is having the same issue maybe if you guys fix that that be great. Also ask if you guys could put a feature on the app if you sell something and the customer wants return it and if you choose to agree on return with  if you guys could put a button saying that item is back on the market due to whatever whatever I’ll be great. Setting within those lines this happened to me three months ago I have no problem taking a bag because the part and fit. Thanks so far it a great app,5
147,"Beware of scammers: My first and only purchase on OfferUp turned out to be for an item that never existed and I never got. I purchased a woodworking router from what I thought was an American seller. I didn’t find out the seller was actually in China until after I paid for the item and could finally see where it was supposed to be shipped from. Long story short, it was all a scam. I received a cheap little plastic trinket in a small envelope from China a few weeks later. No router ever showed up. The trinket did, however, generate a tracking number which the seller deliberately did not send to me. That tracking number was later used to deny my claim when I initiated a case with PayPal. I am in the middle of appealing that case now, but my fight is made that much more difficult because PayPal requested a screenshot of the item listing on the site from which it was purchased. Guess what, though, it’s nowhere to be found in my offerup account. Even the notifications I was sent regarding that purchase have disappeared. Why? Luckily, I think I still have the envelope with the tracking number on it. If I can’t find it, however, I lose for trusting this site. That’s money I could really, really, really use right now.",1
148,"How does this have 5stars: I’m not sure how other people are using this app.  When I post items no matter what I post for no matter what price it remains at 0 views. I tried updating app and now j can’t log back in and the reset password link is not working, I have run into so many glitches on 1 app before. A was trying to buy before I got logged off and I have sent 30 or more messages and get zero replies I don’t think my messages are even going th erough, Letgo was a much better platform in my opinion, i wish they merged off of the letgo platform instead of the other way around.  I have got a reply to this bad review I posted but it only offers a link to offer up FAQ “fast fixes to common issues” but to answer the question asked, # 1 Instead saying can’t add device because number is linked to another then give the option to unlink that account or log into it, and I link it so since I have a new phone with the same number I don’t have to loose my whole profile, #2 have some sort of help and support other than your worthless FAQ that helped nobody hire a person or 2 to sort through the emails of peoples problems, your automated response doesn’t do any good. And put a link or something for customer care somewhere on the app",1
149,"A step up from letgo, but still amateur: Have tried to sell with this app for a few months now. It’s fairly amateurish, even the dumb company tag line says it all. Simple. Not to hate, but I feel like everyone who contacts me is either a bit or simple. The easy base level communication secures zero level of trust, because 99% of the people on here click the dumb canned responses like “is this item still available?” Uh, yeah, it is... it’s a posted ad, right? This system encourages people to use the bare minimum amount of communication, so you are really taking a risk of meeting up with a scammer or someone unsafe. Even craigslist is better, at least people need to type an email there, and if they sound like a degenerate you just ignore the message. Here, that is the default. Short robotic messages and you are supposed to just meet this person in the hopes of selling a toaster for $10. Also most people are too lazy to post a description for items for sale, so a lot of items are blurry photos with unhelpful titles and no info. The app is so lame you can’t even delete messages, just the option to “hide”. This and Letgo are awful, unfortunately eBay and Craigslist are still the best.",2
150,"A few changes for 5 stars: My only complaints are these: the search radius, and old listings.
I live at the end of a peninsula. A listing that is 20 miles away in the search radius can take me over 2 hours to get to because I’m separated by a body of water and no bridges for several 10s of miles. Or I could drive all the way up the peninsula and around the channel of water which is just as crazy time wise. It would be FANTASTIC if you can draw your search area on a map like you can with Redfin or Zillow. 
I’ve come across listings from 2 years ago. The sellers of those items never get back to you because the item is long gone and/or they may not even use OfferUp anymore. Maybe OfferUp could implement a user required monthly renewal of items that are marked as still unsold. NOT DELETED! Just UNLISTED so it can be reposted without making the whole thing over again. If it’s not renewed at then end of 30 days it’s delisted until the person goes in and renews it. Something like that. 
Otherwise, I love OfferUp. Thank you!",4
151,"Customer service response time is VERY slow: Several months ago I upgraded to the monthly promotion plan. I couldn’t get it to upgrade items I listed. I contacted customer service via email. It took a week for them to respond. By then I had gotten frustrated and cancelled the subscription. Foolishly, I decided to give it another go, because I wanted to promote a couple items. I’m still having trouble, so I emailed again. This time I got an auto response telling me to effectively reboot the phone and reinstall the app. That didn’t work, so as instructed by the email I responded that it didn’t work and provided screenshots. It’s been two days and I have yet to hear back from customer service. Because I reactivated a subscription, they have my $20 and I’m not able to use the service. The best I can do is cancel the subscription and keep it from renewing next month. As long as you don’t buy the promote subscription the app works as expected. Two stars, because the app works well, but only two, because the subscription feels like a scam. 

Update, it’s now been 3 business days since my email to CS and still no response.",2
152,"Almost Good: This seems like a really good app. The one problem I’ve found is it’s only for people in cities. For some reason the way you select distance makes it not usable for rural folks like me. You can choose your location but it only allows 5, 10, 20, or 30 miles. Then it goes to maximum. Well, 30 miles won’t even cover the nearest town for me. Maximum gives me results from 3000 miles away. There should be more choices or a box to enter the miles you want. I can’t shop with it like it is so I have to go elsewhere. I think a large part of the US will be having this same problem.

I guess I should also mention that most of the items I looked at were years old. No one ever responded to any which makes sense. The website has much more functionality than the app for searching. On neither did I see a way to sort by distance or time. I’m at a loss for how to find something that’s actually still for sale on here. Maybe this is a dead app I just happened to find? I have shopped with letgo before which seems to be the same company now.",3
153,"Horrible App: The people that work for Offer Up banned me for something I didn’t even do. When I went to post some shoes on the app I received a good amount of people’s interested in shoes. I met up with this particular guy in a different city not to far from where I live. When I went to his general location or his city we exchanged where he wanted to meet up. As I arrived I could see that there was no car in the parking lot which was odd because he told me that he was already at the location of the meet up spot. I began to text him thru the app and he never responded, as I waited 15 minutes I still had not got an answer from him. I assumed he had pranked me so I just left the stop and went back home. The next day when I went to check the offer up app I saw that I had got banned for some reason. But I know for a fact that he had to be that guy because I hadn’t done any deliveries of pickups for the past month and that one my first post since last month. I try to contact offer up support but they said they couldn’t do nothing about it and that I would have deal with it. 

This app doesn’t care about its fellow users at all 
Sincerely offer up hater now because of what happened",1
154,Their 0 tolerance misread a sale:( No customer service is a major negative!: My hubby and I used our collective accounts to help ship a book to an out of state family member. My husband thought it would be easier to enter her credit card info (per her permission of course) she gave us onto his account to make things easier than helping her set up an account of her own over the phone. So we thought😤 I accepted the offer he sent me for the book… and when I went to print the label it wasn’t there because we had both been BANNED from using offerup ever again! I had over 1000 ratings and 5 ⭐️’s and almost 400 followers that had taken me around 8 years of my life to accumulate😭 This was extra income for us that we needed and it was whisked away and no customer service to call. We’ve sent numerous emails and an automated response followed about having a zero tolerance for ? Not sure what they are thinking we did but it was very innocent on our part. We didn’t put as much thought into it as we probably should have but we tried to rush the purchase due to it being a birthday gift item. Not sure what else I can do but cry.,2
155,"Extortion Practices: I’ve really enjoyed OfferUp for YEARS until recently… someone messaged me wanting to buy an item I had listed and I immediately got an email from OfferUp stating that all of my items were archived by them and this could only be reversed once I provided my cell phone number (I confirmed the email was truly from OfferUp… also confirmed this in the app as all my items were archived, I couldn’t send ANY messages and a pop-up would appear requiring me to verify my phone number). I contacted OfferUp and was told that it’s so buyers can feel safe. First, I was never forced to provide this info when I posted my items about a month prior; only once someone wanted to buy an item. Second, I’ve been using OfferUp for years and have a verified email that’s worked fine for dozens of buyers. Third, if someone doesn’t feel comfortable buying from me cuz I don’t have a verified phone number then they don’t have to buy from me. OfferUp NEVER answered my question about where this requirement is in their Terms of Service, though I clearly asked them twice about this. Deleting the app and using other services from here on out.",2
156,"Sale Items Not Visible Unless you Pay to Promote: I posted 2 items successfully and a friend was interested so I gave her the title I used to post the items so she could look it up & view the pics. She tried to search by the Title I used and then by the Title & pickup location. She couldn't find either listing.
I figured it was a mistake so my husband searched for the items from his personal offerup app/account. We were standing next to each other so I could see his phone as he was searching and both items were no where to be seen. 
So... my husband explained that he didnt like offerup because he never had any luck with sales... always ended up selling his items through fb, craigslist, or letgo.  He currently had items listed so I used my offerup account to try to look up his supposedly “active listings” and I couldn't find his listings either. 
Long story short - According to both of our offerup accounts we had successful active listings, but they were not visible to multiple people specifically searching for them.
I guess offerup wants you to pay to make your items visible.  Shady... I wouldn't have wasted my time listing and using their app if I had known.",2
157,"Scammers Paradise: The concept of the app is great but the platform, the customer care team, and it seems the company itself are a nightmare. My problem is the App is literally filled with fake ads and posts from scammers looking to make a quick buck off of someone trying to buy a product. When asked for help, you won’t get any assistance from OfferUp and if you do it’s usually days later with no real help or assistance provided. Went above and beyond in my case and provided a internet crimes report and a police report. There was “nothing they could do for me”. Since they weren’t gonna help me I wanted to see if this was a one off incident or a pattern. I started clicking other random posts pretending to be interested in buying something and sure enough a good amount of those ads were scammers who posted a fake ad. Because of the lack action OfferUp takes in these cases I’m assuming they are well aware of the problem but choose to turn a blind eye to it. Not saying all sellers on the app are scammers. There are legitimate people trying to buy things but I’d advise to be very careful when trying to buy something off the app, if you do happen to get scammed, trust me you are not getting any help, your money back, or your product. Stay vigilant",1
158,"Don’t use!!!!!!Offerup stole my money from an item I sold-: UPDATE: BEWARE of OFFERUP itself not just its users!!!!! Still haven’t responded to me after 8 emails, 3 emails on another email I set up to try and reach support, spoke to someone in corporate, and emailed their Socialcare they told me to on here when I rated them bad and still no response!!!! Offerup is an illegitimate, unethical scam app trying to steal your money!!!! They are stealing my money on goods I sent!!!!!!  Stay away! 

I sold an item and had to follow their awful procedures of using their shipping, go to the post office and get charged a fee on top of that by Offerup. Then I received my confirmation email I shipped something. For days I reached out to the person I shipped to to make sure it arrived (they won’t pay you until the receiver approves your item) and then I bid on someone else’s items. All the sudden I received a message my account was canceled for a violation which I have no idea why I sent my items I was supposed to and only asked the person who I bid on their items what sizes they had. With no explanation they shut my account down and took my money with it with no way to get a hold of them but wait but email! Huge scam site, no support, awful, awful, awful. Don’t use it!!!!!",1
159,"You guessed it, ....: In its infancy this was a great app but as it’s been molded into its current rendition it’s now like any other invasive app - it’s pushing advertising everywhere.  I search for this?  It shows at least 20% results from paid advertising from Walmart to Macy’s and everything in between.  I search for that?  It shows me results from 3000 miles away, with advertising.  And if that’s not enough? OfferUp is now loading advertising into my fricking personal messages that I’m exchanging with the person I’m interested in possibly doing business with.  No kidding, I get an alert that a message response to my inquiry for an item and then load the message - I’m getting an ad for Macy’s inviting me to there website to make a new purchase with them IN MY MESSAGES!  Sad.  Sad that OfferUp has now developed itself to need advertising in a person’s private message center to increase revenue.  That’s the line in the sand for me.  To crawl (algorithm or otherwise) into my message center to read my chats with a seller/buyer to promote a corporate entity to make a profit is more than distasteful, it is now an invasive of my [presumed] privacy.  After this last transaction I’ll delete this app but continue to warn others.  Shameful.

You went too far OfferUp",1
160,"Convenient way to find what you need: I have used this app to purchase camping equipment and it has been a great way to find good gear at great prices.  You do have to inspect stuff when you go pick it up.  For example, make sure zippers work, ties aren’t dry rotted, etc.  It’s kind of hard to do with large items like tents but I have found most people don’t mind a quick check of what you are going to buy.  
I bought a pair of sleeping bags once and one of them was missing some snap buttons and the drawstring were dry rotted but they were quality bags, and the price was good.  
Another time my wife and I went to pick up a table and chairs and didn’t look at them closely and found when we got home that they were all loose from having been in storage for a long time. The heat messed with the glueing and we had to get rid of them.  That was a $200 mistake, but our own fault.  You live and you learn.  I hope this helps someone.  🖖",5
161,"Waste of time money and scam: This was good at first I’ve been on here for years then I purchase a iPhone on here from a scammer and no one could help me on here and I got ripped of $255! I’m on disability u think someone could help me but nope 👎 what else can I do to get my money back? Then after that offerup didn’t like a item I was selling so they deleted my page with no warning no nothing so I lost all my stuff I had on here and all my good feedbacks that I worked hard on getting, I’ve been trying to write them and get it back but nothing they can do they said? Also theirs lots of offerup people selling knives and stuff on here their not supposed too but they do but yet their offerup page don’t get deleted? So why does mine and I wasn’t even selling a knife or nothing! I helped my mum sell on offerup and she did the wrong shipping label cost and the shipping label wasn’t going to cover the item so she just sent the item off with her own money and got a tracking number wrote offerup 4 times and nothing from them? Since she didn’t use the shipping label offerup canceled her payment so she lost her item and money and wrote offerup again and still nothing from them?! Do not sell on offerup it’s a scam!",1
162,"Great app, poor user experience: I’ve been selling stuff on OfferUp for a few months now, and I’ve made about $700 profit. It’s been great so far, until today. A few hours ago, I was suddenly and without warning banned on an account with many positive reviews. I was trying to buy some computer parts through shipping, and the buyer accepted the offer, but OfferUp put it under review, and then cancelled it. I was then banned. I have absolutely zero idea why that would happen. Suddenly, an hour later, I was able to log in to my account. I sent another offer to the seller, who, thankfully, was very understanding. He accepted, and... it was put under review again. Cancelled by OfferUp again. Banned again. As of right now, I am still banned, but I have sent a support ticket to their customer support. I’m really disappointed right now, especially since I was about to get a really good deal. I hope I get unbanned, and I also hope OfferUp changes their policies to make sure they at least explain why they ban people, and so they streamline their customer support system. I’d greatly appreciate any help from customer support!

Update: Nothing. No response from customer support to my support ticket. No help provided. Still can’t use the app.",1
163,"Needs work: I’ve been using this app since 2015, it’s sad to say there hasn’t been much updated since I started using it. I’ve made one purchase but I’ve sold several items. I loved this app cus people could sell their used item kinda like a garage sale, HOWEVER, now every furniture store or dealership is allowed to post. Half the posts are duplicates. I remember when that wasn’t allowed. One post per item. Or it gets removed. Before I would get the scammers but now it’s Ashley furniture, or smaller stores. I think that is unfair to people who buy and sell for DIY or when a person is just trying to sell and item they no longer want or need. But I have to sift through a million posts of bed frames from stores to find regular people just selling stuff. Stores shouldn’t be allowed to post. It’s free advertising for them. But it bumps all the used items out and you just see the same sofa or bed posted over and over and over. There still isn’t a difference between a msg and just a notification which is annoying or I don’t ever get a notification that I have a msg. I wish this was for the people only not for businesses",2
164,"Good but can be better.: The new update for iphones hs not only slowed the ui movememt but is extremely buggier than the previous app. I have tens and maybe hundreds of listings not being shows that i have to manually share while adding other sales happens instantaneously. A 12% takeout seems too high for  online sellers. Maybe lower it just a bit by 4% at least. Add a bio for events or page updates because this could help with sellers being more invested in their page. Finally, make groups, sales groups like facebook where groups of people can discuss sales together and it can drive more sales within the community rather than someone selling one of the same item for $10 and someone else selling it for $70 but no one knowing that they had the 2 options and bought it for $70. Give people a drive to come back to. 
Update: i posted over 20 new items and none are being listed on the site, not getting any views or anything while a usual post of mines would get within 5 views at least within the hour. There are no analytics for views or conversations and it’s ruining business already. Fix this. If i list an item, i want it listed now not in a few days.",1
165,"Will NEVER use again: If I could give zero stars I would. Lousy app and customer service. I scheduled to meet a seller for a freezer I agreed to buy, and we communicated until the night before to confirm our meetup time. I purchased all the rental and moving equipment, borrowed a truck, withdrew all the cash, and enlisted a few friends to help pick it up. I messaged the seller in the morning - no response but I headed down to his area anyway. An hour goes by and still no response, so I start messaging every 5 minutes to tell him I’m in his neighborhood and can’t wait around forever. He finally messages me back to say his daughter had his phone (why would you not have your phone on you when you know someone is coming to meet you) and that he gave the freezer away!! He literally told me the night before that I could come pick it up! There is no way to rate this guy because I didn’t get to make an actual purchase, so I reported him. The customer service response was “I understand how frustrating it can be when this happens.” They took no action against the seller for this incident. Absolutely unprofessional on both the seller’s and OfferUp’s part, and a complete waste of my time. 0/10 recommend. Using the letgo app instead!",1
166,"Decent App— Bad Apples: The system itself is setup pretty well. The app is simple enough to use, a couple of thing should be tweaked but overall setup very well.

However, the biggest difference between this app, Craigslist, 5-Mile, etc. is the ability to have items shipped to you. However, when you purchase an item the seller has up to 7 days to ship it and what I have found is that many simply don’t ship the item timely, or even communicate with you. 7 days will go buy, no shipment and no communication and then they’ll start messaging you when the payment is canceled to purchase it again and “they promise” this time they will ship it. I have yet to buy an item that actually gets shipped within 3 days. And that was the only item that ACTUALLY shipped, all the others the timer just expired. Additionally, the buyer is not able to cancel the transaction during these 7 days only the seller. This puts no pressure on the seller to simply take their time. The sellers on this app are simply horrible at shipping. When picking items up they are much better. But shipping, the one thing this app brags about is utter garbage. This fault is not of the app designers.",2
167,"Won’t let me cash out my money. Support won’t help: Offer up is holding the money I made selling my antiques. I have sent several requests and done everything they asked even updating my phone and app, deleting and reinstalling the app, and I have requested they send my money to me or deposit to my account on file and no reply. I still have yet to receive my money so I will be filing a BBB complaint to get the issue resolved. This is unacceptable. How do you expect people to trust this platform to sell on with no live support, no phone to call for issues. It’s illegal to hold my money! Customer service is nonexistent. I paid for the monthly promotion bundle and it never was added to my account. Support said they couldn’t help because the emails for the apple ID and offer up have to be the same. Apple would not refund because it was a valid purchase in their eyes. So I'm out of $30, and all they offered me was a temporary promotion for 3 days of one of my items for free. Are you kidding?! This company has immature children running their support! Ripoff, and a scam. I feel a lawsuit brewing! Shady shady shady! Nothing like it used to be. Stick to in person transactions. You have been warned!",1
168,Service isn’t working and technical support was useless: I had heard about offer up and wanted to give it a try so I downloaded it signed up and found some interesting things. To no surprise when I went to make a offer the app asked to verify my number. I did so and it claims on record in app it is verified. To my dismay when going back to make an offer I was asked again to verify my number. I did so multiple times with the same issue. I then tried deleting the app redownloading several times then figured I should reach out to tech support. Despite explaining the issue and the solutions I’ve tried they’re only recommendation was to delete the app and redownload I tried again along with one other potential solution with no luck. Their response was simply we’d look into it and get back to you on how to resolve it… that was over a month ago and I have yet to receive any other correspondence. This was by far the most frustrating experience I have had with a app or service and at the rare chance they do find a solution and get back to me I am not sure if I would want to support this service considering they don’t seem to care about their users.,1
169,"Not much luck since the merge.: I used to have LetGo and OfferUp separately, and I posted on both apps. I had more luck selling/buying items on letgo rather than offer up. Ever since the merge, NO LUCK! OfferUp keeps items that are 1+ year old. It has way too many old items, it doesn’t let you know if anyone has saved your item as an interest, and I have noticed SO MANY SCAMS on this app!! There’s way more ads on this app, and it seems 75% of the stuff advertised on this app now is from a store. The locations are way off, even though you choose to search areas that are near by and you can go pick the item up, it still shows you stuff many states away. I enjoy this app, but I seemed to have way better luck on letgo. The setup was better, the options on letgo were better, more options to edit, and all around.. letgo was better. Highly disappointed in the app since the merge, and hopefully there will be changes to come!",5
170,"If you’re selling here would not recommend: First off their customer service consists of someone emailing you, which if you have a problem it’s not very reliable if you need it fixed right away. I’ve had the problem where my order gets canceled after I already dropped off the package and it’s already in the state of the buyer and I’ve had to contact support to get my payment twice because of someone else’s screw up and it took multiple emails every day to finally get my money. This time they’re saying that because it was scanned in first today 07/05 (in the state of the buyer location ) that it’s my fault and that I have to work out the payment with the buyer myself and that they can’t do it for me after I told them I dropped it off on the first of July and they didn’t do their job and you can obviously see that I had to have dropped the package off before today because me and the buyer live in different states and the package already arrived to their house. They don’t over night stuff and yesterday the post offices were closed for the Fourth of July. I would not recommend ANYONE buying or shipping on this app. They are unorganized and not helpful at all.",1
171,"PLEASE READ!: This app is extremely good for buy sell and trade, Mather of fact, it is number 1!!!
...but there has to be some dramatic changes! I can’t get any messages from anyone and when ever I send one they never look at it meaning my account got banned or something, I did everything I could, I logged out and back in and I restarted my phone and even off and on my WiFi but that dosent seem to be the problem! What the problem was is that I was banned or something like that where I can no longer send messages or do anything and every time I post there is 0 views and it dosent show up when I search it! I double checked too by creating other accounts, believe it or not I created 5 accounts! Same problem.... even my friends got the same problem, I DID NOT BREAK ANY RULES OR POLICY! Someone from the offer up company texted me saying I will fix this but it’s been weeks and no changes! Please fix this problem, I beg! This is getting me no where and I am a freshmen so I’m in need of money that’s why I sell items, I get a buyer almost every once a week which is why I love this app! Please help me, fix this problem for not just me but for all!

172,"Unsafe: There’s too many scammers on this app. My first two encounters were literally scammers and sadly the 2nd one scammed me. It was mostly my fault and i blame myself for it because he wanted money to be sent through an outside app and i trusted him and i went with it, DO NOT SEND MONEY THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE CASHAPP, ZELLE, OR PAYPAL because offerup WILL NOT cover it and you WILL NOT get your money back if you get scammed. Also it pisses me off that it doesn’t allow you to look at the reviews unless there’s a way and if there is then it isnt making it easy to find. The only thing it shows is how many reviews they have, and their star rating. I don’t understand how a scammer was able to scam me when it showed that he sold items before and also showed good ratings. I feel like offerup should take responsibility for that because a lost of people would like to see the reviews and who they are from. Was everything on his profile fake? Were the reviews fake? Ere the stars fake? Were the items sold fake? I don’t understand at all but offerup should definitely fix the ability of seeing the reviews and who the reviews come from because i believe it would decrease the chance of getting scammed.",1
173,"Terrible: I’ve had nothing but a negative experience lately. Since merging with LetGo this app is full of scammers wanting your phone number or for you to call them and constantly having to block these brand new accounts who will inbox you as soon as post a new item 9 times out of 10. Then today I was randomly signed out of my account after a suspicious message of a brand new account wanting to purchase an item and I didn’t respond back right away. Then when I tried to sign back in I get a message that my account was disabled due to violating community standards. I did nothing wrong. Today I posted a few items like clothing, a blanket and a little people’s farm toy and that was it. I’ve posted these same type of items in the past with no problem. I read over their community standards and don’t see anything that makes sense for violating their standards. I messaged them to inquire further and awaiting a response. I used to enjoy selling on this site but it’s been nothing but a pain the past month or so and I’ve had much better luck on Facebook Marketplace. I do not recommend OfferUp. Nothing but wasted time and more frustration then it is worth.",1
174,"Seller protection and customer service.: The platform is a wonderful resource to sell your items and make some additional money. However. I’m finding out that the customer service is nearly non-existent. I recently made a sale and my first shipping experience with OU and having an issue. The buyer received the item and it was damaged upon delivery. Both me and her have followed the steps to correspond with each other.  She’s filed a claim but I’ve reached out to customer service several times to see what the sellers protection is since it’s not listed clearly in the FAQ. Nobody has tried to reach out to either of us. Me as the seller has followed all guidelines and policies for
Shipping the item but seems like I’m the one losing bc now my item is damaged and I won’t be receiving any form of payment. It would be nice to know what the process is other than just the buyer being able to be refunded.  Most of all it would be most appreciated to get some type of correspondence from someone other than an automated message stating “buyer has requested a refund!”",3
175,"Will Not Refund You For Stolen Money: I bought a item from a woman who was supposed to ship it to me. She never did and I was told several times that after 5 days I would be refunded and it’s been a month and still no refund! I have reached out to OfferUp more than 15 times and it’s a different excuse every time. The most recent person I spoke to who worked with OfferUp claimed my refund should have been put into my account by now and advised me to check it. I told him I check my bank account daily and I have the bank statements to prove that I was never refunded. I get scammed and ripped off on OfferUp and have to play games with the people who work for OfferUp. I’m sick of messaging OfferUps customer service, I find it highly unprofessional that OfferUp doesn’t have cellular customer service to where you can talk with someone over the phone. My whole experience with OfferUp has been beyond appalling . I just want my money back and to get this done and over with. I don’t see why it’s so difficult for me to get a refund, it’s like OfferUp is trying to assume i am lying about not receiving a refund. The real thief who is taking their money is the woman who took advantage of me and who knows how many other people. Highly Unprofessional!",1
176,Notifications: Let me first say that I really appreciate your platform and service. I use it regularly to both sell and buy used goods. But your use of notifications is the reason for the one star. Companies like yours need to be clear as to what you use platform permissions for (ie notifications). Your “soft ask” to allow notifications say they will be used to get messages from other people buying or selling and nothing about all of the other notifications you send designed for re-engagement. This is both misleading and not how notifications are to be used. Please refer to this years WWDC talk from Apple on notifications to verify this. They state very clearly that notifications are not meant to get your users “back into your app” and should be designed to be both helpful and actionable. As a user I should not have put up with unwanted notifications designed as ad’s in order to also get messages from buyers/sellers.  As a person in the tech space I can only assume that this was an intentional decision and probably a key part of your business model for growth. But I encourage you to be better than that and show more empathy towards your users when thinking about how you engage with them.,1
177,"Nonexistent customer service: My account was deleted by offerup. They said that I violated their terms of service, but I really don’t know what exactly I did wrong. I had 71 reviews with 5 stars. The app itself is great. The search function works well, it’s very easy to use, the rating system is great, there is very little spam, and it is much better than craigslist. I’m bummed that I can’t use it anymore. I tried to create a different account, accepting the fact that my ratings and messages would all be gone. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Offerup blocks your entire phone from using offerup again. They will ghost ban the account. This means you can post and make offers, but no one can see your posts, messages, or offers. I tried contacting them through email, Twitter, Facebook, and the social email they list here on the App Store for other dissatisfied customers. They don’t respond, or they have ghosted me like they do to additional accounts. It seems to be a common problem, and it’s truly a shame. The app and service are outstanding and could be a Craigslist killer. However, their customer service is nonexistent. If you make a mistake whether you’re aware of it or not, you are punished harshly.",1
178,"Buyers beware 😡: I made a purchase of some shoes. The seller said they were a ladies 10. I told her if there wasn’t a ladies 10 did they will be big. When I got them, they were too big. I got a message from OfferUp asking that I want to refund. I said yes to the refund. They let the seller make the decision to send me my money back and they had two days. I thought that was unfair to them a decision to send my money back. I made the decision for refund as soon as I realize they were going to be to be. My purchase was $150. So I understand why the seller did not want to refund me my money. I don’t have money just to give away. I even sent OfferUp an email of the pictures of our conversation about the shoes size. I’m not understanding if you buy something from a store long as you have your receipt, you can get your refund back. They give you two days to come up with all the evidence. It didn’t take two days for the take my money off my card when I got the two big shoes. Now with

I am a hard-working and honest seller with over 150 5-Star ratings on my OfferUp account. I was phone number verified, TruYou verified, FaceBook verified. I got emails from OfferUp support previously saying a listing was against the rules. I was tryin to sell my used HDMI CABLES lol. Sending generic messages with no specifics is no way to fix an issue. I tried reworking my description and still the same message. All photos were mine.  The listing doesn’t even go to archive which would make it easier to prove I made no mistake and the error is app based. So the same night I got an email which said my account was banned for violating their terms and guidelines. I asked what I did specifically, (no response yet) but in the past I always get a generic message. I have been depending on OfferUp to help pay my rent, bills, and for food.

180,"Account Hacked!: *UPDATE: It’s been almost a week and customer support still hasn’t messaged me back. Although the scammer seems to have given up on my account I’ve witnessed other accounts That got hacked post the same spam car posts. I digress, but lately I’ve been having a new problem. Ever since my account went back to normal my posts only get a couple of views. Even for obscure items my posts would always used to hit at least 100 views, this week the most views I’m had on an item is 2. Even for in demand items I’m getting no more than one or two views per post. 

I’m just going to stick to Craigslist from now on. Not once in my years of posting there have I had issues like these.

ORIGINAL POST — Up until today I’ve never had issues with Offerup, I’ve used it to sell and purchase a number of items. But today my account was hacked and some scammer has been filling my account with spam posts. I tried changing my password but this hacker is still making spam posts using my account even after the fact. They’re able to make dozens of posts in as little as a few minutes leading me to believe they have some auto-posting capability. From what I’ve read online other people have had this same exact issue too. 

Please improve your security, I would hate to have to make a new account after all the time I’ve spent building my reputation. An optional 2FA security feature should really be added to the app.",5
181,"WAS working great, then suddenly....: The activity was great. I got inquiries constantly about things I had listed for sale. All day. All night. I’d hear the notification chime at 3 in the morning sometimes. It never stopped. Sale after sale. Then yesterday, it ALL stopped. I can add items, edit them, etc, and I can see they’ve been viewed. But it’s like nobody can send me an inquiry. I have some things that have crazy interest, but now there’s nothing but crickets. (Wish I could list and sell those crickets!) I’ve checked my settings. I’ve checked for updates (didn’t find any). I did the suggested uninstall and reinstall...then panicked that I’d wiped out all my listings (thankfully all was ok, everything was still there). But no flurry of messages that I’d hoped had been hung up somewhere came flying in. Still the crickets. I have no idea what the problem is, nor how to fix it. I’d appreciate any and all help, but can’t seem to find it. I was so in love with Offer Up; it’s great...until this happened.",4
182,"Since you can’t do halves, I’ll give it 2 stars, even though it doesn’t deserve it.: I have been using this app for years, and I have dealt with too many horrible people/liars who say they want your stuff, then you drive one hour away because some despicable sack of crap doesn’t have a car, and it won’t even let me see my own offers to edit them or mark them sold or anything else like that. I can look at the offers page that pops up immediately, I can look at what I want to buy, I can go to the camera area to sell my stuff, but it won’t even let me look at my own offers page to be able to list my stuff &/or change &/or see my stuff. This is absolutely ridiculous and I am just about done with this site. It doesn’t matter how many times you complain to them about the horrible service and the horrible app, and all of the horrible people who make you drive a ridiculously far way to quite possibly the worst neighborhood imaginable and they still refuse to kick them off of the site and they refuse to help anyone.

183,"OfferUp’s contact support and User updates: I’ve been trying to get in contact with the app’s support team about changing my shipping address. I realized there isn’t a place on the app or the website to change this yourself, so you have to reach out. A quick google search will say they will respond within 24 hours but my and others experiences would say that’s just not true. 
I understand that anyone could just log into anyone’s account and change the address, but there’s ways to combat that like passwords and two-step verifications seen on other apps. I think this app is very good at creating a community for selling used or unwanted items to those who do want it, but it just needs some updates. 
Would also love to see when the app updates every week or 2 they would leave specifics on what they added/changed/removed/etc so we could all be in the know of things. I imagine it might be a tall order, but given that other reviews on the app are saying similar complaints I think an updated review is needed.",3
184,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME USING OFFER UP!!! 😡: Read this honest review!!!! I would give ZERO stars if I could!!! I was using the app just fine until for the past three months I cannot post anything and on my public profile it shows no post!!! I take my time out to make post just for them to not be posted/seen!! People on here like to ask stupid questions even after the answer is listed in the description or picture! Those same idiots have the nerve to report you! Who has time to sit around and keep answering questions that are CLEARLY ANSWERED IN THE POST! Then once you answer the dumb questions they never intend to buy!!! I’d rather use the old school Craig’s list method where people will actually do some leg work to research the product themselves or simply read the description!!!! OfferUp also won’t inform you if your account has been blocked! It’s very unfair to block a seller if they aren’t answering dumb questions! I reach out to the “support” team and never receive a reply!!!! They should charge a subscription fee for serious buyers because at this point people just come on here to waste time and get your account blocked because they are LOW BALLERS or too lazy to read!!!!!!!!! Don’t waste your time. Period!,1
185,"Account Removed: After verifying my e-mail, phone number, completing TruYou, and making a successful purchase last Christmas, I figured I was good to go. The app seemed easy enough to use, but over time I’ve noticed many more fake accounts, ads, and scammers on the app. I recently was attempting to purchase an item and noticed the person was using several methods to try to scam me. They offered to have me buy the item via cash app, to have it shipped through FedEx rather than by OfferUp’s method, amongst other red flags. I (apparently naively) thought to report the post and move on. Upon the support team receiving my report, I got an e-mail saying MY account was suspended. Thinking there was a misunderstanding, I appealed the removal all to get a very generic “Violation of Community Guidelines” e-mail in return. It more or less told me I can never use OfferUp again for violating some unspecified rule. I still have no idea what “guideline” I violated after reaching out several times. After reading many Reddit posts and any recent reviews on the App Store, it seems OfferUp gets ban happy without any valid reasons. If you are looking for somewhere to buy/sell items, please look elsewhere.",1
186,"Great way to earn money, but too many scams: One thing that bothers me about this app is the hassle it is to get customer service. Once you get it the experience is great, but there should be a tab for chat assistance. Not a work around to get help 24 hours laters. Very very far behind. As well, they put zero effort to prevent scammers. This ranges from bots, fake posts, and scalpers. Why are there PS5’s on the platform for 1,400. Oh, because they take a 12.9% cut of the sale. They benefit from scammers and will never choose to do anything about it. This has been going on before the console launches and it is just sad. Service fee is too high and makes facebook market places 5% look better. They make a killing off the amount of data they sell off you. Looked at a game once and within seconds all I got for advertisements over the last week have been for the game clogging up message and search feeds. This app is great for what it is, but you are far better off sticking to Mecari or FB Market Place. However, their payout period is very quick and much appreciate. All my complaints are simple courtesies that should be common sense. Not an after thought.",2
187,"Recent update made me drop my rating...Pretty good app, a few lag issues.: New review: after the recent update deleted the “everything” button, I feel like I see the same items every time I look for something. In addition, there are an excessive amount of advertisements on every page now. I feel like offerup had something really great and they are getting away from it... might start looking for another app that does that offerup used to... connect people to sell items... not just promote ads and a few businesses.

Used to say this: Great way to sell items without having to divulge any personal info i.e. Phone number or address. You can talk to buyers or sellers straight through the app. The only issue is that sometimes the app is slow to let you know someone has messaged, which can lead you to miss a sale. I also wish that there was a way to tell if you have already viewed an item and what the price is without clicking on it.",5
188,"Amazing!: I have never sold anything in my life. I am moving and need to get rid of everything in my apartment. I thought about just donating all of my belongings to Goodwill per the usual, but a friend recommended I try selling it with OfferUp. I decided to give it a shot and I sold 6 items in 4 days - not to mention I live in a very small town! The app is super easy to navigate and I like that you can communicate through the app without providing personal information. I mostly sell through in-person transactions, but you can also ship your items which may allow the items to sell much faster. I really like that you can see how many people have viewed your posts and that we are able to rate as both sellers and buyers. I am already looking for things to purchase for myself and I am so happy that I get to receive some sort of income back the items I bought less than 1 year ago! 😆😁",5

Then I went to location and it said the same thing so I came onto the App Store and it says to contact development so I tried but it took me to a site that says access denied so I can’t even send them a message? I had stuff for sale on there & I have more that I want to sell but I can’t even use the app at all & I can’t contact support so this is absolutely ridiculous???? You ruined a perfectly good app! I made money before selling my stuff both locally & shipping it to customers but now I can’t even use the dang app??? And to not have access to contact support is ridiculous in itself(?) what did you do you ruined your perfectly good app??? Guess I will be looking for some place else to sell my stuff because none of this makes any sense why am I banned from contacting support?)! This is so stupid??? What did you do now you can’t even use the app?? Way to go you ruined a perfectly great app???? Please fix these issues so we can use the app again????,1
190,"My account not working or banned: I have been with this amazing app for almost a year and half. I like it so much since it’s a super ease app to use to buy/sell items in minutes. I have used my account to buy items that I need and like (did not sell any item yet only bought more than 20 items). However, two weeks ago I suddenly cannot make an offer on anything nor message anyone at all. Even my account has a very good reputation with 19 five-star. I have had this issue for almost 2 weeks. I was wondering why this happens to my account? And if it was banned then what’s wrong? What did I do wrong? Why nobody informs me before? I have truly got frustrated dealing with the issues for more than 2 weeks. Now, I can’t buy or sell anything on OfferUp because of this problem. I truly need help to get this annoying issue fixed. I have already reported it three times to the Customer Care to take care of it or at least inform me what’s wrong/going on? but unfortunately nobody replied back to my concerns. I hope OfferUp organizers will reply back soon since it has been two weeks 😔dealing with this annoying problem.",2
191,"Has a lot of potential: I’ve been using the app for sometime and I’ve sold a couple things. It’s very simple to use and to navigate. It works well when it comes to searching for items and is very straight forward. The app needs a way to filter the feed you get because a lot of the time I will get random things popping up and I’m stuck scrolling through random junk just to find items. They need a way to recommend items or find similar items to things you like and get rid of dislike items that you don’t want to see. Something similar to YouTube’s recommend similar videos button. It just gets frustrating also when you click on an item just to look at it and next thing you know, your whole entire feed is similar items to the 1 thing you looked at for a couple seconds. The algorithm just needs some work and I think the app would be a lot better and more user friendly. Hopefully this helps because I love the app and it definitely has the potential to be a lot better.",3
192,"Could use some better coding: The app is pretty good, I have sold quite a few things and it has been a great help. I have some feedback for the developers to make it even better so hopefully they see this. My first issue with the app is I try to look for things that have recently sold, there is not a way to do this unless you just scroll through the pages and look for the “sold” or “shipped” banner on the image. My second issue is that when I filter my search by price, it doesn’t really do anything. For example, if I choose filter by price: high to low, it will still show me things that are $25 above things that are $500. Frustrating. Last but not least, it continually shows me THE SAME ITEMS regardless of how far I scroll down or how long I am scrolling through. There just all randomly scattered and there’s literally no organization even though it clearly tries to make it seem that way with the options to filter. All in all, I am thankful for the sales I have made through the offerup app but there is a huge portion that could be improved. Thanks!",3
193,"Shady app in Mar 2022: This App sort of works as of Mar 2022. It’s bad enough no one ever answers your messages and when I purchase things I’m refunded because they never even respond or ship. It’s a sea of abandoned accounts and items that you’ll never be able to purchase. When I report items that are obsolete or being refunded due to no activity, nothing happens. But to make things even worse, the actual sellers that DO respond can’t accept nor process my orders. Now ALL my payments are declined, and I get an email that the seller cancelled the transaction. They are trying to sell me the item and they have no idea what’s going on. They tell me it automatically cancels even tho they are accepting it. Googling this, I am not alone. I reached out to OfferUp customer support and after about a week or two I finally got a response. After 3 weeks the seller is finally able to accept my offer. Neither of us did a thing, it just randomly processed 3 weeks later. Idk about this app, but since I finally got what I wanted I’ll give it and extra star. Now…. Will I actually receive it…. To be continued.",2
194,"IF I COULD GIVE IT A NEGATIVE RATING I WOULD: Honestly there are more scammers on this app than Craigslist. I was scammed into spending 520 dollars that I cannot get back. And I only trusted the person because he had over 90 ratings at a 5 star and 139 buyers and yes he was still a scammer. I reported the account so many times and it is still up and standing, OFFERUP does nothing to try and take these accounts down. All I’m saying is if they want you to pay them on CASHAPP or any other third party apps don’t. Unless your certainly sure they’re legit by proof of identification still wouldn’t recommend this app, truly one of the worst experiences i have ever had to be tricked and for this app to condone that type of behavior without consequences is sick. It came to a point of it doesn’t even matter about the money you guys are just gonna let these people get away with tweaking their profiles like that and scamming many other people on what’s suppose to be a legit way of selling and buying through verifications. Do Not Download It if you see any promotion or anything you want online to buy from this website and app I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you don’t fall into the trap of paying your money that I did any many others do.",1
195,"Wish OfferUp made it easier to provide app feedback!: It’s a great app, just wish it was more user friendly in some areas.

1. The App Store page says you can provide feedback by going to the help center in the app.  Whatever OfferUp listed the “contact us” section as in the help center, it isn’t intuitive and I have not been able to find it.

2.  The feature defaults to include pickup + shipping and 30 mile radius (which is really closer to 50 miles).  I want to set it default to 10 miles, local pick up only (no delivery).  Even with 10 miles, it stretches to about 20 miles, but it is really inconvenient to have to review the settings each time I log in.  I don’t care if it only shows me 2 matches instead of 20, I know how to change the settings if I’d ever be interested in driving further.

3. When saving items to a board, it should be easier to go and delete the items, ideally similar to how you would manage photos on an iPhone.  Right now, you have to click each one, confirm you want it deleted, then it sends you back to the top and you have to scroll back down to where you were.  Sometimes I will mark things, but it will be sold before I can decide, so I’ll need to go back and delete a handful of items at a time.  Right now, because it’s such a hassle to then filter through everything, I’m not inclined to go back and look at what I’ve saved.  Please make managing the saved items easier by making it easier to delete multiple items.",4
196,"Returned item, seller received refund. Offerup wont handle it.: I still have received no refund for an item I returned and the seller now have the item and the refund. Offerup has provided no assistance except telling me I waited to long even though it was shipped within the 6 days and I have a receipt and photo proof.
I purchased an item through a great seller, item was defective and the seller had no problem with me getting a refund. I sent he item back within the 6 day time frame and offerup said “You shouldn’t have waited until the last minute to send item back”. Again, it was the 6th day but still in the time frame allotted. I sent the item back at 5:30pm, 1 hr before UPS closed. Their system glitches I suppose and didn’t show UPS had item. After emailing 6 times, I finally was told that if I wanted a refund I had to contact the seller who had the item and apparently got the refund instead of me? 
No one has been helpful, in any way and now I spent 50$ on an item that I no longer have and they will not give a refund to me since it was sent to the seller. 
I’m contacting my bank for further assistance on the matter but I recommend NOT using the app at least for selling/shipping items.",1
197,Worst customer serice and out of hand bans based on false claims: Thanks for blocking my 127 - 5 star rating account for -user-to-user-harassment but not going through my report of no-show (she didn’t show up at the meeting making me lose time stating that she sold time item for me to later find out that she posts it again) of the person who probably reported me - I don’t knoa yet because offerup never warned me nor said that I was blocked nor who reported me etc... I tried messaging them and they send me only one reply message stating that I was blocked. Oh thanks for telling me that I was blocked and not giving me further explanation nor a chance for dispute. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Probably trying to remove all those who try to profit locally and now requiring TruYou to all new members. Wow. You’re asking about safety on the app yet you’re asking me for my personal IDs and information. No I would rather meet with a stranger and risk something else than giving you my personal info which I don’t know where is going and who is going to use it or abuse it. WORST OF THE WORST. At least hire some people to properly handle your customer service from taking all the money from your ads throughout the platform,1
198,"Selling on OFFER UP: I have posted several items for sale recently and frankly I’m not very satisfied with this site. Those people who do reply and ask for the items or say they want them initially, respond once and you never hear from them again. You try to make meeting or payment arrangements, you never hear from them again. After repeatedly asking them to respond, they still leave you hanging. You need to better scrutinize the people who respond, if that’s possible. Also lots of scams. People ask for your cell number and you never hear back. Or they say they want the item sight unseen and want to pay with Zelle and ask for cell number and email. Oh no, that is definitely a scam to get your information and they never respond back when you don’t give it to them. One person who responded and wanted to pay me with Zelle lived in some foreign country and she was buying my dining room set and sending her movers to pick it up.   “ I don’t think so “. I will take my items off and use Craig’s list from now on. My experiences lately have not been good ones. Sorry.",2
199,"All about the APP: - The interface navigation NEEDS to be more smart, sample if you’re watching an item’s picture AND if you wants to go back to the principal page to choose another seller, YOU JUST need to click pushing DOWN the picture in order to go to the principal page, but now actually you have to click and click and click and click and click several times to go to the principal page this can be so much better. - The navigation changing pictures about items is annoying cuz’ all the controls are on the top of the page instead near of the picture to pass to the second picture.  OfferUp needs to be more focused in scam people blocking their IP address so they can’t open and reopen fake accounts to stole information about the real sellers and buyers.  - We would like to see options about, items most sold, adjustable prices from low to high or inverted, NEW ITEM OR USED ITEM OR LIKE NEW ITEMS. That will help us to choose easily what we looking for.  We would like the sellers can get some insignia or stars ✨ indicating trusting seller or trusted buyer.",3
200,"Hot or miss: Well if your a seller be prepared to receive offers of up to 95% off of the listed price and rarely will buyers offer 50% or more and even after that people will stand you up at the designated location.  There is a rate the buyer section but I'd rather not due to the fear of retaliatory critiques and I am a new seller and don't want any bad marks. Sorry if I didn't warn other sellers.   I have sold a few pieces at basically 50% off the asking price.   This app is a great place if you wanna just get rid of something.  Very garage sale like.  Oh its a also a good place if you wanna advertise your retail or antique mall as many vintage hunters are on here.  Including me. Good luck.  This app is what it is and who isn't looking for a bargain?  Good luck 
Ps the app itself is fairly simple and easy to use there is a ""bump"" option that basically puts your ad back at the top of the list but I'd rather just retake the photo and repost.   Gives good practice with product photos.",5
201,"Sketchy app, don’t get it: I downloaded this app to make some quick cash and get rid of some things. At first nothing was wrong, I posted a bunch of clothes that I wanted to get rid of, and they started getting views. Two days after I got it and started posting stuff, I got a message from someone asking if a sweatshirt I was selling was still available, so I said it was. They then said “text my number” and gave a number that was not local to me. I asked if they were local and they proceeded to say “sending a message on offer up does not seem safe to me”, so I said  I wasn’t comfortable texting them, and they viewed the message and never said anything else. The same thing happened the next day too, but with a different name that gave me a different number. I also got another message asking if an item was available and OfferUp put a disclaimer thing in there saying the message violated community rules. I told the person anyway that it was still available and they saw the message right away but never responded. The items that I got these messages on were ones that I promoted with the 3 day free trial on promotions. Overall just a sketchy app and I wouldn’t recommend getting it.",1
202,"Would be great, if it worked: Update: I have now been banned for no reason. I had 5* with 23 reviews. This platform is complete garbage now. I wish Letgo was still it’s own standalone app. 

I’ve been using OfferUp for years. In the past 6 months, all messaging for me has stopped working. It shows that my messages have been delivered, but people never get them. I know this because I started having my wife reach out to the same people with her account after me, and the same people responded to her. I then would ask them about my message during the meet up, and they showed me that they didn’t get them. I created a 2nd account and it worked for about 1 week before doing the same thing. I have asked support, and they have not been helpful at all, just suggesting things that I have done (sign in/out, delete the app, etc.). The number of items that I have missed out on is truly frustrating. To make things even better, my wife’s account was banned for no reason. She never sold anything, only purchased, and never had any negative interactions with anyone. She reached out to support months ago and never got a response.",1
203,"Useless User Support or Assistance: Probably the worst buy, sell, or trade platforms of all apps. People who buy from you and use shipping have the opportunity to scam you. Once they file an issue with the order, whether there be one or not, Offer Up suggests you involve Law Enforcement to get involved whenever there’s an issue. This buyer I sold to tells me he never received an item but based on tracking info it was delivered to his mailbox. Instead of him investigating with his Post Office or neighbors. He immediately demands a refund. He then filed a claim the item was damaged when he received it. Both contradicting!! Offer Up does not pay you until the receiver is satisfied. It gives advantage to anyone trying to scam people into “selling” their items for FREE. Valuable Items at that. Any dilemma with a sale, Offer Up will instruct you to get your local Law Enforcement. That’s their solution to every problem, that it’s not theirs. This is a disgusting platform with plenty of opportunities for people to get scammed. Because Offer Up will not help or assist any of its users when a problem happens with a sale. Imagine getting Law Enforcement involved over some toys?!",1
204,"Mostly just scams: OfferUp used to be alright. The lack of price visibility until you open an ad is really stupid and the overall app is frustrating but the occasional deals I could find used to be worth the trouble. In this last year or so the number of scams has gone up exponentially. I’ve been looking through Nintendo switch ads for the last half hour and in the Phoenix area I’m not exaggerating when I say there are well over a thousand scam ads with a few dozen real ones mixed in. It’s made WAY worse by the fact that I can’t see the obvious titles or pricing until I open up every single stupid ad. 
Then, a few months ago I had been in touch a woman through the about about an item I had spent a couple months searching for. I was almost done with a two hour drive to meet with her and OfferUp without warning shut down her account for suspicious activity or something like that. No way to contact her at all and I ended up having wasted 4 hours of driving. I’ve bought and sold hundreds of items online and I guarantee that wasn’t a scam yet every scam I report seems to just stay up. I’d give 0 stars if I could",1
205,"Contacting support is a nightmare: OfferUp all of a sudden change for me and I start getting any views on my page . I figured that I must have been shadow banned since they never sent me any notification about anything .    Faster contacting them they told me that they don’t know why my account went down. They did reinstate it which was a good thing .
A Couple of times that I sold that items The item did not scan at the post office when it should have. Twice specifically, The buyer received the item while offer up still sent me notifications saying shipping was extended and shipping was canceled.   
They say that if this happens to contact support. Finding the button to contact support is a nightmare in itself, but when I found how to write the message, season putting in before transaction ID and my message, the SUBMIT button stayed grey colored and couldn’t be clicked.  
Thank God my buyer was honest and sent me money through PayPal instead. I may get screwed on other purchases!
There is no other way to contact them",3
206,"Not for white people: The problems are mainly with customer service, although they affect total usability. When you list something for sale, you get tons of low offers, even though you check the ”my price is firm” option. Often the lowballers start by asking other questions to warm you up, thus wasting your time. Because OfferUp doesnt do enough to prevent this behavior, I wrote a description in my ad explaining to the OfferUp crowd how I was from northern Europe and that my culture of doing business is different than theirs, and in what way. I explained this in a friendly manner, and did not insinuante my business culture is objectively better - but immediately after this, my account was blocked. But they didnt tell me they had blocked it, I just noticed how views on my ad stopped increasing. No, not like I didnt renew the ads, it went from hundreds of views per month to exactly zero. Why is OfferUp not honest and tell people they have been blocked and why? Was I wrong to explain that I would not honor lowballers? The OfferUp staff seem to think so, or more likely, they just dont want people who are white. I wish the app was for everyone who would respect the ”price is firm” flag but apparently not!",1
207,"Useful, some irritations: I’ve both bought and sold a few dozen things locally. Most people I’ve meet are nice, but some are deceptive. There’s no way to leave feedback for a seller unless they report that you bought an item from them. On several occasions, when a transaction was less than perfect, the seller falsely reported the item as sold to a different account. Either another one of their own, or someone else’s they have some sort of fictitious positive review agreement with. Because sure enough, on accounts with few enough ratings to tell the difference, the item I bought was marked “sold to someone else,” and their account received another 5 star review (not from me).
Another irritation about the app is that it doesn’t tell me whether or not a shipping offer I’ve made has been seen or just delivered. This information is always clearly available on in app communications regarding local sales. This outta be easy for the developers to fix.",4
208,"DO NOT SHIP STUFF: Ok so I loved offer up, I’ve shipped stuff out to people before and I haven’t had a problem until recently. My son lost my left AirPod so I said why not purchase it online. I paid for one to be shipped out to me from New York. A day later I message the guy and asked if he was going to ship it out to me that day. He said to “cash app” him I said “I’m sorry I don’t feel comfortable with that, thanks anyways.” He proceeded to insult me, threatened my family, and told me if I didn’t cash app him money he’d show up to my house with a rifle. Mind you this guy has my address so I contacted offer up 3 separate times. You cannot call them at all, they never responded to my emails. I blocked the guy obviously and today the 3rd day offerup had the audacity to “remind cliff to ship my item” I cannot believe the lack of communication and that they don’t have a way to cancel an item or remove your address from a stranger having it. I went and looked at the stuff I sold and I still have those peoples address. It’s just not safe, and unless someone is at your door or you meet up in person you have no way of making a report. Stay safe people!",1
209,"Great app, terrible ads now: I have been using offer up for many years, over 2 or 3 accounts. I've met cool people, scored great deals, sold plenty of stuff. It's been a life saver even when it comes to niche car parts. Most of the bad reviews seem to be due to buyers complaining about the behavior of sellers/ other users in general. This does not really reflect on the app. The reason I'm giving 3 stars now (I used to give 5) is because of the new 30 second ads. There used to be regular ads all over the place, and they make money from boosting posts and from people that have many posts. I feel that the 30 second ads are too much now. It's greedy. You can't use the app while the ad is being displayed. I even go out of my way to close the app and restart it to avoid the ad, just out of principal. If this new ad format is removed Id happily revisit and give them 5 stars.",5
210,Letgo app was better: They said they combined the 2 apps but nothing I had saved transferred over to offerup and things I’m trying to find for sale on letgo I had saved I can’t go back to on either app now. Letgo at least let you know when you had messages waiting for a reply to remind you. Now my 5 star rating I had on letgo and offerup has disappeared. When you search for items to buy I get things from other states instead of stuff local to me which does me no good and I get people from other states asking me if stuff is still available only to find out they are nowhere near me so it’s a waste of everyone’s time. The only thing I can do now on the letgo side is answer messages I had previously they blocked everything else. All these problems makes it difficult to sell items that are seasonal like a lawn mower because by the time they straighten this all out the season is over and your stuck with things nobody wants to buy when the season is over. They should’ve just left it alone. Letgo has its issues but in my area nobody uses offerup letgo was what everyone buys and sells on. I’m very disgusted with the app and the changes they made to both.,1
211,"3 years ago this app was great: Back in 2020, this app was amazing. I was able to communicate well with others whether I sold or bought items. Back then I opened and used this app almost daily. Now with the introduction of paying to promote your listings (more $$ for the company aside from all the ADS they already include- corporate greed) to be seen, it’s almost impossible to communicate with others. Since all premium accounts pop up first I can’t see others messaging me because their messages get bumped down since premium accounts are put on top. The INBOX is also a mess because the premium/standout option screws with the chronological order of messages you receive. In short, if you don’t have a premium account all your messages and products will be shadowed by premiums accounts. As someone with ADD/OCD it’s also an eyesore when I open this app… it seems very cluttered and unorganized, literally gives me a headache if I spent more than 5 min on the Offerup app.  I no longer will use this app like I use to… what a shame. Also what’s up with the AD videos they play, once I get an video AD like that I X out of my account!",1
212,"I love this app, but it needs a couple things.: Sometimes updates come with a Search Bar for your listed items, then the search bar gets taken away. I have to update hundreds of listings per week, I need that search bar all the time. 
Sometimes the app will let you ship an item from a category selection and sometimes it won’t even if it is the exact same category selection. I believe it is because the app made a A.I. prediction about what you are listing and got it wrong. Then even if you change the category it does not change the ability to ship. I had it happen on wine chillers back to back. 
All in all, a very useful and great app. There are just a few things that could make it a easier and more enjoyable experience.
I like how many categories there are. I love the shipping rates, but there could be more options, like 5lbs. and Media Mail. Missing out on media mail hurts the movie, tv, music and book sales.",4
213,"Great app but not accurate with location: The app itself is great, no problems when posting to buy or sell. However, once the item has been posted I’ve noticed the item location will be different than my actual location. Ex: If I say the item is being sold in Los Banos, Ca then the map will show that the item is way outside of town, even though it’s not. I think it interferes with possible purchases because if I were to see that I had to pick something up outside of town, I’d be a little sketched out to meet with the seller. I also have a hard time finding more local posts, I usually have to change my location if I want to find things closer to where I live. Right now, leaving my location as is, I receive posts from sellers that are more than 2 hours away even though I live around a lot of small towns less than 45min away. In order to view more locally, i change my location to one of the other small towns around me & BAM I get so much more posts from my own town! So I guess my only complaint is: FIX LOCATION ACCURACY!!!",3
214,"Concerns of a fellow offer up User: I think offer up should periodically send alerts every couple weeks to people to make sure they want their ad to be continually posted on offer up and If the person doesn’t respond within a certain amount of days to confirm that they would like their post to still be up. Their post should be deleted for the sake of everyone else. I think 2-4 days is a fair time. People who are actually in need of a car or other item don’t have to stress when they find something nice and constantly message the person to see if it’s available but they never respond. It has happened to me more times than eggs in a carton and it’s frustrating.
Please take people’s comments concerns & ideas into consideration when fixing and adjusting your site to be the best it can.
Thank you offer up for being the second best platform for selling and buying items...
(Craigslist being numero uno)!

215,"What’s with the ads?: I’ve always enjoyed being able to see what someone is offering without having to close an ad. After the last update, if I back out of an item I view, I get to waste 3 seconds waiting for an “X” button to emerge because some random ad has popped up. Is that what the fun new update was? Annoying ads? It’s pretty distracting. I guess that’s the point, but now I lose focus on what I was searching for. And instead of continuing down a rabbit hole of things I might want, I give up and close the app. 

Update: they’ve decided to put a “close-out” X in the upper corner of the pop up ads. It doesn’t do anything to close the ad, so you HAVE to close the app and hope you can find whatever you were last looking at, when it reopens. 
Also if you try to list an item and it fits a certain model, like say, a side mirror for a car. When you list the years with a dash, their program will remove the info you put in because it thinks you listed a phone number. I went from loving OfferUp to almost hating it. Tip my hat to the developers!",2
216,"Absolutely no improvement last rating: They actually made things worse for example every time I go onto the site I have to tell it (pick up only )and (within 10 miles). It always goes back to having stuff delivered. I’m not putting any money in here to have something delivered. Another absolutely ridiculous thing is that there are listings in there for stuff that’s two years old. People never reply because they don’t even use the app anymore they just left their listing. They need to put a time limit on a listing so it disappears automatically. Also I’ve run into quite a few lowlifes that have you drive out to a nonexistent or wrong address. And there is always someone selling a $10,000 vehicle for $1000 and that is some kind of scam. It’s totally a pain to try to block somebody or report somebody. But that’s what you have to put up with if you don’t want to pay ridiculous seller fees from eBay.

Two years later. I deleted the app for the second time. It just keeps getting worse. Now ads pop up in front of you all the time. Does ebay own this there's all kinds of. Auctions on the site.",1
217,"Slowly Progressive Trainwreck: I’ve used this app for years, and it was great. It was simple, quick and sleek. Everything that it needed to be and nothing more. But every decision that’s been made by developers to make this app “better” has completely torn it apart. Full screen un-skippable ads, listing promotions, the jobs feature, and “premium” functionality has brought on all kinds of bugs and lag. To list one bug, if I search by most recent I’ll see months-old posts at the top of the list (and no, they aren’t ones that were promoted and I can’t see that they’re months old until I select it) and there are dozens of bugs like this making the app borderline unusable. I hope you (the developers) listen to your users and make some big changes or you will lose a bulk of the people supporting you. For now, this years-long user will be deleting your app out of frustration. I hope some things change, and maybe I’ll come back to using it again in the future if they do. I used to love this app and found it incredibly useful.

I look forward to your obligatory “We’re here to help” message.",1
218,"Awful! Customer Service is trash!: Are used to love offer up but ever since they connected with letgo their customer service has been absolute trash! I recently got a new phone and therefore don’t have my password for my OfferUp or remember it so I’ve been trying to restart my password and that option hasn’t been working I’ve contacted customer support and they just keep telling me to check my junk folder or that it’s an issue that they’re working on and they will get back to me shortly… It’s been over a month and I am just overly annoyed I’ve contacted every day with absolutely no help and at this point I just see myself looking for another avenue to sell! Thanks for losing a five year long customer!

Update: They responded saying We are always working on improving our product, service, and interface. We take all feedback into consideration as it helps us shape the future of the OfferUp experience.""

But yeah I’ve been contacting them for over a month and they haven’t taken that feedback into consideration and helps me get into my account and it’s just been nonstop nonsense emailing wherever they are no resolution",1
219,Scammers everywhere I don’t know how you’re such a highly rated app: I don’t know how you’re such a highly rated app when there’s scammers everywhere and fake accounts. So many people are telling me to contact them through email making excuses such as “the only way to contact me or my father because he wants what you’re selling they say is through an email” they are lying acting like they can’t look at my pictures or something. It’s so hard to sell because you’re not cracking down on these con artists! I cannot even sell my television because this happens more often than I deal with real people. I even had to sell my van old fashioned way on the street with a sign because I was fed up with the con artists here and on Facebook market place. Also beware of Facebook market place because they let a liar sell his car and the seller pretending everything was alright with the car. With my limited skills and my lack of having a mechanic to look at my car I took a chance and I feel like I got screwed because I have to repair the evap problem on the car and the belts soon and I have to fix the radios and door locks.,1
220,"PROBLEMS!!!!: It randomly started acting up a few days ago and so I updated the app then it wouldn’t work at all. All pictures were blurry and it wouldn’t let me click on anything. I couldn’t send or receive messages. So I logged out and deleted the app and re-downloaded the app to try and fix the issues but now it won’t even let me sign in. I’ve asked for help from the support 2 days ago and still have yet to hear from someone. I’ve sent several messages to the support trying to find help and no one helps. I’ve missed out on making purchases and selling items because of this. 
I read a couple of forums and people have said that the support people don’t help or try and fix your problems and they are RIGHT!! I’ve tried for 2 days now to fix this or figure out what went wrong but no one will help. Some app this is. I will be deleting the app and using another app instead. You lost my business.",5
221,"How does this have 5 stars?: Most people must not ship items because every forum I’ve read is filled with complaints about their funds not being available or withholding funds due to not sharing their Social Security number etc. I’m a fully verified user, I have my Facebook, phone number, last 4 of social, email, etc etc etc yet every time I make a sale it withholds my funds asking me to give them my full SS and my tax information which is ridiculous. They always eventually release the money, which is even more ridiculous. Seems like they’re trying to collect as much info as they can so one day if they go broke they can sell it all. Maybe I’m crazy. Anyways, just got an email stating my funds had been put into my account, surprise surprise, no funds. I did some googling and found plenty of others have had this problem. And the response times of the help service was multiple WEEKS with no help provided anyways! It’s crazy that they have an almost perfect rating. I’ll still use the app but jeez they could use improvement.",3
222,"Great app Now becoming to commercial: So I have use this app for quite a few years and loved that I could find unique things locally that I never thought I would be able to find. These things were unique and also affordable/free. I’ve sold quite a bit of things on here from plants to restored furniture and given away a few things on here as well, but as of this year 2024 and last part of 2023 it has begun to have ads and small businesses have started to post on here. Like storefront businesses non-small people trying to get their start of businesses or your average Joe trying to sell their grandmas antiques. As of right now, I don’t necessarily have a problem with it.  The above reasons are impacting how often I use it because of the pop-up ads and small businesses that end up making everything more expensive then the app would have normally been and It is becoming harder to find more bargains than anything which is why I originally downloaded the app. Still a good app.",3
223,"Long time seller/buyer: The app is great. I wish there were two things thats worked - swiping on posts, and more proactive action taken when encountering a scammer/thief etc… as it is you can open a post but you have to close it and go back to keep going down the list of results. So when your looking at a whole category the whole process is annoying. Also, when encountering a scammer or thief, offer up will do absolutely nothing. All they do is offer to block that person for YOU. No corrective action is taken against the individual. I proved with with a person who scammed us out of $300. I reported her every which way, and sure enough she was selling the very next day. I posted a notice as an ad that she was scamming people and also selling stollen items,  up warned me and took my post down…. Good overall app. A lot of people on here, dont expect any support if anything happens. Thats why i dont buy or ship via the app. Their not trustworthy. Otherwise a great app to meet people and buy/sell.",3
224,"Developers; please read: Often the app shows I have 5+ notifications, I click on the app and there is no notifications. 
The notifications and messages are in the same category and they need to be separate. Dont lead me to believe I have a message when it is just an ad for items for me to buy. The reviews left for me by other people are blocked and I don’t know if I got 5 stars or if I got 3 stars.
There is no way to tell the app once you’ve shipped/dropped off an item. The user can message the person, but if the carrier hasn’t scanned it (which is the issue), it shows you did nothing and you get a nasty message from the developers saying, “if you don’t ship the item, we will cancel the order and refund the buyer” I had an item shipped, then it took a few days for the carrier to scan it and offer up just cancelled the sale automatically and refunded the buyer. The next day, the item arrived at the customer’s house.",4
225,"They will shadow ban you without you knowing it: I have been an OfferUp user for a few years.  I don’t sell or buy all that much from the app but it comes in handy.  Well out of nowhere I started realizing nobody would answer my messages and for whatever reason every time I try to purchase something it says transaction denied.  After contacting support they message back YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED for a reach in the terms of service policy.  First of all I have never ever done anything mischievous or unlawful with the app.  I buy things here and there and sell things here and there.  Well just know you may randomly get banned and they will not tell you the reason why.  I emailed back asking what I did and how to correct it?  In which the return response was YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED AND WILL NOT BE REACTIVATED.  Again no idea why this happened but they are unwilling to actually go through will helping me figure out what the heck I may have done.  So just know that one day if nobody will answer your messages your sending you probably got SHADOW BANNED.  I can still look at everything, send messages, just can’t purchase anything and nobody sees any of my messages.  Complete bullsh*t",1
226,Experience on offer up w application: It’s easier w app. The ppl some are very friendly. A lot of nobshows flakes ppl saying they want don’t sell giving u stories then changing their mind after u tell others sell pending bcus some are so so believable. Offered items for sale but sell to someone else n don’t tell u tho u knw u were first for days. I put it my take want two minutes immediately after post went up two days later I had to ask do u want to sell. Oh I sold it. This has happened 3 times in two weeks. Sadly but I have sold a couple things in over a month just not the response I expected from brand new stuff half the price of same item I post brand new online next to mine some w tags others in box never opened. All in all I don’t love it but I like offer up better than where I was. Market place two yrs. more fake ppl n flakes then ever.. I’ll give it a few more months n add more stuff but not paying to bump. Don’t like that n neither do all my clients who post or friends,4
227,Doesn’t work anymore.: I have been using OfferUp for a while. I am a trueyou member with 5 stars and have bought and sold on here. Never any problems until recently. For the past 5-6 months I have not been able to receive messages and don’t know if my messages are even being sent. I was i the middle of setting up arrangements to pick up some wheels for sale when I no longer heard back. I know that people sell them items first come first serve all the time on here and don’t respond to other buyers after the fact. But I have sent a lot of messages to other people about theirs items and it doesn’t even show that they opened it the message. And not one reply since the wheels incident. I can’t even find a link contact customer support on the app to find out what happened to my account why I’m not able to send or receive messages. OfferUp was great while I was able to use it but not so much now.,5
228,"Decent but could be better.: I downloaded this app to clear out my house. I do enjoy it because I can sell things at my own pace rather than setting up a yard sale early in the morning and not even sell anything. 

However after using this app for 2 months, I’ve ran into several issues.
1. I did most of the identity verification, but when I was going to do the final step of TruYou, it refuses to recognize any of my identification documents. I messaged the support team and all they told me was to delete and download the application again. I did as told and to my not-surprised mind, it didn’t work. 
2. After using this for a month or so, they locked my account for no reason. I was able to post items but they would only show up on my profile. For 2-3 weeks, I was unable to sell items because they locked my account for no specific reason. 
3. After my account was unlocked, I went to post more items. However after I was posting one, it would immediately disappear from my profile. It was as if it never existed.

Contact support team just sends the same generic message out. Delete, download again, log in, log out, or switch between Wi-Fi and cellular service. Then when they do respond, they ask for what the problem is again after you’ve already described it once or twice beforehand. Slightly frustrating. If these bugs were fixed, that would be great. But as of late, I’ve had more issues dealing with the app and it’s frustrating not being able to sell my items.",2
229,No support from OfferUp they allow scams: I placed an offer of $150 for a product a seller had for $200 which was being reasonable. I received no response from seller. I noticed later that the product never really existed and wasn’t a real product so I canceled the offer since I got no response and said I don’t believe this is a real product and I haven’t had a response from seller. Right after I canceled my $150 offer. I get charged $225 on my card for this product. I again ask the seller to cancel. No response. I contact offer up 2 times since yesterday and no response from offer up. I let them know what happened. And offer up is also ignoring my concern and hasn’t contacted me for a refund. I believe offer up who allows these scams is part of the scams that happen on here. If there is no support for buyers in this case. What kind of buyer protection is offer up falsely advertising? I have lost all faith for offer up and I just got scammed and offer up has ignored my concern and has done nothing. Beware of using this app. They lie about any protection and allow so many scammers to get people. It’s a sad world we live in.,1
230,"Adding ads over the years makes me frustrated: During my few years on this app I’ve causally been checking the ways this app has added ads into everything, from ads as items, to ads that immediately open even if you accidentally scroll on them, and recently a VIDEO AD as I tried to submit an offer for something. Developers, this is the kind of horrid thing I hate to see. 2 years ago I would’ve praised this app for a near complete lack of ads, but now I can’t give it 5 stars on account of the ads. I understand you have a business to run, but slowly rolling out more ads and then heavily pushing premium is the disrespect for the user base I didn’t expect. I really want to keep using this app as I love the clarity, safety, consistency, and simplicity of it all. Don’t be like the rest of the world with frustrating manipulation that makes the users feel like they are just objects. Thank you for reading this.",4
231,"Not worth downloading: Sellers don’t respond when you’re trying to buy something. I’ve had numerous sellers that either initially engage in conversation and then just stop, or sellers that don’t respond at all. With one seller, she posted a lot of Funko pops and I told her I would purchase 4-5 of them, we just needed to find a time and place to meet. She never answered me. I tried to message multiple times and can see she sees the messages, but doesn’t respond. So either she was a scammer or she doesn’t care about making a sale (so then why even post your items?) and this particular seller also, somehow, had a 5-star rating.

And even if you try to report it to OfferUp, they say they can’t do anything. So why would you want to use their app anyway if a seller can just bait people and then do nothing? Clearly they know nothing about user experience. I don’t want to buy anything from this app because clearly they just allow fake sellers to roam the platform and do nothing about it.

You’ll have better luck with Mercari and just paying to ship items.",2
232,"OfferUp‘s anti-scammer algorithm makes the app unusable: Like the title says, the update over the past few months has made this app completely worthless but so many people use it it’s to go to to shop. So all of the people complaining about scammers because most people are just too naïve and gullible and think that they can get a brand new Mercedes for only $1500 they sending their email and complain about the app have made this app unusable. Yes offer up in order to counter the scammers has enacted an algorithm that picks up certain words but it is way too sensitive. My account for the past few months completely gets locked out like clockwork after exchanging a few innocent messages with people interested in buying something I have for sale. I have to constantly go to the help center and send OfferUp a help ticket message in which they reinstate my account and send me a generic message stating that a technical issue caused my account to lock up. Happens over and over and over. If I could find a better alternative I would just completely delete this app. They really need to fix their algorithm filters.",1
233,Service fee/scammers: I really like offer up but what I don’t understand is why your fee is so high? 12.9% is a lot especially when selling items $30 or less and it isn’t fair that you don’t ask for a fee if the item is sold locally but demand a fee when the item is shipped. We’re the ones who have to go to the post office and do the work to ship out the package including printing a shipping label which can make things more difficult if you don’t have a printer at home. For some reason it seems a lot less of my items are seen by locals which would make sense considering offer up would obviously rather have their 13% fee they only started after the merger. And also the amount of scammers on here has grown exponentially since the merger of offer up and Letgo l. Almost every other message is a scammer. You need to do more to protect your customers from these types. You need to make it harder on scammers to make multiple fake profiles. I’m sick of being harassed by Thieves and charlatans,3
234,"Zero star if I could.: Got sold a counterfeit item, I get things like that happen especially on a private selling app. What bothers me the most is nothing on their end is done what so ever, even with messages confirming price and txt messages confirming the meet up and exchange. Went to the police and filed a report as well, currently still dealing with it all. Hopefully I can get my money back and this app has to pay up something. To top things off more of the exact same counterfeit items are being sold and no action is done, the posts stay up for days until some sucker like myself falls for it and losses 700bucks. When I try and list my item as similar style but not original(also for just $50) I get flagged and have the post taken down immediately. I’m not trying to sell something fake as a real item. I’m not trying to get hundreds for a knock off. I’m trying to get a portion of my money back from the post that was up for weeks from a “verified seller” since offer up, offers absolutely NO help. Offer up is full of S***. Now I’m stuck with a fake bag, can’t even sell it as a gag item for $50 bucks.",1
235,"Should Add Erase/Delete Button to Delete Conversations: This app is amazing. I won $59 dollars in 3 weeks! I love this app, but there’s one problem...there’s no delete button to delete conversations. For me I usually delete conversations I don’t know why but it’s my thing, and it irritates me that there’s no delete button. I have like 10 chats and only 8 of them are the people that refused to buy my stuff. It’s annoying because I have to scroll all the way down to the person I want to text, and it gets out of the way. Why having useless chats lying all over your Notifications? Why not add a delete button so that it would be much more easier to navigate your customers or the things you want to buy instead of useless chats all over the notifications. I definitely and urgently recommended a delete button that’ll be very very helpful for me. Other than that the app is fine and I absolutely love it!",5
236,"I love the app but needs improvement: This app is the greatest thing since craigslist. Ive bought and sold multiple items to great people who are honest to their word and I personally have no negative experiences because I am always cautious and thorough. I bought my Mustang with 100k miles for $2.5k a year ago and the car is still lasting me with no problems. Great purchase. HOWEVER, I HATE all the SPAM that I see on the app, especially in the cars and truck section. Even after trying to filter the results, I see a lot of obviously SCAM POSTS as they say to contact them over email and the price point is unreasonably low. Its saturated with phishing scams or car dealerships that put the total price as the down payment and it might not be obvious to inexperienced buyers. It would be nice if you could filter all the posts w an email in the description or put dealerships on (IP) probation for posting misleading prices. With these issues, it takes a while to find the real, great deals but I still love the app and hope they can get rid of these scammers.",3
237,"Once great, now completely annoying: I used to love this app and used it regularly now it’s not only annoying but exploitive... 2-3 years ago this app was awesome… At some point they started adding ads (I get it, I’m even cool with that if done right)… but they kept adding more and more… they basically threw any user experience right out the window and overwhelmed your scrolls with ads… even worse though is now they have some totally dishonest screen sensitivity or something where the ads apparently will click themselves… if you are anywhere near an add, don’t be surprised if it opens up because this happens often… not sure if y’all are scamming your advertisers creating bogus clicks or what but with the garbage experience you’ve turned the app into, I honestly suspect the answer is possibly… Get back to a reasonable add cadence and a user experience that justifies opening the app to begin with before the app does entirely… I used to be so proud to be an offerupper, now because of the add volume and sketchy add clicks, I go weeks, even months without even opening it… years ago I was in there everyday. Good luck…",1
238,"Trash app with ads and massive privacy concerns: In the search results are so many ads disguised as actual results it’s hard not to click on some while browsing. Some of the ads are predatory scam websites or badly rated commerce sites that OfferUp could care less about filtering. They also now added timed casino pop-up ads to this app now! Just disgusting

App somehow also has continuously bypassed my notification settings to not show notifications. Developers have found a way to ignore your settings and still show notices on my lockscreen once in while. I have notifications turned off for this app through iOS settings itself AND in the app everything is unchecked yet I still get them. Speaking of tracking, look at all the data this app collects on you in the App Store privacy info at bottom of app page! One of most invasive apps you can find.

Problem is this only real marketplace to buy/sell stuff locally. For that it is decent. Much stuff just sits for a while and ends up on eBay but I have had some success locally. But I delete the app asap when not using because of above concerns.",1
239,"Loyal OfferUp User Banned: I have used Offerup for YEARS now, basically since they first started. I have now been banned for “violating their terms if service”. I posted two items before suddenly my account was shut down. One was an unused Victoria Secret bra, the other post was a houseplant. I am really not sure how either of those warrants my account being completely disabled after being a loyal user for so long with excellent reviews and lots of sales that have made offerup money too. The crappy part is that they did this with no warning at all and no explanation. I received no emails from them regarding this supposed “violation”. There customers service is absolutely terrible. If this happens to you don’t expect to talk to anyone and be able to explain yourself because there is no number to call and they blocked me from even contacting customer support through their website. So I’ve probably lost my account forever, for nothing. If it was for posting an unused bra, well that’s ridiculous because other people have boobs too and there is no reason bras should be considered inappropriate, grow up Offerup.",1
240,"Beware of scammers!!: I have been using this app for quite some time both as a seller an buyer. As a seller, i have missed out on people who have messaged me through the app and inquiring about the items. Offerup didn't email / text me on those inquiries. I find that the letgo app is better on informing you. As a buyer, I have inquired a lot of people on their items, and it ended up that most of the items were already sold. I wished that the items would be marked sold because it is such a waste of time. Also, there are scammers out there who would try to scam you. I had a bad experience where a seller already confirmed the time and place and ended up not showing at said time and place. Seller did not respond to messages/calls upon my arrival
on said meeting place, and this seller even has 5 star rating! There is no option to leave a feedback for seller's performance on this app just a report user button.",5
241,"Very terrible customer service and app has a lot issues: Updated: tried to contact the email they replied here but everything was THE SAME. They even didn’t reply my email now. Worst customer service ever! 
Ridiculous app ! I got the same problem with everyone here. Constantly they removed all my posts and banned my account with no accurate reason. My listing was merchandise but they removed them as prohibited items & then they said I over or under price to manipulate search results while I did NOT. I tried to contact customer service both emails socialcare@ or help@ but it seemed it was nonexistent. After I sent many emails back and forth but I couldn’t touch to a human. All their responses were crap over and over by a bot and my problem was not solved for months. I went to internet & find out that a lot of sellers who had more than 100 ratings five stars like me were banned with NO reason. A lot of fake buyers from their bot and scammers. I better delete the app and use other flat forms like Marketplace, Craigslist or 5miles. I love Let go app but since they merged with Offerup so I had to use it.",1
242,"Why did you go backwards?: Let go was a great app….offer up….not so much…..you keep listing things that have been sold and are no longer available or are very old. Please make a cut off limit like 30 days…..if the item is still available then the seller needs to update it every 30days otherwise the listing needs to get removed. Let go “got it”, even Facebook marketplace gets it….list recent items that are actually for sale now and the moment it’s dated or sold it gets removed….period. I hate seeing search results for items that were listed 1-3years ago….like are the developers just lazy or do they like aggravating their customers? Next it’s complicated and not user friendly. Sometimes simple is better. I thought when you first took over let go that it would improve and how long has it been and your pulling a Benjamin button and your growth is backwards. Stop doing the opposite of what your customers are telling you they want and start giving the people what they want. Who does more of what people say they dislike???? Where’s the intelligence in that move? Cmon",1
243,"I know you guys can do it, so plz do!     :-): Hey there. Been a user for years, before the merger even!  Listen - there are some key areas that need to be addressed here. It’s kind of mind boggling that this app, as good as it is, still can’t do the most basic. 1, Sorting priority: at least at a secondary or perhaps tertiary search option. Sort by newest AND by closest location for example. I don’t want to see something from 4 years ago. 2, Aged Posts: isn't there a watermark or something? After 4 years of it hasn’t sold maybe it should fall off. FIFO rules should work fine here and it would keep your search tables concise and accurate. As well as help with duplicates. 3, Favorites: Should be able to bulk select/ move/ delete items. This variable selection method should be applied throughout the app, but I think we’d all settle for just these top 3. Your ad revenue must be amazing, so invest that capital in some MUCH needed improvements. I’d like to see OU replace Marketplace so no one has to use FB ever again.",3
244,"An Easy Lawsuit, Terrible Employees & Rules: I tried selling a nerf gun. And was permanently banned forever regardless of having hundreds of sales with A 5 star rating just because the nerf Gun is still called a Gun, nobody gave me reasons/answers until I said I would sue for having my information still & not telling me such info for almost a year. people sell tons of illegal things on there all the time it’s not hard to see & find that, but because I TRIED selling a Toy, Nerf gun, which shoots foam darts, I got permanently banned forever, regardless of new accounts made etc. which means they have devices pinged & Info still saved. Yet people are allowed to sell drugs, stuff for drugs, stuff for killing like suppressors, And “Food” related items that could lead to disease & meat that literally is illegal to sell or bring into the U.S due to the diseases it could carry/contaminate. Also majorly of the comments are bots that they purposely paid for to hide real comments & deter them like mine. I traced the reviews. If your a good lawyer & want experience, there’s a perfect case here for you to dig into & easily win Tbh, I could give you all the proof you need. It’s really not hard at all.",1
245,"Letgo WHY?: Ok I was on let go and offer up in the past and I stopped using offer up cause it was dead to be honest but letgo was good I sold things locally on occasion and it was a nice app with real people. After not using with app this year due to world craziness I decided to put a few things up on let go and I found that letgo was now part of OfferUp but I figured I try anyways. BIG WASTE OF TIME, that basically sums it up what was of this merger for nothing good I posted a few items up and was spammed instantly by scammers wanting wire transfers , personal info, and even by some random pervs wanting to chat. I mean really I was trying sell a few items not get hit on by random men it happened more then once and scammed. The few “real” people I spoke to talked up to the meeting set up then vanished so I feel like they were bots to since their responses were very similar. So even reporting the scams was not helpful as new ones would just pop up. It’s sad cause letgo was good but this combo of letgo/OfferUp is worthless I just pulled all my items and I don’t advise using it I saw items that were posted and had been there for months so I’m calling it this ship has sunk.",1
246,"Please help, I want to get back to selling but I can’t.: Offer up is a great place to sell, but one day my account got hacked. Whatever, I just made a new account with a different email. Things were going great until I realized that I couldn’t send messages without truyou verification. I believe this is because they saw the fraudulent activity on my other account and wanted me to verify my identity. I don’t find it safe putting my ID on here though, because if my account get hacked again they could steal my identity. I tried everything, using a different phone, different emails, nothing works without truyou. I tried contacting offerup and every time I get the response “we noticed harmful activity on your account and you violated the terms of service.” I keep trying to tell them it was not me, somebody in another state hacked my account but they won’t listen to my emails. I’ve made like 7 email addresses to try and make new accounts but nothing works. If offerup could please respond to this review with a way they could help, that could be great. I want to sell again but I don’t want to verify true you because I don’t want my identity stolen by some hacker.",1
247,"Some Pros & Cons: Pros - 
> Posting items for sale and searching for items is super easy. 
> Communication through the app is nice but there are times the notifications don’t work. 
> It’s nice to have the saved search feature, which will notify you when something that matches your criteria gets posted.

Cons - 
> You cannot see the price of the item unless clicked on (on my phone)
> You cannot filter out “business” postings (Sometimes I would prefer to deal with for sale by owner only)
> Postings don’t ever seem to expire, so you will find old postings (I’ve seen them as much as a year old) for items that the seller doesn’t have
> There are A LOT of flaky people on here that don’t follow through or make insane offers and I believe it is because they can hide behind a fairly anonymous user name so there isn’t much accountability (the older version of the online buy/sell/trade site had actual names and phone numbers and/or email addresses so people thought twice before acting that way). I do enjoy having some privacy but it would be great if people on here would just use some common curtesy. 
> The default settings for search criteria cannot be locked. *It would be nice to set a distance of “x” miles from location “z” and have it stay that way instead of changing it every time. 

***I use this app all the time and have seen improvement over time, so hopefully this feedback will help future modifications 😊***",4
248,"The App is amazing, the buyers not so: I only say this because I feel that buyers and the people who do transactions on Offer Up should be held to a higher standard or have their accounts suspended. I live in Northern NJ and most people that are using the app are from NY but even around my way I will get tons of offers, tons of promises to pick up the item ( I am a seller) and they all cancel or just don’t respond when a deal and a meeting time is confirmed. I don’t know if it’s just my area but I think the conversations between buyer and seller should be analyzed so that in this case as a seller, I shouldn’t have to waste my time answering questions, negotiating a deal, holding on to an item that someone says they are going to get the next day and then they don’t show. The app itself is great but if you are selling also put your item on Craigslist or EBay because this app has only brought me people who waste my time.",5
249,"Remove sold items: I love OfferUp, and I want to love the app but it’s missing the mark big time in a couple ways.

On the whole, it’s a very good marketplace. So far transactions have been seamless, people have been reliable. Definitely a huge improvement over Craigslist for buying and selling used items. I believe it would benefit from secure payment through the app.

But why, oh why, do they insist on showing you SOLD items when you are shopping? It does me absolutely no good to know what was up there a week ago that someone else sold. This might be a helpful feature if you were say researching similar listings to better price your own items, or looking for ideas more than actually shopping. But as far as I’m concerned it is a distraction and a huge waste of my time to have to sift through a huge number of sold items. Please, please, give me a way to filter these OUT of search results, both in general product listings and in my saved boards.",4
250,"Good but can be much better: Not sure how this app scores 4.8. I definitely use it a lot to Denise my rentals. But it seems like it’s made more for the occasional shopper. I like to whittle down selections into saved folders. But as I get more folders, it’s a real chore to find items as the folders are not alphabetized!! Whyyyyy? Also saved items to a folder get randomly placed inside the folder. Whyyyyy? Searching items is slower than FB Marketplace which shows the price on the listing without having to click. Swiping to the last item is cumbersome and sometimes doesn’t work. Same with enlarging photos. Also, to echo previous reviewers, deleting is not easy. Why can’t you delete multiples at a time and/or just swipe left. Unlisted items should show the same as sold in one place instead of having to click on listing. Everyone knows about this app which definitely fills a need. But FB Mktplc much easier. Let’s not get into the adds that are basically irrelevant at best",3
251,"Used to love this app: Ever since they updated this app it has been absolute crap. It takes forever to load, it uses all the resources on my phone. Also my Google Voice number is no longer good enough for verification purposes. Now they want my actual phone number and they would not let me send any more messages to anyone until I gave it to them. I was right in the middle of discussing a sale with someone when they did that to me. I don’t want them to have my phone number. They don’t need it. I have never done anything wrong on this website/service or any other one ever in all the history of time, but now “for security reasons” they suddenly need all my information. No, they really don’t. I hate how all these companies suddenly want my info but then they also never store it securely enough so that some stupid hacker eventually breaks in and steals it all and then my info is on sale in the dark web. And what is OfferUp going to do when that happens? Nothing. I’d be lucky to get a boilerplate apology email. So no, you do not need my phone number or any of the rest of my information.",1
252,"This App REALLY NEEDS TO IMPROVE A LOT.: I have had Offer Up for over 5 years now and this app is dying. Most sales are made through shipping but the system is terrible. When it comes to shipping, there is no opportunity to “CANCEL” as a buyer once the seller has “Accepted the offer”. I find this absolutely ridiculous, especially if the buyer states that they shipped within the given 3 day period but there is still no tracking for the seller. This always leads to cancellations after long periods of time that I have to personally make by contacting OfferUp when this was none of my fault. The reviewing system is terrible and should be changed where the buyer can see the sellers reviews made by that specific seller with any personal comments if they wanted to leave any. A lot of other apps like Mercari do this and it would make business a lot easier. Last but not least, what is the point of having a certain amount of stars if it doesn’t match up to how many it says you “sold” or “bought”.  Plz step up your game OfferUp.",3
253,"Disabled my account: This app is not friendly at all. I posted something that violated their guidelines (my fault for not reading) they didn’t give me warning and disabled account. Well at least tell me or remove my listing, Instead they just banned me. I made some sales with shipping and contributed to their market. So strict for no reason. Better to use POSHMARK or EBAY, much more friendly. I posted items against their guidelines before and they gave me grace warning and support staffs were helpful on chat, I was able revive and keep using my accounts. Not OfferUp, they just straight up ban you. UPDATE: Reached out to support but didn’t hear back from them. They leave you in dust once they disable your account. 
2nd UPDATE: i posted some fetish items and I realize now they don’t allow in their guidelines (Ya I been using this app for few years and didn’t read guidelines fully). I feel very disappointed that staffs didn’t take effort to educate or notify me or remove my listings. Instead they just banned my account. There’s other apps/sites that are less strict and more friendly to their users, not OfferUp",1
254,Great app but…..: So I’ve been using offer up for a few years now (possibly more). I use to love scrolling though and posting my unwanted stuff up. Now that they have updated things and require a premium subscription (or whatever it’s called) I have slowly lost interest in using it for anything. I’ve occasionally hopped on to see what’s newly posted until the adds pop up and then I just close it out and move on to other things. It is a bit annoying and after having this happen over and over again I’ve decided to leave this review then upon finishing I will be removing the app. I find using Facebook market is more effective and less annoying. Most of the items here are posted to n Facebook already so I’m not missing out on much. It was fun while it lasted but apparently whoever controls these things just wants to make more money. I like free and I like hassle free. I don’t want to pay for something when there are free alternatives out there. Thanks for the good run but all good things have to come to an end,2
255,"Need a better way to contact the sellers through the app.: The premise of this app is great but that doesn’t count for much when you can’t actually buy anything. I still haven’t been able to make a single purchase. I don’t know if it’s because this app doesn’t efficiently notify the sellers when someone makes an offer on their item, or if it’s because people list things and then never open the app again so their phone moves the app to the cloud to make space, but so far every single item I’ve offered to buy (at the seller’s list price) I get no response and the offer expires. I’ve sent out at least 50 messages inquiring about items and received maybe 4 responses. Even items listed as recent as a month or two ago.  It says “verified email” on each seller’s profile but there’s no way to to send them an email! There should be a way to forward an email through the app, so the seller has a sure way of being notified when someone wants to buy their item. I don’t have this problem on any other resale app, and it’s incredibly frustrating.",2
256,"Close app vs forced full-screen ads: I’d honestly use this app more if the full screen ads went away. I close the app 100% of the time when they pop up. Maybe 40% of the time I reopen it immediately and keep searching if there’s something I really need/want, but most of the time I take it as my timer and walk away. I understand needing to make money, but nope, I will never support this business model; I’ll take myself/business elsewhere. Or close/re-start the app. Also, super annoying that I constantly have to re-set that I only want local options, not shipping. Zero interest in paying more for shipping… that defeats the whole purpose of this app in my mind. I’d go to another app if I’m looking for stuff to ship.

Update: had a good laugh at the developer canned response to email them and they’d “take a look.” Lowered to one star. Read a bunch of other reviews, and literally EVERYONE on here is complaining about the full page ads- if they used their own app they’d see how intrusive and obnoxious it is haha. Definitely doesn’t require an email for them to “look into.” Good one developers.",1
257,"No accountability but nice to sell stuff: I am grateful offer up provides a space to offer unneeded items. This helps give people a chance to meet their needs affordable, network in the community, prevent waste and protect our environment. However, offerup is full of flakes, scammers, and individuals lacking integrity. There’s no accountability. There’s no protection. It’s the online Wild West where you risk your safety to save a dollar. The risk is both in the individuals lurking here and the complete lack of accountability in providing accurate listings without bait and switch. It’s easy to get hooked on buying and selling but the stress of dealing with the lack of integrity is taxing. I don’t know why they changed it from letgo to offerup but it’s still the same mess. The INSTANT adds flooding the feed is scary. It’s not possible to remove an ad unless you archive it or mark as sold. Good luck. Never give out your personal information, operate within the app, give your address out at the last minute. Just give a general cross street then when they’re close or on the way, give them an address. Try to avoid meeting at your home.",1
258,"Bans for no reason: UPDATED 2024: Despite their response to my review, absolutely nothing changed. This is a garbage app run by a garbage company. If you want to get harassed, stolen from, and then abused by scammers and have the company take their side and completely screw you — then download this app. If not, stick to literally anything else. 

Has zero human services whatsoever Scammers will get you banned if you don’t let them scam you. You will not be able to do anything about it. I’ve written in to socialcare@offerup more times than I can count I had a 5 star rating with lots of time and effort invested in it and had never broken a single guideline. To this day they still won’t tell me what I did. I got ONE response that said I “ignored multiple warnings” and in response sent proof that I have never received a SINGLE warning and they stopped responding altogether. Update: I contacted socialcare@offerup as asked and absolutely nothing different happened, they still have not told me a single thing I was banned. This company should not be #1 in buy and sell and Apple should investigate their practices and resolution teams.",1
259,Offers deleted: I had a whole page of my bonsai with about 1000 followers and I had sold a whole bunch of bonsai trees. I worked very hard to post some of my best work and had some very interesting people become regulars in my garden some amazing people came to my home and garden. I had a good thing going until recently my page was deleted with no reason or explanation other than your page was deleted because you broke community guidelines. I was never told specifically what guideline I broke or any other explanation just like that lost contacts content and business. Being a single dad out of work this was a critical income for my family. So I emailed them asking what can I do to make it right again or what can I do to return to offer up. Never got a response not a second message or anything just like that my offers disappeared so I figured I’d start a new one. Well that was a waist of time now i still can’t make offers or post my trees I can’t contact anyone and basically I’m Just waiting hoping to get a response so far this was my only option to write my review.,1
260,"Experiencing offer up: In the last six months I have been utilizing offer up to my benefit. This app has allied me in the practice of buying and selling and trading as well as played an majority role in my experience here. 
On my birthday October 3 I brought my first pair of Jordan’s ( black and yellow Mid Aj1’s) and uploaded them to this website and within hours I was receiving traffic locally from my city inquiring on how they could get what they wanted while offering something of equal value if it wasn’t money.
The beautiful part about this app is that  money isn’t King around here. However the skill of bargaining and hospitality is something that can get you almost whatever your heart desires. With that being said don’t rule out the value of money just yet. It is still the bottom line for most people who upload their personal items on here. 
So in conclusion my experience on offer up has been great , thank you.",5
261,"Review for offer up, July 2022: Overall, it’s a great app, and I use it all the time.
A couple things off the top of my head I would like to see improved or changed:
It seems that the postings that I get are very narrow and repetitive, almost exclusively based on my saved searches. I appreciate a customized set of postings for my viewing, but I would like to see a wider range of things, not just the items that I’m saving searches for.
Sometimes, when I have a notification of a number of new items for my saved searches, I will look at them, but the notification number at the bottom of the message icon does not go away.
As I’ve suggested before, in  previous reviews, I would like the back arrow at the top left of the screen to be larger, so that I don’t accidentally click on the photo, when I want to go back.
And probably the most annoying thing is duplicate postings from lots of people. The same person can post the same ad for the same item 15 times or more, and they just stay up… Serious waste of time, especially when it’s one of my saved searches.
And although I love the app and I think you guys are doing a great job, it seems sometimes that the ads are a little out of control. Especially when it’s a huge ad that covers half the screen… that really turns me off to the point of not wanting to use the app.
Thank you,
Taunovo",4
262,"Good, but needs some UI Changes: I used to use Letgo (much more catchy name), but has to switch to OfferUp when they took over. That said, the apps are basically the same and generally intuitive and easy to use.

Now that I’ve been using the app more frequently, I have a few suggestions:

1. Categorize messages by product. This would make it easier for buyers and sellers to track.
2. Automatically flag the first offer/messages in seller’s inbox. This way, if they have a lot of listed products and conversations going on, they can track them more easily.
3. Alternatively, you can give the seller the option to flag the first offer, with the ability to mark as accepted, rejected, or even to flag their preferred offer (rather than the first offer/message).
4. Automate messaging from sellers to buyers. For example, after one buyer has messaged about a product, any messages for that product thereafter can receive an automated default message to let them know they aren’t the first offer, but that the seller will be in touch if anything changes (let the seller configure this default message).
5. Response rate. What’s the deal with this? I respond to all messages within 4 hours, and yet my response rate is 75%... Is it a time zone thing? This reduces buyer confidence, and it’s frustrating because I am overly communicative, but I’ve been dinged because I technically responded the next day because buyers reached out around midnight and I responded just after.",3
263,"Great to sell stuff - but algorithm needs fixed: I love selling stuff on this app, there’s a ton of users and it’s easy to sell things quickly without any fees. I haven’t run into any bugs or issues using the app with the exception of the search algorithm.

Whenever you sell something the first thing you do is search for similar items to see how much they’re going for so you know what to price your item at, but then on the homepage when you’re browsing for items to buy it will ONLY show you items you’ve searched for in the past thinking it’s being smart since you “searched” for those items before.

It’s super annoying because I wasn’t actually looking to buy these things, and now all I see on my page is things I’m trying to sell myself to get rid of! The main homepage needs better filters and less “suggested” items under the algorithm for recently searched items. Keep searched items in the search results and don’t be so aggressive pushing those items onto the main page.",3
264,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE / MODERATION: Okay so I was using OfferUp for a while and had PERFECT ratings across the board for every sale I made. Unknowingly I listed something that was used for tobacco but was NOT used and was still brand new. Granted, I would never sell to minors and I have ethics and morales when selling. Without any warning, OfferUps horrible moderators shadow banned my account and phone information thus preventing me from ever making a new account and starting from scratch. When I emailed their customer support, their staff played stupid and stated “there’s no account tied to this email.” I showed several photos of previous sales I made with the account that they doubted existed. It’s such a joke that this application and it’s developers punish users to such an extreme without hearing out the full explanations from its users. LetGo and Mercari are among some better apps. Craigslist is even much superior to OfferUp. Be warned, they do shadow ban accounts and users and will play stupid. ID GIVE A QUARTER OF A STAR IF I COULD. Also, this is the first review I’ve ever written for an app on the App Store after owning an iPhone for 11 years. I’m glad I could shed light on this terrible app",1
265,"Glenn Benoit: I loved the app at the start made some good buys. However that has changed drastically after the loss on a couple hundred dollars on purchases. So Offerup encourages and outlines trying communications between seller and buyer to resolve first! I was cheated out of my hard earned money. I followed OfferUp instruction and got cheated out of several hundred dollars on couple different purchases. I’m a Slower learner I guess! One in particular I mailed item back to seller( at his request) at a cost of $49 dollars due to holidays and $189 item cost. The Seller never refunded my money and won’t answer me. Offerup has given no support on the matter when I did as instructed by OfferUp! I have the paper trail and text to support my claims again followed Offerup’s instructions. As is seen from my ratings I purchase many items here. I have very good ratings. I’m a person of my word and follow the rules!

   I don’t understand how Offerup allow people to do this sort of thing to honest people stealing our money with no consequences. I’ll be going back to Ebay where I’m protected and they support their users. Ebay! Ebay! Ebay!",2
266,"OfferUp closed my account without due process: UPDATE: I gave you a chance to redeem yourself. So, to answer the developer’s response (that they are “here to help”).. Uh, no, they are NOT here to help. They have bots that reply to REAL reviews because it has been over 15 long days since I emailed and I have yet to receive a response. They don’t care. So today, I’ve deleted the app that’s just taking up space. I will contact my bank and BBB regarding those charges and stupid run arounds. 

Original review: OfferUp closed my account and won’t let me create and use a new one despite getting verified and numerous transactions. Why? They won’t even say. No help available either. And btw, I will call my cc company for chargebacks because you closed my account despite 2 or more remaining purchases I made where sellers never shipped my item. You closed my account but at least I have confirmation emails to go by to file my claims. This is not an app for traveling people. Your account will get flagged when you access the app and purchase while outside the country OR in a different state other than what you have on your billing statement. Ridiculous!",1
267,"Great app to sell in person but shipping feature is no good: This app has been great since i started using it a few years back. Now they added the shipping feature and I thought even better I can reach people and sell as I do on eBay. Well I’ve sold several items and I can’t get my money. I’ve been trying to reach for customer service help but as you have read in the other reviews good luck getting a response back. I don’t think it’s fair that they take their service fee right away from the sale but you can’t get your own money. It’s been 3 weeks since I sold, shipped an item and still no payment. They refer to the FAQ and it states that you should receive your money 3-5 days after they receive the item. Well it’s been 3 weeks and nothing. I’ve tried emailing daily and no response. This was my next shot at getting some attention. Hopefully this will work. We’ll see...",5
268,"This app is trash: So many problems wrong with this app. The app kicks you out and if you don’t have the phone number you used to register the acct there’s no way to get back into your acct and they leave your acct open with all your personal info / credit card info. They ban your acct. if you post prohibited items but they’re still being sold through the app by many people. The items that you post won’t be viewed because of tech issues with the app making it pointless to use the app. If you get death threats through messaging the person who was planning to kill you are allowed to keep there acct open and keep posting items for sale. Good luck with customer service, they have no phone lines and don’t answer to emails and if you’re one of the lucky people who get a hold of them they just copy and paste a response.",5
269,"WORST APP FOR SELLING AND SELLERS: I had a decent time selling on OfferUp. They automatically take listings down immediately after posting a listing if they don’t “comply” with their policies. I attempted to post an item but they kept taking it down and all the posting was of a chair. If you get reported the system automatically deactivated your account and you no longer have access to that account ever again AND you won’t know the specific reason why you’re deactivated. OfferUp shadow blocks you so even if you attempt to create another account or use someone else’s account, you can post but they’ll take it down automatically again. They have no customer service except through email (who knows if you’ll ever get a response). I used to sell daily on offer up and my customers were always satisfied. I utilized offer up to pay for my livelihood and I actually enjoyed it. I was a loyal seller for years and had 5 star reviews with hundreds of great comments. I’m disappointed in how OfferUp has an automatic system and no live customer support. I’m no longer an offer up customer.",1
270,"Great Concept To Buy Things at a Discount and/or Get Rid of Your Things: Good concept, unfortunately, OfferUp can't control people who use the app. People have used the app to steal items or rob people when they meet up, people don't always respond or only respond to say they sold the item rather that they are meeting someone & notify you one way or the other if the item is still avail or not, major pet peeve is people not giving any descriptions of their items, such as size, dimensions or even what it is I'm looking at. There should be good customer service to voice problems or issues with the app & some way to confirm if someone should be banned or if someone just wants to ban a competitor or is just being a $?!@# because they didn't get the item they wanted. It is easy to get addicted to looking at & using the app though. New to the app & so far the people I've dealt with have been nice.",5
271,"Many Scammers on OfferUp: Used to use LetGo and had great experience. This new app needs to do a better job at phishing, guide users on what to look out from scammers, and find an alternative way to keep from receiving “Is it still available?” from multiple users the minute I upload an ad. And if I reply “Yes, it’s still available”, they immediately ask me to send then my contact details. I have not been scammed, but as a product manager, have been trained on phishing, personal identity theft, etc and these types of responses/activities are not from legitimate users. Also, for does a user account on have over 80 five-star reviews when it’s not even a month old? How I get Is it it still available questions keep coming from 15 user accounts many user accounts that are less than a day old, on same day I post a new ad? Must be bots instant replying to my ads. Same accounts asking same questions to same ad for days.  Will stick to Craigslist for local postings and other marketplace platforms for now. OfferUp to a product  miles backwards from where Letgo was. Users have to be more diligent on safety when using OfferUp.",1
272,"#1 App for the genre!: This app leads the pack, hands down! Having said this, there are a few minor things that the GUI could have improved. Such as, navigating from listing view, to viewing one’s saved or favorite items. Presently, it seems quite cumbersome to navigate as such. Another is not having to manually refresh the chat screen because the latest response doesn’t automatically appear in the chat thread. And another is the way one has to scroll through the listings to see items listed days before. It should just be a matter of pictured items being separated by dates, so as to allow a user to jump from one particular date (of a listing), to any other date, without having to scroll aimlessly through, hoping to get to the listing one might be looking for. However, as I mentioned, the competing apps, are no where as good as the OfferUp app. Hence, with a few minor tweaks, this could be a 5star app. Hope this helps!?!?!?!",4
273,"Unbelievable: When I first started viewing items on this app, it was good. There were genuine people offering good products, a reasonable price.
Now it’s full of crooks and scammers and everybody’s afraid that they’re gonna get scammed in a number of cases you see pictures for the same product but they’re for different products like someone is advertising a Mercedes for sale, but you see pictures for the Toyota in the same ad something has to be wrong there many times can you send a message you don’t get a respond to many dealers are on this site
They are depriving the good people of offering their products, and they’re robbing the buyers because dealers price would have to include the fee for the rental of their property and the prophet that they’re going to make versus an honest person addict I only wanna get rid of the product @ a reasonable price
You can no longer trust anybody on the site. This is really unbelievable. I used to be a real good side before it is no good, nor trusted
I just come here to view the pictures and see how many scammers are out there and the results are unbelievable",1
274,"Inefficient Seller Marketing of Items for Sale: This used to be a “Great App”. Now it looks like One big Swatmeet on an App. If and when someone finds your “Item Listing” the Question is Always asked, Is this Item still for Sale or Available? Nobody in there Rite mind is going to look at 7,000 pairs of Jordan’s or 1,000 pairs of Purses or Levi’s. 2.5 Million people have Downloaded this App. So over half a million people are going to waste time looking at Every posted item. Sellers give up on posting for Customers to see cuz that will never happen. You’re App has NO Marketing to Drive Traffic to Items. To drive Customers to Sellers at All. I have been a Seller since you’re App first Started 6 yrs ago. And Nothing has been Updated or Added but “Shipping to an Item”. Whopdeedoo!!!! That do really do anything at All. There would be 50 million users is this site didn’t Resemble every other Seller app site. It has become a Newer version of Craigslist. It is a Dinasoar. Just like eBay. Seriously changes need to be Made or people are just gonna find a better Newer wheel that works. Half a Star !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
275,"Seller beware: As a long time user of multiple online marketplaces I’ll give OU a rating from a seller perspective. Steer clear. It’s fine for a buyer but if you’re selling, customer service is atrocious and their policies do not protect you in any way. For example, if you sell a glass vase and the buyer wants to return it because they don’t like it, they’ll give the money back to the buyer out of your account. Sounds fair right? Now, if that buyer took the vase, shattered it on the floor, scooped up the shards, put them in a box, and returned them to you, guess what? They refund the buyer and tell the seller “well there are certain risks you take when buying or selling online” at which point you are now out your money and the item since it wasn’t returned to you in the condition you sent it out in. Or instead of getting the vase back, they return a box full of dirty dish rags. Yep, you’re out. Additionally, since their merger with Let Go and new design the app history features and such don’t even work consistently or properly. So, stick to marketplaces that look out for the interests of BOTH their buyers and sellers. Can’t have one without the other.",1
276,"Horrible App: It first seemed nice & dandy until I got a whole bunch of messages from what seemed like freaks. Asking to see intimate items and inappropriate pictures, etc. I report these accounts and it seems OfferUp never does anything about them. It’s so hard to contact them, by the way. There isn’t a number, an email, just useless articles that never get me to an actual person who can help. I posted at least 20 items from clothes to shoes to many other objects and to my surprise, they are ALL gone. No email, no alert in any way, shape or form. That is ridiculous considering I spent a lot of times and money posting these offers and all for them to be removed? With no reason? I remember also connecting my back account to this app which I have no access to now. It keeps saying “ERROR” to every option I press. I don’t know if it’s the people trying to scam us, or the actual company, but I do not feel comfortable giving them my personal information when their app crashes every 5 minutes but unfortunately it is too late for that. I wish I could give 0 stars.",1
277,"Positive, Negative, Posative: Positive: 
The app is intuitive “easy to use,” and the messaging interface makes it easy to contact sellers.

Negative:
You must pay $1.99 everytime (if you choose) too bump your listing to the top of all the listing once it’s dropped down to bottom of all the listing. Usually your listing will get more views if it’s near the top. Also there are advertisements for items being sold on other sites within the listings. This seems kinda corporatized to me, and it won’t help someone’s listings placement and sales in the long run.

Positive:
You can pay for an item through the app itself, which helps with speeding up the process of buying and selling and making a better experience for buyers and sellers. Lastly and verification you can go through to make yourself stand out more for better faster sales is awesome! Overall a great app for buying and selling.

Suggestions: 
Maybe a larger one time fee e.g. $5.99 to enable permanent bumping for listings and continued smaller fee e.g. 99 cents if a user doesn’t want to pay the larger fee to unlock and permanent bumping feature. Get rid of the advertisements from other sites. It seems scammy and people get the offer up app to experience offer up, not some other site. The money needs to come from somewhere, so the managing team to keep the app running smoothly. But let that money come in organically, not through other advertising sites.",4
278,"Rating system needs to be confidential, OLD items: Please make it so others cannot see the rating you give them immediately. By allowing poor ratings to be seen, we risk getting anger and harassment from the people receiving the review. Rating should wait a while to be posted publicly so that it is more anonymous. I also believe there should be more of a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” option instead of the star rating system. Some people believe 3 stars is a terrible rating and expect 5 stars all the time, while others think 3 stars is the baseline. Please update the rating system, standardize it, and make is safer to leave critical reviews of others.

Posts need time limits. They need to be removed after a month or so, unless reactivated by the seller, otherwise posts end up abandoned. There are too many abandoned items that clutter up active posts. It ends up to be a waste of time and makes it difficult to find what you are looking for",3
279,"OfferUp Supports Fraudulent Activity: I found out that my estranged wife was selling items on OfferUp that she had purchased using fraudulent credit cards. She was selling numerous items including an expensive stroller that she had bought for our baby boy. I filed a police report with my local PD and I also notified OfferUp and gave them the case number and the contact information for the police officer who was working on the report. The email I received back from OfferUp stated “Once we have the case number, our Trust & Safety team can help your local law enforcement in their investigation.” However, this was never done and OfferUp never helped. They never reached out to the police officer who worked on my case. My estranged wife turned out to be a con artist and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest back in 2016 for identity theft and opening multiple credit cards in a service member’s name. She has been committing fraud her entire adult life and OfferUp never helped to bring her to justice.

It happened right after I made a full price offer for sofas which went through fine but then i was blocked and couldn’t sent a message to confirm a time of pickup. I’ve  bought a lot and sold a lot and have a 5 star rating but that apparently holds no value to this company.

Let me explain:  If you put up something for sale and later change your mind and want to delete the ad, the app has no delete function. Rather, it provides an Archive feature/function. I was ok with this and didn’t mind it at all.  I thought it would archive my ad so that others would no longer see the ad. However, that is not the case. I continue to receive messages and to make matters worse, when I select “View public profile” from within the app, it still shows the ad under “My Offers”. Therefore, as a first time user, the overall experience has been a bit annoying. 

Also, it wasn’t obvious that the app wants you to use the Archive function to remove or hide your ads. I had to to Google “how to remove ads in Offer Up”. It was then that I realized that others had asked the same question and that the app wants you to use the Archive function.",2

283,"Unable to rate user and now can’t sign in: There was a seller that mislabeled his item and shipped it to me. When I got it, I immediately noticed it wasn’t the item he claimed it was. I requested a refund and the seller got back to me. After a few heated back and forth, I decided to keep the item as it was too much of a hassle to return. He gave me 1/5 stars which tarnished my 5 star rating. In response, I wanted to accurately rate him too but I wasn’t given the option at all. Wow. I contacted customer service and they said they’d help me get a refund but I told them I wanted to settle it but be allowed to rate him back. They told me since I had a claim open, I wasn’t able to....NOW I can’t even sign into the app. It keeps saying “something went wrong” I’ve tried deleting the app and the same thing keeps popping up. No matter which option I select to sign in, it still keeps giving me that error. The app apparently still works since my friend just bought something on her phone. I feel like I got banned or something....",2
284,"HORRIBLE!!: BEWARE!!! This is the worst experience with any app or company I’ve ever dealt with. I get nothing but fraudulent offers from non-english speaking people telling me they sent payment and submitted an offer but they didn’t, I never got a notification saying anyone purchased. Then they asked me for personal information and told me *I* was playing games. 2 people did/said the same exact things to me on the same day. ?? For what reason they do this, I don’t know, but it’s shady. So I decided to close down my account - CAN’T!!! Every time you go to the deactivation page, it tells you there’s an error. I tried to take my personal information off of the account - CAN’T!!! You cannot remove anything, only change it. I tried to find some sort of number to contact them directly and guess what?? CAN’T!!!  They offer no customer service support. I sent 3 different emails to 3 different email addresses, to which I haven’t received a single response. Now, I will have to change my debit card and all my personal information will be out there. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!",1
285,"This app is a joke.: If I could give zero stars to be able to write a review and have it affect their score, I would!! They deserve zero stars. This app was great, but then they started giving me problems. First, I paid, twice!, to have one of my listings boosted for the $20 and both times they took my money, deleted my post and failed to return my (all together) $40! I am in the process of selling my camper (which they have a section for, mind you) and as soon as my post is listed it’s taken right back down. A couple days later my account is no longer accessible as they have deactivated it or something. My account was TruYou verified, linked to my Facebook, cell phone and email verified, everything. I have tried emailing customer service on several attempts to no avail. Contacted them through their two separate twitter accounts and still nothing. All they do is take your money and leave you high and dry. Don’t ever try to get in contact with them because they have no such thing as customer service. I wouldn’t doubt if they went and deleted this review too since that seems to be their forte.",1
286,"⭐️EXCELLENT⭐️: To keep it short and sweet, offer up is the most SIMPLE, self explanatory app out there! This app is so easy to use that I downloaded it on to my fathers tablet! He’s 65 and has no knowledge of technology nor wants to learn it lol. However he is able to navigate offer up with ease! He makes purchases and conducts transactions daily! Flat out amazing app that don’t force purchases onto u or make you buy anything! Overall five stars here! From posting/Selling to buying& Meeting, offer up makes it very easy and so simple buy whatever u are looking for at the very best price possible! Nothing like eBay and other apps that’s charge u to post and make things so complicated!!! this app is 100% free with options to buy later if YOU choose too! If your looking for a good app for buying and selling OFFER UP is best in class !! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 👍👌💯",5
287,"Concept is good and the app works great, but communication from sellers is awful: In my opinion too many people post items and don’t manage them. OfferUp just leaves postings up indefinitely, so it’s difficult to tell if items are actively being sold, or just forgotten and left on the app forever. They’ve made it even worse because they’ve changed their policy and they stop noting how long an item has been posted after about a month’s time. 

OfferUp used to state “Posted a year ago” or 2 years ago. Now when an item has been up for over a month it simply sates “Posted” and gives the city, so it’s impossible to tell the items that have been left on there indefinitely. 

OfferUp should remove posts after a certain amount of time, say 3 months. 

Additionally I find that too many sellers do not respond to inquiries about their posted item. It’s so frustrating to be interested in something, reach out to the seller and never get a response. It happens way too often. Much more frequently than it happens on Craigslist. 

I also find that the emails I receive from OfferUp will say “We found these items based on your recent search” and maybe 40% of their suggestions are actually similar to what I searched for. The other 60% are just random items, seemingly unconnected to what I was searching for. 

The app is great in concept, I just think it should be managed better.",3
288,"Separate stupid notifications like “new sellers following you”: So many people I have talked with have turned off notifications entirely for Offer Up, because they keep on getting the annoying notification that “new sellers are following you“. because of the way that the developers have set up offer up, there is no granular level of being able to turn off notifications for just notifications like “new sellers, following you“.

The problem with not having granular settings is that everyone is turning off the notifications entirely for Offer Up which means that if you’re trying to buy something then you reach out to the person who has had their item posted for multiple months and they never get a notification message from you because they have turned off notifications a while ago to try and avoid the exact same problem that I mentioned above. this is a critical issue with the way that Offer Up is currently set up with its notifications and it is undoubtedly hurting the buying and selling experience.",1
289,"Cannot manage posts on website: The app works fine and may be good for a random item or two, but I discovered you can’t edit a post on the website. This limitation makes it harder to use OfferUp as a primary selling company. eBay offers everything and has a highly functional website. If OfferUp wants to have more of my listings they need to have omnichannel storefront management. Developers, not go down the road of Yelp and force yourself into obscurity. Because Yelp does not allow their website full functionality, I have stopped using the Yelp altogether. Frankly I don’t know anyone else who still uses Yelp either. Google makes it so much easier and it doesn’t force me to hop around app to app. Too much work to use Yelp. They let the user use the platform (web or app) they desire. Nowadays app-only companies are so dated. Maybe acceptable in 2014 but it’s 2022. Sellers need full functionality if you want to be more than a small hobby sale app.",3
290,"Horrendous customer service: I downloaded OfferUp, made an account, made my very first listing to sell my vehicle, and within 3 hours my account was banned for “violating community guidelines” I read through all community guidelines, posting rules and terms of service and nothing in my post or related to my account violated any of that. I have the same exact vehicle and listing descriptions listed on multiple other selling platforms and haven’t been banned from any of those, so if someone falsely reports you clearly OfferUp will take their side if that is the case. After emailing customer service to understand why all they do is send you a generic response stating “you broke the rules but we’re not going to tell you which rule or why, oh and you can’t make another account” This is apparently an ongoing issue for a lot of people and it is very well known how awful their support is for their users. I do not recommend anyone use OfferUp, especially if you are a more established seller because at any point they can ban your account without reason and provide you zero context.",1
291,"Good at first, but then disabled: Good first experience for a few months. Bought some stuff, sold some stuff. I like the messaging system and the general location map so you have an idea of where stuff is. As time went on and I saw a frequent heightened spam posts, I started reporting them as scam. This was a poor experience because when you tap flag as spam, the options change, you can’t proceed except exit or chose another option. So I started commenting spammer. Then after some time, offerup disables my account for repeatedly posting prohibited items. See their response below. I’ll be happy to use this company if they offer a better experience.  Giving them one star for the great start. Thank you  OfferUp User —- “Your account has been removed from OfferUp due to repeated violations of our Posting Rules. As prohibited items continued to be posted after our notifications, we have made the decision to close this account. This decision will not be overturned and opening a new account once your account has been removed is not allowed. Thank you OfferUp Support”",1
292,"Good until it’s not ; save yourself and head to Mercari!: I really enjoyed offer up for a while. It was great for local selling and buying, as well as purchasing nationwide. However, a lot of scammers are on the app and unfortunately I was booted off the app because a scammer reported me because they realized they couldn’t scam me. Since the scammer reported my account in an attempt to steal my money, my account was deactivated and the customer service team never got back to me after numerous attempts of contact. If you look on their twitter page it is full of unhappy customers who have also experienced similar things. It’s very unfortunate because I really did enjoy offer up when I could, but even after I did everything to protect myself, I was the one being punished for scammers with no help from the company. If you want a good app for buying/selling with almost 100% scammer protection guarantee, I would head over to Mercari. I’ve been there ever since and have had nothing but positive experiences. All purchases are protected, and you don’t have to worry so much about scammers!",1
293,"Shadow banning: I had no idea I was shadow banned, actually it’s been around 3 months now when I started noticing no one is replying to my inquiries and all this time I thought the sellers were just not responsive. Until one day I made a new listing and there were 0 views. I started to wonder whether there is something wrong with my account (logged out, logged back in but still no changes) and then I tried to research online- there’s actually a reddit thread about this, and so many users - many of them long time users and even 5 star rated including myself - that have been shadow banned. There were no notifications or warnings even from Offerup. I have no known violations whatsoever to the best of my knowledge. And many users also don’t understand why they were banned, and they also complain about the lack of responsiveness and action from the offerup team. So would I even make an effort reaching out to them? Maybe not if I’ll only waste my time. Time to delete this app as it is hopeless. There’s marketplace anyways and going back again to the OG craigslist.",1
294,"We want to OFFER UP not HOLDING UP: Offer up is an app that was founded on the principle of submitting offers freely (no need to pay or commit if you found a better deal or were able to negotiate something better with other users). I could not believe it when I realized some of the latest upgrades have now removed this feature to completely replace it by the hold for pick up option. This is a nice to have as an additional feature but not the only option! It is like founding a democratic nation only to forbid freedom of speech later! (and no, sending a message is not the same, is a lot less convenient!). The app is great, just do not change the basic, intuitive and versatile features that attracted so many while trying to enhance it. This frustrates users and you are risking loosing them to another app out there.",5
295,"Not entirely user friendly: I’ve been frustrated with offer up for a few different reasons. When I browse stuff for sale in the app, there is no indicator or price in the thumbnail, you have to click every picture to check the price. In the messaging feature there is no way to insert a picture, so if someone wants to see more pictures of what you are selling, you would have to give them your phone number, which is against the whole premise of the app. When you go to look at someone’s profile, you can see how many reviews they gave and what rating they have, but there is no way to leave actual written feedback for the seller, or others to see. This app is like stripped down Craigslist with a unimpressive messaging feature, and minimal filter options. The only reason I am still on it, is because other people still look at it. I really wish they would make their app more user friendly. As of now I would much rather buy and sell on Craigslist.",3
296,"Bring back Letgo app: I was an active Letgo seller and buyer for the past 5 months. Letgo did a great job of picking up scams and not allowing duplicate listings. It was also a very clean app with how it listed people’s items neatly and in a way where you could really see what was being offered at a glance.  Ever since OfferUp took over letgo, I have been extremely disappointed in the new app and experience, there are too many small pictures all clumped together haphazardly as you scroll, I have seen multiple scams where the same item is listed under several different users well over 10 times (in particular a used 2007 Jeep Wrangler 4 door in Raleigh area) , and have tried to buy items from 5 star sellers only to stop getting responses once deal is made and I ask for pickup location. This has never happened to me on letgo. The amount of ads in the search is also ridiculous, if I wanted to know what Walmart was selling I’d go to Walmart not this app. All in all I am not impressed and irritated. I want Letgo back, at least it had integrity when on its own.",1
297,"😡THIEFS!! DO NOT USE SHIPPING SERVICE!: First of all I want to say that offerup is actually a cool app if you’re only looking to buy or sale locally. I started using the shipping service and that’s when things went sour. At first I didn’t mind using their shipping method, but as time went by I started getting frustrated because for some transactions it would take weeks for me to actually get the money deposited to my bank account. I tried reaching out but they might as well not have customer service because in order to get a hold of someone you have to email them and they hardly ever get back you. Well on one of my last transactions I sold a pair of shoes for $280 after the shoes were delivered I waited 3 weeks and never saw a dime! I reached out to make a complaint and they deleted my account. I never got my shoes back or my money 🤬!!!! I’m Very upset because they don’t reply back through their terrible customer service email or twitter. I’m gonna contact my bank now I proof of the transaction that was money was never deposited. If you’re looking to sell I highly suggest to not use the shipping method. Sketchy app!",1
298,"Where is the customer support: I stared by placing one item, the item sold fast. I did not know how to start a new post so that I can sell a second item. I tried different ways and nothing worked. The first item was easily done because the system offered me a quick short cut and explanations; however the second time I had nothing. I figured out that by tapping on the camera button you can start a new post. I had to get on my desk top to figure it out because there is no customer support. I added my id, and confirmed my phone and email. I almost made the mistake to pay for “promote”  but I started having distrust. I tried to finish posting my second Item and sure enough is not working, I got network connection problems, server errors etc. The worst experience ever. My wife tried it and it worked for her, she didn’t sell anything but it worked. So I stared a second account, this one looks like it’s working but I don’t see my items anywhere others than my profile, lame app, lame customer support or there lack of any kind of support. I guess I’ll stick to Facebook and Craigs List.",1
299,"Carry something to protect yourself, Use your 2nd Amendment: I was selling my ps4 for $100 dollars on OfferUp looking for a easy flip. The person who responded to me went to the agreed location public location. I met up with the person to see he had a group of friends. They were trying to intimidate me before I could leave the group of friends and person who wanted to buy it stomped on me, beat me took the ps4 I was trying to sell. I was on the floor swollen, the friends threw fake 20 dollar bills that equal 100 and the person who I thought was going to buy it waved a gun, pointed it at me & said ‘you lucky I don’t feel like killing today’ after that they sped off in their car. 

After this altercation I will not be using OfferUp, I gotten swollen beat and the police will not do anything because it is petty theft, there isn’t enough evidence to find them , & the guy who who made the account deactivated it. Then I report it to OfferUp for them to say that I didn’t follow their guidelines. This app clearly does not care about safety & for that I learned my lesson. Keep your guard up people.",1
300,"Great virtual garage-sale-like flat form: I recently downloaded the OfferUp app because we have accumulated certain gifts given to my kids when they were young and also new unused house itens and appliances that we no longer has use for them or have extra supplies of so I decided to do garage sales until eventually I opened an account here and it’s been a big help to let go of things and help others save as well. You let interested buyers know of your availability when you can sell, while working your regular job same time. You’re your own boss setting your date, time and price you’re willingly happy to sell. Like any buy and sell transaction, take personal safety and caution very seriously only doing your business on known safe public place and during bright daytime hours and treat every prospect buyers with respect and practice the golden rule for your profile rating.",4
301,"PRICES ARE NOT DISPLAYED  IN SEARCH RESULTS: First, Offerup forces users to download their app to post items instead of allowing items to be posted through web also. However, my main issue is the way they changed the interface of way the listings are displayed. The prices are not displayed in search results as they are when searching using web, but the prices are displayed on the plethora of ads that are included in search results. I WILL NOT BE clicking on each item just to see what the price may be, therefore  I do not use the app to search for items.  I use the web as much as possible to make viewing search results more convenient and faster compared to using the app. What is the point of the filters if users can’t even view the prices of items without opening each listing??  Also there is a big problem with listings that are sometimes years old and abandoned, but yet still clog up the search results also. Offerup is well aware of these issues as they have been pointed out before by other users also. Do better!",1
302,"Rife with scammers and trolls and years old listings that no one will respond to.: This app will give you so much unneeded stress. 9/10 the seller won’t respond. Even though you have it sorting newest to oldest they don’t put it in that order and you may see a three-year old listing up in the first place and then in the sixth place you’ll see one that was posted hours ago. They don’t list any prices until you actually tap the listing. And more often than not if a seller accepts your shipping offer they will just stop replying to you and never ship anything and you’ll have to wait for at least a week for OfferUp to refund your money. I don’t even understand why anybody would do that unless they’re just trying to troll strangers on the Internet for no reason, there’s no way that they can possibly benefit off of doing this but yeah it happens so often I’m so done with this app good luck ever getting ahold of customer service at offer up they are nonexistent. For all intents and purposes this app is automated and doesn’t have a single soul actually over looking it.",1
303,"Good app...too many unresponsive users: It might seem unfair to let the fact that so many users on this app never respond affect my review of the app itself, but what good is finding great deals on an app, if the people who claim they are selling never respond and you can’t buy from them anyway? I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve found a great deal on OfferUp and sent messages or even straight-up offers to buy an item for the full asking price and not received any response from the seller. I wish the app would figure had a better way to ensure that its listings are legit and current...maybe have listings auto-deleted after a few weeks so the seller has to keep re-listing their items and pay more attention. All I know is I just sent 10 sellers questions about the same item and 3 of them offers to buy for their full asking price and nobody responds... this makes me go to other apps first whenever I need to buy something quickly, and I wish I didn’t have to",3
304,Let go please come back!!!: Soooo many ads it’s ridiculous! Post never expire which some people might think is good but why do I need to see something posted 3years ago? I’m pretty sure they’re not selling it anymore. Sold items also remain on your feed but the most frustrating thing is that once you click on an item it basically only shows you similar items. Can I just see everything that’s actually available in my area please and thank you!! I loved letGo!! It was actually more like an online garage sale. Offer up is not!! I used to also sell lots of stuff on letgo and not only have I not sold one item since they combined but I don’t even get messages with people inquiring about my stuff. Based off of how I struggle to actually see the available items in my area I’m sure people aren’t even seeing my post. I feel like I’ve actually lost a source of income and my favorite store closed at the same time. It’s so frustrating!!! I will give it one more try only because I really want to sell my stuff and I’m looking for that letgo high but I’ll probably be deleting my account soon. 😒,1
305,"Utter Disaster: This is the first negative review I can honestly recall ever writing. After wasting valuable time and money using this app, I feel a public service duty to warn legitimate, considerate and professionally-oriented individuals of my experience.  In short, I wasted over a week of time and a significant amount of money promoting a item for sale on OfferUp.  In return I was subjected to nearly certain attempted scams, multiple missed set meeting times by an alleged buyer and a firm deal that was broken last minute after a tremendous amount of time spent dealing with just that one user.  To top it off, although OfferUp encourages reporting such incidents and asks for additional details along with the entire documented record of the facts which all went down in the company's messaging system, OfferUp's final response to my detailed complaint was a generic email essentially stating that they are continually looking for ways to encourage users to act with a semblance of common courtesy and professionalism.  I actually ended up selling that exact item on their competitor 2 days ago. Words cannot describe how negative my experience with OfferUp was.",1
306,"Too many ads: The old OfferUp was beautiful and glorious. Since it merged or purchased letgo, I believe that’s what the developers or whoever was in charge of this app did, was they let go of their devotion to ensuring that this app stayed useful and relevant. The large mandatory ads that cover the entire screen of your phone while using the app have become cumbersome. To new users of this app it can be a complete turn off and no thanks when they see that large glaring annoying ad. It is almost 2024. There are new ways to advertise that actually work. Forcing people to click on your ad for something they do not want is a bit much. Hiding ads within the search results is one thing (yet it’s still dubious in nature) but blasting screen dominating ads is a whole another level. I used to use this app daily. Now I open it once in a blue moon. If everyone else gets that feel then this app is headed deep down into the abyss of emptiness where other has been apps now crawl around scrounging for scraps",2
307,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON OFFER UP!: This platform is a joke! I have some BMW exhaust down pipes for sale and have used Offer Up in the past to sell other car parts so I thought I would try Offer Up again. I submitted my post and it was deleted within 45 minutes because it was against there “guidelines”. I reposted after going to another users post on Offer Up that was selling a similar product that had been up for a week and followed their wordage exactly but with my BMW model and info…..within the day it was deleted yet again!! Apparently Offer Up thinks my BMW high performance DOWNPIPES are considered to be drug related and against their guidelines. SMH!! 
What a joke!! If someone is going to use a 6” x 3’ metal pipe for drugs is not from this era!! Whoever decides what is against their guidelines and what isn’t……really should get out more. Go for a walk, go sightseeing, dance with the birds but do something!! That’s probably against their guidelines too) Bottom line….you will have better luck going back to the old days and using the newspaper and a smoke signal to sell your items!!",1
308,"Buyers and sellers: Offer up is A good app. For the majority it’s really awesome for getting your items out there to sell. Sometimes you get the ones that string you along and set everything up to be picked up and hold the item. Then you never hear from them again. I also went to pick up an item to buy and they never answered me back when I told them I was at the location. Now if there where penalty of using the app when people did that so hopefully it wouldn’t happen anymore for the more serious sellers and buyers this app would be pretty much flawless. But it’s always nice to see items that are priced to sell instead of people that are firm at 85-90% of what it costs brand new. 
Why not spend the extra $10-$50 for a warranty if your not gonna get it for a good price. I was raised on the old saying I guess. 
Half price if it’s used. Yes the old half price rule. lol  thanks OfferUp",4

Screen goes blank after hitting search for an item. I have to close out the app and retry over and over to no avail. Same with trying to post an item for sale. Blank white screen, close out the app, start over. 

The other day I tried posting an item and as I was typing a description the screen would slowly rise into blank space so I would have to close the app and reopen it almost a dozen times to finally finish what I was typing. Then, today I was searching for similar items to what I’m selling and after hitting search I would get stuck on this blank white screen again, unable to get it to go away without closing out the app. So now I can’t search any items at all because the entire screen just goes blank after hitting search.",3
310,"If it’s not broke don’t fix it: Ok so I’m experiencing the new update today for the first time. Major layout change and changes within the features of the app. One thing I like that has changed is now when I click someone’s message and get out that message it doesn’t scroll all the way to the top anymore. However one thing I don’t see so far is the hidden notifications???? Where are the hidden notifications? If it was taken off I don’t like that. I also am not fond of the multi select to delete multiple messages at the same time. Pls put that back!!! That should’ve been left alone. Pls don’t turn this into a platform like eBay. That’s the last thing me personally I would want. Keep it how it’s always been because too much is being put into this buy sell app. This is supposed to be like a safe craigslist. Pls put the hidden notifications selection back if it’s not there and leave it alone. Don’t change no more!! Leave the app functions ALONE, Thanks!",3
311,"It works but not amazingly: The 3 biggest complains I have with their selling platform are.
1) dead listings - There are tons of listing that have been on there for years! Which means the buyer forgot about the app, has overpriced it or sold it and never changed the listing cluttering the search with lots of bad listings. Change it so listing have to be revised after some time period?
2) Selling fee - they charge the same as other big companies (eBay) yet have a lot less users. I have listed the same item on OfferUp and eBay at the same time and 90% of the time they sold on eBay first.
3) Can’t avoid shipped items - there are 3 options when buying something “Shipping” “Pick up” or “All” all 3 settings work great until you pick “Pick up” which should give you only items that you can drive to and pick up. Scroll down just a little and they start throwing things in that only ship, NO! STOP! I don’t want them! 
They might have the most downloads but not the most users.",3
312,"Awesome but has one big issue: I use the app all the time, it’s great and I love it, but I am always eagerly awaiting an update to fix a problem that never should have been there in the first place! What happens is, on your favorites tab, if you just save a bunch of stuff and then go look at it later like I do, by the time you go to look at it a lot of it is already sold or unlisted. Here is where the problem comes in, in order to remove these listings that are already sold from your favorites list you have to scroll down to find them and open them and unclick the little heart. Then when you go back it will scroll you all the way back up to the top of your list. Then you have to scroll allllllll the way back down to unfavorite another. It has taken me several hours to clean out my favorites list because as someone who flips computers there is often up to 200 different items on my favorite list.

I’ve been having technical difficulties with logging in for 2 days now to the point where the app does not function AT ALL, and I’ve been contacted twice only to be told that they received my complaint and someone would get back to me. How do they have the time to tell me that but not the time to resolve the issue? It’s completely ridiculous. It also took me a solid 30 minutes to even find the information on their website about who to contact in he event of technical difficulties. At this moment the app is completely useless to me and I’m extremely disappointed as I not only use this app to search for items to buy, but had intended to list 15+ products to sell, and I cannot do either of those things, which is the main purpose of this app. It is also not just an update issue because I had the problem before and after the most recent update.",2
314,"This app is okay. . . Could improve: This is a great app and has helped me sell many items, but I see a couple issues with how it runs. 

Only a set number of people get to see the item I’m posting which leads me to have to post several of the same thing to get the person that wants that item to see it. Others also have this issue and it can be challenging to sell the things that need to be sold. 

If you were to get this app, some items might sell quickly, but other items will sit there for a long time before anyone even inquires you about it. Patience, in this case, is testing.

I know that this process is put into place so people have to pay money to have more people see it, but it can be quite annoying at times. 

I like the rating and verification system, it helps buyers and sellers have an idea about the reliability of the person. 

After letgo and OfferUp combined, less of my items have been getting purchased. 
Personally, I miss letgo because of its layout, decent sized community (without being too less or too little) and it’s review features. I hope OfferUp starts to include some of the letgo features to make it easier to sell the items that need to be sold. 

This is my long winded way of saying that it’s a great app if you can be patient and be okay with stuff you want to sell sitting in your house for a while. 

Have a nice day/night :)",3
315,"Suspended Account without Reason: For the two weeks I had it, the app was easy to use. That’s where the good ends. Support is terrible. I received a notification that my account had been suspended out of the blue for “violating the community guidelines” but they did not list what community guidelines I violated. I only had two listings up all of which had been up for two weeks without incident. I have never communicated with any buyers. Both of my items are real items that I was selling. I think it would be more helpful to tell users the problem first—for example, if one of my posts violated the rules, for them to take down that post and say why without suspending the entire account! You lose all of your posts, which for people that may not have a copy of what they wrote (I did, so I’ll live) could cause them to have to do more work to measure the item or remember what specific pictures and description they wrote. This is bad business, and it has ruined my day. I will be telling everyone to avoid OfferUp as they do not have transparency.",1
316,"Good but needs to better about scammers: I've been using this app for about a month now. Overall a great and easy way to buy or sell things locally. I haven't had to ship anything yet so I cannot comment on that aspect. User interface is fairly easy to get accustomed to and navigate. A little bit of a learning curve when starting out but after a few transactions you get the hang of it.

It would be nice to see a tutorial for beginners about the process of buying and selling.

Overall pleased with this app. However, scammers seem to run rampant on this platform. The amount of scammers and phishing (asking for address or personal info) posts I see is troublesome and makes me think that they are succeeding. On a daily bases I report at least a dozen of posts and users who are clearly out to scam or obtain personal info. 

The developers need to introduce a way that will stop people from posting ads that are not verified. Another solution would be to auto flag posts that seem suspicious and warn the user that the post has been marked so so as to not give out any personal info. Craigslist has an automated feature that removes post that are not relevant to a particular city based on IP addresses. Another suggestion is to make shipping products unavailable to a user unless they submit verifiable photo id. 

Please developers!!! 
please help stop innocent folks from having their identities stolen or getting taken advantage of.",3
317,"Garbage: At this point this app is garbage. So many fake profiles and bots on the app it doesn’t even make sense. It’s like a 5 year old is controlling this app. The amount of ads is insane I don’t think anybody can go without accidentally clicking on at least one. You don’t see the price UNTIL you click on the item. App Support? Customer Service? Not sure if they believe in them. The ONLY service you can use is the Unreliable, Slow, Awful USPS. Otherwise you don’t get paid. Instead of letting you choose your own service. Or at least giving you another option. I had a package picked up 8 hours ago and it has not been updated in Offerup yet. The Sellers fee is pretty high given how poorly this app is run. Sometimes listing get taken down randomly which is funny because scammers have a million of the SAME item listed. Not sure if the people who run this app actually think or..? There’s no way they can think this app is in anyway good. Tried messaging the app developers at the email they said to. Almost two weeks No Response.",1
318,Please fix the bugs and fix your customer service: There are many bugs in this app that need to be fixed. When I go to my messages section and swipe down to load messages. I get a message that says: something went wrong. An unknown error has occurred. When I go to the notification section. When I swipe down to load notifications I get the same message. When I go to the selling section. I get a message that says: network error  we were unable to load your offers. Please tap the button below to retry. I press that button and get the same error message. This also happens when I go to the buying section. I also can’t sell anything on this app. Because when I post my item that I’m selling. It doesn’t show up in the app. Please fix these bugs. The app is useless now until these bugs are fixed. Also when I have tried to use customer service. I send in my complaint and get connected to someone. Then when they say they are transferring me to someone else. I don’t get transferred. Your customer service should be up to par with Amazon’s customer service.,1
319,"Anything for a hit, real or immaginary: They will do anything to make it appear someone is using the system. Increased hits means increased adv revenue. Unfortunately for the user, excuse me I ment to say the buyers! they do anything to make the numbers go up. Each time you visit your own adv, if look you closely you will notice the system records a hit like an actual interested buyer. Then they wonder How can we use this glitch to our advantage. Put a tick on the offerup icon so people will think they have an interested party. But when you open the app there is no email. Five hours passed before a new email appeared on the system, but they got the hit for me checking all my adv to see who emailed me.

They have dumbed down the search capabilities You must see it all, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Not to mention all the extra time you must expend plowing through it all the junk you didn't want to see. This use to be a fun system just to browse, its such a time waster with all the commercial advs I never browse anymore. My purchased has crash as have my sales",1
320,Thanks App Developers!!!! This is Perfect: One this can we assure that location is matching sellers location or meet up location... often see people selling items for other people and you have to go to the friends house cuz the item is there or call a phone number and deal out the app. Having  location updates once seller arrives at location would help relieve risk factors and insure safety and secure more sales. I have turned down a few good sells cuz of said reasons. Also it would be courteous to tell buyer that the amount they offer should be the amount they bring a few sells I have had from here and other apps is the amount agreed upon is not the amount I receive and I go out my way to set up meeting times so it’s even more frustrating if I have to turn the sales down. Thanks for listening to a person that cares ! Thanks again for this app.,5
321,"Love it: This app is really awesome. I’ve been on this app for like 6 years. I’ll continue to use this app forever. (I think) Anyways I would give it a perfect 5 star rating. HOWEVER! since the last update they changed minor things, but one thing that is probably a minor thing for most users it’s kind of a biggie for me. I’ve worked with other buyers from this app multiple times. In other words I’ve bought from other users multiple times. And it use to be easier to keep up with those followers. Because OfferUp use to have a tab where I can click on my followers or following. That NO LONGER EXCIST. If you like someone’s page you can no longer follow them. You can click on something you like and that’s a quick way to get navigated back to the user persons page. Either way it’s weak. I need my following and followers tabs back.",5
322,"Remove my account: After reaching out to offer A several times regarding my account being removed, I had outstanding five star ratings. I have always been loyal to the back and respectable. I was recently scammed, and the only thing I can think of is that I made a post in regards to the scammer making other buyers be aware of this person. I didn’t want somebody to fall back down to be scammed, I reached out several times to remove the ban and just keep getting the same generated email. This was A soul revenue for my family. I am so disappointed in how handy situations I could only assume that the other gentleman who is scanning peoples account was removed I can’t even tell at this point I am hoping all was done to me was at least telling him because that was very wrong what he is doing and what he did be aware of this platform deals with situations as they see fit not fair your account will be removed and all credibility. I feel that I was treated wrongly and will never recommend opera to friends and family. I recommended to countless people.",1
323,"Ads just to browse? Don’t alienate buyers!: I’ve bought many things through OfferUp and sold a few.  Often I would just browse and sometimes come across something I wanted to buy.  I noticed in their latest update that there are now ads I have to watch in between browsing. This is irritating and certainly not something I’m willing to do if I’m just browsing and don’t need something specific. I also noticed they want me to pay for a subscription now to remove those ads.  I suggest the developers take a best practice from ebay’s early days as they developed best practices for a successful marketplace: if there is ever a business decision that poses a conflict between sellers and buyers, you make it better for the buyers as a healthy base of buyers is necessary for the platform to exist at all.  I was sad to delete the app after that update, but I hope many folks did the same so OfferUp’s product owners get the message.  If they correct this poor decision I’ll happily come back, it’s a good platform helping communities save money and reuse unwanted items…",1
324,"I don’t know why I continue try listing items: I’ll start out with the good. It HAS gotten a little better with a few of the updates. The spam controls must have been beefed up. I used to get flooded with scammers minutes after posting, but I’ve only had one with my last post. For that reason, I’ve given it 2 stars instead of 1. 

The bad. It’s basically a pay to play business model. Sure, you can list your item for free if you want, but good luck getting views. If you don’t pay to “promote” your item, it quickly gets shuffled down to the point of obscurity. If you DO pay to promote your item, it still doesn’t get many views. I haven’t sold one item through this app but had great luck on other sites. The other bad is that live ads that you have to sit through were added with the last update. Really????

Kudos to those that have had luck with this app, but I don’t understand what they’re doing to drive the sale! My advice, try a different app to sell your items!",2
325,"Offer up is a great site: I have been able to sell a lot of items using this app, I am 57 years old if I can do it anyone can.  Things I put on that I think will sell sometimes do not, other things have sold almost with in hours of posting them.  All of my final buyers have been kind  people very grateful ,helpful  snd respectful. The one thing that can drive you crazy is when someone messages you with an interest and then disappears or fails to respond again. I appreciate the buyers who communicate well, are Truly interested and do not waste my time. When it works well I love it, when people are not courteous it makes me irritated. This site is like having  a garage sale one item at a time.  I actually posted a lot of things now, it amazes me how fast I have sold furniture pieces, I am getting ready to move, downsize. And , it has worked out great!",5
326,"Too many FAKE ACCOUNTS!!: Ok so I’ve been using offerup for years now and before they merged with Letgo,it was decent. I would post and real people would write asking about my listing, with some spam accounts here and there. But now since LetGo has merged I constantly get spam/ghost accounts asking if my listing is still available that I JUST POSTED seconds ago! It’s very annoying. They ask is it still up for sale right as I list and item. The profile has no picture, no seller status and ZERO followers. You can tell the account was just made. LetGo was really bad with that and now it’s even worse. It makes me not want to post on this app anymore. I just posted an item and instantly got 20 fake accounts asking me to use PayPal or another form of payment besides through the app to ship. Offerup should make it to where you have to verify your identity like the selling app “Mercari” so you can avoid spam accounts and wasting your time. Not happy that this hasn’t even been suggested. That way you’ll weed out the random fake accounts.",2
327,Needs one MAJOR improvement: I like the app and the functionality but there is one thing that makes OfferUp almost useless. The inability to refresh your listing and get in front of those “newly listed” eyes when you first login. There was a glitch in the app this weekend that when I edited my listings it was like I was posting for the first time. By “refreshing” I received hundreds of views on most listings that have been sitting there for months with 40 views. I sold 6 things in 2 days. I think I was averaging about 2 things a year before because no one ever sees the posts unless they’re specifically looking for it by performing a Search. Sometimes people need to see something before they realize they want it. FYI the promotional up charge function was a bust for me as well. Barely got any views and nowhere near their projections for the premium function. OfferUp change your function to refresh listings as new like Poshmark does as well as Craigslist(minus the 2 day wait for CL),3
328,"Easy, convenient, and great deals always!!: I love this app. It feeds my retail therapy fix, satisfies my closet hoarding thirst & without spending too much money. Also a great way to make a little cash while cleaning out some of the excess previous “must haves” rather than having to round them up and take them to donate somewhere. 
I’ve also met quite a few people who I’ve remained in contact with since our first interaction on the Offer Up app. So it’s great for networking. I would give it a 5 except nothing is “perfect” and just like every other app, it has its glitches but nothing too significant to complain about.
As for meeting up with people and things going wrong at that point, that’s on the buyer/seller to have some kind of “common sense”. Can’t blame Offer Up for your lacking of the ability to read people and situations well enough to know when things are leaning towards the shady side.... 
To sum it up....👍🏼👍🏼",4
329,"One star for no customer support: Go use Mercari or Letgo, who have a decent customer service and respond in a timely matter to your queries. More than that those platforms are not full of lowballing yahoo’s and Nigerian scammers.

Okay, so my account has been blocked and I have not been informed if the reason. Have sent several chat messages to customer support  and I received the message back that it was forwarded to some obscure department. This is now more than 3 weeks ago. I find this silence very disrespectful and if they are not going to unblock my account they should at least have the guts and decency to explain to me what the reason is.

P.D. After two months and more than 6 times to reaching out to customer service, I finally received a message “Your account has been removed from OfferUp due to violations of our Community Guidelines and Posting Rules.” Nothing more, nothig less. This platform will not last long if they are treating their paying customers like me, with 56 five star reviews, as some sort of criminal. Again, peope, skip this platform and go to Mercari, eBay, Letgo, Facebook marketplace.",1
330,"Borderline scam: This is about mindset. The people who make this up or not people that want to offer something useful to the community. They are people  whose mindset is how to manipulate you  to give them your money. Instead of honestly just charging a few dollars for the app and then you never hear back from them ever, every aspect of this app is  permeated with attempts to get you to sign up for something or buy something. Worse, when you do try any of their ""free"" offers, they are not really free. Instead of just expiring after the free., They require your initiative to cancel them. What kind of greedy, perverted mindset would even think of that? Worse, while signing up for the ""free"" service was of one button click it is impossible to find a way to unsubscribe before the free period ends. I looked everywhere, including my iTunes account and to date I could not find a way to unsubscribe. It is unfortunate that this practice is legal but to me,  making of service automatically charge or making it difficult to unsubscribe is a borderline scam and has been devised by ill minded people",1
331,"Horrible Seller Service, Arbitrary Account Ban: Basically they have bots and scripted bubbles to handle all complaints. I posted an ad where I refer to my competition as ""the other guy,"" and they took my ad down. When I asked about what it violated, they said I can't sell anything that could be illegal or used in a crime (in generic response form). At this point, my account was not banned, and I asked the ""rep"" what was illegal about installing an HDMI port in someone's Nintendo 64 and why I received that incoherent message. This was met with retaliation via Offerup blocking/suspending my account. Their response to my raising issue with this has been completely non-punctual, to say the least. Absolute trash in terms of quality oversight and service. Site doesn't go after a single person it should, but gladly blocks me. Go figure.

UPDATE: I actually pre-emptively addressed the Orwellian-named ""social care"" email and was given no relevant reason for the ban, only told it was discretionary and that I was forbidden to open another account, which is why I have reported this garbage heap to the BBB.",1
332,"Jarring adds, clunky user interface, and annoying notifications: I recently came back to OfferUp after a few years, and was really surprised when a pop-up filled my screen while I was searching listings- which was really jarring and off putting.
The saved item interface is also super clunky and won’t let you “un-heart” multiple items at a time, and the app is just not the most pleasant to navigate.
Lastly I can’t stand the notifications- I’ll get random app notification and click on them thinking they’re from people I’m buying from/selling to, but no, 9/10 times it’s just a random add- not even for something specific I’m looking for, just a useless “hey, come look at what’s new”
There’s no way to selectively turn off marketing notifications, so I find myself disabling all notifications and just hoping I don’t miss something important.
All in all, I’d say stick to other BST apps unless OfferUp stops the blatant and invasive cash-grabs and annoying notifications.",2
333,"Will kick you out for nothing: I posted “letters from penthouse” books that are not pornography, no pictures in it, just peoples stories. Apparently that is not allowed on the app. So literally no chances whatsoever. I responded asking why my post was removed and they removed me from the app with no explanation saying: Hi,
Your account has been removed from OfferUp due to violations of our Posting Rules.
This decision will not be overturned and opening a new account once your account has been removed is not allowed.
Thank you OfferUp Support

Such garbage. Also if you have an issue with a buyer customer support doesn't help. I had books I was selling and on my listing I said each book is $5, to let me know which one you want. This app doesn't have options like other apps where you say how many items you have, you just have to relish it and make any needed changes. This lady was harassing me telling me she bought she bought the whole lot of $20 books for $5 and didn’t see at the bottom where it said $5each, let alone her thinking $7 would cover shipping for 20 books. I explained this to her and contacted customer service  to refund her. They said I had to wait 3 days then it will cancel. THEN it gave 3 more days to ship out that I had to wait. So almost a week of this lady harassing me before I could block her. THEN the app completely kicked me out for posting books that is not porn and no issues on other apps. No warning just kicked me out. Terrible customer service.",1
334,"Update Ruins Experience: Please, please, please roll back to the old version. First, the way the categories are divided with expanding sub-categories is much too convoluted The older tiles were much easier to understand and navigate. The individual listing page was also perfect before, its now too long and requires extra scrolling to just to get to the description. The seller info should be placed back near the top of the listing and I liked how the price was overlayed on top of the photos area. Browsing through listings is also a less pleasant experience. The preview photos are now all small, uniform squares whereas before their sizing was dynamic and larger. But now it's too busy and everything is smaller. Lastly, the ability to 3D Touch/Haptic Touch to peek into a listing was removed. This feature was immensely pleasing as it allowed to quickly see the price of something without having to open the listing. I feel with this new app takes longer overall to perform simple functions like search or viewing listings. The old design also had a bit more charm, for what its worth.",1
335,"FYI!!: I love this app! I use it a lot. It helps me get some extra cash when I’m need. Or find things for cheap. But I just discovered that when you ship something, and you use their shipping method you have to wait 2 days to get paid AFTER the buyer inspects your item. Don’t get me wrong this is nice that OfferUp protects the buyer but what about the seller? I have to pay a commission for using shipping, I have to wait for delivery, AND I have to wait 2 days after the buyer inspects my item. I didn’t make any profit from my college book. I needed the cash ASAP. What if I sold it to someone dishonest? Who will protect me as the seller? What if they damage my expensive college book and decide to return it? I’m hoping I sold it to someone honest (they had just opened there account. Now it’s a waiting game.... maybe something look into.
I’ve been using OfferUp for a couple of years now. I love the app but that I did not like that I have to wait for MY money.",3
336,"Offer up be Facebook marketplace: For some reason, perhaps because it’s called “offer”up I tend to get way more low ball offers on offer up vs Facebook marketplace. In addition, if my listing has not sold in awhile it gets buried In a pile of listings unless I pay to give it more visibility. In which case I typically delete and repost a new listing which is a bit cumbersome, as opposed to the “renew listing” option on Facebook marketplace. The other hiccup that I have with OfferUp is that sometimes buyers have significant lag time in their responses due to the fact that they haven’t chosen to receive notifications from offer up which can elongate the sale process and cause you to miss sale windows (like the weekend when more people are able to come and pick up an item).That said, I’ve still had luck selling and buying items with offerup and I appreciate the assurance of buying from a screened seller or selling to a screened buyer. Craigslist is a scammy mess these days!",3
337,"Rant/review: So, I just started to use this app because well just like everyone else that has it, I have stuff I really just need to get rid of. I’m pretty fresh in the system so nobody has bought anything yet but they have made offers. I’m hoping this goes smoothly. But honestly, right now I’m not diggin’ this too much. Not because of the app itself but because of the people. One thing I’m trying to sell is my prom dress from high school a few years ago it is currently put away to stay nice and the only picture I had to post of it was me wearing it. Majority of my offer up inbox is messages from guys being inappropriate. Pretty disrespectful if you ask me. Last time I checked, I didn’t download a dating app. I posted that picture so that women interest can see how it looks fitted, I’d prefer not having men come at me all crazy when at the end of the day I’m trying to sell this dress. Rant done. Ladies please be careful.",4
338,"Great platform but buggy: The platform is great and the concept is amazing. My only issue is that I keep missing some sales because of the notifications system the app has. I typically receive a notification on the first message a person sends regarding an item but after that, no notifications come in. I have had in the past multiple people reach out and I don’t notice until the next day or so when I open the app to check.
It’s VERY important that notifications arrive in order to coordinate a sale. I find myself having to provide my phone number to buyers just to ensure they can reach me if they have any questions.

I did go through the notifications troubleshooting steps and everything in my settings look okay. I do get other notifications from the app, such as offers for things I can buy, or the first time someone bids or reached out about an item, so it’s not my notifications.",3
339,"They stole my product: I shipped a product trough them to another person ( mind you it has been 3 weeks since the shipping date) I still have not received the pay for the product I had sold and just today the customer decided they didn’t want to product and filed my product as fraudulent. Now the person has a hold of my product and has not shown any signs of retuning it. (Mind you, the product I sent was worth over $600) I now have contacted the team through email, Twitter, instagram and have gotten no response as to where my product is and how to get it back. I know have to get my lawyers involved in claims to come after OfferUp. This is NOT the only time this has happened, they do not recommend using any third party apps like PayPal, cashapp, or anything. However that is because they charge a 7.9% service fee when shipping to your ENTIRE profit. I HIGHLY suggest not using this service if your looking for a reliable, responsive, high quality application to buy and sell your products. The freedom of the buyer is a bit enlarged and the companies terms are illogical.",1

341,"Don’t even bother, just use FB market place: I don’t usually leave reviews on apps but this one is just horrible & depressing. My account was auto converted over to this app after they bought out letgo and I don’t understand why a company would buy out the competition without implementing any of the features that made them a success. Scrolling through this app is like looking through a graveyard of for sale posts- letgo would automatically retire a post after 30 days & would give you the chance to auto renew the listing. Why would I want to scroll through pages of listings that have been up with no activity for over a year? Letgo also had a friendlier user base, this app for some reason is full of warehouse wholesale- I just wanna buy a used office chair from someone who lives nearby 

Oh yeah and after manually moving my listings over from what I had on letgo, I just did not ever get any messages from anyone interested… on letgo it would only take me a few days to get rid of something.
 Anyway… RIP letgo, I miss you everyday",1

I do cosplay in my free time, and there just so happens to be a cosplay of a character I love for a really good price! I message the seller for more details on the item... and nothing happened... You can tell if a seller has read your message or not because offer up has read receipts. They never read it... days passed and I gave up. This happened about 5 other times for other items.

I only sent about 7 msg in app and haven’t been able to make a single purchase (or sale) because this app is just so dead. :/ it’s really lovely, it’s got some amazing deals and it’s easy to sell, but no one is there to sell/buy, and that’s why I gave the app the score I did. Sorry offer up...",3
343,"Drives me crazy: This app used to be good and now you’re forced to look at other sellers “shipped items” and can’t default to local only. The app constantly runs ads which the easiest way to get rid of is to close the app and restart it because ads don’t align with the imagery, so even if I’m looking at something, the ad sound is running in the background.  The constant MoneyGram is really hard when you pay for one thing, but you need to now pay for another thing.  I understand that you need to have a pay but but I don’t need to be bugged constantly about wanting to upgrade to priority. Overall, the app works well though it does not make messaging easy. Organization of Messages is mediocre at best. The UI does not allow swiping between listings so it is tedious to look at multiple listings. it is very tedious to look at specific types of items. Overall, craigslist application is designed better than this one. it is obvious that the owners of OfferUp care more about revenue generation than the customer and user.",1
344,"This App Is Horrendously Slow and Backwards AVOID!: I’ve used OfferUp for quite awhile. I post here and there to sell stuff I no longer need, and I would buy stuff frequently. 

There are several grips that I have. 

1. The app has become insanely slow. I can’t even load a page or open settings without it taking forever, you go to tap on something and it takes a solid 10 seconds. Never had this issue before, and I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max. Totally inexcusable. 

2. Craigslist likes to do this thing that once you’ve had an ad up for a week, it will take it down unless you bump it. OfferUp keeps things on here from 2 YEARS ago. That’s just ridiculous. The person profile is probably inactive, and that thing you wanted to purchase? Non existent. 

3. Scams galore. I can’t look for a vehicle without them have 10,000+ posts of the same car with the same pictures, all telling me to email them. Or phones, same thing. You go on there and it’s absolutely disgusting. Filled with iPhones and PS5’s that are free because my son no longer wants it. 

4. Location settings. You should be able to select how far a car you want is away from you, not a maximum of 25 miles, that doesn’t even make sense! I want something  within a 10 mile radius, for example.  

OfferUp, this is ridiculous. Letgo was actually a good app with decent quality control. Your app needs to be completely revamped and you need to have active employees sifting through the scams.",1
345,"No longer a usable app. Sad to see: Last year, i would have given this app 5 stars. They have a simplistic and user friendly layout, tons of members, great verification system for creating a safer environment, and above all a great staff team that deals with scams, rude and inappropriate behavior, and general questions in a timely manner.

BUT
They recently have had a string of shadow bans (which you can read about all over reddit) and the support team refuses to admit to and/or do anything about it. These shadow bans are likely due to poor automated report systems and possibly even malicious user bots mass reporting, perhaps both? The support team basically just send you through hoops, blame it on device bugs and multiple accounts, and then just give up and tell you to wait for new updates. All while many innocent members have access to the app, but have no access to selling anything as their items dont show up publicly because they are shadow banned. Hope to see what was once a great support team figure out what went wrong :(",1

Then it would get unlocked for an hour, and locked again.  I begged for a resolution and asked what I was doing wrong, but no answers, just the same auto generated message.  My wife created an OfferUp account to help her dad sell some things and you thought I had a duplicate account, which was just brought to my attention and possibly the reason my account was getting locked.  I have missed sales on many items because I can’t message and I look like a flake. I follow the rules, I’m
responsible with my listings and I’m a reliable buyer and seller.   I wish the app would just work.

349,"Never friendly: Many “ratchets” on here. Waste of time. Ppl are cheap & rude for no good reason. Even when I try to make an honest sale, buyers act like I lied about the item & give me 1 star because they’re mad I kept my word and didn’t drop my price further after it’s already 95% less expensive than it originally was. And they wait until they pay, leave, and get home to complain so I’m not going to bother redoing a deal after it’s done anyway. I guess I think you should be able to rate your customers, too. Other people try to bargain by trading items with me that I never showed interest in and then start to try to clown my face while hiding behind images that aren’t even of them (sketchy/dangerous) because they’re mad that they’re broke and I have things they want I guess? Lol. Can’t bother with this anymore. I like that they don’t take a cut from the sale, but I’m annoyed that we can’t pay thru the app in a safe manner because I hate cash. Especially because I don’t want to meet these crazies, I’d rather then pay for shipping too! At least make it an option.",1
350,"Useless, annoying waste of time.: What a terrible experience. I’ve run into more flakey people on here than Facebook and Craigslist combined. After months of trying to engage these people I managed to make two cheap sales, out of numerous items I had listed. Not worth my time. I had a truck listed on here for over a month. Got dozens of messages from “interested” people who never followed through.  I put the truck on Craigslist and sold it in about a week, for close to my asking price. 

The spammy notifications (“We picked this item for you!” “See what your neighbors are selling!”) were the last straw. I deleted my account and the app.

This app would be much better with some kind of buyer reputation system. As it is, there seems to be no consequences for flakes, lowballers, and no-shows (other than the “we’re sorry you feel that way” report system, which doesn’t seem to actually do anything). If I could see that the person messaging me has a history of ignoring messages or not showing up for meetings, I would know not to waste my time engaging them.",1
351,"App is joke: I highly recommend people avoid this trash of an app. I have had nothing but issues since making an account, from technical issues with their own verification methods, to their own policies being a joke. The support team has literally been not only no help but has harassed me and messed with my account. When purchasing an item for shipping the seller is supposed to have only 3 day’s to drop it off with postal services or your money gets refunded, going on day 5 now with no item to track and no refund yet they reminded the seller two day’s ago but do nothing about it. When I reach out for help I get responses that have nothing to do with anything I wrote them about. I would love to post all the screen shots I have on here showing everyone what I have dealt with since joining this selling app. Also tried reporting this app to the app store but they won’t let me since I have no purchases through her directly, so much for the app store caring about their users getting treated fairly by apps they allow n trust!",1
352,"Charges sellers fees: I first started trading cards on offer up and I was liking the platform a lot. I sold dozens of cards ranging from $2 to $5 on the app and was surprised when I saw only cents being added to my account. After carefully reading on the fees I found out offer up charges the seller a 12.9% selling fee with a minimum fee of $2. This means my $3 cards That sold on offer up, I would get $1 and offer up would take $2 from the transaction. This was unacceptable due to the fact that other platforms only charge 5%. Once I figured this out I increased my prices on the cards to reflect the 12.9% fee. I also told my customers that my prices went up due to the fees offer up charges. I also gave the customers the opportunity to waive the fee if they payed through another merchant like venmo, PayPal, or cash app. Offer up did not like this and ended up closing my account due to “violating community guidelines.” Offer up is a disgrace to online businesses. If you are ok with being charged 12.9% fee then offer up is the app for you.",1
353,"Disappointed: I've had the app for several years, at first I was happy to have found a good way to sell my things.  But with every change you made, there was something good, but also 1-2 things that turned out to be worse.  It would now take too long to list everything, but I would like to tell you one thing: for a couple of months now I've been getting new search results on a regular basis, but firstly, no one reacts to inquiries, secondly no reactions to offers to buy, thirdly, no purchase offers from others, no matter how  I greatly reduce my goods, fourthly, there is no longer even an inquiry.  Since you teamed up with lets go, things have been extremely downhill. The question is now, what's wrong, that was never there before? Would be nice to know why, certainly not because there is no interest in buying or selling! Otherwise at least someone would have reacted at some point. I have consciously contacted more in the last few days and received no answer. Hope there is soon a change! Bye Gabi",1
354,"Love the App, Only Problem.. Scammers!!: I love Offer Up, I have sold quite a few things on the site and there’s always interesting things to shop around for. Great variety, easy to use, and I’ve recommended it to my uncle who was looking to sell a keyboard. My only complaint with the app isn’t even necessarily directed toward the app itself, but more so some of the users of the app. I posted a handbag, someone inquired about it, I told them the times I would be available to meet up to sell it to them, and then the next day when I went to check if they had responded, my entire posting selling my handbag was removed like as if they reported my posting for some reason. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Offer Up should look into these things better because there was absolutely nothing wrong with my posting, nor did I say anything inappropriate in the correspondence with the person that messaged me about the handbag.",4
355,"Good App, can be better: This is a good app for selling and buying.. however There needs to be some sort of customer service if you’re going to have buying and selling on this scale. There too many issues that pop up for you to just have FAQs for answers. For instance... if I send a package and that package is not scanned by the post office in a few days ( they are backed up) the order is then cancelled refunding the buyer even though I already sent the package out. And then like I said there is no person to call to fix it. I’m left hoping the other person is a good human being and will send me the money after it arrives. Too many times I’ve lost packages/money because no one from OfferUp will step in solve the problem. Examples: EBAY, Mercari, Poshmark all have customer help and protect both the buyer and seller. More details in this department need to be addressed.",4
356,"Add picture messaging.: This app is all around amazing but in my opinion suffers from one crucial flaw. You cannot send pictures through the app messaging. 

I really don’t like having to ask for someone’s contact info if they want to see the other items that I’m selling, that I haven’t posted to offer up. It would be 100% more efficient if we could just send pictures through the messages. People would respond faster to picture messages as well, it would also help remove this anonminity between buyer and seller. 

Lastly it would keep people on the app, it would entirely remove the need to take any transaction off the app. The main reason why I go off the app is to send more pictures to potential buyers of 1. The item I’m advertising to the app and 2. Items that I haven’t posted yet or items I don’t want to post but people would be interested in. There’s always a warning message when you send any contact info through offer up, and in some cases they just completely remove all of the info and make it hidden to the person you sent it to. This is a fantastic way to protect their users but limits their ability to sell more items or sell the item that’s advertised at faster rate. 

Thank you, hopefully this gets to someone that can add this to the app. It will be a 5 star if that could happen.",4
357,"I used to love offer up but it’s gotten way to many ads: Like the title says, it was my go to for a long time since I really dislike all the Facebook and Craigslist scams. I have bought and sold so much stuff here. OfferUp  was great until the last couple of months. They started putting unskippable ads when you send a message, ads over the messages when you are trying to read that have a tiny X that is next to impossible to click, they constantly give notifications that you can’t turn off, it makes you look like you have a message but it’s just suggestions you don’t even want to see. The app has gotten slower, I think due to all this. The cherry on top is that if your unwilling or unable to pay $8 a month, your posts and messages will be at the bottom and not nearly as many people will see them. I wish they would focus more on users instead of profits",3
358,"App stopped working: I think I’m not the only one experiencing this problem, and it’s extremely frustrating. I have been a user for a little over a year, and downloaded the app for the convenience. Everything was fine until about two updates ago, and all messaging seems to have completely lapsed, and all views of my items being sold stopped accruing for and unknown reason. 

There is genuinely no contact for customer support, no forum to check if this is something anyone else is dealing with. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled it; logged out, logged back in. I’ve tried sending multiple messages, and nothing happens. I don’t even know how people found out their accounts were disabled?! I haven’t done anything offensive, and have made 5 sales, 5 purchases no problem. So whatever is going on with their messaging needs to be redeveloped because it’s a major fail. 

I also don’t like how you can’t relist your item like you can in the Facebook marketplace without incurring a fee.",2
359,"This app as always been bad, now somehow worse: I’ve used this app for many years, and it has enabled me to find some great deals. I like the feature of searching nationwide and the search parameters. However the app has always been clunky, even at the best of times. This current iteration for the last few months has been the worst I’ve ever seen. I can’t use the app for more than 15 mins without it slowing to an absolute crawl, a click taking approx 30 seconds + to register. The app has always been clunky, not the most well put together, but usable. Not only is it no longer usable, but it seems to require SO MUCH GPU that my entire phone slows down and it’s almost impossible to use other apps unless I close OfferUp and give the phone some time to recover. I’ve resorted to using my computer and the website, but I run into the same issue, after so much time scrolling on a page of results the page becomes slow to the point of being unresponsive and eventually no longer functions at all.",1
360,"Location not accurate: The location of all local items are not accurate, not approximate. The App always shows me that the location of all items in my city are near the same 4 mile radius that I am near. Even when an item is actually on the other side of the city, 20 miles away, the app shows me that is in the same area as everything else I click on, only 4 miles away. 
This needs to be fixed to show that actual approximate location of the items. It’s a waste of time for both the buyer and seller to need to ask/answer questions about approximate location. The accurate approximate location helps me decide if an item is worth the travel/traffic/parking before bothering the selling with questions. 
This wasn’t a problem before the merge.",5
361,"Works well, but can waste the Seller’s time: The functionality of the app is solid. It does what it purports to do, but there are features that could be improved. The rating system is heavily skewed toward rating Sellers. Only after a transaction is completed can the Buyer be rated. This results in people fishing and sending endless inquires (i.e., is this still for sale?) with no intention of buying the item. Also, there are no consequences for flaking on a purchase. So, the seller can spend a lot of time corresponding with a potential buyer(s) that disappear or don’t show up. This app needs to have a method for identifying bogus buyers and/or people that are not responsible. 

Also, I get a duplicate email every time I exchange messages with a buyer. This feature cannot be disabled from what I can tell. This is annoying and wastes more of my time deleting these messages.",4
362,"I’ve never seen so many scammers in my life: I’ve been on this app for over 5 months. I’ve gotten some likes on my items. But the only offers and conversations I’ve received are from scammers or men who wants to have sex. I don’t know why those gross people would think they’d go on a date with me by purchasing a $20 necklace from me. It’s so gross. I can’t tell how grossed out and disgusted I’ve felt. I was really serious with this, I took time and effort taking pictures of my items and retiring descriptions. And for countless times all I see was sexual harassing comments or scammers asking for my phone my email and my personal address. I’ve already reported a few to the app and I got tired of doing it. To me this app has nothing other than  just scammers. I’m so naive to think this’d be another good platform like Mercari or Vinted. I’ve given it so many chances but all I’ve gotten are mental traumas for all the gross conversations I’ve received. Now I have to look for a way to delete my accounts and removed all of my payment methods.",1
363,"Great app!: Great app to get rid of some of my unwanted items and find items I’ve been looking for. I’m a vintage video game collector/seller and I collect funko pops and this is the perfect place to collect and sell. Love this app. The only downside is having to wait so long to be paid, I think that once an item is sold, it should process right then and there, instead of having to wait nearly a week on top of having to wait for the buyer review. There should also be an option that allows you to keep some or all of your money as credit within the app instead of having it all transferred to your bank account then if you decide to transfer it to your bank account instead you can be given the option to do so. Other than that I haven’t experienced many problems or have other complaints at this time.",5
364,"Like the app not so much the people: App is great. Could use an about me section and ratings would be better if we could add messages. So for one star users it would be good to write as to why, for example “they never showed up and wasted my time”. So others can avoid them! Please add that. It would help so many people not have their time being wasted. Also PLEASE BAN PEOPLE WHO WASTE OTHERS TIME. I can not count on my fingers how many times people sst up times, read my messages and NEVER came. It happens SO OFTEN. I would love reports to actually do something. They need to not be on the app if they’re just wasting peoples time. For example I had a lady tell me she would come at 10 and I called work to come in late and all she did was read my messages and not respond. It’s so unfair that these people still have their accounts when they aren’t even serious about buying...Now i’m out of some money because of her.",3
365,"Disappointed: I used to love this app. But out of the blue yesterday OfferUp DELETED my account I had been using for years. I got a message saying I had violated community guidelines. I can assure you I haven’t. I use it to occasionally sell my used electronics and have received nothing but positive ratings so far. I contacted customer support via Facebook and got a quick response telling me to wait for an email. The email said the SAME thing, “your account has been removed because it has violated community guidelines, we cannot reactivate it after it has been disabled - OfferUp support team”. Well, I’m obviously aware of that, but the fact is, I never violated any rules, and they obviously don’t have the tools or resources to look into what happened, because they aren’t answering why or bothering with my questions. Use this app to buy things but if you’re concerned about building up a seller profile it’s risky and not your worth time. I’ve read up through Reddit of this happening to many people with no resolution. Your efforts would be better spent on eBay, Letgo, Postmark, or Mercari.",1
366,"Fake buyers and time wasters: The app itself is good. Unfortunately, the people who use the app are another story. So many fake buyers and or low ballers. They send messages inquiring about your item and then you never hear from them again. That’s not as bad as the ones who want to offer you crackhead prices for your items as if they think everything is a goodwill store item that they should not pay more than $10 for. Those reasons are enough to discourage anyone who wants to sell their items without the hassle of having to ship it. Also makes me worry if these people are so shady, it’s possible if you did ship something to them , they would probably claim it got damaged or not what they expected so they could get their money back.
 I think the app is a great concept but unfortunately my experience has not been favorable therefore I personally would not recommend it to sell to anyone unless it’s a business trying to buy your item. They are less likely to waste your time.",2
367,"Yes I Love It!: Offer Up is life altering! I run a sales team for a Fortune 500 company and I talk about Offer Up all the time in regards to lessons in sales and customer service. 

After the birth of my twins (surprise), my family went in to some financial hardship while trying to maintain the rapid growth of our total members. I have been able to buy gently used necessities as well as sell things to have additional income on Offer Up. The people that I meet are friendly, happy, and kind and I love doing business with them. 

I understand that the concept of selling goods online is not new but the ability to rate the interactions and earn trust that way is very new and very needed. 

Additionally, this meets the needs of many of my own environmental concerns as we continue to live in a disposable world. This connects people with items that they want or need while encouraging them to not purchase things new in turn driving supply needs down. So many of the things we own eventually make their ways into landfills. But they don’t have to! And Offer Up makes this goal much easier. 

Thank you!

I have experience in sales, marketing, and project management and would love to become further entangled with Offer Up. If you ever see a need to have some support in NC, please let me know!",5
368,Good and bad: Is so many issues with the app and is not the app that is bad is the people that make this app bad main issue is low ballers second people who make you waste your time how they can fix this? Banned those who waste other people time I have many buyers telling me oh I’m going to get the item wait and 4 hours later they msg you putting a excuse that they couldn’t make it but they will go tomorrow and they do the same wby they don’t punish this people ? Get rid of them honestly this kind of people ruin the whole experience for everyone that’s why I rather sell on eBay because you don’t deal with low ballers and you don’t waste time is just buy boom ship the item if the app would get rid of this low ballers and laggers this app would be so amazing to sell also the sad part is that this laggers are also sellers so is just people with 💩 in their head o wish offer up could fix this and also many of this people use 5 accounts or more to low bal and resell the same items that they bought here,2
369,WORST APP EVER!: I downloaded OfferUp when I was interested in purchasing a wet saw for a one time tile project. I found a person who was advertising one for sale and contacted her. I offered her the $60 that she asked for. She contacted me about buying it and gave me her address. Then every time that I suggested for doing the transaction would not work out for her. She then suggested a time frame and I replied that I would make it work. That was the last I heard from her. I sent her numerous messages and she didn’t reply. Then I saw that she reposted the saw for $40.  I replied to that and didn’t get any responses. The next day I get an email from OfferUp saying that my account was terminated because of rules violations. WHAT??? I really needed the saw and was super polite to the seller. They would not tell me what violations were broken and locked my account. Go to Facebook Marketplace instead. I did that and got my saw the next day. The fact that you can be accused of violating rules without defending yourself is inexcusable. That lady should be the one locked out!,1
370,"I hate OfferUp: There’s no way OfferUp is still doing this banning. Other people post drugs or glass on there I post my puff co peak once and it gets me banned when I’ve seen others posting vapes, vaporizers, tobacco, bongs, etc. whatever OfferUp you’re never going to be letgo, you might of bought letgo but you’ll nothing like letgo you’re like the pentagon no one likes you and has to follow your dumb fine print rules or they get GHOST banned. Not even a notification that we get banned but literally muting us from talking to others. I’ve lost a deal buying from someone once, driving over an hour because OfferUp banned me coincidentally right in between my drive there when I arrive to her house, she wasn’t out for minutes after text so I spent 15 minutes spamming her in case she was sleeping or doing something and only to realize none of my text was going though because OfferUp ghost banned me, at the worst time possible. Wrong place, Wrong time, wrong company/app. Don’t use this thinking you’ll get letgo again, it’s exactly the opposite.",1
371,"Unstable sellers: I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with a couple no response sellers, supposedly they’re not actively using they’re accounts, and one complete spaz that didn’t believe I was a legit buyer, after I just opened my account. They were only asked to provide one photo, if possible, to show the condition of a game discs and instead they took it personally, while also sharing their merits on how many sales they had, just to justify not needing to show one extra photo, and having audacity to compare my account to theirs after telling them I just started using the app. 

If they didn’t want to show another photo than keep you angst to yourself and don’t send a bunch of email just to troll. Especially, according to this person’s OfferUp profile stats, says they both respond only 80% of the time and only have 7 out of 10 for ITEM DESCRIPTION, that’s funny. Some merit pal, get a life and also I say forget this app with this kind of sellers. I’m sticking with Mercari because of this bad customer experience.",1
372,"App needs some work: Searches are too cluttered with old posts that never get removed.  You can try to sort by newest posts, but it doesn’t actually work.  New and old posts get mixed together regardless of your sort options.

This could be avoided if they would expire old posts, but they don’t, so most of the search results are things that are no longer actually for sale, or from people who listed on it and no longer even check the app.  

If they’re still not willing to expire old posts and clean up their marketplace (maybe they’re afraid that it will expose how few legit postings there actually are), the least they could do is let us hide posts that we don’t want to see in our search results anymore.  At least then I can remove all the old garbage that constantly clogs the feed.

It’s just too hard to actually find relevant posts that are still active.

Also they do little to stop scammers from creating infinite accounts on the platform.  I see obvious scam artists (don’t ever believe their story if they try to get you to move payment outside the app) whose accounts get deactivated, only for them to pop up again with a new name but the same tactics and sometimes even pictures.  It would help if they only allowed one account to ever be created per device, but they don’t.

There are much easier ways to buy items from other people than on this platform.",2
373,"Great App - Easy to Use: I just recently started using this app. I really appreciate the ease of use from adding items to sell, searching for items to purchase, messaging with buyers/sellers and editing your selling price. I also like how you can add things like “TruYou” to your profile to present a more trustworthy profile. 

The only reason I have this 4 stars is because the first several messages I received on this app were from spam users. They were asking me to contact them on their personal email in order to move forward with payment for an item. I know it’s impossible to keep all the scammers off, but it would be nice if there was a way to minimize that from my first several communications. 

Overall I enjoy this app better than any of the other but/sell ones. I had hits on items much faster than Facebook MarketPlace or Craig’s List. I would highly recommend it!",4
374,"Stick to ebay.: I have been using offer up for about 3 years now and I have never had any issues with any of my buyers until now. It’s ridiculous to me how Offer up will take the word of a fraudulent account over a loyal seller that has five stars, & who has been with them for a long time. — a person hiding behind an account who has no items sold or purchased, bought their first item with me. The buyer purchased a designer belt from me and once he received it he filed a false claim stating that the item wasn’t in the box (which it was). So offer up messages me saying that if I am selling counterfeit items that aren’t in the box that my account would be suspended. That is probably the most insulting most ridiculous message that I have ever received. I am heavily disappointed and will be finding a new app to sell my items. This person basically has the belt and is awaiting a refund that I am sure they will give him even though he is  lying about the entire situation to get his money back. 

BEWARE OF SCAMMERS!",2
375,"OfferUp are the new scammers: People tend to list their items multiple times, instead of flagging it as a duplicate post they let you.  Now if you are trying to sell a car they won’t let you post more than 4 different cars a month or pay 4.99 each additional car and if your a dealer they want to charge you (starting at) $300 a month just to promote 5 cars and to let you post as many cars as you want.  People were complaining that people were posting the same car 20 times.  Well as long as you pay $300 you can post as many cars as you want.
Why not remove multiple ads like they remove ads if they are posted in the wrong category.
Why not put an expiration date on all ads. Let an ad expire in 30-45 days. A lot of ads are from 5 months to a year old.  If they offered to promote ads for a dollar or two for a few days they probably would make more...
Seeing a lot of car ads even when your not looking for one, yep that’s offerUp...
We complained but instead of hearing our complaints they found a way to profit.",1
376,"A bit frightening: I would give 5 stars because this app makes it incredibly simple to post items for sale. However, I don’t feel that this is a good app to sell anything of decent value. Buyers are not here to spend that kind of money.  That being said it frightens me that so many Sellers can leave out so much detail in the description box or will post pics making it obvious that the pic was taken on the fly (in desperation). It’s crazy sad to see people selling absolutely anything out of desperation for money. It breaks my heart! I’m not convinced that it would even be safe to make contact with someone in that condition. It’s sad that I even feel that way. Unfortunately, society is scary in this day and age. Browsing through services you’ll find people posting selfies via a bathroom mirror. Seriously? They want to babysit your kids and pets or even come into your home for whatever service be it plumbing, electrical, etc. Craigslist Killer turns OfferUp Obituaries?",3
377,"Great up but not lately: OfferUp is definitely a really good app. Me and my husband love it and have bought and sell many things. It is easy to use, and you can find almost everything you need or sell anything you dont want anymore! I will have giving it 5 stars 2 weeks ago.
The only thing is that lately the app is not working for some reason, for the past two weeks my husband had been telling me that his selling post were no posting if that makes any sense, he even ask me to post things for him on my account. But now my app is not working either my post will not upload, my messages to other sellers will show as send but they will not receive them. We tried deleting the app and installing it again, log out and log back in, turning the phone completely off and nothing have work there’s definitely something wrong with the app. I wish there was a customer service option to send a message, PLEASE FIX IT SOON!!!!",3
378,"GHOST-BANNED FOR NO REASON!!!!: When I first started using OfferUp I really enjoyed it and it was my go to app to sell my items. Then all of a sudden I noticed that I haven’t gotten a single response on any of my offers or messages for months. Then i also noticed that none of my items for sale were getting any views. I didn’t know what was going on until I looked all all of my offers and messages until I looked and saw that none of them were getting read, then I tested it by sending my buddy an offer who was sitting right next to me an offer on one of his items and he didn’t get it. I have a 5 star rating and am a certified Tru-Member so if they are going to wrongfully ban someone they should at least telling them what they are being accused of instead of Ghost-Banning them. I attempted to contact them via Twitter (as they don’t have a live customer service number) and they said they they will look into it; however, when I try to get an update of what’s going on I get no response. This lack of communication is horrible and not a way to keep customers happy.",1
379,Doest work for unknown reaskns: I have used offer up for about 2 years now and use to love the app. I had good sales and bought things off others as well. All of a sudden the app stopped working for me. I would try to post something on it and it would say it posted but in reality it never did. I would try to purchase other peoples things on the app and seems to not send out the message to them. Its like if i was blacklisted or banned but i don't know why? I have never done anything against policy or harmful but the app doesn't work and i ever tried erasing and downloading again to see if that solved the problem but no it didn't. I also contacted the support center about this issue i have been having by email but they never seem to get back i wrote them 3 times and no replies back and its been weeks to months of no reply back from them on the issue. This app use to be good now it just doesn't work. There customer support is horrible as well because they cant seem to get back to any of my letters to them. Use to be a happy app user not i'm not.,1
380,"WAS GOOD NOW ITS NOT: The offer up app worked great until they did the recent update in 2020 in November. They made the photos all square in the same size and they’re difficult to look at. They also eliminated the feature where you could hold your finger on an item and do a quick review and see the price. They refuse to let you see the price so that you have to click on every single item which is extremely time-consuming. They also illuminated the ability to use it in landscape mode on iPads which is very frustrating because all iPads used on a tabletop are used in the landscape mode.
Usually when you update an app you make it better with better features and more options but Offer Up made it less features and less options and less user-friendly? Why would you do that",5
381,"AI or Auto Detection for Categories needs work: The top level category is automatically set based on…? Some say Title descriptions, some say pictures, some say descriptions. Whatever is triggering this feature needs a lot of work. I have no problems with my listings on any other platform other then Offerup.  Over and over again I will try to post a clothing item and then it automatically lists my item under jewelry/ accessories and I don’t get enough sales on Offerup to spend hours trying to figure out how to reword a title  or a description so that I can try to make what is poorly programmed in the app to actually recognize the correct product category. 1 out of every 3 listings this happens to. It’s just a waste of time for very little return. I would have given only 2 stars as a review  but I did generously give it 3 stars since I noticed a massive improvement on phishing scams has been made.",3
382,Wth happened to this app: Omg I can not begin to say how bad offer up has succeeded to make its self horrible wtvr you admins have done please stop and make as it was when it first began because now it is full of scam artist with fake adds and the all spam with the app having about 75% of ads being scams I have reported numerous times and they do not do anything about them it's almost offer either does it or they are that stupid yet u put a picture of an animal and that is restricted but fake ads for vehicles there is a field day and why not separate or have an option for dealers and private sales because I don't want to see dealers I didn't go on offer to view dealers inventory so the rating I give is 1 star cause OfferUp u deserve it . Was the purpose to create this app to be crap I would hope not but it truly is . I can't do it I Going back to Craigslist they have it correct OfferUp is a scammers paradise . Don't download the app you will only get exhausted and frustrated and now the hv pop up ads that cuz of desperation pretty frkn sad,1
383,"Great app, but why the changes?!: This app was a 5 star before the changes. I’ve been using OfferUp for years. It’s great! But a recent change makes buying more complicated. 
Please bring back this feature:
When sending a message asking about something for sale it would have an indication if the message had or had not been read by the seller. This was a very helpful feature. If they were not interested in your offer, you kinda knew by the fact that they read it yet did not reply. AND I’m the case where people post something a year ago and never use the app again. When you see your message has not been read, you can move on to another seller, assuming that seller is no longer active on OfferUp. 
And in regards to that, the feature that I believe has been removed, possibly for security reasons, is the feature that indicates how long it’s been since the seller has been active. That really helps as well.",3
384,"Quick and safe way to get item sold: I had my crib/toddle set on let-it go for 3-4 month with no one will to pay for what I have posted on my items .Everyone who did an offer , wanted to low ball me on my items . The item I was selling was in very good condition .  I saw the commercial for offer up, hoping someone would buy my items for what I was asking for ;  I sign up on a Saturday and sold my items on Monday . It was only posted for 2 days. I didn’t have to worry about someone asking to buy  my things for cheaper . I like how you can choose to have on your profile that your price is a firm price . On the other app that don’t give you that choice , they have negotiable.  Which was never in my case . I had to place on that add not negotiable In writing . Thanks to this app , I can us the fund to buy my kid some school clothing .",5
385,Letgo was so much better!!!!: Recently Letgo and OfferUp have merged and now OfferUp is the platform that everyone must use.  OfferUp is terrible compared to Letgo.  Letgo kept all their items up to date and deleted anything that was old.  Also they would verify to make sure everyone was legit!  I never received scammer type messages and the one time I did Letgo caught it and deactivated the account until it was verified or they deactivated it permanently. With OfferUp I receive messages from sketchy people all the time asking me to call them and the first time I didn’t know so I did and the guy wanted to send me more than the asking price and it was some BS when I heard it I knew it was a scam and he kept trying to call and text me.  I hope OfferUp will change but for now I’m not going to use it and I hate that because I was constantly on LetGo.  I sold my truck on there in 2 hours I sold a go kart a laptop an iPhone and several other things and I bought quite a bit off letgo as well I miss it!!! Please make OfferUp like letgo!,2
386,"Great app: I love this app because there are no fees, and it’s super simple to post. You don’t have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get your material out there for what you want. 

Things that you should be aware of, 99% of the people on this app will try and lowball you. Hold your ground because eventually you will get people to pay the price that you want. People will try and lowball you even if your price is not flexible, which is unfortunate because I feel like that’s the reason we click the not flexible button.I wish there was a section for resale and a section for brand new, because a lot of brand new ads flood when you’re looking for good deals in the resale department. 

That’s my honest review. Hope it helps you if you’re deciding on whether or not to download the app!",5
387,"App is awful & glitches: Haven’t been using offer up because it’s pointless now unless you pay, which I will never be doing. Ads every time I click a post or go to message someone, so now it’s useless and I just exit the app and forget about it. Cant even message sellers anymore if you don’t pay premium or else your message gets lost or pushed all the way to the bottom. It also glitches and crashes all the time because of the constant ads. They also have constant listings of people pricing stuff at $1 when in reality they want way more in the description, even when I report this they don’t do anything or take it down. 

Facebook market place is way better and I’ve had way more success buying and selling on there than offer up. They also take down posts almost immediately when I report them for being fraud or scams. Offer up never updates you on the ones when I report & that is so ridiculous to me. They should really take notes instead of being greedy.",1
388,"Shadow Banned or Account Deleted: After years of selling on this platform I’ve reported scammer accounts with no legal names (i.e. DEALS4U, IBUYTHINGS) of individuals. People illegally sell animals on the platform as well as sell items that are prohibited. These are all actions that OfferUp thinks is ok.

Meanwhile I sell a recording booth I have for sale and write in the advertisement that I can deliver it or make any adjustments for an additional fee. According to this, I’m advertising an intangible item and therefore my account which made me a considerable amount of income was taken down. 5 star ratings and no issues with any users at all. Yes some scammers but they never tried to meet up. As of the apps current status if you do not sign up via a phone number expect to not get any views. Also if you sell an item for less than $5 also expect to have that account banned as well. Your company needs to be a little more ethical in regards to its decision making. Being someone who is disabled and on a fixed income, this app was very beneficial to me.",1
389,"Not  very interactive & contrasting info once I already paid: I purchased something that stated shipping was within 3 days then after searching their website I found something that stated a buyer has a total of 6 days to ship. That’s about a week? To me 6 days is way too much time to give anyone time to ship an item. If you have an item than I don’t see why you would want to delay sending out a product, unless you don’t actually have the item as stated. I won’t be using this app again. It feels very mechanical and like no one is home basically.. No  one to speak with  or to address concerns to. This is the new model for doing business and I don’t like it , which is why I never purchased anything from Vestiaire . I’m old fashioned, don’t like this format/ways of doing business, and don’t believe anyone has the right to hold your funds hostage for a week. I could be spending my money on other things. It’s basically a waste of my time.",2
390,"Merchandise Easy @ Your Pockets: Offer up is just a great website that gives you the opportunity to shop and look up all kinds of merchandise and products that a store could sale, with the exception of the item either being new or used. You still are getting something at great value, hardly used, or damaged, it’s price or giving you the opportunity to select and make your own negotiating offer and it the customers of selling the product say so in agreeing to disagree without a lot of hassle. I shop here a lot and I’ve put items on here that I didn’t have no lore use or need for or it was in my garage and it sells more quickly on here than any other website. Thank You OU you’ve made my garage less junky and gave me the ease of putting something green in my wallet.",5
391,"A place to not sell anything and waste time: The worst of the worst. There is definitely something very wrong with the messaging system here or perhaps it’s the entire community. Very often people make offers and then disappear off the face of the earth. Nobody seems to understand what firm on price means or maybe they’re the type of people who like to do stupid things like walk in employees only areas of places they’re not employed at and then question why they’re not allowed there when caught. It seems like the same level of stupidity and lack of consideration. It’s just as bad if your goal is to buy something. It’s like you have to treat grownups like toddlers who won’t put their shoes on no matter how many times you say it and you repeat yourself constantly just to facilitate a transaction. It’s easier to just take what you are selling to a pawn shop for their abysmal prices because if you have something you are selling for $300 firm on price, there will be some dolt messaging you offering you $60 and oblivious to what an idiot they are for doing so. Ugh!",1
392,"Offer Up lack of support: I was banned from OfferUp. To this day, after extensive attempts to appeal, they cannot give me an answer as to what I did or said that violated what rule or condition. I had a following of 96 customers, with a 5-star review rating, & never any less than 5-star. I’m a nice guy, married 28 years, with two grown sons, own my own home, & when I do have an issue with anything or anybody, I’m typically the one to take the initiative & resolve it. I truly loved OfferUp, & always sang praises of them. But they let me down in the worst way. It’s so frustrating to not know why, let alone be given the opportunity to correct whatever behavior that offended. I believe even an automated machine would’ve been more functional to deal with.  This is where all the other selling apps shine, like letgo, CL, eBay, etc
Too bad OfferUp seems to be flying blind....",5
393,Very good: I don’t have much experience in the app but from already have bought a bike on it I myself can say that the app itself is very good however the one flaw is some of the people using it not that it has anything to do with the apps fault but in my conquest of trying to find a bike before I got one many of the people I tried to negotiate with were very disrespectful some telling me to take my money somewhere else without even trying to negotiate and being told to stop texting them “every 30 seconds” when I was simply trying to make a deal so when people who act like that are on the app whoever is in charge of this platform should check the reviews on some of these people to see what has been said of them and accordingly punish these people.,5
394,"Great App But Too Many Bots and Scammers: App is great but they allow thousands of bots and scammers to make accounts and waste peoples time. If you list an item “for free” just to help out someone that can benefit from that item, you will get tons of messages from fake accounts. If you list the same item for $0.01 you can deter most of those scammers. But then there are also actual people that willingly waste your time by asking tons of questions about the picture of your item, others will say they will pick it up but don’t show. The items for sale part of the site is good but still has some stragglers that don’t intend to purchase what you are selling. Just beware when trying to give away anything for free because you will swarmed with fake accounts/ this has been going on for years I don’t know why they haven’t figured out the problem to stop this still.",3
395,"Shady, scammers, unprofessional and unreliable users: Worst experience I have ever had with an app.  
The people (or most of them)  are either scammers, shady, unreliable, untrustworthy, unprofessional, don’t communicate, are unresponsive, or all of the above.  I’ve wasted so much time and energy on this app and it was not worth making a couple 100 dollars.  Most of them don’t even speak English.  There needs to be a system that doesn’t allow certain users.  One person that was hours late who couldn’t speak English said they would buy my bedframe, and abandoned the job half way through disassembling it. He left all the parts all pieces all over my living room floor and he knew I was packing to move out the same day/night.  He broke parts of it, then went downstairs from my walk up building apt, said he was getting his brother to help carry it down and never returned. My texts and call and messages on the app were ignored.  Worst experience ever.  Awful customer and user. One of many other unreliable customers.",1
396,"This App is trash and blackballed me.: I’ve had an account for YEARS with 125+ five star reviews. Have sold and bought countless items on there and suddenly my account got removed one day for “violating community guidelines” but no real explanation as to what I did exactly since I didn’t do anything than use the app like I regularly do. After multiple emails and no response other than an automated message. My account is now gone and I’ve even made TWO separate emails to try and make new accounts which also got removed after the first day for the same “violating community guidelines” reason as if they just have my whole IP address blocked or something. 
Again for what seems like no reason at all. It’s horrible that there isn’t even a response to all of my emails with a real reason rather than an automated message. I used to love this app and now for this reason I hate it. It’s unfair and the customer support is non existent. 
User beware, you’re better off on Facebook marketplace or good old Craigslist.",1
397,"UX Redesign & Banning Needed: I use the app out of habit, but there are two main problems that OfferUp consistently fails to address with each update, which hinder the user experience —poor UX and duplicates. 

1. Inadequate User Experience (UX): It is evident that whoever tests the app does not prioritize the user. As a buyer, you create lists and save favorite items. While browsing new items, it should be possible to access and manage your lists conveniently. However, OfferUp has hidden the wishlist feature in the profile section, making it inaccessible while browsing. Additionally, the ""my listings"" and ""post"" tabs are irrelevant if you are solely interested in buying.

2. Excessive presence of scammers and wholesalers with duplicate posts severely hampers browsing. Often, while scrolling down, you encounter the same image repeatedly from a single wholesaler who has posted it numerous times. This repetitive behavior is illogical, and the app should prevent sellers from doing so. Some sellers go to the extent of creating multiple accounts to repost the same items repeatedly. From a user's perspective, this kind of experience can be frustrating and discouraging.

I have started testing Facebook Marketplace as an alternative, despite it having its own set of issues. However, it currently seems to offer a better experience compared to OfferUp.",3
398,"Horrible: I really did enjoy this app, buying and selling items. But, recently all the stuff I had for sale got deleted for some reason which never happened before. All my messages got deleted. Then when I go to message someone to buy something, it goes through but then message deletes again. So I decided to make a new OfferUp account thinking that the problem will go away but unfortunately, it didn’t. So I posted some stuff for sale on the new account, but didn’t get any views on the posts which is weird because I usually get hundreds of views on every post that I post for sale. So I searched up my post, and my post was no where to be found. Then it won’t let me message anyone to buy anything. Reminder this is a new account. So I eventually deleted the app and reinstalled it thinking it would fix the problem, but it didn’t. I go to log in, it logs me right back out. I have no clue on what to do anymore. I didn’t do anything wrong so I know I didn’t get banned. Help me please.",2
399,"Had potential: For my time of using the app it was great. It offered simple and safer ways of buying and selling that other online shopping sites do not offer. However, it fell way too short compared to my praise. I was banned off of the site without any warning and without any explanation when I was intending to develop a good reputation on the app. It is completely horrible that after my first sell and 5 star rating, I got banned. They give us the illusion of being able to use the app after getting banned and allow messages to be “sent” but they’re just dead-ends. The company probably traces all devices you have used to sign in or attempted to with your account and as a result all my devices have been banned; even with different accounts. Their customer support team is just horrible. For a company’s app being used nationwide, it is disappointing to see  they do not offer a dedicated customer support phone number. I honestly cannot recommend this app to anyone with this kind of behavior and would prefer these issues be resolved.",1
400,"Poor communication with customer service: I use to love this app up until now that I can not post anything, write to anyone nor make any offer. I’ve been trying to get a hold of customer service for help but that hasn’t been successful with the replies I received in emails suggesting what to do to fix a problem that I still couldn’t fix. One suggestion In their email they send me says “Switching between your wireless internet and cellular data plan.” I Just got i new carrier from sprint to at&t recently and still the same problem. They either need to come up with a serious update to fix the problem or have a customer number to speak to someone personally for help. I read up online others having this same issue. Not being able to write or send offers with an error pop up message.",5
401,"Horrible app: I was a regular user 5 star user with no negative reviews. I then had one buyer that tried to scam me. So when I contacted OfferUp about the inceident they told me to block them. Then the same user made another account and started to harass me. So I blocked them a again and contacted OfferUp. So I figured then out of the blue I could not post anything nor purchase anything anymore. I figured yep! They banned me to, guessing the person I banned did the same to me even when I have never had an issue before. I tried contacting OfferUp and nothing! tried making a new account still nothing so I am deleting the app and finding something else.

Update! So I finally get a email from OfferUp a whole month later saying I was banned for misconduct which is crazy because I was the victim in the situation. These people customer service is a joke and never take the time or resources to look into anything. And for anyone that use the app please meet at a police station because if someone says one thing negative even if it’s not true your banned! Stay safe everyone.",1
402,"No Buyer Protection: I’m a frequent user of this app. I have bought and sold many items. They do have some nice features but the customer service is poor. This is reflected in several reviews. 

For me, the buyer protection was denied. I received a fake SD card, I provided proof within minutes of receiving the item. They asked for pictures for further verification, which I provided, again, within minutes. Afterwards I received silence from the Offer Up team. When I resent the message with the pictures days later, they said I did not provide proof in time. I offered to provide proof that I had sent the message within minutes of receiving their original response, but they never replied back and now are ignoring me. Now I am stuck with a fake SD card that does not function and is not UHS-II as described (clearly seen by a single row of pins in the pictures I provided). Not the first fake SD card I have bought, so I figured I’d be safe with the “buyer protection”. I was sadly mistaken. 

If you are afraid of scammers, go to eBay. They actually back their claims, unlike Offer Up.",1
403,"The app is not working: (A 5 star rating for when the app was working)
It must have been hacked or had a deadline to shut down its servers because it just lets you post and watch and other post in the feed...however i remember a few years back when letgo was launched it came with a message that said “offer up is now letgo” I always knew that they had something going on and must of had a deadline like how could the biggest baddest selling app go down like you can use the app as a fake out but u cant sell message or buy trust me I know its not working and with facebook market place here offer up is selling its  shares and acting like its still available with a glitch or whatever its sad but we’re being played point blank period.... letgo & marketplace is all we pretty much have... just giving you all a heads up.",5
404,"So many bugs..: So many glitches. It won’t pull up my albums when trying to post a new listing and I don’t have time to sift through 40k photos in the main library to find them. 
The balance from items I sold through the app still hasn’t deposited to my account and it’s been well after 5 business days since last item was sold so I don’t know what’s holding it..
Trying to get through to their customer service is a pain in the neck. There’s NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, they just ignored my message when I inquired about it. So if you ever have an issue (and there are many) your only option is sending them an email and waiting 24-48 hours for a reply (they don’t reply on weekends) which can take days/weeks going back and forth for something that could’ve been taken care of over the phone in minutes. Such a wage is time. If it’s an urgent matter, good luck. 
I like the idea of the app but thinking of moving my business to another platform, it’s just too frustrating to use 😞",1
405,Too many pawn shop adds: I like offer up except for the fact that they let these pawn shops load up the site with their items most people are just posting as if they were having a yard sale and they may have a few items it’s not fair to them to have to compete with some money hungry pawn shop who rips people off when they get the stuff they have by loaning a very low amount for the items hoping they won’t get picked up so they can turn around and sell them for an exorbitant amount and they are posting too many items at one time and they take up all the prime space also there are a lot of people lately who play little games like saying they will meet up with you and you go there and they don’t show up there should be a way to mark them so others don’t experience the same bad outcome especially since gas is the price it is thx for listeningJC,3
406,"Each item must be individually viewed just to see listed price: Just as the title says, the fact that you must select and view every single individual listed search result in order to see the price is ridiculous. It displays a nice thumbnail grid list view after searching for any item of interest which clearly and quickly allows you to scroll through many potential items but in order to actually compare prices you must click and view an item then back out to your results screen and then select another and repeat. The sheer lack of the very simplistic concept of listing the item prices in the corner of the thumbnails for listings makes the app almost a waste of time for shoppers and therefore likewise for sellers posting items unless they were to literally photoshop the price into the corner of any pictures they upload. I am still baffled by the lack of this fundamental feature that is utilized on virtually every single other shopping website and app imaginable.",1
407,"Where do I start….?: There are too many outdated ads. At first I would message for an item and frequently never received a response. That’s when I noticed those items had been posted anywhere from 6 months to as old as 3 yrs prior. I came over from the letgo acquisition and I believe their method of dealing with old ads was the best. In letgo, you were required to reverify your ad every 30 days or it would be deleted. 
 If you’re looking for a particular vehicle and it is popular than you’re out of luck because most of the ads will be a scam or spam. I’ve searched for a vehicle I wanted and had to scroll quite a bit to get passed several hundred ads of the same vehicle from the same or several different user accounts. These accounts are probably single use or throw away accounts for spam/scam or maybe even hacked accounts. 
 These are just 2 of their worst problems that haven’t been taken care of since the letgo takeover.",2
408,"Improve please...: I really loved this app until I was constantly asked to join TruYou, which I already had. Every time I tried replying to msgs or trying to post a listing it said “To post in this category join TruYou” but I already am part of it. This is very annoying. Furthermore, the fact that there is absolutely NO WAY to contact technical support via phone call. Everything must be done over email which allows support to be very vague in their response. Do they realize people report you over the simplest things like not wanting to lower a price by $5 or just simply because they don’t have anything better to do? I really hope my account wasn’t blocked since I always try to avoid any arguments on here, but people would just report you for ignoring them. Overall I think support and troubleshoot solving is subpar. Everything else is very easy to use and navigate.",3
409,"Overran with Scammers Now: Locally this is the best app to buy and sell items. The shipping marketplace has potential but is overran with scammers at the moment. Every hour there is a new post for popular items, usually with an older man/lady as the profile picture, or no picture at all. Right now I see a lot of these fake profiles posting Nintendo Switch, Macbooks, and Sony cameras. Some are even giving away electronics for free to get your personal information. There are so many fakes I imagine offerup is overwhelmed by spam reports. A great feature would be a search filter where you only see profiles TruYou verified and/or with reviews. None of these fake profiles have reviews. I wouldn't purchase an item from out-of-state anyway if the seller didn't have reviews. This search filter would be very effective in at least hiding these fake profiles from unsuspecting consumers. Plus they overwhelm the results when you search for popular items, making it difficult to find genuine sellers in between them.",2
410,"Keep taking item down with hour of posting it: I’ve used OfferUp a lot in the past and have had no problems with it at those times. I believe it’s a much better app than LetGo when it comes to buyer/seller engagement. (At least in my area) I’d post the same item, at the same time, on both apps. And easily get 10-20 responses on OfferUp before getting even 1 on LetGo. So up until now, I would have easily gave it 5 stars. But I’ve been trying to sell a replica/decorative sword from Game of Thrones on there and it’s been removed 4 times now. I checked the rules and while real weapons/swords are not allowed, it says decorative swords are. I even put “Decorative” in the title of the item but it still gets removed. And honestly I’m not one to even write a review but then when I went to the “Help” section of the app. I couldn’t find any option to where I could contact them to try and get it sorted out. So I thought I’d leave a review about it.",3

About 30 seconds later I get a notification saying my post was removed because I didn’t pay some fee.  I was never asked nor prompted to pay a fee.  The application just guided me through the posting process....  apparently incorrectly!  Had I been prompted I might have considered it, but just having the listing not only removed but deleted entirely (I’d have to re-create it, not just pay the fee and the ads would be re-activated) feels silly.  I’m a programmer who focuses on process improvement by trade.  Thinking out how end users will use the product can admittedly be difficult...  but to miss big basics like this for a program in this wide usage is BAFFLING.  I’d tolerate some minor quirky issue, but when you can’t figure out how to guide users in the basics (like listing an item effectively) on an app who’s whole purpose is facilitating buyers and sellers is unacceptable to me.",1

I emailed numerous times to ask when my account would be active again or at least safe to be active again....I NEVER got any response. I then emailed again to ask “what about my information? Could they see or access it since they were able to post stuff to my account? “ NO RESPONSE. Not even to say “we are looking into it”.

But with that being said, there are folks on here that are not honest, trying to get 1 on you, scammers. So you really have to ask yourself, is this too good to be true. And if the price is cheap & no way for you to test it out before purchasing & really looking it over? I would not even met up with the person. 
I stay away from items that look too go to be true & especially if the account was just made?? As in the same month or recent month and year, with no reviews from others. I’d say it’s a scam.

414,"Long-time Seller - Won't Be Coming Back: I've been using OfferUp since 2016 and have sold hundreds of items over the years. However, recently I've had much less success finding buyers quickly compared to other platforms. I suspect this might be due to the influx of intrusive advertising. As a seller, I'm now forced to watch ads before I can post items, modify listings, respond to messages, or perform any other actions. This once user-friendly app has become cluttered and frustrating, resembling an outdated interface similar to Craigslist.

The situation seems unlikely to improve, as OfferUp has turned to monetizing the marketplace with premium subscriptions. It's baffling to me why anyone would pay to see postings 30 minutes early, which doesn’t benefit the sellers who drive traffic to the app. To sum up my review: what has OfferUp done in the last eight years to improve the user experience? The answer seems clear to me: not much.",2
415,"Haven’t received money - such a hassle to deal with customer service: My partner sold an item for me but for some reason the sale was cancelled the same day as we shipped it (neither buyer nor us cancelled the sale). The item was shipped successfully (as per tracking number update and offerup update). But even dispute putting in deposit info within the 90 day limit, we still haven’t received the money. After submitting a request for customer service, we received an automated message then finally got an update within the app over half a month later. The in-app notification says to put in social security info and so many other things. Despite numerous tries, it doesn’t work and just says there’s been an error. We’re so tired of dealing with this and not getting any actual help.

Just stick to other services if you want to buy or sell items.",1

How does a number verify if what I’m selling is real?! There’s also a lot of creepy people on there asking inappropriate questions, even asking for inappropriate photos, and to send used clothing like underwears and bras. I understand that’s a fetish but this app is not for that. These so called “buyers” are newly added accounts that copy and paste messages to every seller they possibly can before they’re blocked from the app(IF they’re even blocked). It’s really annoying! I’ve had more of these “scammers” than actual buyers! They don’t update their system to where it can catch these “buyers”. I’m so close to deleting the app and telling everyone NOT to use this app. I’ve been a seller since 2013 and this is the only app with these problems. It’s getting to be ridiculous. If they’re really looking to make money on this app, they should really consider updating their system so it can flag those accounts/scammers.",1
417,"Still sliding downhill: Just an update, app has fallen downhill. I love the idea behind it.  Todays issue is I searched and it gave me a posting outside my requested 20 mile radius. Also, it was a car dealership at that. If I was looking for a car I would search for a car. Issues below are still going on. 

But it has some major issues. - if you search for something it keeps showing items like that in the overall whats for sale section leaving out items your missing when just looking. - old listings need to be removed after so many months. There are things from over a year ago. Make people re list items. - I think everyone should have a verified profile. Most fakes are new with no profile. - ads pop up way too easy on the newest update. - notifications settings. I keep getting you might be interested in notifications even though I only asked for notifications for buyers. Two stars max",2
418,Dumb: I will never be shopping with offer up again I’ve had an account for quite awhile but have never listed anything or bought anything until last night I was looking for a new security system for my house and made an offer and went to bed woke up to the seller accepting the offer only to have the seller decline the offer an hour later after my money had already been pulled from my bank account ($250) which not long after that lead to my account being deleted for suspicious activity and I’ve tried contacting their support team I have got no where I tried emailing them I have got no where I have screenshots of everything including the money withdrawn from my bank and time the seller accepting this offer and time the selling declining the offer and time and the deletion of my acc and time I have personally emailed this to offer up and have gotten no response my money has not been refunded so next step is now getting in touch with my bank to get my money back,1
419,"Gotta be the worst marketplace app: Its gotta be the worst marketplace app put there. I have sold at least 20 items on here, throughout the years. I have been using this app since around 2015. At first, it was full of honest people. And now, it is full of scammers. All they do is constantly search and low ball EVERYONE. You are selling a brand new Iphone? Well I will waste your time and ask you to sell it to me for a ridiculous price and drop it off. Beware! They typically will low ball you and then after you try to meet them, they will be be like “Oh if I pick it up, then you have to take 20$ off the price.” Its ridiculous and then you look at they’re selling location and they are 2 minutes away from you. So you can literally meet in the middle. The developers DO NOT continuously  block scammers so the app is full of them. Either they low ball you or ask if you can meet them in remote locations at night. JUST USE Meta MARKETPLACE, Poshmark, or Ebay. Way easier to deal with and less scammers, in my opinion.",1
420,"Hit & Miss Yard Sale App: Most people on this app are genuine, the rest are scammers. Be aware do your research before searching then buying. Why? Well OfferUp has items posted for cheaper and sometimes too expensive then what you buy in stores if it’s NOT SOLD OUT. But it’s a cool place to find rare items and SOLD OUT items that you really want. I love offerup better then other apps, I’ve made a lot of purchases and sold a lot as well. Best app in my opinion for extra cash when cleaning out your closet! 
THE APP is great for searching just got to word it right and you’ll find it. Some kinks as in you search “iPhone 7” you get “iPhone 7 Plus” also in the mix of postings. So read the titles and item description! A lot of ppl don’t do that and it’s such a waste of a message when you don’t pay attention to little details.",5
421,"Need to change buy now system: The app is great if you’re doing pick up, looking, or coordinating a pick up.

Bad experience with the buy now feature. I personally care that my money goes where it’s supposed to in a timely fashion. Which is something buyers should care about as the seller also gets to review how working with the buyer goes which can be impacted by a bad system. It took less than 12 hours from reviewing after receiving the item for them to take my funds, but sellers should be aware that if going through buy now it can take 6 DAYS to receive the funds. To me that’s just ridiculous and setting the system up for bad reviews. With transferring funds I can imagine it should take LESS than 2 DAYS for a seller to receive their funds after the final review by the buyer since they take it so quickly. Ridiculous! I’m very unhappy, and I was the buyer!",3
422,"Glitchy. Unscrupulous. Will sell your info: On my very first attempt to buy something…i sent the buyer a question using the Ask button. It didn’t seem to do anything…twice. I saw no Sent message in my outbox. The third time the email went through. I asked the buyer where they had originally purchased the item and why they were selling it. Simple enough, right? Next time I try to login it fails and tells me “Your account has been disabled due to violating our community guidelines”. It gives no explanation, no timeline, no way to contact anyone. What an amateur app. Do you think I will waste my time trying this app again? 

 Also, read the fine print before you buy or sell anything. When you click on many listings it takes you out of the app and to a third-party website in your browser. This app definitely has a lot of hidden agendas. You can tell from using it that it just isn't a normal buy/sell environment. There is a lot going on behind the scenes here.",1
423,One person wrote a bad review about me and offer up has banned me because of one person lies: I am very unsatisfied with offer up because I purchased a freezer for asking price and then the seller said that somebody else was offering $50 more. So I did not pay them the extra $50 because I thought that it was extortion to ask me for more money after paying the full asking price. So they reported me to the police saying that I stole money from them. And then they reported it to offer up with a police report and offer up has now banned me from use of their site when I have always been honest in all of my dealings on offer up. I had a five star rating on offer up with Meny purchases and sales and for offer up to believe this person was telling the truth about my actions was odd because of how many positive reviews that I had. It would sure be nice if offer up would reinstate me because I have always been honest in all of my dealings with every person that I have ever met on offer up.,1
424,"2021 OfferUp is complete garbage.: I’ve been using OfferUp for personal items, etc for the better part of 6 years. It’s always been dependable and reliable. Now, ever since the last update, and truyou verification, I don’t know why but the app is complete garbage. You post something and it will sit there. Nothing. I’ve used this app enough to know how too get people to look at items, and it even included views. Now posts average 1-2 views total. Plus I’ve messaged numerous people, for a pair of headphones, all different people all different zip codes all different prices and not one replied. Or read the messages. And their posts were posted no more than a month. 

Also, 90% of the things posted are dealership ads, car dealerships, phone repair ads, just ads as posts non stop. And some are multiple ads for the same thing. Unless you know exactly what you’re looking for don’t bother randomly aimlessly just looking through the timeline of things posted because odds are you’ll see 700 ads for a car over and over again",1
425,"Member since 2016: I have been using this app for years now and it has always come to the rescue when I needed it. Everything about this app just works, especially now with all the new additional features that didn’t exist a few years ago. The only suggestion that I would like to make and I have been wishing there was an option to do this since day 1 is to be able to select, mark as sold and archive more than just ONE single item at a time. I always try to be good about keeping things up to date but it would be nice to have a “select all” type option. Just to have the option to edit your public profile and what you are actually selling be a little bit more convenient and less time consuming. Thanks!",5
426,"Good app for getting rid of items: This app is not without faults. Some things are uncontrollable like the flakiness of potential buys or unresponsive sellers but others could be part of an update that would make the app so much better. Here’s a list of items to consider...

1. Get rid of the ads and hiding them within search results. We all know how to search the internet for things we want brand new. We come here to sell or to buy used or new  at a discounted price. Not a retailer.

2. When I search from something. I don’t need to see items that have been sold. How does that help me?

3. When I search for something. I don’t want to see items that were posted from 1 year ago. A notification should be sent to the seller that the item will be removed (by you) and will need to be re-listed if they still wish to sell it. 

4. Make notifying buyers that an item has been sold an option. “Do you want to notify other buyers that item has been sold?” And a “check all” button and list of customers to notify. I don’t believe potential buyers that were interested in the item months ago need to know that the item was sold.

5. If a buyer or seller receives a rating other than 5 stars. I would want to know in detail why. The reviewer can remain anonymous. 

 Thank you! 

Thank you!!",4
427,"Easy to use for buying and selling: I have used OfferUp for buying and selling and the process is very easy and safe.  Posting requires little effort and responding to people through the app is easy and secure. The one downside that I see is the rating system.  I received 4 stars from a buyer and the only thing that wasn’t perfect in the transaction was that I missed the buyers message that she was in the parking lot (designated meeting spot) of the store I was in because of a low phone signal so she waited about 15 minutes on me to respond.  I was very responsive before then so it was obvious that there was an issue!  Since then I have had 5 star reviews that brought that one up so it’s okay and I really don’t know how you could correct this issue so I guess it is what it is. Other than that, I like this platform for buying and selling and prefer it to CL or FaceBook based sites.",4
428,"OLD LISTINGS and RELISTING: PLEASE! Unless I’m missing something. There has got to be a better way to update listings. This not only helps buyers, but sellers too. 
When trying to buy something. There is so much that has been for sale for years out there. You ask a seller if something is still available and they either never answer or come back and say it sold or no, they don’t have it anymore. 
There has to be a way to get all the old items off and to make it easier for sellers to relist your items without remaking a new listing.  I even paid for the “promote” to move it back up in all the selling items and that was a waste of money. 
On other selling outlets, They can let you renew your listings and force old listing off if  the seller doesn’t renew after a certain time period. There is sooo much stuff out there that is no longer for sale taking up the site and my time. 
It’s very frustrating as a buyer and as a seller.",2
429,"What happened?: App was working as it shod until recently when trying to post an new item for sale. During the item  details. If i need to backspace to correct something like grammar or whatever. The entire page will shift up out of view and no matter what i do all i see is the next tab. If i close the app. Then reopen it. I can see the page in full agsin . I select the ‘post’ tab and the detail for item page is visible until i try to edit it. Then the keyboard blocks the writing so i cant see what im typing and if i do anything like hit the ‘done’ tab the whole page slides up out if view again showing only a blank white screen and the ‘next’ tab on top. If i hit next, the price input is visible. I input the price for item and hit the next and blank screen again and stuck on the ‘post’ tab. Hit post, but nothing happens. Ive tried reinstalling app several times to no resolve. Issue persists. Please fix this issue.",2
430,"Used to be better :(: I really like this app. Even when LetGo was still around, I preferred this a little; but, it just isn’t improving in a lot of ways. 

My biggest issue is that it doesn’t expire old listings. Now, I sell stuff too and I know when listings expire it can be annoying, but what’s more annoying is coming across items you’re  interested in that were posted 5 years ago! 

It’s beyond frustrating. Why is there no expire feature? Facebook market place has it and so does NextDoor. I remember Letgo even had it as well, so I don’t get why this doesn’t.  It’s so idiotic that listings never expire. They should go stale after maybe 3 months if the user doesn’t renew it. SO many listings are YEARS old and for what reason?? 99% of the people have thrown away the item/don’t have it anymore/moved somewhere.

I know there’s a sort by recent option but I use the “closest near me” option more. Plus, even with the recents first, items 8 months or a year or more old still show up. 

You need to put a feature in that will take these dry old stale listings off the marketplace and allow an easy option for the user to simply refresh it when needed. 

Oh, also, make the price shown on the actual search screen instead of forcing people to click the image to find it. It wastes time.",3
431,"Measurements People: I wish this site could somehow alert posters to include measurements. Even asking a question gets no response.
I wish this site could alert their posters to respond to questions or OfferUp / Letgo will remove their post assuming that no response means item has sold.
Have posters items deleted after a certain amount of time unless the poster responds to alert from OffeeUp/Letgo to confirm if still for sale. So frustrating to look at posts years old that seller does not respond.

As a elderly woman, I do not appreciate going to false addresses because the seller (also a woman) wants to protect herself. I have no idea how to fix that. Phone number provided was her boyfriend who finally answer his phone. He directed me to the right address (it was NOT a typo). I don’t appreciate knocking on strangers doors. Seller was thinking of her safety, NOT MINE!",4
432,"Changes needed: Allow users to send additional pictures of items instead of forcing users to the app to send our personal numbers to receive pics. For example if someone who’s selling an item and we want more pics of the item. The seller won’t make the effort to add pics to their post or listing. Instead they send the photos directly to our cellphones because they tell us, send me your number and I’ll send you more pics.. 

Solution: allow sellers to send additional photos from within the tread conversation with a potential buyer. 

Maybe even add a calling feature so that sellers and buyers can call each other to meet on time at a location instead of exchanging numbers. Do a call feature like Facebook messenger has or WhatsApp. Our phone numbers are protected this way.",4
433,"Almost Perfect: Like with any app, there’s good things and bad things. The good is that there’s always someone selling something you're looking for or at least close to it. Now for the bad, listings can be up to 3 years old so it can be disappointing. The developers really should remove anything after 1 year and even that is a stretch. The other thing would be the people who sell, they’re hit or miss. Sometimes you get a quick response, sometimes they respond once a week and sometimes never.  Granted the developers don't have power over who responds but, like the 3 year old posts, they could freeze accounts of the people who do not respond after a year and all items associated with them. I love this app and will continue to use it but maybe the developers could clean it up a bit. Thanks!",4
434,"Too many scams: Don’t get me  wrong offer up is a wonderful place to be able to sell your items however I feel like there are too many people that sell fake items and also too many fake accounts. The most common fake is “ send me your number” when there is direct messaging on the app. I also feel like a lot of buyers are flakes or just no shows! they message that they are interested in whatever you are selling but then never message back or when you set up a time they never message back I feel like offer up needs to at least have more security and have better notifications if you the buyer .. such as more reminders for them like “ are you still interested In this sellers item? Respond back” 
Instead of just having the sellers just hoping and waiting for them to respond. Some of us make a living off of this app. At least make it a little easier for the sellers.",3
435,"Account stopped working: I have had to open multiple offer up accounts because for some odd reason my accounts never work past one transaction. I have contacted offer up multiple times and my problem has never been solved. I have never posted to sell anything against the rules, never added my phone number, never  missed a meet up, always get 5 star reviews, am an true you member, then poof! My account won’t receive messages, send messages, post, nothing! This has happened to me on multiple offer up accounts for no rhyme or reason. It gets so old. My husbands account, SAME THING! I’ve missed out on so many things we’ve wanted to but because they haven’t resolved this. Because of this, goodbye offer up, back to CRAIGSLIST for me, never had to deal with this with Craigslist.",5
436,"Very happy customer!: I've only been a member for less than a year and my sales results have all been positive. I like that you can sell and search by category. But I have to say that what I like most of all is the privacy of the sale. I don't have an open form where everyone can see the content of the conversation. I am seriously thinking about removing myself from the online FB ""garage sale "" groups and just staying with Orderup! I recommend it to all my friends! 
However I absolutely hate that people ask about an item and then don’t respond. Another problem are no shows. People also need to learn how to change the search distance so they stop wasting our time inquiring about something they have no intention of buying bc it’s too far. OfferUp is great but definitely has it’s downfalls",5
437,"App features: I love the fact you can buy and sell easily.  In reality this app is great but what makes the app better is the popularity in it, the more people viewing the more chances to buy or sell. It’s too bad I can only view what people are selling now. I was band from offerup do to violation of policy. That is what the offer up team has told me. I don’t understand where was the violation despite me writing several messages. The only message that was sent to me was that I could no longer use offer up due to violation Policy. I really love this app but I cannot log into it anymore. I would really like for someone from OfferUp team to help me in this matter. I would really appreciate if somebody in the upperChain of command, like a manager help me out. Thank you very much.",5
438,"Flooded with Temu ads and bad algorithms: For a free app, it does the job pretty well. But I have to say I think it’s going downhill. **Notifications do not belong in the inbox section with messages. This is either bad UX planning or deceptive tactics to engage/ manipulate the user. The other main issue I have is that they’ve sold out to Temu for all their adverts. Offer up has allowed temu’s ads to mimic rows of actual user posts as to intentionally trick the user into clicking on ads for the worlds spammiest company. I understand you need ad revenue but this one is a terrible look and says a lot about values when customers are being deceived. Finally, the algorithm has somehow gotten worse. If I clear my search history, And my saved items, even delete and redownload the app it still populates my home feed with homogeneous content. Two weeks ago I searched for a bike, bought the bike, success. Every day since then , all I see are bike related posts.",2
439,"Not a good app: 1. App has no “renew” your listing option like Facebook Market Place has, so you are forced either promote your listing for $ or delete your listing completely and make a new one so you can be on top of OfferUp home page. Otherwise your listing is getting lower every day and minimizes your chases to sell it as time goes by. 

2. There are no prices on the listings you see at home page unless it is a screenshot from the web page of different retailers, so you have to open every picture to check the pricing. Very inefficient for potential buyers to find best deal they looking for.

3. Tons of scammers trying to get your phone number. Please make your page safe and secure place for both buyers and sellers by increasing steps for making an account so scammers wouldn’t be able just to go and create many fake accounts over and over again.

Now the good part I like about this app that I as a seller don’t necessarily need to put exact length or weight of the package, it’s all approximate and i get prepaid label right after someone makes a purchase. Very quick and easy steps for buyers and sellers.

I like that you get notifications about when your package is being reviewed/scanned buy courier and message when package was delivered.

Overall App needs a lot of improvements but definitely not the worst option to buy/sell various items.",2
440,"Payment Process Too Long: When a seller sells and ships an item in order to receive payment it takes way too long. The seller has to SHIP the item & WAIT for the buyer to receive the item. Therefore if i sold an item today until the item is process and handled through the post office & delivered at the buyers house which can be 3-7 days. On top of it the buyer has 2 - 5 extra days to view the item with NO PAYMENT, therefore you’d be waiting almost 2 weeks just for each shipping sale. After it gets delivered the buyer needs to be asked is everything ok. It wouldn’t take 5 days if someone has an overdraft money the money from the sale isn’t even valid anymore because the app takes so long to process the payments.",5
441,"Great in good times, really BAD when something goes wrong: I have used this app to purchase and sell things it works great in a lot of cases, that is until I got ripped off by someone, the user had “great reviews” all 5 stars with more than 30 plus sales, so I decided to purchase a macbook pro, after A few days I tried upgrading the OS and the computer started crashing every time I tried updating the OS. I took it to the apple store and they told me the ram was damaged. 

So I tried writing the seller he never answered obviously, what really bothered me is that Offer up didn’t do anything to the  guy that ripped me off,  not even reducing his rating.

So my advice to all of you, don’t believe that star ratings because it looks like offer up doesn't like displaying bad ratings to ripoffs, specially if they have “great reviews”",5
442,"👎🏼👎🏼: I am a person who has been with this application installed for a few years and I feel that the system of this application in one way or another tramples us as sellers for the reason that they without any communication take your publications for reasons that one cannot explain  Today I publish some bottles of coquito to sell since no kind of alcohol is published and without caring they erase the publication I go back and put trays of bakery sweets made by my wife for the season since we are going through this situation and honestly and  without hurting anyone we are looking for our money for rent and debts and they come and they delete it, I make a publication of some wheels of my car for sales and they do not have a person who has seen them because they have not published my  publication, I believe that with this they are not contributing anything to society that at the moment we are oppressed with this virus that has us without work and drowned and on top of this you  to be able to sell they make things more difficult for us !!",1
443,"Needs restructure: I used both apps, but sad to say letgo was the better app, because of it’s simplicity and layout. Letgo had topics, all your messages in one place, ease of viewing a message/person/item for a transaction, quick and easy to change area/search radius, and nothing felt hard to find. 
If OfferUp is the top dog in app marketplaces it has a long way to go IMO, why have messages and item messages in separate places, why search for something and get results 400 miles away because of shipping, why is the search area, and search radius in two different places to change, why is saved items/favorites and the messages about them not in one combine message center. Not to mention since the merger I’ve seen hundreds of scams/fake profiles while looking for a car on there. I’m sure things will get better, but just my opinion, take a page out of the Letgo book as far as layout and massages.",3
444,"OfferUp has a systemic notifications problem: This app is cool... but people are horrible about responding to ad inquiries compared to FB marketplace or other apps. Why? I think it’s because, like me, everyone disables OfferUp notifications because they are absolutely obnoxious. The ca’ching! sound and the frequency of unimportant crap invading my life every time something little in the app happens.

OfferUp is not a lifestyle, it’s just an app. They need to dial back the amount of things that require your attention. Maybe I don’t want to review a seller and be hassled about it every time I open the app. Yes, I know I can turn on notifications, stop hassling me about it, that’s why I’ve shut this app up - too many annoying, in-your-face attention grab attempts. It feels like walking down the street in Vegas with all the flippers trying to get you to take their flyer.

And I believe all this causes people to turn off notifications which results in a really bad communication experience between buyer and seller.",2
445,Features: Great app. Can’t fault them for users’ shortcomings when it comes to making things happen with a sale or purchase. The app works well and is smooth. There are a few features that should be included since the community has grown exponentially and killed off many competitors. They should add an option for video. I’ve purchased cars through here from sellers and would love to see a video feature added. This would also be nice to see all around angles of items for sell. May make it easier to sell things as well. Making PayPal and option would be awesome as well if it hasn’t already tried to be implemented. OfferUp has done well with their app and are always adding new features to stay ahead and give buyers and sellers better ability to make transactions.,5
446,"New issue since photo privacy increased: I use the OfferUp app quite a bit and it has been great! But since the latest iPhone update I have had a new issue. Offer up app allows me to choose between allowing the app to see selected photos or having access to all photos, which I love! But after I selected a few photos for it to have access to, I have not been able to add to that library since that initial action. So even though I want to post photos for the baby seat I am selling, I can only access the photos of my faucet, which I just added. I have found zero support for this via their customer support (which is a huge FAQs section and nothing else as far as I can tell!) so I’m here writing a review hoping this will get resolved. 😕🤷🏻‍♀️",5
447,"horrid customer service: DO NOT USE THIS APP! I am super sad to say this company has zero customer service skills and is very scam like. I paid to promote an item I was selling. Got an offer from someone out of town through their “sell nationwide” portion of the app. Offer came through, I accepted, and the shipping label didn’t show. It also said i initiated cancelation of the transaction which I did not. I emailed their customer service and got a copy and pasted reply for 2 days. Then radio silence. The buyer was super upset, as she wanted the item in a timely fashion. Both the app and website do not work for the “sell nationwide” feature. 

Also, I reported someone for selling very fake, cheap knock off YSL bags, and suddenly my account isn’t functioning right. Very shady stuff, I’ve contacted the appropriate local authorities about the illegal and counterfeit items being sold on this app. 

Wouldn’t recommend this app to my worst enemy. Use letgo, eBay or any other site except this one. At least other sites have REAL HUMANs working customer service, who actually reply.",1
448,Fix your buggy app: I’m sorry but I don’t understand how long it’s been live this app and yet I continuously have issues specifically with notifications and messaging. This trash app lags when you need the most you can be in the middle of a conversation with a buyer on an item that you’re selling and then the conversation either locks up to where you have to close the app and go back into it or it says that you sent a message that never sent or you have customers that are waiting eagerly to buy your item and you never even get a notification saying that they have sent you messages so you end up not knowing towel maybe possibly days later and then at that point the customer would have already purchased your item from somewhere else. This is ridiculous some people use this app for business use to sell multiple items to customers not just selling an old couch one time and then never using the app again please fix your garbage app before I just go to eBay and start using them.,1
449,"Get Mercari instead: I started using Mercari & OfferUp at the same time to find some old LEGO sets for my kiddo.  We live in a small town in Montana, so we didn’t use it to buy nearby, everything was shipped.  I attempted to buy 8 different things, 3 of the people actually responded, all three items were not as described when they arrived.  One was missing way more pieces than mentioned, another had a box that had been eaten by a rodent (unmentioned in listing, and not visible in photo), and the last item was terribly packaged, arrived crushed with a hole torn in it, also missing more pieces than listen, and completely unusable as a gift.  The sellers on OfferUp don’t seem to have any idea what they are doing.

Trying to deal with these issues was even worse.  The interface was hard to use, when items had been delivered they didn’t show that way in the app, so I had to wait days to file complaints.  The whole interface is so awkward compared to Mercari.

Of those other 5 “offers”, 4 were radio silence, the other guy raised the price of his item after I had already offered to buy it...  not the way I expect a sale to work.

I eventually bought 7 sets off Mercari.  It was simple to use, the sellers all responded quickly, and shipping was integrated so even if the package arrived before it showed in the app, I could report it has arrived and give feedback without having to wait.  Just save yourself from the crazies that use OfferUp and go with Mercari!",1
450,Too much of a hassle to be low balled constantly: Give your stuff to the Salvation Army. Those people will at least be grateful... Unless you post your stuff for free if they pick it up. It’s just low baller nation for broke people who are mostly not kind and not worth dealing with. Most of the stuff being sold on here is stolen as well. So that’s fun dealing with. If you enjoy sitting through hours and days of lowballers or people who claim to want to buy it then don’t show up or stop communicating.... Offer up is perfect for you. If you want to save all of the hassle. Have a garage sale then give away everything you didn’t sell to goodwill or donate it. Offer up is for people who love to deal with a lot of bs for pennies. 1 out of every billion times you look you’ll find a quality deal. Is that worth it to you?,5
451,"I’m officially off of this app.: I really don’t like talking bad about apps, but unfortunately that’s the case with this app. I had the app and it was working fine. When all of a sudden I wasn’t able to post another listing. The app kept telling me there was an error and that I should try again later. So I waited. FOUR HOURS LATER THE APP IS STILL TELLING ME THE SAME THING. So I figured I have to delete the app and reinstall it. Lord, lemme tell you. I uninstalled the app three times and got met with the same results. I even changed my password, and when I did this the item I was trying to sell prior to this new listing was removed from my account. So I try to contact support. I can’t call them because it’s 7pm my time, so I go to the support page, click on the bottom link stating “contact support” get led to a site to log in, and the dang link brings me back to the log in page.

I clicked the link, changed my password and tried logging on both through the app, browser and original email and was unable to reach out to customer support to inquire about the reason for cancelling. All in all an incredibly frustrating experience for someone who was trying to make their first purchase through the app.

Update: I was notified my account was identified as “high risk” and was deleted without any additional information. I tried pressing to see if I needed to add anything to my profile to help but was told they wouldn’t reverse their decision. All in all terrible customer service and little interest in getting a new customer...",1
453,"This Review is of the App, not the people: The App is very well made and will make selling, buying a very simple and clean experience. The Built in location sharing for where to meet up is nice as well. I have bought and sold a LOT on here and only ran into 1 guy trying to sell me a fake phone, again, not the phones fault and not much they can do since people can just make a new account and keep being frauds. 

As far as what they CAN control, they do a good job. 

A suggestion however, for people who when looking for an item, messages MANY people at a time for likely chance of getting an item , there should be a feature to mute conversations you are no longer interested in Because getting messages back from people you no longer need to hear from is annoying .",5
454,"You have to use their shipping label. (Seller account): They don’t warn you that you have to use their shipping labels when you make a sale. But to be fair you can find that info in the help section. But why would you need to go to help section before making a sale though? I’m a small time seller on mercari and eBay, and they are straight and narrow with you. So I figured I’d get into selling on this app as well. OfferUp is straight garbage. After the sale I basically paid for my own shipping label at the post office, before realizing I had to use their shipping label. I don’t own a printer. Now offerup is threatening to cancel my sale because I’m not using their shipping label although my item shipped. Customer service is non existent, you literally can’t get ahold of anybody. There is a bot to answer your messages and give you the run around. I tried calling only to get another bot to give you another run around. I tried messaging them on fb but haven’t heard anything yet. I will update as time goes on but I don’t expect to get paid for what I sold.",1
455,"Better then Craiglist and more kid friendly: One thing I hated about craiglist and other websites that allow you sell items was all the scammers and other things like personal adds that were very annoying.I appreciate the folks who manage the offerUp site keeping it clean . There are a few bugs that could be fixed but overall a CLASSY version  Compared to other sites /apps :) thanks guys. 

Update :they added a free category which is nice to have but people are severely abusing it . Starting to get cluttered with ads for services and scams, people shouldn’t be allowed to post things in the wrong category or post things in the free category that they’re actually asking money ,waste everyone’s time having to scroll through trying to find which posts are actually legitimate.",5
456,"Was a good app, bad pop up ads: I’ve used OfferUp since 2015 and it’s been great until the past few months, I’ve never written a review for OfferUp but this has gotten so bad here I am. OfferUp advertisements especially Apple Music advertisements are set at like 100x more touch sensitivity. You can be scrolling through your home page and if your finger even scrolls over top of the advertisements it jumps to the web and tries to open another app. It’s difficult to even scroll through the feed now just because I’m getting stuck constantly opening Apple Music ads when I’m not trying to. The horrible targeted advertisements in this app were bad enough before so please for the love of god save us from the ads that literally take us out of the app to blank pages or other apps. So please turn the ad sensitivity down and stop changing it every update from low sensitivity to max thinking we aren’t gonna notice.",2
457,"Worst customer service ever!: I use to sell a lot of items on offer up with no issues, then one day I was having log in issues and Luna count was just removed and said I violated something and when I reached out via email they just sent me a template that says they have the right to remove accounts with no explanation. I responded asking for a reason why so I could understand what I did wrong and would just get the same auto template reply. My husband tried to start a account and his was linked to mine and they won’t fix it. Again I sold 100’s of items with no issues and had a great rating and feed back. I’ve been trying to resolve this for 3 months and get my account back and inquire why my husband can’t have an account and we get no explanation. The worst thing is they don’t have a customer service number or even life chat, it’s literally snail mail that takes days with auto replies. Absolutely terrible. Your better off just using fb marketplace!",1
458,"SELLERS UNPROTECTED: I was dealing with a buyer who claimed my item was damaged when received. Now this either happened during shipping OR the buyer damaged my item on accident and wants a refund. So the buyer has 2 days until they can request a refund. Before those 2 days expire, I write numerous claims and disputes to offerup to clear things up. After a total of 8 disputes and claims, they wait til the buyers claim is reviewed and then they simply refund him and allow him to ship a damaged item back to me. That is a missing unit. Damaged/irreplaceable/non profitable. I make one more claim/dispute towards offer up in the same manner my buyer did. I requested a refund for an item that was broken when shipped back to me. Offerup has clearly decided to blow off my dispute and hasn't gotten back since. Most idiotic, rage-inducing, robot automated customer service ever! Buyers can break or take your items and you as the seller have to suffer. Go ahead and move to FB marketplace or create your own website for e-commerce and drop shipping.",1
459,"It’s okay. Too many scammers though: It’s a decent app. You can connect with people. Sometimes the app is very clunky when trying to execute a task. And that includes dealing with scammers. The app is absolutely and utterly flooded with scammers. You will mysteriously have one item posted literally over a hundred times in one day by multiple users, all with the same email account on the same picture posted. The only way you can do anything about it is to report each picture one by one. And then it will take several days for them to take it down and in that time the same scammer has posted several hundred more of the same post again. Luring people in with its false offer. And again you have to report those new pictures one by one. It just keeps accumulating which also renders  the notification feature for new items basically useless because it is nothing but scammers. Very, very annoying.",2
460,"Lacking notifications!: I am shocked to see that this app has 5 stars. It lacks to notify me when someone contacts me with interest in a product I am selling. I don’t have the time to look at my phone 24/7 and have already missed 7 offers. This is especially ridiculous considering what the app is made for. If this wasn’t such a difficult process I would have rated OfferUp 5 stars!

Also, I tried contacting the support team but the only way to contact them is through social media apps. Not everyone is a fan of this method of choice, and their contact through Gmail is no longer in tact. 

- Please make it more versatile to communicate to customer services as well as  allowing notifications within the app itself.",5
461,"Counterfeits and scams: There are so many counterfeit shoes and clothes on your platform.  They even advise they are selling counterfeits by calling them reps, UA, or other common terms.  Some say the price reflects the authenticity.  You should be able to block and then ban them.  If someone sells a bunch of counterfeits on your site, it affects the others who are selling legitimate products.  I showed up to buy a pair of shoes and they were counterfeit.  He tried to pass them off as legit.  I reported it and then he deleted his ad and account to just restart again with another fake account.  Then he called them reps on the new ad.  Why do you allow these fakes to be advertised?!?! Wasted 3 hours of my time because of your counterfeit issues.

Car sales are another scam.  They post it for $1200 for a relatively new car and say they can’t respond to the messages in OfferUp so to email them and they list their email.  It’s a scam.  Newly created account and asking to email.  You should be able to block them.",1
462,"Please help to reactive my account: My Offerup account was deactivated all of a sudden today and I guarantee I did not violate any regulation to the best of my knowledge. I have been a loyal user of Offerup since 2016 and my account has more than 100 FIVE STAR reviews. I sold more than 800 items over the years and I have 180+ followers. I have been a big fan of Offerup since the first day I used it and I recommended Offerup to many of my friends and family members. I like and admire the platform that Offerup offers and I spent tons of effort to build my Offerup account. I made a living by selling on Offerup during the COVID 19 time and I tried my best to satisfy every single buyer. I think extremely highly of obeying the regulations of Offerup and that's why I am pretty sure I did not violate the rules. However, my account was suddenly deactivated right after I posted a cat tree and a radio. Thus I am so much confused about what happened to my account. Please kindly reactivate my account and keep my postings. Thank you.",1
463,"No customer support.: Can’t receive messages for a while now and when I post no one responds and I don’t see the item if I try to search it so clearly no one is seeing my post. I’ve tried to contact Offerup but they don’t have a number and no one ever responds to the Offerup support email address. It’s crazy how bad their customer service is. It’s basically non existent. Also it’s super annoying that Offerup allows businesses to post on here because that stuff is not discounted and takes up all the feed space
So after posting my review here, Offerup sent me an auto reply email that said my account was removed because I posted a sign that said “moving away sale” on the cover picture.... they said there is no advertising allowed which is hilarious since as I mentioned earlier I hate the companies who advertise on Offerup. My post was of items I was selling before I moved. How does this make any sense. I was not advertising and they won’t allow me to reactivate an account ever again?!!?!?!?!! Terrible customer service",1
464,"Simple, Useful, and Also Annoying AF: Great app aside from a serious oversight in UX. Why is there no option to selectively disable notifications for when a Facebook friend installs the app? Frankly, I don't care that ""Michael"" just joined OfferUp. Also there's about 10 ""Michael""s on my friends list, so by not showing the last name the notification manages to be not only unnecessary, but completely useless.

Listen, I understand the point of these fluff notifications is to remind your users that the app is on their phone in hopes that they might open it, scroll past a few ads, and rake in a few more pennies to keep the engines running back at HQ. But come on, I can't even go back and disconnect my Facebook account. Guess I'll just turn off all notifications until an update with that option hits. ✌️",5
465,"fake accounts: Have had this app for less than a week, and I have received multiple scam messages. Only downloaded it because they took over LetGo, an app which rarely had these issues. Will update the review if this trend changes.
Update: Terribly disappointed with this app. I click on a kayak, less then 10 seconds later I get 50 adds for kayaks on the web, click on a guitar, 50 adds for guitars, accidentally click on a candle? Welp you guessed it, 50 adds on a candle. At least promote items for sale within your own app??? 
 Also half the items shown are marked as sold, why do they show sold items constantly on the feed? And why is my feed filled with items from over a year ago even when I have it set to chronological order? Not to mention more than half the items are not even from my state, when it is set to pick up within a small radius. I miss letgo, where the items shown were actually still available and located within the sales radius.",1
466,"I’m not sure about this app. LADIES READ THIS: Beware if you wanna want to use this app, there’s a lot of creeps on here. Like people would try to lure you, so you have to be careful especially the LADIES!!! People are crazy out there, I’ve been harassed on here MULTIPLE TIMES, almost every day. If I could upload all of my saved screenshots I WOULD JUST TO SHOW THAT THIS APP IS UNRELIABLE. I’ve reported countless of weirdos on here and I’m not quite sure if Offerup has taken a look into the situation(s) and have done anything to fix it. I know it’s not Offerup’s fault cause they can’t control perverts but respectfully, I’m just trying to make money and treated with respect like everyone else? Offer up should only allow people who have joined their “TruYou” to continue to use this app. It’s constantly frustrating, so therefore I’m not using this app anymore. Depop is a better community where everyone treats each other with respect! I’ve never been harassed on there, and people actually communicate and not flake last minute. NEXT",2
467,"Great app but still needs improvement: Overall the app does very well in terms of face-to-face sales. 

One of the issues is the whole cashless system that doesn’t really evoke trust between potential buyers from other states. 

There’s nothing preventing anybody from taking your money and not sending you what you asked for. This has not happened to me but this is another reason why I do not buy anything out of state and I always meet locally and face-to-face with cash.

The other issue that I have with this app is saving searches and getting notifications of items in that search that have nothing to do with the search criteria. I think that was to be updated and more specific.

 I do think a great addition to this app would be a video feature letting you describe what you’re actually selling. This would be incredibly useful for selling vehicles and other specific items. 

I personally rather watch a video then read the gigantic paragraph describing the vehicle.

Another additional would be to remove the No link feature. As in when you add a link offer up removes it automatically. This is extremely frustrating for people using this to generate business and income. I think allowing URL links would increase traffic and encourage more purchasing.",4
468,"Review of this app: A fantastic app. I don't remember how I found this app, but it's one of my favorites. I'm not always active- either as a buyer or a seller, but whenever I'm looking for something, I come here first. I found the car that I drive every day on this site. When my granddaughter needed a car, we found it here too. As I declutter, this site is a great place to post my belongings, and finding local people to sell to is very beneficial. I'm not bombarded with junk offers here. I continue to tell everyone I know about the site. If you are a new user, welcome. If you've been around here for a while, I'm sure you understand  where I'm coming from. I will continue being both buyer and seller for a long time to come. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to post my opinion. Happy holiday to all",5
469,"This app leads to lots of sales: I have had lots of luck with free advertisement that this app provides. It promotes our listings for free for the first days which makes sure lots of potential buyers see it. This app makes it easy for buyers to make an offer and for them to talk to sellers. I will say, the one thing the app can improve on is screening for vulgar & inappropriate language before each message can be sent to the other recipient in a chat between a buy and a seller, as I have been called and told horrible things from 1 upset person because I told him the item was sold. That is the only issue I see but other than that - I love this app for making it all about making sales, money, and OFFERS! OFFERUP gets a 5 star rating in my book!",5
470,"!!!!Thieves!DO NOT Download!!!!!: This app somehow signed me up for a promotion that I never agreed to. They(offer up) will not let me even update apps on my App Store until my billing information was changed so that they could charge me immediately for a bogus premium account that I never signed up for. 

         They’re obviously running a racket(scam) because no one needs a premium offer up account and when you try to get a refund their policy is automatically no refunds for the three day premium account promotion… I wonder why that is? SCAM!!! 
         
         DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!! it’s a huge waste of time due to the posts Never getting deleted and lasting for years on end. Not to mention the ridiculous rules that are just there to scam people out of their money.",5
471,Multiple posts of same item is awful: I really like OfferUp in general but I’m incredibly frustrated with trying to buy a car because so many people list their car over and over. I have been looking for a specific car and I’ve seen several listings anywhere from 2 to 8 times. Them trying to buy a toolbox I come across the same problem. Then trying to buy a phone same problem in addition to SO many of the phones being stolen. If OfferUp would help the buyer instead of catering to the seller by allowing them to list the same post over and over and over and over. I would respect OfferUp but now I’m just going to use her and never call her back like I was still in high school trying to get lucky!,5
472,"Took my money, blocked my account!: Been using these guys moderately for a few years now. I was even paying $20 per month for their scam ad promotion nonsense. Then recently my account is now blocked from listing, of course after they charged me again for this months fees. Contacting their customer service is useless. Their only responses have been to wait 2-3 days and then copy and paste some vague pre-canned nonsense that never directly addresses my concerns. My phone is verified, my fb is linked etc. I’ve never had an issue that I’m aware of with anyone on here as a customer or seller? They keep trying to force me into joining truyou and uploading my drivers license which seems a bit extreme just to post ads. I’m not sure why they feel this is warranted or appropriate? Either way, after seeing how terrible their customer service is I’m certainly not comfortable trusting them with my sensitive documents. Guess I’ll go back to fb and all the other FREE apps that are readily available.",1
473,"No Use w/ VPN Privacy - Invasive: OfferUp used to be our favorite selling and buying app. NOT anymore!! They are determined to run off anyone who values their privacy which in turn ruins theirs and others business. Is there control and nosiness worth the loss of money? OfferUp does by disallowing all people that use VPNs. They do not allow there app to operate as they disable all use including login with the use of VPN. Many people use VPNs to protect their privacy and exact location especially in these times, which is their right to do so. If OfferUp needs that kind of private information about users of their app then they’d better understand that many will be leaving because of it. Actions have consequences and these data greedy companies will be learning that the hard way. OfferUp has pushed their invasion too far. Our entire group is sick of having to disable VPNs just to open OfferUp app. Who do they think they are?!! All of us, strictly over this issue alone, are FINISHED WITH OFFERUP INDEFINITELY!! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!",1
474,Things need to be fixed or reworked: This app is actually useful as you can buy some near by where you live or a city next to you which I guess is good as well but there are some issues with this app. One is that the search alert then gives you results from outside where you wanted to give you like it’ll give you from other states that are far from you. Another thing is that things need to be removed if the owner of the item is no longer either selling or no longer active so the item could be removed so other sellers can have there already items selling. I think items that your interested should appear as soon as you open the app even if they are new or older items. And maybe fixing the profile with like an Instagram type of format but maybe just a bio and some information to give to buyers.,3
475,"To many scammers to find anything real: Half the people selling are scammers the other half are selling garbage. The very few people selling decent stuff are selling them at full price saying firm but I’d rather buy it brand new instead of used at that point. I’m all for recycling when it’s a better deal then buying brand new. Sadly most other profiles with stuff are still being shown when they haven’t been on in a year or two. Things need to change for me to use this crappy app. 

Filter out scammers. When I say scammers I mean the people that post from several different states the same item. Or the scammers offer something to good to be true saying they will give someone the item if they call there number and wish them happy birthday or they got a promotion so they want to give away this item. Seriously I have reported so many scam accounts and posts but I don’t see any end.

Deactivate posts if the profile hasn’t been used in a couple of months or years.",1
476,"So Helpful: OfferUp makes selling so easy. I’m extremely glad my friend told me about this app before my move when I needed to get rid of some things. Even stuff I otherwise would’ve thrown away sold in 24-48 hours and it feels so good to recycle so someone else can use it. I would’ve considered Craigslist otherwise and the riffraff over there is so unbearable I likely wouldn’t have had much success. Don’t f around with anyone less than 5 stars bc there’s a reason some people have only 2 or 3 stars (they’re usually flakes). The intuitive listing algorithm is almost always correctly categorized just from the title, and the app is very intuitive to use. I’ve only been selling and haven’t bought, but I’ll keep this app top of mind for everything I need to buy or sell in the future.",5
477,"Suggestion: First, I want to say I love using this app and have made some sales. 

Second, I have some ideas to improve the app. 

Please remove the feature where the buyer asks the seller if an item is still available. A lot of potential buyers go around pressing the “ask” button asking if an item is available and when the seller responds, letting them know the item IS available, the buyer has already moved on to other accounts pressing that button with no intentions to buy. It is a huge time waster and completely irrelevant. 

By removing that question button, I think it would simplify the transaction process.  INSTEAD the OfferUp Application, could automatically send the seller notifications, asking about the item status (still available? Sold? Etc.) to keep the item status up to date. 

Examples of useful alternative questions available for the buyer to ask: “I would like to purchase this item but I have some questions about it first.” Or, “I am ready to purchase this item when can I get the process started?”

Selling or buying items is extremely satisfying. If offer up had more successful transactions, people would be more excited to download this app and enjoy it!",5
478,"Too many notifications: I’ve been noticing two problems that I think are related: 1) offer up sends unnecessary notifications, and 2) sellers don’t check their messages. Sometimes I get annoyed with all the reminders suggesting that I shop or sell with this app, so I disable notifications, but then I don’t find out when someone messages me. I think that happens to other users too b/c a lot of times I don’t hear back from sellers and their items stay listed for months afterward and I can see that my message has been delivered but not read. I notice this more often on items that have been up for a long time already, like a year or more. It seems like users tend to get fed up and just stop using the app after a while. 

Otherwise the features are great, the app seems to run alright on my older phone. A lot of the adds are for scam websites, but hey I guess that’s the cost of a free app.",3
479,"Worst!!! User beware!!!: I used Offerup for years, i had a old account with 40+ 5 star reviews, sold a lot of items. Recently app changed. Before it used to be unlimited posting for free, and they changed it 15 fre a month, and if you want more you can only purchase 200 postings for 157$. It is pricey and frustrating, but i can understand that. Fine, i’ve paid and purchased additional postings. In 2 month my account was closed twice with no reason no explanation. Above I mentioned that i have been using it for a while and i was extremely careful not to violate any rules. Last time my account was closed i wrote a lot of emails to customer service, and they told me “sorry it was a system issue”. Now they closed it and they say it is not going to be recovered. I paid 157$ for 200 posts 5 days ago, and they are not planning to give me a refund of that as well. What is this if not fraud? I’m going to use every possible platform to inform people how dishonest offerup works!!!",1
480,"Why so much HATE on these reviews?: I agree that the functionality of the app has dropped slightly after merging with LetGo, but the app still works fine and gets the job done (making a sale). People who are having issues with this app either have an outdated iPhone, are selling poor items and shipping them expecting everything to work out fine, or complaining about small issues like deleting messages, notifications, photo orientation, scam accounts, or cheapskates lol. People just post your item with high quality photos, know when someone is trying to scam you, and don’t lose your mind over a few notifications this app throws at you.

The color way should go back to white and green though. That dark blue with green accents is a step backwards in design lol.",5
481,"No customer support: Suckiest selling app. I have ever used. Deleted my account without warning. In the middle of several high paying transactions. No customer service when my account was hacked. Stick to Craigslist, Letgo, EBay or mercari. They are so much better and will help if you have any issues. Save yourself the headache. I have had over 72 transactions with all 5 star ratings. Emailed them several times but no reply yet wanted me to ship the items after they banned my account no way. Use a different app so many better ones than OfferUp. They are the worst app to use and only protect scammers and not good sellers or buyers. I personally won’t ever use them again and told everyone I know not to use them either. Very shady app. stay away",5
482,"Good but not perfect: Offer Up is a good place to buy and sell personal items you no longer want or need. It is better than Craig’s List, but lately it’s like an unregulated e-Bay. The sellers/buyers are becoming less and less reliable and more and more untrusting. I have, in multiple occasions, had sellers change their posted price after initial offer or sell an item to someone else after agreeing upon a meeting pick up and pay. Sometimes buyers don’t show up for sales. There is an option for reporting an individual, but I find Offer Up has a lack of discipline with no sign of repercussions for such behavior. I will still use the app because it is better than Craig’s List, but I have less trust in a transaction until it is completed. Buyers and sellers use at your own risk, people have less ethics these days and Offer Up is another one of those vessels for people to take advantage of others with a simple transaction.",2
483,"Beware of Scammers-Lots of Them: I haven’t listed on here in a while but decided to try again today.  Within minutes of my posting, I had 3 people try and convince me they needed to do business via texting vs. thru the app and pay thru Paypal-all they needed was my email address. It all just sounded fishy, and another few minutes went by with more of the same. Turns out, this IS a scam. I understand you can’t keep out everyone, but there shld be a way to keep people from this or warn us. Everyone shld go thru some process to be a member on here-or maybe that’s impossible. I am on 2 other sites similar to this and never had an issue with them. It’s just sad people can’t live life without trying to bring harm to others. And worse that we can’t get protection from these people.",5
484,"Need better rating system: The rating feature doesn’t really say anything about the buyer. A buyer can make an appointment and a meeting time, and then completely flake and there are no drawbacks to this. A seller would like to know before wasting a day or working around a buyer only to find that the buyer is playing games. 
It would also be helpful if there was more of a breakdown… So if a person has four stars is it because they have all five stars and one one star? Or has everyone given them 3 1/2 stars, do you know what I mean?
I still like the app, but I wanted to get some constructive feedback. Plus I wanted to ring a persons neck today who basically baited me all day, made me drive 15 miles, only to say 30 minutes after we are meant to meet that their car broke down. Jerk",5
485,"Annoying to use: I used this app mostly for buying at first, but then decided to sell some stuff. At first it was working fine, people were able to see my items and I was able to see it on the main feed. After a few hours I noticed the views had stopped rising. I checked to see if the items were on the main feed, nothing. They still showed up in y profile, but nothing in the main feed when I searched them up. I contacted support and have not heard anything back. It’s like they don’t care. If I have done something wrong with my listings or broken a guideline, which I assume I haven’t, I would at least expect a notice or warning that I have done so. As of currently my items are still invisible and I have received no help. 

Edit: Buying is also a pain as of now. Sellers will just completely ignore and not respond to any messages or offers. 

So overall 2/5, buying experience is fine, but selling is a complete mess.",2
486,"Not Happy: I’ve made a few sales using this app and I was relatively happy with it despite the tons of inactive users who never reply after they ask if your item is still available and all the spammers, but I’m so tired of Offer Up sending me notifications about items it recommends to me simply because I VIEWED them at some point. I saw a ridiculous pair of Crocs so I clicked on them for amusement. Now the app constantly tells me whenever someone has Crocs for sale. Same for items I’ve sold (and therefore do not need) like book shelves and other furniture items I have zero interest in. I expressed this to customer service and of course nothing has changed. It’s been months and I’ve stopped using the app because it’s so irritating.

If they fixed this and took care of the spammer problem (they need to ban the IPs/remove access to the app, not just take down spam that users can and do easily repost), I’d give it another chance and update my review. Otherwise, it’s just not worth using when there are alternatives.",1
487,"Don’t offer up your sanity: Nothing but issues, since a friend recommended. Buyers pulling tricks to raise prices, after you already offered, paid for, and item marked as shipped. The latest issue, item agreed on, paid for, and marked as shipped. Seller, if doesn’t ship with 3 days, got warned by app to ship. Next, I’m messaged by the seller. States if I wanted the item, I’d have to pay an additional $76 lol App support does absolutely nothing. You still have to wait 5 days or more for cancel and/or refund. Literally, it’s a 10-step process to report and/or block someone for being shady, or harassing you via message. Hands gives you better support, than Jessica of support for this app. Emails repeatedly the exact same thing. Spewing garbage that isn’t helpful. Keep your sanity. Don’t offer it up to this garbage app. Stick to the others. I’ve gone through the same issues with 95% of sellers on this app. Marking items as ‘shipped’, than you inquire as to status. Then told, “I don’t want to ship it”. Lol Then wait another 5 days for a refund.",1
488,Major Security Issues: Someone listed a fake car listing in Chicago with my profile.  I had logged in only with Facebook and had no Password setup. I disconnected Facebook and created a password to stop the listing.  The next day the same car was reposted in my name again Los Angeles.  Hackers have a back door into this app because neither my Facebook or the password was compromised.   Offer Up has no easy way to call them and address this major security risk and the larger concern is that they never got back to me to address if my other data may have been compromised.  I deactivated the account but when I open the app the account still shows open.  I went through the complete account setup to make sure all my info was secure and I have no assurance it hasn’t been compromised.,5
489,"You’re definitely going to want to read this...: OK the only reason I won’t post one star is because perhaps people won’t take me as seriously, but truthfully, it should just be one star let’s be honest 

This is Such a useful app!!!!! (Wait!!!) ...that it becomes useless when it does not actually post as viewable/searchable listing which happens??FREQUENTLY!!! (...continued after the photo...)

Thanks for the three views guys. Why do you even allow people to “post” things if they’re just shadow banned? Why don’t you just straight up let me know what the issue is please? I’ve been an OfferUp user for years and don’t know why this randomly happens...
(There was one other time like a year ago you guys did this before and when I wrote you you immediately fixed it) seriously, you guys just pretend that something is posted and then act like there were actually three views? (which were probably from me checking it in my own app?) 
This is ridiculous, can you please resolve? I would be selling Way more things on OfferUp if it actually worked, i’m such a great and honest seller and unfortunately for you guys and for me, this “tool” has been SO extremely useful to me which is to say extremely useLESS at the moment",5
490,"Sale In Process feature: I absolutely love offer up and I’ve actually made hundreds of dollars within the last year using their service as well as other sales services. Out of every selling app I choose offer up as my favorite. The only suggestion I would make is to have a feature that shows the status of your item as ‘Sale in Process’. Sales don’t always work out, but I respect the order in which someone was interested and I don’t want to take my item down or indicate sold until I actually meet with that person. But in that downtime between meeting a potential buyer, other interested buyers are reaching out and I spend my time explaining the situation to them. It would be nice to have something that shows that there is a buyer I am working with. Or ‘Sale Pending’? It would save both the seller and the buyer’s time!",4
491,"Don’t waste your time this app has been messed up for over a year!: 3m ago
I would give a -5 Star rating if I could!
I used to love this app and used it exclusively but I’ve been having trouble with this app for over a year now. I’ve tried off and on to use it again. I would post items for sale and then couldn’t see them in the feed. I would ask to buy and not get a response. About 20 minutes ago my phone just started shooting a bunch of messages at me from inquiries I sent 6 months ago. 🤣🤣🤣 So then I think great! They’ve got it fixed. So I go to mark some items I’ve had on here from a while ago that have sold elsewhere and again seeing can’t connect to the server, try again later messages. I have tried deleting/reloading the app, rebooting my phone and everything. It shouldn’t be this messed up. Don’t waste your time with this app people! There are others out there that actually work. Make OfferUp Great Again!!!
Maybe I’ll hear from you today or 6 months from now. Who knows??? 😡😡😡😡😡",1
492,"Great app but can improve a users experience…: First, I would like to say that I greatly appreciate this app and have saved hundreds of dollars in buying items from my local sellers and I also have recommend this app to many of my friends who live across the US. With that said, however, I do feel like there are some small tweaks that would hopefully reach the programmers so users like me could benefit from. 

1: the swiping gesture on iOS that enables a user to “go back” requires about a 50% minimum distance before it becomes enabled. This can be fatiguing when going through many posts. I would recommend reducing this to about a 30% distance. 

2: creating the ability to have general filters on the main “for sale” page. One specific filter would be to show “most recent” posts in order to improve efficiency for the seller and buyer, as well as avoid seeing old, inactive posts.

3: a “global seller block” would be ideal as i see many spam posts, or duplicate postings. Some sellers post their entire beanie baby collection, for example, and have each item as an individual one which takes up space for other items. 

I have other smaller or less important feedback but these are my main ones. I would be happy to discuss more too! Thank you!",3
493,"Way too many inactive listings!!!: To the folks that own OfferUp - somebody seriously needs to start cleaning up all the inactive listings (especially in the Las Vegas area)! There are thousands of listings on your site that are inactive; where the seller listed something and either simply forgot about it, or they never had the item in the first place. There needs to be some kind of accountability when listing an item, if not- it's a complete waste of time! I know the site wants to make it look like there are thousands and thousands of things for sale, when in actuality its probably only 15% of the items listed that are currently active. There are hundreds of sale items that are over a year old, where the seller probably doesn't even have this app anymore. There needs to be a time limit on sale items, and after that time limit has been reached, the seller will have to re-list their item if they still want to try and sell it!",2
494,"Notifications Lie: Everyday I get notifications that I have messages that are not messages but rather spam from offer up. Everyday it waste my time suggesting things for me to search for. Also everyday it shows the same items for sale and rarely updates to show any new posts. Pretty disappointed in this app, especially since everyone is now using other platforms to sell things for more for what they are actually worth. Offer up seems to be a community of disorganized rude people selling a lot of stolen goods. I have had to report dozens of people and it just continues so I wont be using the app much in the future. I have had about 10% success selling things here and buying things the other 90% of my experiences with Offer up errors and constant harassment that i have messages when its not messages it Offer up spam mail every single day 2-3 times a day. Super annoying lil app!!",2
495,"No to the merger: Who decided that is was a good idea for OfferUp and Letgo to merge? Two separate platforms have all of us more options to buy and sell. We all had different buyers and sellers on both platforms, some who only used one but not the other. Also, my ratings from Letgo did NOT transfer. 

There is so much room for improvement too. A full featured desktop version would be great. It semi-exists, but doesn’t allow making new posts or editing existing ones. Too many posts from a year or two ago.. OfferUp, please send reminders to people to update their accounts or delete inactive posts after 6 months.. 

Lastly, currently photos upload at very low resolution, please allow higher resolution photos to post. Also a direct feedback / contact support feature within the app would be great instead of sifting through the help pages. Looking forward to all the updates. Thanks",3
496,"Worst customer service help ever: I posted my car for sale and they froze or banned my account. I have posted another car of mine in the past with no problems. I didn’t get a notification saying it was banned, I had to write a message to customer service asking if I got banned for some reason. They said that I violated the terms and conditions and there is nothing they can do to unlock my account and I would have to create another account with a different email address. I created a brand new account with a different email address and when I posted my car again, same thing happened. I’m not going to keep creating a new account. They did not tell me what exactly I did to violate the “terms and conditions”. They are no help to getting your account back up and shopping/selling. I have used offerup for years with no problems at all. Whatever they changed and won’t tell me exactly what I did, is wrong and the offerup changed for the worse.",1
497,"Try to Sign in After Over a Year of Inactivity…: I’ve used offer up since the platform existed. Want to say I made my account all the way back in 2010 or somewhere close to that. So over a decade on the platform. I’ve bought and sold several items and had a 5 star rating over all my sales/purchases (except for one person). 

I go to log back into my account on my phone, I haven’t had offer up since I’ve had this device, and when I got to the Facebook login, it tells me my account is no longer accessible due to violating their terms??? I really wish I could get info on this as I haven’t done anything of the sort and wouldn’t jeopardize my account like that since the history alone is what use to make business trustworthy on this sketchy platform. 

No way to contact support or ask anything about the reasoning they just have a sign pop up and it then closes out of the app. Smh guess I’ll be sticking to eBay and fb marketplace then.",1
498,"SOCIOPATHIC CUSTOMER SERVICE! BANNED w/o REASON!: i had used this app for many years and never had any problems— i had HUNDREDS of all 5-star reviews. I always take care of my customers — I was banned randomly and they never would tell me why. They said if i believe it’s a error to reply. I did, many times. The only replies I got (after many non-replies) were vague and repeating what the first email said. Meanwhile they have constant scammers allowed, illegal activities bought, sold and promoted through this app, they screw buyers and sellers constantly. they banned my account without reason right during the COVID pandemic around the holidays. So i suffered huge financial losses from their irresponsible actions and lack thereof. This same thing happened to millions of users and still happens today. I believe competing sellers falsely reported me for my competitive prices, making up whatever reason they wanted to try to make me look bad. Now those same sellers are scamming buyers with an inferior product. OfferUpYour@ss!",1
499,"Ruined the app: Was forced to download this when it combined with letgo. Huge downgrade. Smaller pics than before and the screen is absolutely choked with ads and promoted listings. Curious what a pic of something is? Accidentally tap on a listing? Get ready for an absolute onslaught of ads for that thing as you scroll. There will literally be 3 ads for that thing on your screen at ALL TIMES as you browse. And it constantly logs me out so I have to reset location. Even if I just go to read a text real quick, I come back to “logged out” across the screen. And sometimes the app is frozen and I have to close it out just to make it responsive again. And it constantly has listings from all over the country even when I set it to my location. Big disappointment after enjoying the previous letgo interface. Also, I lost all my messages with vendors and access to items I had my eye on when I was blindsided with this forced integration of apps. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",1
500,No responses!: Offer up is a great place to shop and find items at much cheaper prices than in the stores. One can usually find a decent selection of items as well. One pet peeve I have is that some sellers will not respond to messages sent to them or they’ll take way too long to respond. I see items that originally were listed up to a year or more ago and I’ll inquire about the item only to get no response. If these items are no longer available than they need to be removed from the site or marked sold. If they are still available then the sellers need to respond to buyers questions! Even with items that have been recently listed I run into the same issue! Sellers please respond and in a timely manner!!!,5
501,"OfferUp has let me down and has taken away from me: I was crushed and my spirit was let down when I found out that OfferUp banned my account without any notice. I was a try you member and had spent years building up my reputation and selling to buyers as well as shipping products and making offerup money from the service fee. They kept all my information and banned me with no notice after years of hard work, my entrepreneur spirit has been crushed. I don’t know what to do because I am a retired disabled father and offerup is the only way I made money. If I had violated the conditions in anyway, a warning would have been sufficient, but they didn’t warn me, they have made Year’s hardwork disappear and have benefited from me only to take away from me. I wish I can have my account back ):",5
502,"DONT SEARCH CAR BUYING-: Offer up is a great app! I’ve had it for years & also had let go for years but if your looking for a new or used car-go elsewhere!! Every other vehicle is a scam!!!! Pleaseeee get these off of here offer up! &&& another thing-after there is no activity on an account or a listing-remove it! Jeesh!! I search for things & think I’ve found what I’m looking for only to see it’s posted 4 years ago!! Come on now!! 
Get rid of the scam accounts selling used or new cars & get rid of listings that are more than a year old or something! I doubt those capris I want that are listed -are no longer available since they were listed 2,3,4 years ago!!
Other than that offer up is awesome-just needs some updating!!!!",5
503,"Things you should know:: I usually send a message asking if items are available before purchasing. So far, Ive sent about 15 messages and only 3 sellers have responded. It is frustrating because the prices seem so good and I can’t purchase them! Also, sellers are very minimal with their descriptions and I struggle to have a good conversation about the item with them to be confident in purchasing. I know Offerup has buyer protection, but still, the process of getting your money back for receiving a bad item or not receiving anything is exhausting on any app or platform. ALSO, this app is infested with scammers. Im going to say 4 out of 5 is a scam. DO NOT send your money or your items to anyone, other than on the app or on Paypal with buyer protection, and NOT through the friends & family option since that one has no protection. DO NOT do Cashapp, Zelle, Google pay, etc. because none of those have protection. Be smart!",3
504,"👁 likey: OfferUp has a great , easy to use format. I like it allot. It’s 1 of the best , if not the best personal items selling app. What a great idea for an app and they made it so easy to use. Never been an easier way to sale anything you no longer have use for, no longer want or just want to sale for whatever the reason, it makes it super easy for the person to just take a few pictures of the item, write the details , post it and then to keep track & get notified. 
 Does what it is meant to do & I like it allot. Sometimes I just go in and scroll to see if there’s anything someone else maybe selling for a price that I’ve got to have. Highly recommend it. I gave it ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️ It has to be absolutely perfect for 5💫in my book and I’ve only given that out for a few things .",4
505,"Better Business Bureau: This app is awesome until they delete your entire account. I loved the app for over 2 years and had around 60, 5 star reviews. I used the app nearly every day until one day when I signed in and received a message stating my credentials were reset. I was sure it must of been some sort of computer glitch until I contacted support. I was completely star struck when support told me they had deleted my account for multiple violations but couldn’t tell me what violation I broke. I had nothing but 5 star reviews and I was certain I hadn’t done anything wrong but there was nothing I could do or tell them to get my account back. I know if this happened to me that there must be more of us out there. If this has happened to you please contact the better business bureau and join in to our campaign. We are fighting to get compensated due to “no proof of violations.” This should be a easy win for everyone impacted. Thank you all for the help!",1
506,"Buyer app not a sellers app: If you are hoping to sell anything of value it’s likely not the place.  This app is poised for the buyer to get a great deal and the seller to give away whatever they are for Pennie’s.  If you want to take the time to sell something worth $35 I recommend listing it for $5 but even then you may never generate enough views to get a sale.  The one item I’ve sold in 5 months had 320view and 4 conversations before the sale.  Most my items have only 24 views/ 60 views and are in the correct category.   So however the app is pushing out just isn’t working, and I have close to 30 items listed with nice photos and descriptions and the shipping option activated.   The alternate is for seller to pay for boosts probably the only time you’ll make money so just be aware you’ll need to figure out what value that had for you.  It’s not straightforward selling like Craigslist. Or Facebook marketplace.",2
507,"Horrible Customer Service Reps: First and for most, as a company the business should hire employees who can speak directly and not use copy and paste. I understand that offer up is a place for selling and not service advertisements. However my posts were removed all at once randomly out of nowhere from months ago up until today. Out of the blue! I was able to post items to sell, but when I contacted customer service the rep through twitter was extremely rude typing on all caps for whatever reason. I did contact the email that was provided to me, and instead of warning me the representative dismissed me and disabled my account. My account wasn’t disabled prior to contacting customer service. There are people posting the same exact things I did nor are their posts being deleted nor are they getting banned. Crappy customer service, now I can’t get a response from anyone if I mention “disabled account “ in the email or through twitter offerup.",1
508,"Great app to buy and sell: Offer up is a unique app that’s similar to buying and selling sites such as eBay and Craigslist.

I have sold a few items on there and plan to sell more in the future. Offer up makes it easy to sell as they email you a shipping label and keep you updated on the status of the items you’ve shipped and the payments you receive. You can set your own prices, add description, and pictures. You can also chat with the buyer or seller. You have the option of selling locally by meeting the buyer in person or shipping anywhere in the country (buyer pays shipping) and offer up takes a 9.9% fee for shippable items you sell which I think is a fair commission.

Recently I also tried to buy an item on there where the seller backed out. Offer up was very kind to send me an apology email with a $5 credit towards my next ship panel purchase. Now this is great customer service and how a business should be ran!

I would highly recommend offer up if you are looking to de-clutter your home and make a little cash or want to find some unique gently used items at below market value. You can find almost anything on the app. I will continue to buy and sell with them!",5
509,"Great App with much room for Improvement: For the first time we have an app that incorporates both in-person and online marketplace. If Craigslist / LetGo had a baby with Mercari / Poshmark had a baby, it’d be OfferUp. With any new app it has plenty of work that needs to be done to refine the UI/UX before it’s an exceptional app. Additionally, the acquisition of letgo and forcing existing platform members to move over to OfferUp was relatively smooth; but there were certain design aspects of letgo that were developed in a manner that I believe to be superior to the current layout of OfferUp. Last, the suggested advertisements littered throughout your search results and messages is overkill and quite annoying. At the very least - I would get rid of ad listings in the message center of the app. Or at the very least offer a paid subscription to remove ads from the app.",4
510,"Could be the best seller app: Great app and service, a modern craigslist.  With this its easier than ever before to sell stuff around the house, and i feel safer doing it with the built in protections.

However recently notifications for messages have been flakey, making the selling experience frustrating.  Stuff tends to either sell a few days after posting or not at all, so seeing a message 2 days late is costly.  Additionally, there are some notifications now that i can only explain as ""look at me!  open offer up!"" type, which are not disable-able.

Network is good.  Not craigslist numbers, but could be.  I like how easy it is to ship, making OfferUp occupy a juicy spot between CL and eBay.  However some stuff like mobile phone parts are not very sellable/buyable.  This is because you cannot filter based on condition and other things important to the refurbishing economy, and because the moneyback guarantee only lasts two days instead of thirty.  I dont really mind this, but it does bother me that attributes like ""used"" are not filterable, and it would be nice if i could do all my used goods buying & selling from one app/service.

All in all i will be continuing to use and enjoy OfferUp.  Heres to hoping that a lack of competition doesnt lead to a decline.",4
511,I want to like this app: It’s hard getting people to respond back or accept or deny an offer. I wish you could sort people have ratings with one who don’t to see items for sale. I do a lot of shopping and selling on Mercari and don’t have as many issues with people responding. I’m not sure if their notifications are just not that great or what. I know a lot of times messages I receive from buyer in my email end up in the junk mail. So unless you have notifications on in the app some may not be getting my messages if it does the same for buyers. Also sometimes people don’t have the right shipping amount I don’t know if that’s their fault or the app. There will also be sellers who have there stuff show up under shipping and they are not willing to ship. Had this happen twice to me when making a purchase.,4
512,"Worst for sales/tons of scammers: This app use to be nice when it first opened up and had genuine people. Now it’s just a place that crawls with scammers, people trying to haggle for prices, and items aren’t authentic or are copied from sites where items DONT EVEN EXIST WITH THE SELLER! I had two people try to meet for items I had but came and tried to haggle the offer with the bare minimum and I had to turn them away. Also they just don’t care if the people who are sellers are REAL PEOPLE! Majority of the buyers I see aren’t real people or they say that their interested in an item and never get back to you. Or if they are they try to scam you by saying that their going to pay through a 3rd party method. If Offer Up could do a payment method where it’s through the app and you used a wireless transaction then I feel like people might be more at ease. Unfortunately the app has just went to the dumps honestly. I don’t think I would recommend selling anything due to scammers and no real insurance system for who the seller/buyers are.",1
513,"Do not ship your items on here!: OfferUp does not care about what happens to your things. They will always side with the buyer. I shipped something, buyer reported it damaged. They did not ask me a single question even though I had delivered a monitor with no damage. They do what they called an ""investigation"" which is them taking pictures from the buyer and seeing the item is broken. They then gave the buyer back his money and sent me a broken monitor which I could no longer sell. There was no true investigation and OfferUp sided with the buyer immediately. To avoid wasting your time and money do not ship your things on here! You don't get your money until the buyer has had 3 days to basically say ""yeah I like it"". Their customer service is almost non existent and completely useless. Emails only! Really, from an app this big?Don't trust this app! They hold the money and if the buyer doesn't like it for whatever reason it's getting returned to them! and it will most likely be broken or damaged but OfferUp does not care!",1
514,"Issues!: When people open a case for something wrong with the product they received it in the mail. You give them to long to show the proof or prove otherwise that there is something wrong with the product. Also they get three days to try out the product received in the mail. Someone could receive a pair of shoes in the mail from me & basically where them for 2 days and return them. THAT IS INSANE TO ME & ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! It’s takes me a couple hours maybe to evaluate a product received in the mail so at most they should be allowed 24 hours to make a decision and 72 hours if they file a case for review. THATS MY OPINION & IM SURE IF YOU TOOK A SURVEY EVERYONE ELSE IN YOUR APP WOULD AGREE. When you give them so much time to review products and state there cases they acquire similar products & send you back the same product but it’s broke or damaged. YOU NEED TO SHORTEN THE SPAN ON REVIEWS & CASES TO ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM PLAIN & SIMPLE!) 

Thank you,",3
515,"My favorite new way to sell: As a long term eBay and Craigslist user, I just discovered this app a couple weeks ago and it is now my preferred way to sell my stuff. Simple to use - takes less than a minute to list and the app seems to be widely used. I'm getting good response in CA where I live and I’ve used it to sell things long distance when I was helping my parents clean stuff out of their house before moving. The only annoyance, and it's not a problem with the app, is with people making offers and then not replying to pick them up. I think they are either impulsive and then have a change of heart or addicted to this app. In any case, I love this app for finding new homes for my unused items. It’s also cheaper to ship on OfferUp then Ebay which is better for buyers.",5
516,"Not for sellers: This app is not for sellers. People send messages asking for a lower price and when you respond they disappear. They don’t even read the message. Then I had a guy jerk me around for three hours after we had arranged a price and meeting location. He tried to change the location to closer to him. (I don’t do delivery) Then when he arrived he tried to haggle me down saying he thought the product I was selling was bigger. I posted the make, model, features, and took pictures of every aspect of the item. Another buyer shows up and says we agreed on a lower price than what we agreed on originally. Then tries to negotiate even further when I told him no because I had already knocked $200 off the listed price. To top it off, he left me four stars because he didn’t get his way even though I was polite but firm. The buyers on here are jerkoffs and time wasters. Offer up does nothing to keep them off the site either. This whole app has been a headache and a  waste of time. Deleting today.",1
517,"AD infested: This app was great for the longest time. Great customer service. Annoying but bearable ads. Recently they have started forcing unskippable full page ads randomly, akin to cancerous mobile games. Are you guys struggling that bad you needed to pull this on us? They get 2 stars because selling and buying is still good. But they are more than happy to waste your time with the full page ads while you browse. Here’s a hint: it’s quicker to close and relaunch the app than it is to just sit through the unskippable full page ads. Just dumb decisions by the product team on OfferUp’s part.

Update 3 about 10 year after signup. This app is too far gone. Can’t silent notifications. Ads that aren’t clearly marked as ads. Ads between simply looking at posts. Bad search filters forcing ads/shipped items when you request local only. They have fully driven it into the ground and are squeezing every possible penny out of user data and eyeballs. Absolute shame.",1
518,"Buggy app, mostly scammers or ugly stuff: It’s not a surprise how little good (good meaning stylish, honest vintage or antique) furniture still makes it’s way here given the success of Facebook marketplace. It is however a surprise how buggy this app is and how common scam messages are. This app fails its users in it has known bugs where you can’t look at your messages, making this app essentially useless because you can’t sell items without accessing your messages. And despite asks for support, all of their fixes fail and they don’t seem to know how to fix this known bug. If you are lucky enough to get the app to work through the bugs, most of your messages come from scammers/bots. My main plus in that is the app does advise you when they suspect a message is a scam! 

TLDR: Ultimately, this is a great app to dump your generic gray Marshall’s live laugh love furniture. It’s a terrible place to find anything you would actually want and it’s nearly inaccessible to sell your items.",1
519,"Very bad UX decisions: I wasn’t thinking to waste my time adding any review but as a UX designer seeing ridiculous decisions with every update made me do it. This time you removed the background on promoted items so it’s very hard to glance which items are promoted unless you scroll really slow. I don’t see a reason for that even from the financial perspective that should be a benefit for you to make it prominent, right? Also you added a floating “add new item” button sticky right above the same add button - what is the point of having two same actions side by side? If the business need is to increase adding igems then you place it somewhere else not where ypu already have it.  Along with previous reviews like having “suggested items” notification in the same bucket as messages - it’s not only misleading but also very frustrating at the time the user is waiting for messages. And don’t you think that people who sell are not necessarily people who buy?",1
520,"Excellent results: I have listed many items for sale on Offer Up and I always get multiple inquiries regarding the items I list. Not only do I receive multiple offering, but they seem to generate inquiries quicker than listing on another sight named after a guy called Craig. The inquiries are about 6:1 compared to other sites I’ve used. I usually end up selling the item off of this site vs the others. Easy to use, easy to communicate with potential buyers and easy to present your item in a very nice way. I’ve also bought items from this app and it has been smooth transactions with folks that are serious about selling. Thanks for providing a great platform to buy and sell items. This is now my go to.",5
521,"I don’t normally review but…: TL;DR: The sorting and filtering system is completely useless. Sellers do not respond. Most listings are YEARS old. 

This app has SO many problems. It is HORRIBLE for buyers. You can’t see the price of an item just scrolling, you have to click on each individual listing to see the price. The filters DON’T work. Filtering for condition ESPECIALLY is broken. If you search for any condition other than broken or for parts only you will still see SO many listings where the seller listed as normal wear but in the description say it’s for parts/broken. Sorting is USELESS. When you try and sort via most recent, the top options are all YEARS OLD. Seriously, the very first listing when I sorted via most recent was 4 YEARS OLD! So many listings are years and years old but not marked sold, still with the option to buy now. If you try to sort via price low to high, the listings are NOT in order. At all. 

Not only that, but so many sellers DO NOT RESPOND. Even recent listings don’t respond when you ask if their item is still available. It’s impossible to tell if a listing is real and still available. 

Also, the amount of COMPLETELY unrelated listings that show up in your search is ridiculous. I’ve been searching for a cheap 3ds or 2ds and I’ve seen listings for shoe keychains, wall art, sweaters, and so much more that has absolutely NOTHING to do with nintendo or ds systems.",1
522,"Not a fan of OfferUp anymore after this: I was a fan of OfferUp, I’ve used it for a few years now and the one time I post a picture of a bathing suit I was trying to sell I get banned. Why? Who knows because OfferUp didn’t even tell me why. It just signed me out and every time I try to sign back in it says account disabled due to not following community guidelines..and im only assuming it’s because of the bathing suit I posted because after I posted it my account was disabled. 
I guess a karen thought my bathing suit was to provocative. It wasn’t even a picture of me! It was the model wearing from the site I bought it from and she showed a little cleavage!?! Really? Come on Karen’s stop being so selfish and let us sell what we want!!! I’ll be sure to make more accounts and start reporting people for random things so they can see what I’m dealing with.

I wouldn’t be so mad if OfferUp would reach out and tell me what I did wrong or even tell me how long my account will be disabled.",1
523,"Love it!: I love OfferUp and I scored some great deals on here! I bought a pair of sneakers here for a great price but unfortunately they got lost in the mail. Luckily OfferUp assisted me and gave me my money back! Definitely a trustworthy app! I love it! The only complaint I have is about a lot of the people on here. OfferUp can’t control the mentality of people, but I noticed that most of them are rude and if you have a question about something they leave you on read and don’t respond or they say something rude back to you. It’s hard to make a purchase sometimes because of this :/ overall I love this app and I’m so glad I downloaded it! Definitely trustworthy and overall a great app to find things at a great price! I love how they have a shipping option as well as you can pick it up nearby! 5 star app!",5
524,"Better off using other apps-don’t verify: Not only do they charge a ridiculous amount but the customer service staff is just rude.  If you do setup an account make sure you don’t verify.

2) sold a used computer storage drive and now they letting buyer return it because his own personal testing showed that the copy/write speeds were slow.  They responded saying the drive “wasn’t as described” which is absolutely b/s.
Not only did I lose out on other buyers of this working product but now if this buyer has installed malware/virus on that, they better be willing to replace my computer.  The way that they handled this is the reason why I rated them 1star.  Otherwise, it’s good for local transactions in person.  But better alternatives",1
525,"GOT SCAMMED OF $500. Never use this app!!: Unfortunately I have had a terrible terrible experience with this app. After thinking I was buying an item from a user that was marked as having great ratings, AND a TruYou member (a verification service where all members give all legal info like SSN and license) I was scammed of $500. After I sent the user $500 over Google Pay - the user was supposed to send me a video of the item being carried to the post office and a tracking number the user completely stopped answering my messages after reading them AND has continued to try and “sell” the item again after changing his name and location on the account 5 times now. This user has reposted items and it is clear once he scams someone he changes his Name and location all under the same original account. I have reported the user various times and OfferUp has done nothing about it. They clearly are not concerned with users getting scammed as this guy has probably had 5-10 victims since my experience 3 days ago.",1
526,"Love OfferUp but it is buggy: I use OfferUp extensively, I have over 300 sales and many purchases. I love the overall service but wish some of the bugs would go away. 

Bugs:
1. No matter what I set for sound notification settings I ALWAYS get sound. Right now my iPhone has sound notifications disabled for the Offerup app.  Offerup also has ALL push and email notifications disabled in its app settings. But I still get notifications when someone messages me (that really annoying cash register sound). 
2. Loading your items for sale isn’t graceful. It doesn’t load right, crashes, and you end up at the top again. With so many items for sale, it would be great if you could load the items more reliably. 

Requests: 
1. Display filters for items you have for sale. 
2. Ability to bulk discount/reduce the price for all/many items at once. 
3. Ability to reset the “posted” date without having to delete first post and repost. For heavy users this is key. 
4. Star/flag message threads. For example, I could star the guy buying my bike so I remember which one I committed to. 
5. Filter in messages for flagged threads. 
6. Ability for sellers to require TrueYou badge for purchases. This would help with scammers... I’ve never had an issue with someone who has verified before, only the ones who haven’t.",3

528,"Decent: I’ve been using this app for months now (about 5). It’s better than letgo, but not all that great. I’ve had some good experiences and have bought some pretty nice items on this app, but stillit needs a good deal of work. 

A major annoyance is the organization. They need to add more categories and search filters. It can be extremely hard to find the right item when so many people put minimal effort into their titles and descriptions. It causes me to have to look through a lot of irrelevant items before finding the ones I’m interested in.

Another problem is when sellers never respond because their item is likely no longer up for sale or they may not even be using the app anymore. I was once able to buy a really nice hat that had been up for 3 years, but there are people who don’t respond when an item has been up for just a few months. 

Regular updates by item adjustment or responding to messages every 2 weeks should be made to allow people to keep up their items unless they’re on vacation. It’s very frustrating to message a seller and never get a response at all.

Regardless, I’m still using the app, but I’d give it more stars if they could actually make these updates. I would recommend this app for people with time and patience, but otherwise it’s not worth it.",3
529,"Solid app, the ads are obnoxious.: As far as a classifieds exchange like Craigslist, the app is great. Interface is easy to learn, communication with another buyer/seller is easy, posting takes no time at all. In regards to overall ease of use and function the app is great.

Who ever is in charge of the ad placement should be sent packing. The ads forced into the search field are obnoxious at best. Eye-roll inducing when it’s stupid obvious the last search item you clicked is now every 4th thumbnail in the search results. The items displayed aren’t even good examples of what I clicked on. Your algorithm is garbage and annoying. Unless I’m checking for something specific, I no longer use the app to just browse and see what’s out there. The ads ruined that in short order. Hope the money you make from the accidental click-throughs is worth it.",4
530,"App is GREAT, people are NOT: I wish I could just give 5 stars for the app itself as it is really easy to use and couldn’t be better.  The problem that I have found is the buyers and sellers.  If you like lowballing, being unprofessional, flaking out on people or, just plain being rude, this is the selling and buying place for you.  I have tried to sell a few different things and have had the same experience with everyone.  Note I said tried as I have had 100% of the people who commit on the app flake on me and disappear.  The others offer such a lowball price and then have been rude when I decline the offer.  Anyways, I have pulled my articles for sale and will go back to Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.  I hope that someday the makers of this app clean the users up a little.  I have found it almost impossible to rate the users, although it seems users have a way of being rated.",3

As soon as you reach out to a seller to buy something you start receiving messages to your phone. Do not give out your phone number here. The app used to be good until it was bought by the other app, management here became careless for support and user friendliness. The app encourage buyers to buy local from other people but when you try buying a car here there are only car dealers when the down payment only, when you finally ask for the price, the prices ends up being 300% + what the price is on the listings. I bought a flat screen once, that one probably the only good buy here and even then you could have wen to Facebook for that.

 Again. The app has an unsafe user friendly structure and it is not moderated. Message scams with false links are abundant here. Do not provide your personal info whatsoever. Yw",1
532,"Scammers paradise: This app does nothing to remove fraudulent sellers or scammers. You can clearly see there are knock offs and fraudulent activity happening and when you report it they do nothing to follow up or remove the members who are clearly fake accounts with painfully obvious fake names and no photos etc. 
They need to make the app so that unless you are verified and using your government beamed, you cannot sign up. 
I removing the app for good after being stood up once and being scammed with a knock off product that was convincing and even packaged only to find the product itself was not high quality!

You should always use common sense when buying online, always pay on PayPal goods and services, record your transactions, meet in a public well lit place with preferably cameras to show the people in the transaction and their vehicles with license plate, but this app makes it way too easy for people to just straight up lie and something needs to be done about it.",1
533,"Used to have a favorable opinion of OfferUp but NO MORE!!!: What jerks. Read some of the reviews below. Specifically the bad ones. People consistently complain, again and again, about the lack of any customer service or the ability to speak to an actual human being and OfferUp’s employees, managers or whoever can’t do any better than to post the same 3-sentence-long drivel for every single bad review. Hey OfferUp—all you’re doing there is very clearly demonstrating how little you care about your customers. You all obviously know ZERO about business. I guarantee you 100% that the amount of money you’re losing as a result of refusing to offer any real customer service is a significant amount more than it would cost you to provide meaningful customer support. I’m sure you don’t offer real customer support because you figure you’re facing bunches of money by not having to employ those people but you are absolutely losing stacks of potential profits as a result. Cheapskate amateurs…",1
534,"havent got paid for selling a shipped item: so i just started selling on this app for the first time and i shipped an item for the first time too around january 8th . i sold two items and in total i was supposed to get 21 dollars. its been almost been two weeks and i still haven't received any payments in my bank account. i emailed or gave feedback from my experience and i got an email saying my bank comfirmed i received funds for the payment on january 10 and should have took 3 to 5 business days to appear in my account, it's january 18 and i have received no payments at all and i have fast pay activated on the app. i have more items for sell that are more expensive but i dont wanna ship anything else until i know im getting paid. for now im giving two stars because i dont know much about the app and maybe im inpatient but if i dont get paid by the end of this week than im putting one star and probably wont sell when it comes to shipping 

so i change my review to one star because they still haven't done nothing about me not getting paid for an item i shipped out. this is very disappointing and irritating because i basically gave my items away for free. i shouldnt even have to wait any business days for something i sold ! i should be getting paid as soon as the item ships out its not yall money to be holding on to especially if i have fast pay active",1
535,"Shipping is HORRENDOUS BUT OFFER UP IN A GREAT MONEY MAKING TOOL !: Shipping on offer up is horrible I had to ship the product first, which is expected.... but then I have to wait until the person receives the package to get paid. Which I can deal with, but this is the insane part the sender then has to wait TWO DAYS for the receiver to approve the package for payment! Then once the payment is approve offer up then sends a message saying it may take 4-5 business days to be deposited into my account. WTH. Then once it’s deposited into my account I still have to wait an additional 1-3 business days. This description on how long it takes to receive payment shows how ridiculously long the process is !!!! I’m glad I wasn’t starving or needed the money for my baby or to get to work. NEVER AGAIN",5
536,"Absolutely Awful Merger: Ever since OfferUp and LetGo merged the integration between the two has been terrible if not absent altogether. They got rid of every facet of LetGo, your listings, ratings, everything. So if you were previously on letgo, you have a significant disadvantage over users who were on OfferUp. Now I have to pay to get views on things I’m selling?? Never had to do that with LetGo, it defeats the purpose of selling easily like it always was. There wasn’t even an option to co-opt to one of the interfaces or to have previous listings transferred. Not to mention it happened seemingly without warning. No messages on either app until I opened it one day and it was merged. OfferUp is a terrible app with listings from 2+ years ago and terrible visibility for posts that you shouldn’t need to pay extra for in order for people to be able to see what you’re selling efficiently. Not using this app again, as well as not ever recommending to anyone. Horribly done merger that my five year old cousin would have managed better.",1
537,"Would be amazing if not for scams & constant bugs: I’ve been using offer up for a little over a year now and overall it’s been an okay experience. Have been buying & selling PC’s and Pc parts. If it weren’t for the people constantly trying to scam you & constant bugs with messaging , it would be perfect. 

Scams can be easy to spot but it can also be just as easy to be fooled , especially when it’s people who have positive reviews who try to get you to pay them outside of the app (for shipping). I constantly have problems while trying to message people. It’s like I’ve been shadowbanned , and it isn’t until I contact offer up that I’m able to send & receive messages again. I’ve had this issue so many times when I haven’t violated any of the community guidelines. 

If you fix the messaging system and crack down on scammers , this will be worthy of having 5 stars.",3
538,"Disreputable Sellers!!!: Extremely disappointed with the OfferUp app. I have done Craigslist for years and yes l had a few bad experiences but nothing compared to OfferUp. As a buyer l found that it is rare for a seller to honor the accept offer. Even when a pickup time is agreed upon (say an hour or two for pickup) it is sold to someone else. The seller usually does not attempt any contact or answer inquiries... just left hanging.  For most sellers it is whomever shows up at their door first. Buyers problem if someone beats you to their door. As a buyer, l value my travel time, gas and time to find deals on OfferUp and communicate with seller. I find it is a high waste of time as sellers are not good at removing items no longer available. .... l have not as yet been able to sell an item on OfferUp. Same items sell on Craigslist.",4
539,"Buyer protection does not work!: BUYER BEWARE. Buyer protection does not work. I paid for a product bundle to be shipped to me and received a nonworking item. The day I received it I sent in a refund request. They gave the seller 2 days to respond. The seller ignored it and it timed out. It then told me to send a request into OfferUp and I did immediately. I never heard back from OfferUp. They released the funds to the seller anyways and I have not heard from him either. I lost out on $300 dollars!! DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE. I have sent several requests to OfferUp and heard nothing back. I requested help through the app and also via email. That was over a month ago. I cannot get help or an answer and have lost my money. I hope this keeps someone else from losing out on a lot of money too. Buyer protection is a sham and does not protect the buyer at all, it leaves it up to the seller to give you back your money and if they ignore the request you lose the money. So sad as I usually love this app but the shipping and buyer protection does not protect you.",1
540,"OfferUp Overload: I absolutely love OfferUp!  As everyone knows by know, it's like Craigslist but on a more personalized and intimate scale.  I've found a lot of sellers on OfferUp to be more honest as well.  As Craigslist is more on a general scheme, OfferUp tailors to your specific searches, as-well-as remembering your searches and also reminding you and/ or catering to your searches.  The algorithm they use also puts together what you've searched for and automatically sends them to you in reminders and lists of suggestions.  The one thing I mainly love is that you get to message the seller directly and you get a faster response time rather than having to email them like what Craigslist does.  OfferUp is awesome and honestly, a majority of my electric tools and tactical supplies have been found on OfferUp.  Way to go guys!",5
541,"1 stars because: This app is horrible, way to many scammer or bots on here with bunch of accounts either selling items but can’t ship thru app and want you to “text them” or some other excuse not to ship thru app or people wanting to buy your item but can’t “pay thru app” yall need to update this app big time. 

This app can be amazing if yall monitor or either make it so not just anyone and everyone can sign up and a max of accounts that can be create . Also if you ban and account don’t allow them to be able to make more.. cause it just makes the app horrible. 

I find it ridiculous how I had people with 5 star rating from over 10+ ppl even telling me they can’t ship on the site and if I can send them the money else where and “They promise to ship my item” (scam). This app should make everyone verify some kind of information. So many scammer/bots couple years from now real buyers and sellers will no longer be on here cause it’s not reliable.",1
542,"Not what it used to be: The app now does not show results that are relevant. More than half of the results are ads. When trying to search for something like a car, most of the postings are from side dealerships instead of private sellers. It takes too long to sort through the ads and paid content to find a private seller. 

Also, they are blocking accounts that were useful from private sellers - which is super annoying because some of these sellers had really good prices. It’s like Offer up doesn’t want us to save money and wants us to only use the people that paid for ad space. It’s a completely different environment than before when you could just sell or barter with a neighbor that just had something extra lying around. 

I don’t have the time to browse through countless pages of irrelevant stuff and ads to look for one item. I’ve already deleted that app and will look to alternatives or go back to yard sales.",1
543,"Poor customer service: Hi, I had an offerup account that was banned yesterday for no reason. I bought an Xbox yesterday with no issues and planned to buy a ps4 later. I managed to find someone with a ps4 and offered them the money they were asking for. They accepted the offer and then proceeded to tell me they had no way to accept the offer and that they had to issue a refund. The refund wasn’t working and I was trying to find ways to help them refund it. Eventually it worked but on top of that my account got banned and I have no idea why. I don’t know what will Happen to the Xbox and if it’ll ship or not. I also do now know what will happen with my money involving the Xbox. Nobody has helped me so far and I’m getting very frustrated. If I get the Xbox I wouldn’t be as mad but I still wouldn’t be able to use offerup because for some reason I can’t make a new account anyways. Please get back to me.",2
544,No costumer service: I was a big fan of offer up because of its ability to be a great and useful app. The catch is they don’t care about you as a buyer or seller whatsoever. They will not support you and there shipping rules are incredibly flawed after sending an item and attempting to reach customer support for days they finally responded. With whatsoever no help they told me if my item was shipped within there 5 days as it was they would have it covered. It was shipped at four day and I constantly reached out to customer support for help where my item is and how I will get paid eventually they just ignored me and wouldn’t respond and still won’t I am out 100 dollars because there shipping rules didn’t stand up and I was never paid by the buyer. I told them this repeatedly and they could care less they just repeated to me it had to be shipped within 5 days as it was. I asked for a phone call and they wouldn’t respond. I’m very disappointed I will not use it ever again or advise anyone else too.,1
545,"Horrible app: My account got disabled not once but twice. The first time I was given no reason or warning. I was locked out of my account and I had posted 15+ items....Then my account was reinstated and all of my items/messages were deleted. My account got disabled again after probably an hour of use. No warning nothing just disabled. I’m moving out of state and posted a lot of items so maybe that’s why it got disabled but nonetheless why not just put a cap on the number of items being listed per account instead of just disabling? My second account got disabled because I was sending messages that didn’t abide by their guidelines. I didn’t know that responding with my address, phone , number or simply stating “okay” was against their guidelines. So they not understand how time consuming it is to post that many items and then have your account be deleted/disabled.....and not to mention the loss no a potential sale for both the seller and buyer.....very disappointed.",1

Figured it was due to the pandemic and people stopped searching for non essential items to buy. But then I decided to make some purchases and noticed my messages were not being read and keep having shipping payment errors. Finally decided to contact their support (which is crap) no direct number. The next day I received an email saying I have been banned and I was not allowed to reopen a new account?! No specific reason on what happened and why. No warnings were given. Absolutely horrible. Only reason I didn’t give it a 1 star was although I did

Someone somehow posted a million ads selling a vehicle which clearly I didn’t have to sell. I had to shut down my acct all together to get it to stop. Lost all of my listings which takes a lot of time and effort to post. In the last month I’ve been unable to post new items to sell. I get all the way to the end of the listing process (add photo, title, description, price, location) where I click on “post”... I get an endless refreshing symbol. I click done to try to force thru and even though the item shows up in My Listings, it doesn’t actually go live. So now I have a bunch of listings with zero views for weeks. Total waste of time. Lastly and maybe the worst of the app is that god forbid you click on anything, let’s say a listing for a golf bag, now your feed is loaded with ads (from 3rd party retailers and not other users) for golf bags.",1
548,"Offer up is only “fair”: The site encourages you to use the app. But the app is a pain. Built by someone who knows how it works with little input from anyone unfamiliar with it.
Glitches - there are “cancel” and other clicks but you CANNOT see them or identify them because they are BLUE and disappear into the app green
Pictures are so small in the browse window that there is NO WAY you can tell what the item is unless it is a car or a bicycle or a smart phone. Even then it is sometimes hard.
Offer up crams “promoted” items into the browse screen based on what it thinks you want to see. Bug that stuff is mostly SPAM and Offer up has become a commercial ad space. 
I list items on both Offer Up and Craigslist and have NOT sold anything to an Offer Up user. EVERYTHING I sell is because of CL. But I get TONS of low ball offers from Offer Up users DESPITE having FIRM PRICE notice. Waste of time.",3
549,"App is great!! But....: This app I great and easy to use and is probably the only buy,sell, and trade app that got it right but the only little things I and maybe many others don’t like is the items that have been SOLD are still in the buying list .... I think that if marked as sold it automatically goes into its own SOLD category so if anyone wants to look and see what’s been sold they can choose the category instead of going through the entire list.... everyone has said it at least once “if it’s sold why is it still on the list, no one wants to see sold items” unless someone is looking for something that has been stolen , which is why making its own category will make it easier and faster to those looking for lost or stolen items",5

I GET correspondence from staff but I see nothing ever done or put in sites of these people who write offers and after acceptance do not follow thru.  Your star system and information you show for me and other users to see before we accept never shows these reports so we are not able to evaluate these people before we get involved and then have to spend a week or more in follow up 
If you had system and education these users would clean up their act or risk some data being published to show the actual behavior so users like me would be aware.   Why do we report the facts if no follow thru?",5

In my description I do write other words or names of items that I’m willing to trade for (I own a pawn shop so trade is always open) but it is stated in my description that I’m willing to trade for those items. I see scammers or drug dealers or people that truly violate and intoxicate the offer up community that still have their accounts but mine gets removed unfairly and without an explanation.

By that time I got very nervous and changed my security measures. sure that it was a scam.  I would have love to make a sale, but they seemed to not even be able to spell but were really good on codes, Think I will stay on easier mode of sales.

553,"Had an Item worth nearly $400 stolen: I reported the buyer for being a scammer. And after a week of waiting never received a reply from OfferUp (only an automated reply that did not help much).
I sent my item worth around $400 and when the buyer received it he immediately sent a refund which I idiotically accepted followed by a huge essay on how I put him and his family at risk of a house fire and how I should be ashamed of how I packaged my item. And that the Li-Ion battery was “swollen” even though he could have easily popped the back slightly off to make it look like it was swollen and damaged (he modifies and fixes game consoles by what I can tell) and likely because he values his “life” he never bothered to find a way to check if the battery truly was swollen.
He then never sent the item back and decided to dispose of it along with the games that went with it without my knowledge and permission.
He then proceeded to send another essay saying how he got his money back and “disposed” of my $400 worth Nintendo along with the games I sent it with. But I highly doubt he truly got rid of it and instead did what can only be described as a well put together $400 scam. 
I sure hope you enjoy my stolen Nintendo 3DS Galaxy XL Joshua along with the other games you rat.

554,"By far the worst selling and buying app amongst all others: Edit: As you can see, the response is a generic response directing to the general support email which in my review says doesn’t answer or doesn’t reply with anything useful. Tells you how much they care. 

Can’t post anything. Yet also see only ads. Support is unhelpful. Offer Up used to be good. I used it until 2022 with no issues. Since 2023 it has been awful. As a regular person trying to sell by no longer needed items, I can’t post anything because everything immediately gets removed without specific corrections for me to remedy and repost. Supposedly it’s to help with the buying experience. But as a buyer all I see are ads. Bad experience as a seller and buyer. Support either doesn’t reply or gives you generic unhelpful messages that don’t tell you how to fix, while also threatening to ban your account.

555,"Behind the scenes: LetGo was so much better then OfferUp.
I report business advertisements / spam. I get a reply back from OfferUp we allow businesses to sell their product on our platform. I understand that. But the employees at OfferUp don’t know the difference between business advertisements and spam from a item for sale by a business.
The free section is flooded with spam and advertisements and either nothing is done about it or it takes forever for them to remove it.
They still haven’t fixed the unfollow a seller problem. I have followed some sellers from years ago and there is no way to unfollow them. There is no unfollow button to click on.
OfferUp is not used that often from sellers in my area. I see more recent sale posts on Marketplace then I do on OfferUp. I cross post all my items between Marketplace and OfferUp. Honestly ive sold one thing years ago on OfferUp and haven’t sold anything on OfferUp since. I sell more items on Marketplace.",1

My account got deleted unexpectedly, I reached out for support with no help. I am completely unable to use the app and spent hours of my time wasted both from posting products and from making offers to other products that I wanted. I guess I’ll stick to craigslist!

557,"Useless for blind users!: One of the beauties of the iPhone is that developers are able to make their applications very useful for blind users. There is an application called voiceover which will speak everything on the screen. Unfortunately, the offer up app does not take advantage of all of these features. So, in the app, many features don’t speak. The tabs at the bottom of the screen for example. The only reason I know about them is because my cited wife says well just tap at the bottom. It’s not talking to me. Neither do the saved lists maybe the worst part is that the price seems to be a graphic on the page of an item. I can’t figure out how much something costs on OfferUp! These things would be easy to fix if the developers took advantage of apples built in speech system. As it is now, a blind person cannot use offer up on their own without sided help. That’s a sad thing since the iPhone is really a revolution for blind people. But not when it comes to offer up. Very sad!",1

But that is not what this is about I'm writing this review because I would like for offer up to add a subcategory when posting iPhones it would make it a lot easier when somebody is posting an iPhone needs to list the carrier and gigs of the phone and what model ! This would be a tremendous help for millions of people including myself cutting down the time of searching and weeding out what you don't want to see also making it easier for the buyer and seller , also if offer up could incorporate the category from owner or business to help sort this out because there are a lot of people and businesses that are trying to get money ! Would significantly help with the user interface and interaction on offer up",4
559,"App ok. People bad: While the app does what it's suppose to, the majority of people that use it, it could be a regional issue, the people that use it are horrible.

Then if you're buying something most of the people are rude and unwilling to negotiate at all. Also another thing that may be regional as there are a vast array of shady people in this area, be very careful. I've had 2 incidents. All while meeting in a public place. One person tried to steal an item I was selling. In another case a person talked normal then suddenly threatened my life. And of course if you report the person, the people that run the app do absolutely nothing at all. In spite of having police reports in both instances. So for anyone who uses this app, be careful and if you have to contact the customer service people don't expect much of anything.",1
560,"Love Offer Up! But...: I love the Offer Up app. Almost all of the quality material possessions I own, I purchased through this network. Creating access to a ready martlet for anyone in a geographical proximity is so simple it’s genius. However, I absolutely hate the visual changes to the app. In my observation, my user time in the app has almost dropped entirely to non use, despite its genius, despite my appreciations for it. I don’t want to use the app simply because I don’t like looking at it. As petty and minuscule as that is, I would use the app again if I could stand to simply even look at my screen. It looks the beta version of offer up. I looks like the college Craigslist. Seahawks fans?? Otherwise, the function and usability of the app is perfect in every other to me.",5
561,"weed out the businesses: I want to see Peer-To-Peer offers, that's the whole reason I use this app. Unfortunately a bunch of business have decide to ruin the whole purpose of this app by posting their ads here. I really wish the developers would do something about this. Just look for cars and you'll see sales lots posting vehicles with the ""down payment"" as the list price. This is super annoying. Give me the option to ignore ads from certain users. Give an option to view without business ads. Please!

And no, I'm not going to email you. Take the initiative to improve your product based on reviews. I already let you harvest my personal data and track me across apps and sites owned by other companies, which is absolutely disgusting. I can't wait to get rid of this app the moment I no longer need it!",3
562,"😡: Update**
 I contacted customer service and was told it was a technical issue that locked my account and that it had been fixed. I was able to log back into my account. 

I downloaded the app a couple months ago just to browse and see if offerup was something I wanted to use. I ended up creating an account about a week ago. I messaged one seller about a chair and didn’t hear back. I then realized that the ad was a year old and let it go. Yesterday I got an email saying I violated terms of service and my account was deleted. I’ve done nothing on there and my account was deleted without any explanation!!!!!! There was a link in the email to contact them if I thought it was an error and it sent me to a page that was no longer working. Not happy.....",4
563,"Most users waste your time, if you report them OfferUp blocks YOUR account.: Most of the “users” are bogus or people who are just rude and waste your time. They have the ability to report in the app, which you would think would drop these users positive profile scores so the next person doesn’t waste time…instead my account got “locked” and they didn’t even tell me. I posted an item and it had no views for two weeks and had to write numerous messages until they acknowledge it and “fixed it.” At that point my items had been up a while so I asked if they’d promote them so they’d show back up at the top with most recent listings and nothing— no response. They have pretend checks and balances in place that would be useful if they could actually be used to elevate profiles and ding the profiles of people who have you drive miles to meet them and never show.",2
564,"Ridiculous: I had been using this app for a while. I got scammers DM’ing me a lot, almost always the second I posted an item. That bothered me but not enough to stop using it. A few days ago, they deactivated my account without any notice whatsoever. I reached out to them to try to find out what the problem was. Instead of being helpful and looking into the issue for their users, they just responded very vaguely. After a few back and forth emails, I was told that I was taken down because I posted something that violated their guidelines, basically accusing me of selling a fake purse. I told them that I do not purchase anything that is not authentic and they probably thought that because that item is from ~10 years ago. They responded saying the decision cannot be reversed, assuming that I was making a request. No apologies for accusing their users of selling fake stuff. Why on Earth would I continue using this app? 

See you on your competitor’s app :)",1
565,"Hard to reach customer service and technical difficulties: The one previous time I used OfferUp in 2020 I had no problems (actually sold my furniture for a good price in cash) but oh boy, this time was a disaster. My second time around I listed clothes and even secured a buyer for a pricey item, only to find that myself randomly locked out of my account 2 hours before our suggested meeting time, without any ability to contact the buyer and finalize a meeting place. A lucrative transaction that slipped through my fingers due to technical difficulties! I tried reaching out to OfferUp but the only Avenue is contact to submit a request form with assurances that they’ll get back in 2-3 business days... what happened to the good old days when companies provided phone numbers so you could get real-time help when you needed it! This whole situation was not ideal when you’re trying to finalize a deal.",2
566,"always buy used: in my effort to save money AND be more environmentally friendly, i’m working to furnish my apartment without buying a single new thing— so this app comes in handy! it definitely has some design flaws. the “quick save” isn’t really a quick save; it’s just a list like any other. it should work like instagram’s bookmarking, where if you want to save something to a specific list, you hold your thumb down for an extra second. if you merely tap it, it will go into your general list of saves. this app also shuts down a lot (letgo does this too for some reason) and makes my phone pretty warm. not sure why. listings should also have expiration dates in case the seller never updates the listing. overall though i’d aag it’s a good app.",5
567,No security or technical support: I had someone hack my account and purchase items using my credit card on file. Took me 30 min to find a link to send a message to offer up. They do not provide any useful information on how they allowed that to happen. The hacker purchased an item then proceeded to block the seller so I wouldn’t be able to see or communicate with the seller to cancel. I changed my password and immediately tried to unblock the seller to cancel the transaction but the hacker blocked the seller literally every half second so I was barely able to send a message saying I didn’t order and it was hacker making purchases before it was blocked again. All this was communicated to offer up and they did nothing to address the problem. They told me the sale was canceled so I need no further action. They did not address how the hacker received my account info and how they were able to message people and make other purchase after I CHANGED my password.,1
568,"Bargains w/o a garage sale: On average I have been able to find some pretty good deals.  Most people are reasonable and fine to deal with both buying and selling.  One thing I would like to see added though is the ability to rate a buyer.  Buyers are able to rate the seller, but I don’t see that goes both ways.  I think the ratings for buyers should be based on friendliness and didn’t repeatedly reschedule a buy (once is fine, but more than that and you are wasting someone’s time), and whether the transaction was completed appropriately (no showing up with an agreed price only to try to haggle the seller in person).  The rating should not include whether someone inquired but didn’t buy.  That’s part of the deal, a lot of people kicking tires but no real offers.",5
569,"Don’t but from this place: This place is good for local selling or buying. 
I bought an item here and it’s been a week since I bought it. Buyers protection says Next to a reminder that if the item does not ship after 3 days that the order will be canceled and I will get a refund. I contact support and they send me a link that says something different along with modifying what was said on print on their site. OfferUps is great at taking money from your card  but slow at canceling or informing you about what happens to your order after the seller doesn’t meet up with the requirements specified on their page. Horrible first time experience at buying stuff from an app that clearly has a lot to learn.",5
570,"How they made it this bad?: I like this website and I want to use the app version, I really do. But the developer deliberately makes the experience so badly, squeezing products and ads together on phone’s tiny screen without interface designing and lining up, just so you cannot view any products without trodding on some ads that doesn’t turn off quickly, even if you being careful enough the ads will still pops up. This act of forcing user to pay subscription to erase ads combined with function restrictions on webpage, really provokes anger on me. I understand the company need revenue from subscription but ruining their originally good experience and make customers pay to have it back is not an acceptable way. I only used it for 10min before I deleted it, webpage is so much better comparing to this annoying thingy.",3
571,"No protection for buyers and terrible customer support: Outside of the many technical issues with their payment platform (rejected payments for no clear reason after going ‘under review’) for which customer service had no answer,  they  collect fees when an item is sold so have no interest in protecting buyers (refunds = no fees). They have an inspection period of 48hrs after which you don’t even have the ability to leave a review. I was only able to thoroughly inspect an item after this window expired, and noticed the seller had shipped me a completely different item of much lesser value then was advertised. Not only is it not possible to file a claim at that point, you can’t even post a review for the user. Customer service can only be reached through email, and don’t care at all about flagging users so other buyers can be protected. This is the worst experience I’ve had with any marketplace platform; luckily there are alternatives",1
572,"Works great, as long as they don’t delete your post arbitrarily: I use Craigslist, offer up, and letgo.I buy and sell. 

Early on (not realizing it was against the rules) I posted about birds for sale and it was deleted. You live and learn....I stopped posting about selling birds.  But recently I posted a bird cage, and I even said there was no bird with it, but they deleted my post anyway. I tried to contact someone and explain there was just a cage. I got no response from admins. 

Today is the same thing happened again, only this time it was an aquarium with stand. The Clarion was empty, as anyone could see looking at the picture. I did not mention anything in the post about fish or any other animals. Nevertheless, it got deleted. I will probably stop using the app, because it is not worth my time when this kind of thing happens.",4
573,"Deals in theory, scammers galore: As a once-frequent buyer (and seller) on OfferUp, i’ve learned that too many sellers on here are scammers lying about product offered, disguising fake or faulty product as legitimate or real product, or after having messaged to meet and leave for meeting and confirmed seller is on the way, to waste your time with having you drive to agreed upon meeting place only to say never mind on your deal. 

This wouldn’t be as big a problem if OfferUp had any kind of customer support/ scammer protection in place other than their “we can’t do anything it’s totally your fault” emails (which are probably automated) for reporting abuses to OfferUp seller guidelines. 

Some deals are fine, hence the two stars actually given. But OfferUp seriously needs to monitor for scammers better. Buyers beware, app has tons of scammers, no real customer support, and doesn’t look like it will change this any time soon.",2
574,"The people who use this app are awful: I used to have good luck on this app in LA, Denver, and Tampa. Almost 2 dozen 5 star reviews from a mix of sales and purchases from those people who actually have the patience to leave ratings. Don’t get me wrong, this app works fine, but the user-base is less than adequate lately. Nobody seems to read your descriptions. People message you and ghost you, or waste your time trolling you. Some people flat out don’t respond. I’m tired of people asking me dumb questions on here that I’ve already answered in my listings. Someone asked me if my item for sale was at the location I listed it at, then had the audacity to say it was too far. If you want to sell something for the price you want in a reasonable amount of time, use Facebook Marketplace because even though there’s a lot of bs, they have more users, your listings get more views, and their support setup is better. Facebook is the new Craigslist and OfferUp is the classified section of your small town newspaper.",1
575,"Truyou: So I was browsing for most of the day and the app was great. And then i was prompted to get verified for truyou (which is a safety step to make sure you’re really who you say you are). Once I followed all the steps and applied it, I got an email saying they couldn’t accept my application because my pictures were blurry. So I tried again, making super sure I had enough light, no blurring or glare. No luck again. So I tried again. And again. And again. And so on until I finally gave up. My husband had the same problem setting up his account on a completely different phone, email address etc. See this wouldn’t be such a problem if I was able to still make offers around the site LIKE I HAD BEEN DOING ALL DAY BEFORE HAND, but now I can’t send any offered or messages or anything. I wrote to customer service, and got a reply a few hours later giving me some easy troubleshooting tips, which I followed to no avail. Still nothing. Really disappointed because I liked this app.",1

Not only do you not offer a feature to REMOVE spam offers you never posted, but the floods of messages was not good in the life of a busy realtor. Within 4 mins I had 76 messages, some of people accusing ME of being the scammer. The links to deactivate your account don’t work. They timed out so I did it from a laptop BUT, then I went back on the app to confirm I couldn’t log in (to a deactivated account) and my account was STILL THERE. This is after logging out, changing password and then finally deactivating. I should be able to change a password and deactivate the spam listings easily. Instead of having to give up all my otherwise grand reviews and experience here. Shame on you for hour deactivation link not covering both web and mobile platforms and shame on you for not allowing us more control when being violated.",1

It’s been good for the most part and I like it, but whenever I’m removing one of the many things that I have on my saved list I don’t like how I have to scroll down and it takes forever to scroll down because it’s so slow and when I remove one of the items because it’s already sold, the screen goes blank so I have to leave out of that and go back and then go back into the saved items because otherwise it’ll just stay white as far as the screen goes and then I have to go back to the beginning of the list and I have to scroll to bottom of the list and I hate that and how long it takes to do something.

Having done nothing wrong and knowing for a fact i didn’t due to me reading the regulations, i was of course confused. I have tried to reach out to them only to never hear back. I have countlessly tried to make a new account or thought maybe this is an error. I would be wrong. For some reason offer up is now banning my girlfriends account just for connecting to the same wifi as i did. The support staff is a joke, no help at all. They could care less how much loyalty you’ve had to using them soley and to this day i have absolutely no clue why i am banned. I will never recommend this app and will not allow anyone in my family to use it. Facebook marketplace will save you TONS of headache. I can promise you that.",1
579,"Needs a change: This app has gone downhill over the past few years. Between the ads and poorly optimized app I can barely stand to use it anymore. Somehow the devs keep making it worse. It’s pretty disappointing actually. I use to love this app.

Things it could use, in no particular order:
- less ads: some ads, whatever, but these pop up ads that take up the whole screen and you have to wait for are ridiculous. 
- app that doesn’t randomly crash: love it when I’m looking at an item and I leave to look something up in my web browser for a second then open it back up and the app restarts.
- option to filter out dealers for vehicles: the app is a glorified dealer website. It’s really hard to differentiate off the initial results who is actually a private party owner.
- checkbox selection to quickly delete items from your lists
- option to change how you view results: Bigger pictures, more less details like title, date.
- cheaper premium option. $8 a month seems very excessive. Personally I’d pay $5 a month TOPS. I’d also like to see an annual plan at a cheaper price point. In a perfect world there just wouldn’t be ads…
- bots and fake accounts: not sure the fix to this. A lot of unverified accounts selling fake stuff or trying to scam you floating around. Mainly with vehicles, but also other items like tools.",1
580,"Excellent App...: Super easy to use for buying and selling... Only thing I'd like to suggest is when the buyer makes the seller an offer: give the the seller the ability to respond with a counteroffer quickly with a few clicks instead of the seller just having to message as a way to respond... have a counteroffer option click in addition to responding via to message. Just a box that says accept or counteroffer with a place to put in the amount with a send button. Even without this small extra request ... I love offerup and how simple and fast its been with making my life easier as mainly a seller. Nearly all the items I list, I sell.. Love how it's local. Everyone needs to be on it! Way better than Craigslists and much safer too! Thanks Offerup!!",5
581,"Lost a sale: I went through the whole set up process and followed the steps given by OfferUp. After about a week of my item up for sale, someone finally wanted to buy it and made an offer. I go to accept the offer, plug in my information for the shipping label, and the OfferUp platform automatically declined the offer because they needed my tax information. The buyer got irritated because he thought I declined the offer and I lost the opportunity to sell the item. 

I understand the need for tax info, however this is something that should be required when someone puts an item up for sale, not when the seller and buyer come to an agreement, and the seller goes in to accept the offer.  That’s just a lazy design by the dev team at OfferUp. 

Other than that ridiculous scenario, it’s been a good experience.",3
582,"3 Stars Here’s Why…: The app is great for selling, don’t get me wrong. But there’s some glitches in the system every once in a while. For example, when people buy from me, it glitches when they try to rate me. It has happened where I have to wait for the inspecting period has ended for the app to auto rate for them. And don’t get me started on the “payment pending” it takes for ever. Even with fast deposits it takes over a week for me to finally get paid. I hope you guys fix it. One more thing is, please ban those people that make posts saying they are welcoming a baby and as a result they want to give you an item for cheap. It is without a doubt a scam. And there are more than 1 accounts doing this there is hundreds if not thousands. I hope you see my rating and do something about this. Thank you!",3
583,"Why do you show sold items: Second Update: I heard back from the social care folks, and was given the usual, reinstall and then try on a different device bit. Still stuck in portrait mode. Maybe if the folks handling the social care Sid elf things would actually read the reviews, they would see many people have lost the landscape function. 
Update: So now you’ve gotten rid of landscape mode on my iPad. I emailed the social care address, but after being told to reinstall the app, she disappeared. What an absolute joke. Just because you can update an app, doesn’t mean you should. I’ve used this to sell several items, and it’s fine. The thing that drives me batcrap crazy is, why do you insist on showing me items that have been sold? They are obviously unavailable, so why would I care. If you want to put in an option to see sold items, great. Secondly, there is zero contact information other than twitter. Not even an email address. Cmon, you’re better than that.",1
584,Counterfeit money and scams are welcome on offer up: Offer up does not care about scammers and counterfeit money at all. Beware as the buyer and the seller on this site since they do not care about your well-being at all. I was given counterfeit money when selling an item and I reported it immediately and they didn’t even bother to close the persons account letting them continue to scam people and commit felonies with the help of offer up. I sent them an email with all the information and they never bothered to even get back to me... They will follow up this review with the message that says how concerning this is and to please contact their customer service but that’s just something for everyone here to see and they won’t actually follow up. It seems criminal that they let this go on without contacting authorities themselves.. I am in contact with Huntington Beach Police Department but Customer service for the app itself could care less about me or the person who is scamming people on their site.,1
585,"Beware of scams, bad customer service: Thoroughly disappointed in this app. My husband and I tried to use once last year to purchase a used refrigerator and all the sellers we were in contact with were extremely unprofessional. My husband drove an hour away to pick up the fridge and the seller was not even there as he had stated he would be.

I decided to give this app another try recently and made a purchase to be shipped. The seller immediately stopped responding to messages after I sent payment and listed the same exact item I had purchased many more times. I realized that I had been scammed. I contacted customer service and all they said is “we will investigate the issue.” I never heard anything back following but saw that they had deleted her account. They completely disregarded my concern for reimbursement in my emails. I will be deleting this app from my phone for good this time and going back to good ol’ fashion Craigslist, eBay and Facebook market - where I’ve never been scammed.",1
586,"Fix the app already: The app is extremely buggy lately. I think you guys have release 3 or 4 updates and it still doesn’t work properly. Can’t search for items. I type the item I want to search for and when I hit “search” the window goes blank. Can’t go back home, can’t do anything. I have to close the app and launch it again. Same thing when posting items. After I type the description and go to the next step sceen goes blank. I have to close it and pick up where I left off. Same thing when sending messages. After I type a message and hit send the screen goes black. Have to close the app and reopen it to be able to read my messages or reply.  This happens every time. Makes the app almost unusable.",4
587,"Was my go to website to resell: As a seller on OfferUp, I've found the platform increasingly challenging to use and disappointing. The most glaring issue is the fee structure. While I understand the necessity of fees for platform maintenance and profit, OfferUp's fees seem excessive. This is particularly frustrating for small sellers or those just looking to declutter. High fees significantly cut into potential earnings, making it less appealing to list items on the platform.

Furthermore, the app's performance leaves much to be desired. It often freezes, requiring constant refreshing. This disrupts the user experience, making simple tasks like browsing, listing, or communicating with potential buyers frustratingly slow. For a platform that relies heavily on quick and efficient communication, these technical issues are a major setback.

What's truly disappointing is remembering how great OfferUp used to be. It was a go-to platform for buying and selling locally, known for its ease of use and a wide variety of items. However, with increasing fees and persistent app performance issues, it seems to have lost its edge.

To regain its reputation, OfferUp needs to reconsider its fee structure to be more seller-friendly and invest in significant app improvements. As it stands, many sellers, myself included, are considering alternative platforms that offer a more user-friendly and cost-effective experience.",1
588,Too Many ads: [The latest version is obnoxious. You have to watch a 3-4 sec ad to do anything. Offerup already populates your search with ads but the pop up ads make the whole experience not worth the effort. Ask a seller a question… watch a 3 sec ad. No thanks.] The most recent update removed most of the pop up ads. Good job! I do wish there was a way to rate flaky buyers. I constantly am asked to hold an item and then they never show up. This happens a lot. It’s hard not to hold because you don’t want them to drive across town just to find out you sold it to someone else. This is the big issue and makes the process not worth the hassle. The next option is to have them text you the minute they are ready to leave but I don’t monitor my account by the minute so it doesn’t work for me.,3
589,Removed my account for no reason: I’ve had an account for years and recommend OfferUp to people all the time. It’s been a huge help in these difficult financial times and is something our family relies on regularly. Suddenly I found myself unable to use my account. I could post things but they’d never actually be posted for others to see and no one can receive my messages now. When I reached out to customer service all I got was some automated message about how my account was removed for violating community guidelines and posting rules. I have never done any of the sort and now my account is gone forever and I’m not allowed to make a new one. I can’t even get ahold of a real person to talk to about this misunderstanding. It’s such a shame that OfferUp will no longer be a part of our family. I will be warning everyone I know who uses OfferUp that they too may suddenly lose their account one day for no reason.,1
590,"Glitch: Photos zoom in too close...: Ok, first I’ll compliment the update where you changed the layout a bit and the function where you can add lots of specs on the items (very similar to eBay listing) ...but here’s where my problem lies in: Before I tap on a listing, the thumbnail appears to show the item in its entirety, but when I tap on it, the image zooms in RIDICULOUSLY close. Luckily, sometimes sellers that post several images of the item make it easier to see other angles, however, not everyone takes advantage of this feature and do not follow simple photo taking rules. 

Please fix this because this has been going on for months. I have passed on many items that could’ve been a sale if I’d seen the entire product. I have done every possible update and it’s still an issue.",4
591,"Fishy and disappointed: So I’ve had an account and have done nothing wrong or against regulations. I haven’t even posted anything to sell, I only message people when I’m interested in an item I want to buy. The past couple of weeks I have messaged so many people for different items and never got replies back. I then just experimented and messaged tons of new listings, no reads or replies. So I suppose I was banned for some reason and with no notification. Everything is normal except people are not getting my messages. I don’t trust it anymore it makes no sense and I loved it before, but now there’s nothing to love since I can’t purchase anything so I think I’m good and will just stick to real thrift stores now✌️ I checked Reddit too and it’s happening to so many other people too for no reason, sketchy, not efficient, now serves no purpose, and is taking up storage on my phone for no purpose until I delete it in a sec….

592,"So much Fraud on there: I got recommended to look on OfferUp for a used vehicle and man when I tell you how messed up people are it’s disturbing. I contacted someone about a vehicle and they told me a tragic story about their son passing away 2 months ago from a motor cycle accident and seeing the car hurts them so they want to get rid of it, you feel bad and are willing to take the vehicle off their hands. But then they aren’t in the state, you gotta go through an eBay company page to pay for the card with only eBay cards and they’ll ship the car. Okay weird so I bailed on that offer then contacted other people. I get replies and tell me why everyone that responded either had a child that died from a motorcycle accident 2-4 months ago or a husband dying 4-6 years ago and has to leave for military duties. Absolutely ridiculous! I’d understand one or two people but every single person selling cars?!? Nope never using this app again! If I was able to show the emails as proof I would!",1
593,"Clear Out Posts: With the merging of LetGo and Offer Up, it would be really nice to see older postings cleared out. It’s extremely annoying to click on something you’re interested in, just to see it was posted 1 or 2 years ago. It is highly unlikely that item is still available. The poster likely just didn’t take down their post. Send a notification about posts that old (or really over 6 months) letting them know they need to verify their item is still available. If it is, update the time posted in some way to indicate it’s not an ancient posting. If they don’t reply within a week, take the post down! Make it a much more enjoyable experience for those of us browsing. Other than that, when I can find an item posted recently and still available, it’s a great app!",4

I’ve tried to get my account back multiple times by emailing offer up but they have not yet helped me enough , my account gets activated for 10 mins but as soon as I post a item they immediately deactivate the account with no valid reason. I feel as I’ve been betrayed by OfferUp because this was my go to app and I would of recommend it but here I am broke because of this issue. And yes I have already spoke to the help team but they have let me down too. OfferUp has done nothing to help me get my account back permanently",2
595,"Not as good as Let Go, nothing is selling, no messages: I think Offer up baught out Let Go because Let Go was better and more advantageous to the user. Their algorithms allowed me to sell decent without paying. If I needed to sell faster, liked get rid of something in a day, I would pay the fee. With offer up I don't feel like they care about users selling good, they just want us to pay to increase bored on our sale items.

I would appreciate if anyone could shed some light on how I could better use the app to sell without having to go through the paywall(which defeats the idea of selling for less).

I started using let go to sell dozens of items through pickup and clear up my space. A buyer told me about offer up and hope it was the same do I tried it. 

I continued to sell on let go and offer up. Only a few of my sales (towards my goal of selling most of my belongings) were through offer up. The last item I sold was through Let Go during the Sep 21 deadline finish up transaction period. It happened to be my highest priced item and I'm so thankful for Let Go because it sold. 

Since then I've placed a few posts on offer up and the amount of interest is almost 90% lower. I don't get how their algorithms are different but it's worse. What good is an app that says I can sell anything when really I can't.",2
596,Good but annoying how many inactive people there is.: Such a genius app to use but honestly what made me give it a 4 star is the fact that it has so many inactive people. The worse is that the lazy leeches don’t mark anything sold or remove the items when it’s gone. So frustrating. I even came across a person that just left me unread on something I was very interested on. I asked him to tell me if it was sold and if he could take it off if it was. after a few people that don’t answer or mark it sold he flat out said No. offer up needs to step it up cause you’re gonna come across a lot of idiots here and a lot of of inactive people that can’t mark it sold so it makes your search harder to find at times due to so many things being posted either at high prices or so little of it.,4
597,"I hate this new app: I absolutely hate this new app I loved letgo and now it seems like OfferUp is the big boss and I hate it. I had a good thing going with letgo I was verified I had people who wanted to buy stuff I had my things for sale I liked how the app worked and then i just wake up to this. It’s not fair to the people on letgo who had all of their listings taken down and all of their customers striped away from them I was starting to have a good reputation on there and this goes for people on offerup to they got everything striped away from them this app should not exist why do you need a mashup of the 2 apps what good does it do for the people on the separate apps you just loose for nothing and have to start over again I have to use this app now and I just don’t like it, it needs to go back to normal. I know I keep saying this but what does this mashup do for the apps I really would like to know. 1 Star and if I was able to give zero I would 100% choose zero stars go back to normal!!",1
598,"Watch out for scammers especially first time users!: I used this app for the first time and listed my AirPods. Just after listing them I get a message from “John” with picture and all. He acts like he is new to OU and says he wants to by the item for his nephew. He tells me that the shipping on his end is $20. I didn’t read up fully about this app but I knew I chose the small box which should br $3.29 shipping. He tells me he needs to get off his laptop and wants my phone to text. I give it to him (which now I wouldn’t on this app) and he texts “Hi this is Gwen”...what? I thought his name was John. Then he wants me to overnight the item and says he will pay. Huge red flag! I tell him to go through the app and everything will be handled. No response back again! 
For those who are new or didn’t read the safety literature, please do and look out for people like this! Report those through the app.",3
599,"User friendly for buying and selling locally but...: The customer service is pretty bad. No way of contacting them except through email and they don’t reply. I was very happy with OfferUp until I had someone ship me an item. Your supposed to have buyer protection which protects you if item is damaged or something is wrong. I got an item that was damaged, contacted them in the time frame of three days, when you message it says you will get a confirmation email. I made sure my email was connected and it was, I got no email and I have yet to hear back from them it’s been weeks now. And I’m just sitting here with this busted item thinking what I’m going to do with it. Contacted them more then five times through different ways and nothing. Not even a message saying they received my buyer protection case.. so I would just stick to buying locally and not ship. I thought it was a lot simpler then that. And they need a lot of work still especially if there planning on doing shipping.",1
600,"Disappointed disapprove disgruntled buyer/seller: You guys removed and deleted my perfectly good and just item listing. Stating it was in violation for imitation replica rules as I stated in my post “” *genuine* “” then moments later obviously someone literally felt some type of way because as stated there was no rule violation or cause for or proof of such for that matter but my pics and info provided proved otherwise. Smdh  per se

In the end Yes it is nice owning a stainless steel watch that has literally doubled in retail value (that is if you can actually find/obtain one) since it’s inception but I deal with it, even so as I deal with my potential pain and suffering endured during this pathetic display of again someone’s overreaching disposition.  Blah blah. 
Plus I’m actually more of a Rolex guy although the Patek is nice..",5
601,"great app , small suggestion: i’ve sold many many items on offer up since i first downloaded in 2016 but recently i’ve started to feel like using the app is more of a task than it used to be. I think the app is due for a makeover in the way it runs and the overall layout to make it easier to access and locate what you are looking for. For example in my opinion a great add on for the app would be the option to scroll through items instead of having to click on each one to look at the info. and then have to click out and then click on another item. Small things like that would be great for the app and i’m already happy with how the app is working but i think it could be better💯💯😃",5
602,"Good. No Pic messaging/ account freezes/ Work on OfferUp support: Good app. Very user friendly and easy to use I've conducted many transactions using this app! However, I'd love to see a pic messaging additive as it will allow more privacy for sellers when potential buyers request additional photos. Also, on two separate occasions my account froze for no reason at all for about two weeks and I was unable to sell or purchase anything which was extremely inconvenient and it took about a week to get a response from the OfferUp team. 

All in all good app!! Super easy and to the point.  But OfferUp Please consider adding a photo sending option in messaging/ and upgrade the offer up support team so they can handle issues more efficiently. Within those two weeks you could have lost a user! 

Thanks :)",4
603,Can’t cancel a auto accepted offer: This app was fun to use and check for niche products. I even sold some items for a good deal. However my experience went down hill when I went to send an offer. This person hadn’t responded so I sent an offer so when they were online they could accept. However the system auto accepted my offer and immediately billed me. I did not want to purchase right away so this took me by surprise. I was even more surprised to see that there is NO way to cancel your order after you have purchased. You have to talk to the person to cancel. This person happens to also be inactivate so am now out money on a product I’ll never receive for 3 days. This is incredibly infuriating as customer support also can not cancel the order. This has ruined my experience with the app and I’m unlikely to use it after I get my money back.,2
604,"Full of spam and outdated post: Used to LOVE this app. I have bought a ton of stuff and sold a few things too. Sadly it’s nearly unusable now. Try to find a second hand piece of furniture and you will be DROWNING in thousands of dealer posts just posting the same items over and over and over again. I can’t find a good deal on a second hand dinning room table or couch etc because they are buried under miles of spammed warehouse style dealers posting their “deals”. The concept of finding other people selling items in your area has been ruined by the apps unwillingness to stop dealers from putting hundreds of advertisements under every search. 

Also, they should really make people renew their ad or have it removed after a month or so. There are so many posts of things listed 3 plus years ago from accounts that don’t even use the app anymore... there’s no reason for something that obvious to not be implemented.",1
605,"They stole my money: This app has to be closed as soon is possible. And I’ll going to try everything in my power to make it possible. They stole my money without remorse because I sold a thing trough the app the give me a shipping label I went to the usps let the Walmart box an I have proof of everything, but the buyer show them a different box with a wrong shipping label and a different weigh, very different. I send 22 pounds and I have the receipt from usps. And the buyer says was 8 pound, buyer allegations said was me or usps. Craziest thing I ever heard.  They just give the money back to the buyer they don’t ask for proof of anything. Just like that. But now I have an opened case in usps, I have appointment to see an attorney, and I wrote a letter to the White House but also I’ll going to make this viral until this app is closed for good. Because they have a really bad policy or actitud. Sending this link to my 5 thousands friends on social media to make it happen. Thanks.",1
606,"If it ain’t broke....: OfferUp quickly went from my go to for buying and selling to considering deleting altogether. The most recent update has killed this app. I am getting messages late or apparently not getting them at all. Sometimes it will indicate that I have a message yet no new messages appear. This is affecting my purchasing as well as my selling. I have never liked the sneaky marketing trick of presenting a picture that is almost identical to something I recently looked at, only to be kicked out of the app and taken to a retailer’s webpage when I accidentally. It doesn’t work. Nobody likes to be “tricked “ into visiting a website that way and I don’t know anyone who has purchased that way. And I don’t know anyone who likes the new updated app. Please bring back the old app! You are killing us and killing yourselves. OfferUp has become one of the great tragedies of 2020!",2
607,"Why did letgo turn into this?: The old standalone LetGo app was so much better. You can’t even see the prices on the items until you click on the listing and it returns your search with listings from 3 YEARS ago, so you can’t sort by anything other than ‘new’. Also he messaging / making an offer part is clunky and it doesn’t really make sense how they show up separately. The app also needs to confirm with the seller if they are ACTUALLY willing to ship an item: most of the time it’s people wanting to sell locally, but the OfferUp app estimates the shipping cost to you. There’s even listings that say explicitly in the description ‘no shipping’ that the app is pulling up as the first result when you select ‘shipping’ vs. ‘pickup’. 

This is literally the only app review I’ve ever left. I’m so mad that they took away the the streamlined LetGo app for something that seems so outdated. This is making me want to go back to craigslist to find stuff.",1
608,"Offer Up Review: I love shopping on Offer-Up. I always find whatever I need. This site is always my first shop stop, because usually don’t need to go any place else. Especially at prices that I can get more fir my money. This the savings I can always skate out other things because the prices are bargain prices. I don’t have to run all over town searching, and they still not have it. By the click of my finger and comfort in my home and work, or wherever, I type in the mileage, for travel distance and item I am looking for. I recommend this site to everyone I know. It’s just that easy. Almost everything I own, mostly came from offer up. I also met a lot of new friends and people from this site. 
Oh, did I say I love this site?",5
609,"Great app but… sad experience: I love the app when I sold my first thing. However, the buyer came 1.5 hours late and messed up my schedule. My friend told me to ask buyers a bit about themselves before selling anything to them to make sure they sound reliable. Later that day, I asked another buyer about what he does as safety check. He refused to answer, so I said I don’t feel safe to sell it to him and apologized. He said he will report me because I asked too much. Welp, I’m very uncomfortable right now. I just want to know if it’s okay to ask a bit about the buyers. And if not, how can sellers protect themselves? I feel like it’s so hard for sellers to protect themselves since buyers can do whatever they want. Also, don’t I have the right to decide whom I want to sell my stuff to? Could you please answer me since I couldn’t find answers in the “help” section? Thank you!",3
610,"What’s Up with the UPDATE: I’ve been using the app for quite a while now I loved the offers you can give to people’s items and the offers they can give to yours. I’ve recommended this app to my family members,  friends, my bosses my coworkers etc,. It was a great app and I wanted people to know about what great deals you can find on Offer Up and the things you can sell and get rid of quickly, but lately I don’t know what happened I have close to 100 ratings 5 rated stars and I recently uploaded a few items and on all of them I had ZERO REPLIES AND ZERO VIEWS..... Man it was so disappointing I’m used to seeing at least more than 500+ views it’s a progressing app you would understand the views and the offers you’d get it’s amazing but I just don’t know what happened with the new update. Please fix this problem I read other reviewers who had a similar problem as well.",3
611,Apologies report: Aparently I miss by ignorance some rules but I asure you that i owe no client local or far as you can verify i have no account linked to my page . Please give me another apprtunity and i suse we’ll read my rules bwfore  a sale I highly appreciate you understanding and assure it wont happen again although still don’t know how this happened thank you again for the opportunity. Now that I plan to make my only way of income i can go on and on about my reasons but im I’m only goin to say I got ill and this is the only job i can probably perfom safely from home  (brain tumor ) un able to drive. But still a single women that had to provide for my living cost so all I got to say is thank you again.,5
612,"Disappointed: I was very glad to find this useful app, and be able to buy items that I was able to afford, and sale item that I didn’t need it anymore. I had almost 100 people that like me and they continue buying things from me. Also, I was buying items from the same people, so I feel safe and confortable buying items. Then one day I started to have problems with the app, and I asked for technical support, and my account was cancel because they said I broke some rules. I sale my clothes, shoes, and purses that I don’t use. Sometime I sale things that I buy in this app. I am not expert in designer, but I sure that theconsaiment store that sales the items are authentic. I try to sale less expensive, so people buy them. I would rather get some money back than just have it sitting in there. I am very disappointed that I am just trying to do right thing, and my account was close without any opportunity.",1
613,My experience: OfferUp continues to be an excellent way in which we can have the opportunity to make it possible to access so many things from a photograph where we get involved because that article (or articles) are obviously so necessary for us and what they are there like “telling you…hey cheer up what I I solve your needs as much as possible at a cost that is sometimes so unexpected that it would seem unreal…” and in the same way it allows me to get rid of so many others that have already fulfilled my needs and that are already unnecessary in my environment and making it possible to recover something of my original investment and avoiding disposing of these in another way,5
614,"Spam accounts, zero customer service: The idea behind this app is great and when it works, it works well. Unfortunately, after you post something, you have to endure 24-48 hours of spam accounts trying to buy your item for their cousin, brother, mother, etc. Once you make it past that initial posting period, things get better and the app works as intended. However, if you have any issues with a transaction, there is absolutely no customer service. They have a hands off approach and it’s your problem, not theirs. I had an issue with a buyer who wanted to return the item. OfferUp basically gave them the shaft so I worked with him to ship it back to me and I sent him a refund via Venmo except for the 12ish% that OfferUp kept for doing basically nothing. With all that being said, I still use the app but try to keep sales local. If I ship an item, I price it accordingly knowing that offerup’s support team is nonexistent.",1
615,"Unwanted Notifications You Cannot Turn Off: The app pushes notifications for ""recent searches"" even though in your account settings every single notification is turned off. I consider this to be a dishonest and shady business practice because it's something beyond your control that literally wastes your time. Other than that, I'll echo what other people have said regarding old posts and difficulty seeing prices in the thumbnails. It creates needless clicks. It's super frustrating. There's also no way this app's 4.8 rating is organic. I'm positive there are bots manipulating it. The app used to be good a few years ago, but now I doubt I'll ever use it again to buy or sell anything. Especially if it attempts to show me old searches for items I was interested in in the past. No one wants that feature, and I wish developers would stop implementing it in every app.",2
616,"Expect major issues with getting paid: I know several people (including myself) who have sold items on this app that were accepted and paid for by the buyer, but payment was never sent to the seller. Even after several months of “payment pending” status of a sold item and not a single email or notification from them that there is some action you need to take. When reaching out to Offer Up they either tell you, you need to set up a new deposit account or sign up for fast deposit for an additional 1% fee on all transactions. I’m starting to feel as though Offer Up is purposefully doing this to try and force its users to sign up for fast pay. Their customer service is horrible. Do not expect to have any issue resolved by them in a timely manner and without constant threats of action against them. I never leave reviews for anything, but I felt a bad review was warranted in this case.",1
617,"OFFER UP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS SELLERS: First and foremost, I would like to say that I am not one to write reviews on companies or leave comments anywhere, but this app has been the worst app I have ever used for selling items. I only sell new appliances at great discounts to try to give customer deals in these hard times but offer up blocked me from my account in a blink of an eye. I worked hard for solid reputation and only had 5 star reviews never problems with any of my customers and I still get my account deleted. Honestly in my opinion Craigslist or eBay or FB marketplace is a lot better they care about the sellers just like the customers because at the end of the day we are all a customer of the app. I’ve tried emailing support and all it says is I violated community guidelines which I have not done. Anyways I will continue to let friends and family’s and social media know not to use offer up if they want to sell items.",1
618,"So many problems!: I had high expectations for this app because it’s so highly rated, but I haven’t had a good experience. First of all, I have never gotten a response from any sellers that I have messaged. No one has even opened my messages. I have only messaged highly rated sellers who have a high reply percentage, but it was just a waste of time. I wasn’t low-balling anyone or spamming people with messages, I had simple questions like, “What are the dimensions of this item?” I have never sent more than one message. I don’t know if they’re just not getting my messages or they’re ignoring me because I can see that they were active several times after I sent my message.  On top of that, my account was banned! I have never sold or bought anything on this app! I have seen several other people talk about how they have been banned for no reason. This app might have been great once, but I am extremely disappointed in offerup.",1
619,"Great App, but needs some work.: It’s functional, I’ve made a lot of money, but it needs some work.
Current issues include:
-Slow & Clunky interface, listing more than one item at a time is a pain, (there’s a huge delay when sending info to the servers I think(?))
-Lack of bulk editing for lists (I no longer make lists because they just fill up with sold items)
-Promote Plus IS ACTUALLY BROKEN, they took $20 from me & I’m trying to get that resolved atm… I’m broke ok? lol
-I want ACTUALLY FREE STUFF. People post items as “free” but when you read the description there’s always a catch, like sign up for a service, or even just a lie and there’s actually a price. It’s already against the rules to do this, & you can report people for doing it, but the algorithm really needs to work at taking care of these people as well because we can’t report them all away, OfferUp should also let more users know that that’s NOT ALLOWED. Not to mention all the scams that are listed as free…
Lastly, I feel like they can add some better features like “items you might like near you” when you’re out far from where you live/work. No one has any privacy anymore so might as well get some nice features out of it, you know? Like Yelp kinda stuff…",3
620,"Premiere Buying/Selling Service: Offer Up is amazing! Better than mercari, depop, let go & definitely better than craigslist. I use it to sell & ship items all the time. I love that they give you the option of having local meet ups, free of charge, but also the option to ship. The percentage they take when you do end up shipping is competitive and I believe lower than those other sites. Prepaid shipping labels is a huge plus. They allow you to upload as many pics as you want to really show case your items which I also love. The Only bad thing is the low ballers lol but hey you can't fix broke 🤷🏻‍♂️. Offer up is legitimately the premiere buying/selling app out there today. I recommend it to anyone buying or selling. Amazing & fast.",5
621,"Glitchy!: On the surface OfferUp is a simple ad to reach both buyers and sellers of local goods. In turn, OU has found ways to make sure they are compensated for their time, thru ads and delivery options. However, in focusing on those, they’ve neglected glitches and there’s no way to contact them for support. 

I live in one city, but all my listings show up as being in another city. No matter what I do, I can’t fix it, so Buyers think I’m deceptive, and trying to trick them into driving further. I’ve had to resort to listing my real location, as the top feature for each item I’m selling, which is exhausting.

I use two devices to read messages, but one will glitch and always shows messages as unread. This causes me to constantly be checking my inbox, unnecessarily. In addition, it’s also caused me miss actual messages and there is no feature to clear my it. 

In addition, messages from OU pop up in my inbox, they also glitch and cannot clear. So I think OU just likes me constantly looking for messages, some from buyers upset that they’ll have to drive further, than they’d expected.

OU does have great response times, in their report feature. I’ve reported several scams and they’ve addressed them immediately! Maybe I should report my own ads as being misleading!",2
622,"Needs a new formula: I love how even the five star reviews have negative comments (look through them!)(makes me wonder). This app is only good for selling in person. Sending items through US is a nightmare . For Every single product I have ever posted , I have received numerous scams asking for my email. Telling me to call them or text them, give them my paypal account , etc . It has become such a hassle that I stopped using the app. Other apps have formulas to spot scams and block them before the seller can even view it, offer up does not . And this makes it super inconvenient . Scammers run wild on this app, it needs to be fixed . Other apps make people give their ID numbers and take photo of their license to make sure they are legit as well as other forms of identification . And offer up allows anyone to make an account making it super easy for scammers to create multiple accounts and offer fake items....",2
623,"Customer service what is it?: There is no customer service, there is no calling or even chat one-on-one. Which does not stop them from charging 10% fees on every sale handled by OfferUp. 
The issue I had run into with an offerup was me being block to ship. The reason: item was not ship with in three days after sale, buyer was notified prior to sale that I would not be able to ship for three-four days. Buyer was okey. OFFERUP block my ability to mark items as available to ship. So my items would not pop-up outside of New York area, unless specifically searched for by buyer.
My inquiries went unanswered for FOUR MONTH! 
So you charge same fees as EBAY, but provide no service. 
Amount of spam is overwhelming. Post anything of value and you will be hit, with a message such as: “ i am buying for my daughter, I will pay with check, whats your address and phone/email, my second cousen of my mother will pick up”.",2
624,"Scammers’ Heaven: Will not use ever again. You see all these sellers with 5-star ratings and think they’re awesome. That is before you realize the review system only allows buyers to review sellers who mark items as “sold” (literally giving sellers full control over who rates them. Don’t want a bad review? Just don’t mark item as “sold”). Spent over $100 on 4 items Tuesday, 2 of which haven’t even shipped yet. It’s now Sunday. Offer Up says they will cancel the transaction after 3 days of no shipping. They have not. The other 2 sellers just shipped, on Friday, items that were charged to my account on TUESDAY. I thought online companies do not charge cards until items ship? Technically, all these sellers could NEVER ship merchandise since they’ve already got your money. Awful, awful. And there’s no way to rate these individuals to warn anyone else. 

If my other two items haven’t shipped by Tuesday, I’ll be disputing the charges with my credit card company. Will never use this app again.",1
625,"Great hub for getting rid of unwanted items for extra cash: If you need to free space around your living area and make some extra pocket cash by all means use this app; one piece of advice though if you are going to offer the item at a fixed price with no room for negotiation expect waiting some time before you can have that extra pocket cash ready to spend, as its purchasing community is hopping to buy on a budget and or save some money on something they don't imminently need. Think about OfferUp as running a garage sale from a handheld device whenever you feel like or need to, with the convenience of not having to stand around on your front porch and endure the weather or waking up early on the weekend to sort out your goods.",5
626,Pretty much a joke: I gave this app 1 Star.  It doesn’t remember your search location no matter how many times you reset it and tell it to save.  Every time you use it you need to reset the search area as it constant goes back to the default which is the max allowable miles- again no matter how many times you set it and save - it just goes back to max.  The “block” feature is essentially non-working!  It will keep someone from contacting you and vice versa but you will still see every add the person you “blocked” continues to post so if you live within 30 miles of a car dealership you can expect up to 30 dealership posts a day! And you can’t do anything about it do the spam level is Very High!  The developers need to to make an actual working block that blocks users and not just conversations & and a function save system for your settings!!  If it had working features I’d give it 5 stars but as it is NONE of the features actually do anything,1
627,"Easy as saying 123 to list and sell! Good bye BRUTAL EBAY: For many years I’ve been ripped off by eBay and came across OfferUp and have been with them from the beginning and loved this site. Even through the changes of them improving and advancing to offer shipping worldwide this has not effected the convenience  of using this site its only made it better. I highly recommend using OfferUp.  The only downfall is a lot of people don’t follow thru with meeting to buy but this is not the fault of OfferUp, it’s just part of selling and this pertains to any store with their customers. If you can learn to shrug it off dealing with these type of people then your golden. All in all I  enjoy using offer up to sell and buy.",5
628,"Overall a Good App, But the Free Section Needs Work: I've been using Offer Up for a while now and overall, it's a pretty good app. It's easy to navigate, and I've had some success buying and selling items. However, my biggest issue is with the ""Free"" section. 

When I go to the Free section, I expect to find items that are, well, actually free. Unfortunately, a lot of the ads in this section are misleading. Many sellers are posting items and asking for offers instead of giving them away. This is really frustrating, especially for people who genuinely can't afford to pay for items and are hoping to find something they need for free.

I think it would be much fairer if Offer Up could better regulate this section to ensure that only truly free items are listed there. It would make the experience much better for everyone using the app.",2
629,My item: I bought an item the other day and for some reason it’s not came in yet I bought the same kind of the thing from the same account 3 days after this first one and that one came in 2 days ago but my first one still hasn’t and on OfferUp it got canceled my money did get refunded and the item is supposedly coming still but OfferUp said they’ll take the money out of my account in like two days but my item still hasn’t came in on the tracking history it hasn’t been updated for 2 days now! I’ve contacted OfferUp twice now and they still haven’t gotten back to me so now I’m stuck with getting charged for something that wont even come in🤦🏼‍♂️ I’m not trying to talk down on OfferUp because besides this I love it but this is a pretty big issue that I feel needs to be sorted out,3
630,"This app is literally unusable: OfferUp used to be a really great app, however it’s completely useless now. I believe it’s worked maybe one of the last 6 months once I open it I get the “oops something went wrong screen” it will not load any pages and you cannot see search or do anything. I can’t even look at past messages or items I have listed for sale. What’s worse is I have this app synced with my email so I get notification emails from people messegaing me on the app for things I have listed for sale 6 months ago and have no way to open the messages or reply to them. I also have no way to delete my offer up profile or un-synce my email from the app. For all the people talking about how nobody will reply to their messages this is probably why, most of us our basically locked out of our profiles and can’t make new ones because our emails our linked to our old now corrupted accounts.",1
631,"Why Three Stars?: The idea behind OfferUp is very good. My problem with the app is that it’s become a scammers paradise. Example: car sales. Why would a person from a distant city selling a car for a ridiculously low price need to advertise across the country to find a buyer? The obvious answer is it’s a scammer ad. Despite the logic of underpriced cars seeking buyers in distant cities OfferUp continues to allow these scammers to operate. Any ad using gmail or other means of communication other than the Ask button is an obvious scam. But, OfferUp continues to permit such ads. Car ads are simply the most prevalent scam ads but they do use the same tactics on other sales items like boats, RV’s, and 4 wheelers to name but a few. Preference seems lo be for the more expensive offerings that can be offered for an eye-catching low price. App would have greater potential if they’d care enough to clean it up.",3
632,Can’t sell whatever you want!!! Or buy whatever you want: Offerup use to be really cool and easy to use now they made it a hassle with having to use your card every time just to make an offer to someone and you can’t even buy a red dot sight from someone across the country because it doesn’t meet their community standards!!!! But yet they advertise the same thing through their 3rd party ads website that they advertise on their own app!! Smh offerup acts like we’re trying to buy drugs or something crazy it’s just a red dot sight for a rifle what’s wrong with that !! And they don’t even have customer support or contact number so you can’t even make a complaint!! I will be using another app for buying thing online and please don’t reply to me offerup to email you about this issue only to have to wait 2 weeks for your response again !!,3
633,"Decent app but lacking some features: This app is decent, I was able to buy a few items on here. But the interface design is lacking. For example, no price was displayed in thumbnails when you are browsing the listing which is a huge inconvenience when browsing through all the listings. Also, the same listing that you saw keeps reappearing again and again in the list down below when you try to scroll down to see new listings. It may make you feel like there is a lot of listings but in reality the amount of listing is limited to a certain degree.

Another thing that bothers me is amount of scammers in here trying to obtain your address and phone numbers by asking for them directly in messaging app.",5
634,"Good app, but with unnecessary notifications: This is a good app, and it serves its purpose well to be sure. I’ve bought one item and made my first sale recently, and both of those things went as smooth as could be. However, I have deleted the app from my phone, because I’m not looking to buy or sell right now, but that doesn’t stop the notifications from coming in.

I turned off all the push notifications I could from within the app, because I kept getting alerts telling me about items ‘chosen for me,’ which is a feature I am wholly uninterested in. But I did not disable notifications in my phone settings because I need to know if someone messages me when I do have items listed.

But today, I got a notification with the same tone as the message tone, but from Offer Up. It said ‘buyers are looking, post something!’ And took me to the new listing creation page.

This logic is wild to me. Is it assumed that everyone with the app has something to sell all the time? If I want to list something, I’ll come to you Offer Up, you don’t need to come to me.

If there were options within the app to disable any kind of notification that came from it, it would be five stars easy.",4
635,"Terrible customer service: This app has the worst customer service ever!!! If I can give this app a negative review I would! Don’t use this app unless you just want to lose money! They say they offer buyer guarantee if your not satisfied. I downloaded his app thinking it was cool they do shipping as they hadn’t before, I was clearly wrong. I purchased an item from someone it wasn’t as described they used a website description as if product was new and it was clearly used, gross, and rusted. I been trying to contact customer service on this app for about 4 days now and have not received a response, I keep getting these auto emails saying someone will get back to me. There was a chat feature but every time I mention something about my order the person forwards my message to the same automated email system and closes the chat. I am so angry never again! I’ve lost almost $120 and it hasn’t been resolved, I’m stuck with a product I can not use, and I’m out of my money.",1
636,"Seriously the best resell app out there: I’ve been using OfferUp for yeeeears and they have not only amazing software/accurately personalized search results, but they take safety very seriously. I saw something posted by a user that was inappropriate/potentially dangerous (which I RARELY see in my 3+ years using the app) and I reported it immediately/asked that the account be shut down. They took action within 5 minutes of my reporting it. Literally NO apps ever act that fast or even do anything. I’ve never written a review on the App Store in all my time owning an iPhone, but I am now bc that was just the icing on the cake for me. OfferUp will forever have my business & a spot on my home screen. I highly recommend!!!💗",5
637,"I don’t want a job, just get rid of the spam: UPDATE: had to downgrade from 2 stars to 1 star because I contacted customer service again and keep getting these automated form responses that aren’t even close to the original topic. Also, see the canned replies to all these poor reviews of their app - it’s literally just copy pasted. Awful customer service. Below is the original 2-star review:

The app, as it was originally intended, is not usable anymore because of spam networks using dozens of new accounts to fill the feed with the same products using the same descriptions. It’s usually a retail store listing their entire inventory over and over. Seems like a fairly simple problem to counteract: either find identical postings from new accounts and ban them or give users a manual option to remove an account’s listings from the feed. But OfferUp adds jobs to the app instead of working on solutions to make its main app usable.",1
638,"Items bought should be in your purchases: If you can get a way modifying things to eliminate scammers that will be good. Like other app all your purchases are available for future reference or to even look for the same seller but OfferUp after buying something from someone that is all no history of your purchases.
When you are scammed no one to turn to and your loss is loss. But that shouldn’t be the case because we trusted you guys operating the app but if someone can just scam you and go free is no no.
There should be a way of making every item mark sold but most of the items are sold but is still there. 
They should be improvement on the app. It seems nothing is being modified since since and you keep asking to rate it all the time.
Please make it point to able to get some vital information about a person before allowing hi/her to sell or buy on the app so no one can scan and go free.",1
639,"Bombarded by repetitive ads and fake buyers: Accidentally tapped on a dog wheelchair for sale and now OfferUp is FLOODING MY FEED with sad pictures of dogs in wheelchairs (sponsored ads)… I get it… you want to generate ad revenue, but this is depressing. I don’t need to see hundreds of ads for dog wheelchairs or any other product for that matter. Give it a rest Devs. Try to be a little less… in my face with your algorithms. Don’t be so desperate for ad revenue that you annoy your users out of using your app… not to mention… nothing but annoying and fake buyers who strike a deal, but then never follow-through. What a waste of time. This App should have the ability to rate fellow users - too much wasted time with fake buyers. I believe OfferUp uses bot-buyers (fake inquiries from fake users) to keep their sellers thinking they’ve actually got real people interested in their listed items. Sad days and a waste of time.",2
640,"Rearrange: Be nice if somehow have shoes in a category. Where there’s only infant .  Youths men and women’s than rather have go through look in find certain shoes. Have the people are selling put down the sizes of everything whether it’s shoes , clothes etc...or not. Lots of whom do not give a size. 
Overall the set it has okay. I do like the way Santa Maria has there OfferUp set up you can look at things better than ours. 
Another issue is if how we can contact who is in charge of offer up. I would like go customer service to ask questions of my offer page how to delete or get rid of things on my page. There is no place where we can get with
Customer service. 
Please help me out who I can contact it’s very important to speak to one",5
641,"Scam: This app is a scam. I signed in with my Apple ID and noticed immediately I wasn’t getting messages although I could see they were being sent. Looked at a few recent listings in my area, then a few more, and realized nobody was able to see their in-app messages. Which is apparently the only way this platform will allow you to communicate. Contacted customer service, they told me there WAS no problem on their end and obviously, I was doing it wrong or every single person who had messaged me must have immediately deleted their accounts after. I messaged customer service back pointing out what I had discovered and suggested they get their stuff together and make a little effort to look into it. My account was summarily suspended. Apparently, you are not only not allowed to use unapproved and unmonitored forms of communication, you are also not allowed to question the OfferUp overlords. Hard pass on this one.",1
642,"Not well regulated: Here are problems I have had:

1. People creating multiple fake accounts and harassing me for personal contact information.

2. People not responding to offers or not changing an item to “sold”. I get maybe like a 20% response rate on offers but most of them expire.

3. Accounts posting the same item multiple times so it overwhelms the search page with just that one offer.

4. Too many ads for other sites. If I wanted to shop elsewhere I would not be on OfferUp I would look on those sites. 

5. Items that are just ridiculously overpriced.

I gave it two stars because I have found some great deals and sold some stuff. The bad overwhelms the good. The harassment situation was actually scary and I’ve seen it happen to other people as well. People pretend to want to buy something and ask for your phone number or social media. When I say “no” they become irate and continue to push for my information. I block them and then get the exact same request from another newly created account. The whole circle begins again. I had this happen with like six different fake accounts over a week. I do not recommend posting any personal information or photos of yourself on here. Do not model your clothing or items in posts. Be careful.",2
643,"It’s great when it’s working right: I’ve had OfferUp and used it for a long time since it’s been out. Personally I’ve loved it but recently I’ve had problems where all of a sudden I don’t get messages from anyone when I ask if an item is available. These are people that respond in minutes or seconds but I don’t get a reply or even them reading it for days, so then I try to sign out of my account. But then it doesn’t let me sign back in it keeps saying error. So I delete the app and reinstall it and try signing in again and it does the same thing. I figured it out and got it to work one time before but that was a long time ago and I don’t remember when. This app is great but please fix this problem. It pisses me off and i don’t know if other people experience it but i do. This is ridiculous and it’s happened to me so many times already.",2
644,"Horrible user experience that will take your listings off without sufficient guidelines: Unlike Facebook, there is no approval process for posting your listings. As such, you can post your listings quickly but then Offer Up may reactively take them down with no notice. People may have already started to respond to your listings, and Offer Up will ban you and lock you out of your account with 0 notice. There should be guidelines when posting to proactively help you understand what can and cannot be sold. Their algorithms for tracking what is not appropriate are very weak. Some completely normal items that are allowed on Facebook like TVs get banned with no good reason. There are a million bots on here that respond to your posts, asking for personal information. AND there are so many bugs in the app that remove listings and force you to re-upload them. A horrible, frustrating user experience for completely normal people who are looking to sell items.",1
645,"One frustrating addition:(: I used to love OfferUp! The app was amazing and I had a lot of success. I recently rejoined and there are a ton of ads now, which I understand the need for...however, it makes it harder to sell things. Charging to boost items, ok; ads for stores and eBay in main shopping screen, fine...But there is one that is incredibly frustrating. In the messages area, ads are now posted for anything related to any search completed. Even that would be fine if you were able to delete it or at least mark it as read. As it is now, it interferes with any potential messages from buyers or sellers because the ad always shows up as a new message causing one to constantly think they need to check in, thinking an actual human has reached out.
If this could be adjusted, I would bump my review at least one star.",3
646,"5 Stars all the way!!!: Update:
This is a great app. Either they fixed the earlier ad problem or it was a glitch for a day!! I honestly have had the best experience using this app other than that day. I don’t mind ads that are not intrusive or disruptive. It is also possible that I had an unread notification that was causing the issue. Either way I’m back to loving it. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Earlier 1 star review:
I have had this app for years. I’ve had no complaints. I was just prompted to rate this app and gave it a 5 star rating. Then moments later I started receiving one notice after another that I had a message... it was an add. If I click on it and close it a new one appears. So now what was once a helpful signal that I had a message is a bait and switch advertising gimmick. Have you heard of the boy who cried wolf? 
It works for awhile. So you have my attention. Do I have yours?
Hey we all cross the line at times and trade peoples trust for a quick dime. 
Maybe I can learn to live with this, but it is sooooooo annoying!!!!!
You can do this. I know you can. Find a way to advertise in a way that is better than this. Fix this and I will give 5 stars again.",5
647,"Alexi Samaan Update: So offer up has contacted me from being banned for no reason and made my account unbanned! Thank you Annette the only person that cared was her. I emailed offer up so many times and after at least 30 business days she was my hero! Thanks Annette not only you fixed my account but also created my income again when i lost my job. You 100% deserve a raise because she actually does her job compared to others, which are probably browsing the internet or only send automative messages only. Thank you once again! I can’t thank you enough and i never write reviews either. It means a-lot Annette! Someone please giver her the commissions plus a bonus and a raise! Honestly she deserves it! Thanks for fixing my account!",5

649,BEWARE DONT GET SCAMMED LIKE ME!!!: Be very careful using this app and do not rely on the “True You” designation. This site is infested with scam artist. I recently searched for a counter top appliance on the app. Out of 5 people contacted 5 were scammers. Found a seller that seemed to be legit and offer up said the true you designation means they were verified by the company and good. Well I got scammed dispute the individual being verified by offer up. Contacted offer up and they said nothing they could do “be more careful next time”. They said they know who the person is but can’t do anything. I’m only out a couple hundred dollars but wanted to let everyone know not to rely on offer up vetting sellers of protecting users. I reported the fraudulent post to off up to and asked them to take it down to keep others from being scammed. But offer up hasn’t bothered to remove it. It looks like they don’t care about the community. I will never use offer up again.,1
650,"Scammers, ads, blocked msgs coming thru: Well, I block people and the blocked people still get msgs through to me. Scammers are constantly getting through also. Asking for my phone number and personal address, it’s insane. When I do message someone as a reply or maybe something I might want to buy, ads pop up in my messages constantly. They even tend to rotate and multiple in the message center. I can’t view my list of blocked people which would be helpful since I am getting messages. It counts against me if they want to leave a negative review. The app needs a lot of updates and also managing. I see a lot of prohibited items being listed and even if I report them, I notice they aren’t being removed! I don’t get all my messages in notifications either. 
I’m trainable and would be open to training with the app creator or team to help, in any way I can to provide better services to the users!",1
651,"Horrible customer service can’t be reached if you have a problem!!: Avoid the scam of shipping through the app they have higher fees than eBay and no customer service! Five times I have shipped and paid the extra fees to shorten their day deposit time and it never works. You ship it the cheapest slowest way possible and the buyer pays more than most 2 day options cost! They get a couple days to decide if they want it even after leaving a positive review! Then they have some scam where you don’t pay 13% you pay 50% with their $2 minimum!! Love the app for local purchase and selling but after 2 years of shipping nothing ever sells for half of what it will on other sites! The site peaked long ago and hasn’t done anything improved in 2 years but keep raising cost! No email, no phone number but Twitter, you now have to tweet issues publicly, seriously? I need to download an app sign up for another social network just to get customer service?!?",1
652,"I don’t know what I would do without us right.: Offer up is the best then head that has happened to me in a long time. There’s so many things that I needed and I couldn’t afford, and with this app OfferUp it has been a blessing to my life as well as my adult kids and my extended family and friends. I’m gonna fix income so it’s hard for me to be able to get certain things that are necessary for myself to commute back-and-forth as well as other things. I truly appreciate your offer up and are you employees and everybody that’s back there making this happen that said God bless stay safe each and everyone of you all and may God continue to bless you guys thank you so much my friends ... keep up the good work .",5
653,Mary BAGORIO: Offer up is a wonderful app to use if you have some items you no longer need or want. You post an item and state your price as shoppers like you browse the tremendous array of products available. You can get great bargains and save some money. They also have an option to put your item for sale nationally and makes it easy to reach a larger market and to ship your item. Both seller and buyer can appreciate the process used here. You don’t have to leave your home to shop for affordable deals on things you want and need. It’s great for the environment because it recycles items to where they can remain useful. Try this app and you’ll be pleasantly surprised.,5
654,"Very weird: Downloaded OfferUp and have sold multiple items. App functions great accept for the messages! I'am no longer notified when a buyer or seller has attempted to contact me about an item. I have to log back into the app and refresh my message page to see messages that have been left hours ago because I was never notified. 

Also I have my email listed and if I refresh my email I will see a buyer sent me a message but again no notification on my phone that a buyer or seller has contacted me!! Very frustrating have missed multiple buying and selling opportunities due to not being notified that an individual was trying to contact me. And yes the notifications in my phone settings due allow OfferUp to send me notifications even though I don't have the app currently open. Please fix this, I appreciate your time.",3
655,"OfferUp should mean just that.: Pros:
I love the ease in communication between buyer and seller. The app is very user-friendly. There's no need to exchange phone numbers, to seal the deal. Many times, you can meet up in a public place, very safe and privacy remains intact. Cons:
What (should) separate this selling mode from Craigslist, etc. is the ability to ""offer up"" the amount you can afford or the amount you feel that item is worth. Many, many sellers are freezing the option to place an offer by the disclaimer, they will only accept bids at full price. That's not ""offer up"", that's retail. There needs to be a little wiggle room, especially when the item has been posted for 3-6 months, up to a year (in some cases). If they aren't willing to bargain, there should be an expiration date to the listing. 
Some sellers need to follow through and mark the item sold and not just type in ""SOLD"" in the header. 
Some sellers are trying to add multiple items to one listing and the pricing isn't quite clear. I've run across sellers the say ""FREE"" and then list the price in the description. It's a waste of time to contact sellers to clarify the asking price.

Overall, I've had good experiences, have met lovely people.",4
656,"Why are the searches not specific now: Love offer up and have been using it for years but some of these new updates are frustrating. I’m a car guy and specifically into classics. Recently searches started to be be all mixed up, usually I type in the year of car I’m looking for and that year pops up. Now it’s where I’ll type in the year of the car I’m looking for which is (1930s-70s) and cars from the 80s-to brand new start popping up and by private sellers. Can you guys make searches specific again to what’s type into the search bar again because it’s causing a difficulty in staying interested on searches on this app, marketplace has also been like this so Craigslist it is for now. Anyways hopefully some others have the same issue and this can be fixed.",3
657,"Continued downward spiral: I’ve been using OfferUp for around two years and through the LetGo integration. I have not made a single sale since the transition. I also find that the quality and quantity of local items for sale diminishes with each “update”. I get it that the focus is on sponsored and shippable items (I.e. items that OfferUp makes money on), but the overall quality of what’s available locally is not what it used to be, and it’s certainly not as good as it was on LetGo. I will say that the user interface and app work well, but the products available are not great.

It is also incredibly suspicious to me how OfferUp has over 4 million reviews and a 5-star rating when long time apps like CraigsList and eBay have considerably (millions!) fewer reviews. Maybe OfferUp works better for other users in very large cities or other countries, but not in a medium-sized US city for me. Hopefully this helps OfferUp or someone else.",1
658,"THIS APP IS RUINED!: After the merge with let go it’s ruined in my opinion haven’t even gotten a single hit on any of my items..  not 1. When the 2 were separate I used to list ten items in a day and people came out of the woodwork, at very least asking questions. Now I’ve listed ten items 3 times and had enough views but nobody has contacted me...   not a single one...   very strange to me. I don’t understand. But that doesn’t matter. I don’t need to understand. Just need to sell something. And also I’ve seen vehicles on here and tried to contact somebody. That also goes nowhere. Offer up/let go is now garbage. Btw no need for some bot to send me a “developer response” I’m deleting this trash.",5
659,"Good marketplace, bad app: There is lots for sale on OfferUp, but the app has design problems and bugs. I’ve kept the app updated, but they never seem to fix these issues: 

1. Prices aren’t shown in search results, why must I click into every single listing individually just to see the price? 

2. Destroys iPhone battery life, phone gets hot. There’s something seriously wrong with the app’s resource usage. This happens about half the times I use the app. 

3. Navigation bugs: kicks me out of listings and list views, with no way to get back to what I was looking at. Especially when switching between apps, when I return to OfferUp, I lose my place and can’t find the listing I was on when I left the app.

4. Random annoying bugs: I get push notifications for saved search alerts, but clicking through the notification just dumps me into the app, not to the saved search I was alerted for. Why must I navigate manually to the specific item I was just notified about? Another issue: app constantly freezes in transition animations, and I have to force quit the app to start over. 

Overall, a surprisingly poor quality app given the technical resources of a company like OfferUp. I would be able to buy more from OfferUp sellers if the app worked better.",2
660,"It’s not consistent: I have been dumped twice. They gave me some excuse about trying to sell something banned...I guess furniture did me in. Then they said I had too many accounts. (I started a second because they jacked up the first). Then they told me it was a glitch. (I spent months trying to contact them). My account was reinstated, as if I was brand new and my rating was zero, and I built it back up only to have them do the exact same thing to me again. Here we go with the emails and crappy responses. Unfortunately this used to be a great site to buy and sell. I hope they figure out how to run it properly so we can get back to business as usual. Maybe “RONA” infected them!!!",5
661,"Made it worse: Its bad now. Im sick and tired of getting out of state and non local listing! I click on pickup only.... and still get non local.. and i get out of order listings.. new mixed with old, even though i have it set newest only. Update: the messaging system is very laggy and even if I view a message, many times the notification still lingers. Sometimes messages sent or received lag behind and get send later or received later. Sometimes the messages get received multiple times or are duplicated. THE MESSAGES SYSTEM NEEDS A VAST UPGRADE IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH MARKETPLACE. Honestly fb marketplace is way better, smoother and the ui is just friendlier. STOP SENDING SUGGESTION NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT ITEMS I MAY WANT, I DONT NEED YOU TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO ME. I AM MORE THAN CAPABLE OF SEARCHING FOR THEM OR ALLOW US TO JUST SET UP ALERTS FOR ITEMS WE MAY BE INTERESTED IN. THESE ALERTS MAKE ME THINK I HAVE A MESSAGE WHEN I DONT. Also implement 2 step for added security.",2
662,"Needs more sorting features: The app is great, personally I liked it more when it was just LetGo but I’m adjusting to it being both OfferUp + LetGo and I think my biggest issue is some of the listings that you guys leave up are on there for way too long. On top of that, there aren’t enough ways to sort through what you’re looking for. I mean an example of myself, I was trying to trade a PS4 that I have for an Xbox One, and I was trying to sort listings by how recently they were posted and that’s not a feature. It’s difficult to find someone to trade with when some of the listing I’m shown are from over 2 years ago, and others are from a day or two and they are all mixed in amongst one another. I just think it needs to be reworked a little better for the overall user experience.",3
663,"Doesn’t respect notification preferences: The app gives you the option to enable or disable push notifications from three different categories: “highlights and deals,“ “item recommendations,“ and “search alerts.”  Even with these off, I still get annoying notifications like “Halloween is just a week away! 👻Got a costume? Shop deals on ghoulish getups for the whole family!“

I really don’t want advertisements pinging my phone 🚫. I just want to know if someone responds to my items for sale. But if I turn off notifications from the app in my phone’s system preferences, I won’t see you when someone responds to a message. If I want to get messages about my items for sale, I also have to put up with ads pinging me 👎. 

Since they can’t get their notification preferences correct, and there’s about 1/10 the volume of the items here as on Facebook marketplace, I’m going GiveUp on OfferUp.",2
664,"13% fee and takes 20 days to get your money!: They charge you 13% fee on total price of sale. And you have to wait 20 plus days for your money to be deposited. If you have a issue good luck trying to talk to anyone at offerup they don’t have a support team or a contact number. You can only contact them on twitter! And by the way they don’t respond...Go read their twitter post and the problems From many others with issues. 
Not to mention offerup is the worst place for scam artiest. If you purchase something and your product isn’t what you ordered, good luck trying to get your money back! Offerup don’t have a support center to help with simple issues to complex issues like being scammed! If you go and look around for products you will find out quickly that many sellers try to make a sale outside of OfferUp because it’s such a pain to collect money. OfferUp is one of the worst selling sites I have encountered in last 15 years!  You been warned!!!!",1
665,"If you like scams, have I got an app for you.: Offerup is becoming completely unusable.   Every ad is a scam.   The few that aren’t scams get lost in a Sea of scams.   The report \ block feature is pointless when it works but now it doesn’t even work.  When it did work, it was hard to keep up with the endless scam listings with new fake account names.   “Text my phone and Bless my new baby and ill sell you my corvette for $100.”  I can’t imagine being offerup and being morally ok with this service.     It seems that, just like our society in The United States in 2022, offerup is ok with innocent people getting hurt.  Be careful folks.  There is no shortage of worthless trash on here and offerup is ok with it.",5
666,As a seller beware: They have this “buyer protection” guarantee which I think is great and all. But sometimes the buyers use it in the wrong ways to take advantage of the sellers. For example I shipped an item to a seller. He sent it back saying it was a “manufacture flaw with the fit” ... okay? Sorry Adidas made something that didn’t fit you right. I was perfectly okay with the return. However when he returned my item it was damaged. I tried to contact OfferUp customer support and have had the worst experience compared to any other app I’ve ever used in my life. Horrible. They don’t care and it’s obvious. They don’t have a number or anything so you have to email and wait... and wait... and wait... like 5+ days. Just to get a response that said “The seller shipped back the item. You can relist them if you want.” THAT WAS NO HELP!! I am super upset because my item was returned to me damaged. I provided pictures like they asked and that was the response I got 5 days later? Horrible.,1
667,"I liked it first, but now No: I don’t like the fact that you can’t update your listings to put them on top of the feed once in a while. So you have to go through the whole posting process again from the beginning and loading pictures that you already cleaned from your phone. And another thing I don’t like that when I lived in one city, I can’t update my location when I moved to another city. It always shows a message about technical problem and try again later. Then I tried to delete my account and create a new one in a new city where I live now.  And it won’t let me do that with my email, because I Used it for a different account already. And it always stays on hold  for that account. Third Thing I don’t like there is no Phone number of customer service. Where you can call and actually talk to someone about your problem. No. You have to write long messages through email every time and I don’t like to write emails.",1
668,"Dishonest retention of sellers money: I have bought and sold using the OfferUp app for several years now. While searching for items and using their chat feature to arrange a meet up to purchase is easy, shipping sales is more complex. I have sold two items that required shipping and both times it took over two weeks to get my money from OfferUp. I ship right away, but OfferUp will constantly change its method of withdrawal and as of July 2024, it will automatically “hold” your money in your online account (dishonestly acting like a bank) until you dig deep into one of their multi layered menus (that lacks visibility) and cash out. I was never notified or instructed about this need to hit the “cash out” button. The entire time the “receipt” said my payment was “pending”, when really they were just holding my money, since I already had a deposit account linked to my profile. Disappointing.",1
669,"Bombarded with commercials: I updated my OfferUp and ever since I get a commercial every minute or so I understand companies need to make money however, it’s extremely annoying and then it takes five or six seconds for a block to come up for you to exit out. I simply just don’t have the time or patience for this! It was much better the way it was before. And then they also have a new thing that tells you maybe you should consider to offer more! I do not buy anything used for more than 50% off what it’s brand new otherwise I’ll just go buy it from a retail store. There is also no way to get a hold of administration they make it extremely difficult.  They went ahead and reboot my account because I violated community guidelines, but they won’t tell me what I did . Honest you’re on a smart phone just look for a special for sale. You can get a brand new without any of the headache",1
670,"Review: I honestly get tired of people putting pure trash torn up items that should just be taken to the dump. And people putting things for free when they are not just to get you to look. I wish all sales sites no matter what made people list each item and the prices and not free when it’s not, and not make an offer. Just put a honest price and it would make it easier. It’s frustrating and a wait of my time to look. I’m tired of looking at trash examples dirty nasty torn and broken furniture like couches chairs clothes etc. they are just hoping someone will get the trash off their hands. I don’t expect it to be perfect but come on it’s outside in the rain? I just ask this is talked about and something done to be better and not wait people’s time. I get messages for couches that’s junk. Trust me I was raised poor so I understand trash from used. Thank you",2
671,"The filters don’t work, loads the same things, illegitimate users: Whenever you change the filter for cost or location or even if it’s something that can be shipped by the seller, you get listings that don’t even meet the parameters. Keywords don’t do anything as I guess other users are not properly entering them in or what.  

The other thing is the users on this app are not utilizing the details of the listings and making significantly lower offers than what’s asked by you. If you’re looking to make what you’re asking I suggest using a different seller app. 

For using this app for several years it hasn’t changed and it’s a little frustrating. Also I had to create a new seller profile for no reason whatsoever, and it seems to only work with Wi-Fi enabled not cellular data.",3
672,"The app is great, but...: I love the app but they need to find a better buyer/seller rating system so that we the serious users can filter through the unreliable buyers and sellers on here. Every time a buyer agrees to buy an item and just doesn't show or just never replies anymore, he or she should be rated as a unreliable buyer/seller. The star rating doesn't say much about the person. Perhaps braking it down by percentages on reliability, on time, doesn't reply etc. on their profile. Too many people using this great app that aren't serious or just have no curtesy whatsoever. If OfferUp changes their ratting system I would give them a 5 star rating but until then, the people on it make it an unreliable waste of time from time to time.",5
673,Let-go was better: App is full of fake accounts that make fake offers to simulate the app is working to sell your items. I believe the developers are manipulating fake traffic. How do you stop notifications for related items? I keep getting them for items I’m not even searching for or interested in. Re-up loading items is terrible. You can’t delete unsold items. Instead you have to archive them. Which prevents it from being at the top of the list when reposted. Communication with sellers/buyers is also terrible. I am not receiving replies to my questions or offers. Considering deleting the app Since it isn’t working for me. Also beware of many many scammers. Now they removed me from the app for no reason. Terrible app. Better off with eBay or Craig’s list. Now it seems like they signed my email address up for multiple spam email subscriptions. All started after my negative feedback,1
674,"Silently banned for no reason/explanation. No customer support responses either: I have been using OfferUp for around 2 years now selling items around the house and recently listed my truck and car for sale. I’ve had only 5 star reviews and haven’t done anything shady. However I noticed recently that in the past 2-3 weeks 20-30 people never even read my messages. When I looked this up, I immediately was greeted by other sellers who have had this same problem. Offer up has banned these other 5 star sellers with no explanation and no way to ever use the app again with your phone/account. Absolutely ridiculous to spend time building up a good reputation just to be banned for seemingly no reason with no explanation. Especially when there is no way to get unbanned or even talk to a customer support representative. Terrible app, terrible customer support, and 0 communication of policies.",1
675,"This does nothing to combat the numerous scammers: I used offer up to sell my college car and to buy a car for my younger brother. Both times it has been a terrible experience. As a seller I constantly received spam and scammers posing as people who want to buy my car, I didnt sell my car until I used let go instead and now they’ve essentially deleted that app. As a buyer it’s been even worse. 7/10 posts on the site are created by scammers looking to route you to their gmails or fake phones to begin lifting your personal info. I’ve tried reporting lazy scammers using the same car/ photo but regardless the postings remain. It’s gotten so bad I swear I can’t find a legitimate car seller under 3,000. Offerup also aggressively advertises things you click on accidentally and will even go as far as to promote those scam posts because it saw you click on one of their scams. Idk why they pretend to not be in bed with these scammers if they’re boosting their postings",1
676,"BEWARE SCAMMERS! NO OFFERUP HELP!: OfferUp is easy to use and so simple, it’s hard not to get into it. But there are SO MANY SCAMMERS on this app. OfferUp tries to get you to ship through them for their “Buyer Protection” plan, but offers MINIMAL TO NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT/HELP. Reach out to support and you’ll just be ignored; OfferUp does NOT care about the safety of the buyers on their app. Twice, I’ve been scammed through this app and both times OfferUp didn’t help, sending only automated email replies. Scammers will wait until the last day to mail off the item, and you only get two days to file a fair refund report once it’s CONSIDERED “delivered” — even if the package isn’t even at its destination. Once that period is over, even filing a report won’t do anything because OfferUp customer support is (again) just automatic replies. 
SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME, DONT USE OFFERUP!!!! Unless they extend the refund window or actually help customers who constant support, using OfferUp will just make you a potential prey for the scammers on that app.",1
677,"Delayed alerts: Been using OfferUp for about 2 yrs now and was really happy when they added the alerts for items I was waiting to be listed. However, said alerts often come 30 min to 1 hr after a item is listed. 30 mins to an hour may seem like a relatively short time, however; If you are looking for musical instruments or furniture, those items are often SOLD by the time I get the alerts. You have people sitting at home STALKING OfferUp trying to make a living buying on OfferUp and reselling. Well, some of us actually work and have 9-to-5’s and we don’t have the luxury of time to stalk offer up while at work. OFFERUP, your app is very good and I use it daily, but please fix the delay time on the alerts!!! Once this glitch is fixed, I will gladly give 5 stars. In advance, THANK YOU.",4
678,"Great app but one majorly annoying flaw: Pretty good app for buying and selling. It’s really as good as the user makes it.  People who itemize and describe items well make the app wonderful and easy but there are people who just put in no effort with no descriptions and an inaccurate listing title.  Also you have to watch for the scammers as in everyday life. Someone always out there scamming. My main problem with the app which kept out the 5 stars is there is constantly a problem when searching for items or viewing recently listed, there will be items at the top of the list that are absolutely no where near me.  They’ll be like an hour away or another state altogether.  Don’t understand how this issue hasn’t been resolved yet by OfferUp after all this time they’ve existed.",4
679,"Started out well. Now just full of scammers and no-shows: App has become inundated with scammers. Same users posting tens to hundreds of fake ads. Company could easily program around it but seem to want the volume to make it look like they’ve got more traction. Half the ads violate their use policies, but they only seem to care about vape equipment. And the users that are on the app just fish and lowball with no intent of showing up. I mean $5 for a $600 tv. It’s just a waste of time. At one point it was a refreshing alternative to Craigslist but they company has really blown a great opportunity. They even seem to refuse to remove allegedly sold adds. So have of your searches are showing ads marked as having already been sold. But I guess they have to include those or it would be clear to investors the majority of ads are fake, duplicates, triplicates, and far far more. Really a shame. But at this point just save yourself some time and download one of the Craigslist apps.",1
680,"Great app - when people respond!: It’s a great app for buying and selling. A few things I would tweak to help the buyer - 1.) find a way to get rid of old ads (maybe have a active button within 1/2/3 week or active within 1 /2/3 month time) 2.) have a hide & find button to stop seeing the same stuff over and over again. 3.) fix the bell/notification button it doesn’t matter how many time you delete a new notification will always pop up 4.) have a better search are in increments of 5 mikes to 100miles, bigger distance in the car category.  Still a great but still need the minor changes and tweaks. I still use everyday treasure hunting!",5
681,"Used to love it but offerup team humiliate their supporters: As I read ve read from the other reviews it’s not a problem only with me , I used to love a lot this app, posted for more than a year on it, Supported this app and told the others about it. Suddenly after being like a 5 star seller , my posts turned into intangible for unknown reasons, saw other sellers who selling same as me and there is no problem with them , actually I am frustrated now from how this offerup team treat their supporters and their customers , I m here asking them either to restore my profile or I am gonna tell all my family and friends never to use this app in the humiliating way they treat people",5
682,"Major changes needed: This app seems to be dead now. Example, one day I messaged 5 different sellers regarding something they were selling, no one replied or even checked the message I sent. OfferUp doesn’t show how long an item has been up for sale so I assume all 5 items were very old. Another day I bought 2 items, each from a different seller, for shipping and both sellers never replied to my messages and both sellers never shipped item. My money was held for 5 days until sale automatically cancels and you can not leave the seller a review after such bad experience !! As a potential buyer who actually hit buy item and put the money up front …. Seller should be penalized and the buyers should be able to leave a bad review ! I gave up on this app. Old accounts with no activity should be removed to weed out dead accounts. People should be penalized for no shows and not shipping items.",1
683,"Popup ads: I have used offerup for years and I have loved it as a local marketplace. I have sold many things and met up with many wonderful people. However I don’t know why the app has been slowly been on this decline where the interface for listings is just harder to navigate, there are JUST as many ads as listings, and the cherry on top is now there are popup video ads that I have to wait 15 seconds for to skip. This is absolutely ridiculous for a MARKETPLACE to have popup ads. It no longer feels like an online garage sale and it feels like a cheap mobile game where the goal is get you to watch as many ads as possible to generate revenue. By comparison NO OTHER marketplace has pop-up ads or ads that are unavoidable. Facebook, craigslist, ebay, depop, mercari, etsy. This is unacceptable and offerup will 1000% not be around for long if this continues.",2
684,I need the GM OR OWNER EMAIL: I was reinstated to got block in minutes. The owner need to made aware that there associates are discriminating… My page was BLOCKED for a lie. The company never investigated the lie instead blocked my page. After been a member since 2016. I was threaten by another person and made offer up aware of the threat and block the person “Meech” who threaten to shoot me because I didn’t want to sell him my product. I will report this to a high up but this company a fraud. Not only did they take my money for the ad and promotion all the while been blocked and still haven’t returned my funds yet. I did try to communicate but of course everything email and 24 return back … I will tell everyone stay away from a company who don’t feel the need to explain to long term member or who block me because they didn’t want to be responsible if something happen to me and it happen on there platform.,1
685,"Buyers and sellers are not receiving messages: For the past week, I’ve been sending messages to sellers regarding items that I want to purchase with no responses. Message shows “delivered” but never “seen.” I happened to see a sectional couch on Facebook that was being sold by the same person on offer up. When I reached out to him on Facebook he said that he hadn’t received any responses for the sectional on offer up. I had sent him 11 messages in a week on offer up. I thought I was shadow banned so I asked my cousin to create an account and reach out to 5 sellers on offer up that I hadn’t heard from in a week. It’s been 3 days and my cousin hasn’t received one response. All sellers and buyers need to cross list their items on Facebook market place until Offer Up fixes their app. I sent a message to Offer Up explaining the problem and so far no response.",2
686,"Everyone is a cheapskate or a flake.: I remember back when it was just letgo the community was a better one, a reliable community. If you ever post anything just expect people to lowball you constantly (20-60 bucks cheaper then your asking price), confirm meeting locations & times just to flake on you, and expect messages like “what’s the lowest you’d go” even if you specifically state you’re firm on price. I’ve tried selling things as less then half their value and people will still go out of their way to lowball you asking if you’ll take $80 for something worth $200+ bucks. it’s a toxic and horrible environment and I would not recommend this app to anybody even on a good day. Seriously horrible community, offerup does nothing to stop these people and I’m not just being negative for no reason I’m warning anybody who’s considering downloading this steaming hot plate of garbage I promise it’s not worth it. waste of time.",1
687,BEWARE!!!!!: So a few days ago i made a sell on a Thursday 7:58pm for some reason my printer didnt work that night and it was a weekend i had plans so i ordered a printer it was suppose to arrive sunday FROM AMZON  well it got delayed got it until tuesday offer up sent me a message on sunday that they will give me 2 extra days so when i got my printer on tuesday morning i went ahead and did the label and took personally to the usps around noon i have my usps app and scan every package because i like to keep track of everything the tracking was showing acceptance at 2:30pm that same day I explained everything to OFFER UP and they still canceled my order because the tracking didnt update in their system not usps when i sent screenshots pf everything now they sent me an email saying … THE 2 EXTRA DAYS DONT COUNT EVEN IF SCANNED … i wont be using their shipping service anymore i will keep it local THEY WONT BE MAKING ANY MONEY FROM ME ANYMORE!!!!,1
688,"Received payments don’t go through and say I canceled them: I’ve reached out to Support and haven’t heard anything back. A buyer is interested and made an offer on a product I’m selling, and even went to pay me, but each time he attempts that a message appears in my email inbox saying “I canceled so and so’s payment “. I have no idea why it’s happening except after reading online it said somewhere that I have to provide my full address and information for OfferUp to authorize the payments… However I’ve been on OfferUp for the past five or six years, I am true verified, so I don’t understand why thats needed, or why OfferUp doesn’t say anywhere on the app or in the email that that’s what I need to do. This issue interferes with the ability for a buyer and seller to close a deal, and thus far I’ve heard nothing back from support and cannot find a phone number to call. Poorly made process in my opinion.",1
689,"OfferUp is going downhill: I was selling on OfferUp was a truyu member always shipped on time and also sold locally and never ripped anyone off. Have been ripped off buying on OfferUp . The other day could not post anything on OfferUp so troubleshooting the issue I logged off my account and logged back in. Couldn’t do that contacted OfferUp support and was informed via email that my account was closed due to me violating their, “posting policies” have never violated their posting policies but I do see now that these greedy so and so’s want everyone to start shipping so they can charge sellers 12.9 % and the last sale I made they took something like 15% it takes forever to get your money when you ship I tried it and do not like it, I prefer to sell locally . I would be willing to ship certain items but to be banned from OfferUp for something that never occurred is pretty messed up. I would like my account reinstated.",1
690,"One Improvement makes this a 5 star app in my book: Offer Up IMO is the best person to person resale app. It’s safer than Craigslist with Facebook integration and other option account verifications and user reviews. The app is user friendly and easy to use. The only reason I held out one star is if there was a feature to be able to easily “clean up” your lists/boards where it would clear saves posts that become sold or unlisted status. Maybe you can even include a feature like in a photo gallery where you hit the “clean up” button and then it lists all posts with a checkbox option which defaults to select all items and you can unmark only those that you might want to still save for the pics/visual, for example. Other than that great app!",4
691,"Too many bots: I posted an item for sale. In about 3 minutes I received and offer to buy at my asking price, and Im thinking to myself that was way too quick. The guys profile was blank, no followers, profile picture, and account was created Feb 2020 (the month I created my account and listed my item). We went back and forth a few messages and when it came time to schedule pick up he ghosted. I was thinking it was sketchy, but let it go as a possible one off. Now, a day later, I have gotten four other offers from blank profiles all created this month. No one actually tries to buy, they all just stop answering. Obviously they are bots, most likely implemented by the developer to try and trick people into thinking there’s more activity on here than there actually is. Deactivated my account and deleting the app. Facebook Marketplace is better, you can actually see the profile of people you are working with.",1
692,"Very Disappointed by the Support Team: I sold several items using this app and, up until a week ago, would’ve given it 5 stars. However, I then had my account frozen so I responded asking why, got to reply and then my account was deactivated. There is now contact phone number and I got no response to my emails though that is how they say to contact them. I finally had to get their attention on social media. I then get an email saying my account had be reactivated, “great!” I think, but NO...

When I post an item now, I get 0 views. I looked online and other people have termed this “shadow banning” and have had the same experience with OfferUp. I tested my theory by using my friends phone and searching my exact item titles and yup, no results. So they essentially lied to me saying my account was reactivated. 

I have never gone to such lengths to complain about an app, but I am so upset by this. I used to recommend them to everyone, but no more.",1
693,"Needs a lot of work: The messages do not update in real time. It is incredibly inconvenient. Oftentimes I will get a notification for a message, and nothing will show up. I have to close out the app completely, reopen it, then refresh the main message page and/or individual messages to get it to pop up. Sometimes I’ll get the message ding and have no new messages. It’s so frustrating and makes the app nearly unusable. In addition, I use this app because I want to purchase goods secondhand as the environmental impact of the excessive goods created and sold by companies is astounding. So the advertisements for new products are really offputting and annoying to see. Lastly, the pay to hold feature has done nothing for me. You get less money, it prevents you from making a sale, and it doesn’t incentivize the holder not to flake. It is useless and inconvenient, and only slows things down.",2
694,"Mmashal1988: I used to use this app a lot, but they keep change the policies and lock your account. You build stars and you develop an account for years and and with a small mistake they ruins it. It is not good from point of customer view. Now I use LETGO. I had an old account with them they locked it, without letting me to get some information from my account. I sent them an email and an automated system respond that you can open another account, you violated our policy. You should first suspend or warn the customer and then close the account. I think now a days they only go for money not customer, if this policy continue like this all their customer will go.",5
695,"OfferUp: Great app. It’s like window shopping from home. Just one or two things I wish were different. Under the Boards section, it would be nice to be able to delete multiple saved items at once instead of having to unselect each individual item one at a time. When you unselect an item, and say you have many saved items under that board, once you unselect an item, you are brought back to the top of that board. Then you have to start at the top again and keep scrolling to the place you left off. 

I also wish under the feature where you ask the seller a question, that you could create your own saved question or questions that you often ask (like what are the dimensions?, etc.). 
Otherwise, I enjoy the app.",4
696,"Hacked, and then they cancelled my account (personal info not secure): I used offer up a few times over the last year. I sold a few items and it was fairly smooth... Until someone hacked my account. A few days ago I started getting emails from other users, inquiring about a car. Actually received hundreds of emails, but I wasn’t selling a car. So I went on OFFERUP to see what was going on. There were about 50 new posts on my account, all about selling a Toyota Corolla... I hadn’t posted anything in months. Deleting the posts would have been a long process so I contacted support. After explaining to support that I did not post those things and that I hoped they could fix it, I received another email that said my account had been cancelled and I couldn’t open another. 
OfferUp cannot be great at security if this kind of thing is happening. Beware, your personal info is not secure. I’m glad to walk away if my info is at risk. Beware, security risk",1
697,Great app but wish it had another feature and less ads: OfferUp is really easy with posting items and messaging others. One feature I really wish they had was the ability to be able to post a short video of the item. I feel like this would benefit both the buyer and the seller as it can provide information that a simple photo can’t. Just like Facebook marketplace has this feature it can really be helpful on here as well. This can be helpful with people buying or selling cars or an electronic device to show that the item they are selling is actually working and functioning the way it should be. Once that feature is added and they don’t display an ad randomly when I back out of a post then this would easily be 5 stars,3
698,"Terrible customer service.: So I would give this app less stars if I could, I first had my account deleted, so I started a new one and when I did everything seemed normal untold I realized no one was receiving my messages, it was not allowing me to post anything nor follow anyone. So I decided to seek some help. I contacted customer service and they seemed as if they were going to help me. So as I was DMing the person (on Twitter) they said they’d contact me thru email for further assistance. It’s been a week now and I’ve heard of nothing. So I went back to reply to the person on Twitter, and they won’t respond. This is absolutely ridiculous. Not only am I facing and issue with getting my account back or even making a new one that actually works. But to add insult to injury not even their customer service wants to help at all. So I want to let you all know that Offerup DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE ON THE APP. I say you pick a different app until they pull their act together. Good day.",1
699,"No support: They offer no actual support or help when you contact them. I contacted support to get help getting back into my account since they added 2 step and I no longer have access to the mail or number. They didn’t even give me a response they just removed my account for “violations”. I’ve never violated offer up rules & I’ve always had good 5 star reviews. You can’t get through on twitter support either, it’s just a bot that responds with the same thing telling you to email them. I’ve seen this happening to a lot of people lately especially when I read people’s comments on twitter literally begging for help & support & offerup literally just doesn’t care! Please use Facebook market, Nextdoor, or any other platform if you don’t want to lose all your progress of reviews, good ratings, and saved items because offerup does not care about you as a seller, customer, or user.",1
700,"Update ruined it: It was a great app, I could see if people actully wanted to buy my stuff or if they weren’t responding because they weren’t on, now I can’t even see when they were last active, so idk if they just arnt responding or what, and I liked to hid my messages but now it’s like Facebook market place, it automatically deletes. This is a great app but the update is horrible, pls bring back the regular app.

UPDATE:
Still don’t like the update but I am getting used to it, I would like it to show there activity and not automatically delete messages but the dark mode is starting to feel right, I’ll boost my review up a star. I also like the location feature where you can send them your location but is kinda useless for me since I still haven’t tried it",4
701,"Something’s fishy: I’ve used OfferUp several times before. I love how easy and intuitive it is to post. But, this time I created a post and a co-worker decided to pretend to be a buyer to test out the system because he was interested in using OfferUp himself. He sent messages and an offer within minutes of me submitting the post. It’s been at least 15 minutes and still no message and no offer from my co-worker has appeared. Meanwhile, staring me in the face is a “Sell Faster” button which promotes their paid service for promoting your sale “faster.” If I didn’t know that my co-worker had sent an offer and message I would be tempted to oblige their offer. Is it possible OfferUp is doing something fishy in holding back or metering offers and messages to entice sellers to purchase the promotions? I hope not but if so that would probably illegal or scrupulous at best.",2
702,Good app could be better: Good app but I still miss letgo as a person who buys and sells on the platform I felt like letgo was more clean and organized even before when letgo and offerup was separate I use to choose doing business on letgo because I use to see a lot of scam like account on offerup or listing offers that the seller had no intention on selling. I get tired of seeing account that are not verified no picture no info this account never sold or bought anything selling 4 items that cost over 1000USD for 50 placing a phone number between * and saying in each product today is my birthday another I had a child today. Since I have more experience buy and selling I never fell for this scam but I wonder how many good people trying to find a good deal in their area falls for this trap.,3
703,"APP PROBLEMS, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE: I am sooo disappointed! I just got the up and was excited to get going. After posting my first item, I went for the second one and got the offer and that’s where problems began. As I was replying to a buyer, I completely lost my entire exchange as if that buyer never messaged me. Then about an hour later I got 2 more offers and couldn’t do anything with them. My listings froze. I couldn’t see them in the search and nothing was happening. I looked up for reasons and suggestions says that they were not removed. If offer up would remove them, they would contact me and I would get and email. Nothing like that. Just had dad links. I removed the app, cleared my phone and reloaded, same think. I tried to post a different posting and same thing. My posting are there but useless and dead. Worst of it all, no help or reply from customer service. Very disappointed",1
704,"Here’s some tips: Offerup is great for selling stuff you don’t use and getting things cheap. However in my time using it I have learned some things. First, even though you can get nice things on here for cheaper, there is usually a reason. I have encountered multiple fakes and broken items that seemed like a good deal. Second, if you do decide to get nice things like phones or electronics on offerup, when you meet the person, FULLY CHECK THE PRODUCT. Don’t just give it a once over. Even if it’s in a sealed box and everything looks good, don’t give them the money until you’ve opened it and checked the product inside. Trust me from experience, I just want to help people like me who didn’t know any better at first. Otherwise good app, you just have to be smart about it.",4
705,"Some improvements can be made: Although all in all a very useful and simple to use app there are some improvements that can be made. for instance, the main thing that is truly bothersome is the fact that i can’t delete something i posted to sell, i and it doesn’t give me the option to mark it as sold if no one has contacted me about it (i could have decided not to sell the item anymore or have sold it somewhere else). another thing that must be improves from the buyers perspective is the tedious way one must check the offers they made to others, if the seller has replied to the offer it is very difficult for the buyer to review the messages. those and a few other problems that could be easily fixed can perfect this app right away.",4
706,Seller email: I like this app but I don’t think it should allow dealership post vehicles for sale. I think this app should be for just persons living in our community. I think dealerships and company profit from this app since doesn’t need to pay for advertisements while our people struggle to make sale do to big companies post. Also when you are trying to purchase a vehicle and people ask to be email I have emailed them and they respond saying they r in another state ready to be ship out guy or service that they can have vehicle shipped for free that they sell it for that price since just recently divorced and don’t need it and it was part be of divorce settlement she was given the car. For me to send money we could use PayPal if I wanted to. I think they should allow emails in the information or description of vehicles,3
707,Fees to sell?!: I recently posted my car for sale because i am in a jam and need money for my bills. OfferUp took down my post for the reason of i didn’t pay a required fee. Offer up never asked me to pay a fee when i first put the post up on the app and there is no mention of needing to pay a fee for posting an item or vehicle for sale unless it’s a nationwide post and the item needs to be shipped. The only other mention of a fee in the terms and services that offerup provides us to read is when using the offerup payment services on the offerup app. They state a service fee is required and that it is through a third party business called stripes. All in all no mention of a fee was given to me at the time of posting my vehicle for sale and that it is a local sale not nationwide therefore taking my post down because i did not pay a fee is ridiculous. I’m trying to make money to afford living. Not dig myself a grave of debt to be buried in.,1
708,"No check option for non-local sales: The app is overall good for local sales but for any non-local areas (where you have to ship products), it would be much easier and less invasive if they offered a check option for payment to the seller. Every other selling app that lets you sell to non-local customers and takes a percentage for the sales, always offers an option to receive a check. For Offer up, you can ONLY do a direct deposit to a bank account or debit card and they won’t send you a check if even you don’t have either. Offer up is the only one app like this that forces you to provide all your private banking details in order to get paid for a sale & considering all the privacy & cybersecurity issues we have today, hope they’ll change that so more sellers can have the flexibility of choosing the type of payment they get.",2
709,Unable to get money: I don’t think fast deposit is working right since it’s been 2 days and yesterday a buyer got an item from me and he did say the transaction was complete on his end but somehow I’m not getting the money in my bank account. I swear we did everything right on both sides but I think the app is slow or not working? The payment is still pending thinking the buyer did not send the money but I don’t think he is lying. This app really needs a progress bar to show how the money flows from buyer to seller. But yeah I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt and I want the support team to fix this so that I can get paid and fix fast deposit to where it has a notification of whether it’s on or off.,4
710,"Great idea, but needs a way to buy items and they need to do something about the scammers: In theory it is a great alternative to EBay with smaller fees. People list items and what they are willing to sell them for. The biggest item that I dislike is there is no way to buy an item, only make a 24hour offer that normally no one responds to, especially on one of many awesome deals listed that have been up for months. The real sellers sell their items in hours.
The other item I dislike is that OfferUp does not care about the scammers. OfferUp is very well known for them, and for good reason.  I keep coming across sellers that will only accept payment outside of OfferUp (you will never see the item), and if I increase the offer to pay for the fees they still refuse.
I have tried reporting them to OfferUp, but they will only act after you give them the details of the police report you filed, which you can only do if you were successfully scammed.",1
711,"Horrible customer service and app: After numerous emails, scam users, and a general waste of time, here was my last attempt to this app’s administrators:

After being harassed for months on your account by fake users, I began trying to delete my posts (which is disabled on your app). I asked you all to delete them for me, and you advised only archiving them. This still allows scammers/fake users to contact you. I took it upon myself to take blank picture and type the subject as “none” so I could stop being harassed. Finally, it stopped and this was a way to get around the “archiving” part of your app. Well, now, I’m trying to post stuff and buy things for about a month, and the system says “error” each time. I’ve emailed you all numerous times, and no response has been received. Why would you deactivate my account or refuse to help me when I found a solution to a problem you all would not fix (users harassing me through your app)?",1
712,"Horrible experience: Every single contact was a scam!!! I’ve never heard so many dings of new ppl supposedly interested in my posts , turn out to scam me. They constantly sent messages, about wanting to buy the furniture… “ for their dad” could I email him pictures?! What do I look like ? A secretary?! The answer was always no… I’ve posted pictures , you email your dad. Then … could I finish the transaction on the phone?! Could I call them?! The answer was no . We are communicating fine on here. For everyone’s safety let’s chat on here. Well…. Then I’d get ghosted. Then I’d post another piece of furniture … and the cycle began all over again!! I’d report them… block them… but a new batch of scammers would start. All with the same story!! My mom needs this could you email her pictures. Or I want to buy this furniture… when they live in New York. Stupid  waste of time. Does anyone have any luck on here? Seriously!!!",1
713,"Just a headache: Do not recommend shipping. I shipped a product , and they say once usps scans the label you will get your money. Then after usps scanned they said, now you I have to wait 2 days after the buyer receives the package. This could protect the buyer, but the seller. Now the buyer can decide just not to pay me. Luckily I trust this particular buyer. I’m more upset with the fact OFFER UP LIED to me the whole time stringing me along telling me one thing and then another. It’s not like it’s money coming out of their pocket. It’s legit mine/buyers. Also, good luck trying to contact them. They avoid you being able to write in your own words to them at all costs. It’s pre determined questions and answers for you to choose from. As if they want to avoid any concerns and be confronted with anything . Even the buyer agreed with me this is ridiculous and almost considered doing the transaction off the app completely.",1
714,"Ruined: Offerup used to be a great app in the early days.. unfortunately due to greed and crappy rules, you guys ruined it for yourself. The obnoxious ads was the last straw for me. I will never even consider paying a subscription to offerup to cancel ads or promote posts. Y’all are making it difficult just to force people to waste money on your service. Also, really annoying how I’ve had so many posts reported and taken down for “violating community guidelines” when there are literally hundreds of other posts all around the country for the same type of items people are trying to sell. I’m not trying to sell weapons or drugs but my posts constantly get taken down to the point I’ve simply given up and mostly post on Craigslist now. Offerup definitely feels like a communist marketplace, god forbid I try to sell somebody a pocket knife or gun holster. This isn’t china, this is america you weirdos",1
715,Please add feature on “ask”: So sellers have the option to put firm on price and it will show on the screen when buyers click the buy option. However it doesn’t show when buyers click the ask option and that’s where most buyers will send offers. Please add “firm on price” or something along the lines in the “ask” option of the listing. I’m getting tired of having people submitting an offer that is half of my asking price when I selected firm and price and wrote it in the item description. The low ballers on this app are making it more appealing for sellers to move from offerup to Mercari or eBay despite the selling fees simply because there’s a way to prevent lowball offers and it reaches a larger audience. Please fix this because this is beyond frustrating.,3
716,"Please stop allowing “new” items in used section!: This app is so frustrating! I can’t even truly search for local used things because there are too many listings and advertisements in this section for new stuff from businesses that are allowed in the used section. The first 3 items I clicked on took me to a company website when I thought I was looking at used items. I get that you guys want the advertisement revenue but PLEASE keep the “used” section for used items - you are compromising the integrity of this app in exchange for these adds. It I wanted to look at “new” items, I would be looking in the “new” section. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE exercise some control on what gets posted in the used section. It is getting to be a waste of time for me to even look on this app anymore since so much of the used stuff that is listed is actually new stuff listed by businesses! So frustrating!!",1
717,"Just use Depop or Mercari! App run by bots and scammers!: I’ve been offered low offers and offputting messages from buyers on this app. Be extra careful when listing items that should be allowed to be sold. I was posting items that are not listed as breaking community guidelines. 

They will you off the platform-even if you have over 200 5 star reviews and deliver items on time to sellers. I had been on the app since 2018 and haven’t changed anything about how I sell. Bots will screen your listings for keywords that break community policy and they will deactivate your account without even a reason as to why they did so. 

Extremely disappointing and unprofessional app! Plenty of other resale apps that don’t offer these shady business practices. I was booted off after trying to sell some books, clothes and simple household items without even a reason as to why. They will not even tell me why.",1
718,"I would give these developers and app 0 stars if I could: So I downloaded this app to try and sell a dryer.  It was up all of a few days before it stopped allowing me to access my account. Then I received an email stating that I violated the community guidelines and my account has been removed. Ummm…how exactly? All I posted was a dryer and a description of it.  Unless you felt me marking someone’s listing selling drugs from their home (which according to your community guidelines, is a clear violation) as a violation was harassment.  Also, when I select the option you give that states, “if you feel this is a mistake, click here,” it sends me to a broken page that says “access denied”.  So this was my one and likely only experience using this so called marketplace, as obviously there is little oversight and when someone brings a violator to the attention of the devs, they may just decide to ban you instead.",1
719,"Last update very buggy: I used to love the old design of the app, now it has a bit different design which I can adopt to, but it has many bugs! And I am a user since 2015, this is the worst one!
Here are a few of the top of my head, The post pictures are for some reason cut, and it doesn’t show the full image! When you click on the map to see the seller’s location compared to yours it would just show my location but not like before both locations on the same map zoomed out, I mean common I know my location! But the most annoying is the bugs when you type and you can’t see where are you typing cuz the line just gets under the keyboard! And it also fezzes and just gets stock so I have to force close it and reopen it!
These glitches have been around for over a month now and I have been waiting for a fix but no new updates yet!!! Common fix your mess!",1
720,This new update is stupid 2020: This new update has ruined the app completely messages will not send. You cannot archive posts. You cannot mark posts as sold. I have the newest updated iPhone all of my other apps work perfect but this app is not doing what’s right anymore. Some error keeps popping up and this happened after the app updates itself to the newest version. Bring the old version back!! This is unacceptable it’s like you guys are doing this on purpose. Bring the old version back this year has already been stressful with work and here comes this app not working anymore. Bring the old version back this is driving me nuts!👎🏼😡😡,5
721,"Horrible Experience: So I'll start out by saying I did love this app. Then out of the blue I stopped getting views on my listings. At first I didn't think anything of it, but after about a month and none of my listings even getting a single view I started doing some research. For some reason my account got banned. But they never told me this. Not a single word. I was still able to see my account, surf the app looking for items, and even post additional items they just wouldn't show up. I wrote the company and got two responses. One response said it was a computer mistake and they reactivated my account, the second said I had violated the terms of use. I wrote back and asked what policy I violated so I could make sure what not to do again and if they would please reactivate my account. No response at all. Attempted multiple emails with no response. Also, they won't let you create a new account. Worst customer service I've ever experienced.",1

723,"they should’ve kept the letgo UI...: i’ve been a user of both apps for the longest. i loved the idea of both & have purchased from both, respectively. however, offer up has the absolute WORST radius detection in the world, they don’t purge through their listings as some are YEARS old & accounts have been disconnected by their owners. offer ups UI is actually REALLY terrible & the use of ads is so heavy, it’s no wonder so little people actually use the app. idc how many downloads you have. it’s the active users for me. letgo was overall better than offerup which is probably more people listed on there than here. when the two merged, it just made absolute sense, like why didn’t they do that years ago? but now i see why. 

developers: keep the letgo UI, purge through listings that are over 8 mo. to a year old (the oldest listing i’ve seen was posted 5 years ago) & fix the radius detection. i put in a 30 mile radius & get things in a different state smh.",1
724,"Lots of scammers: Offer up as a great app if your only intent is to purchase items. As a seller though you have to deal with people trying to scam you. Minutes after an item is posted I will have up to five people sending me the exact same message asking me for my phone number so they can verify that I am real with a six digit pin. Other times they have asked me to pay me through PayPal when you can purchase items directly through the app, or they’ll ask you to contact him through Facebook or email even though OfferUp has a great communication system Inter grated on the app itself. This is all possible since very little verification is required to create an account, people just create a new email every time their account is closed. I have sold a lot of things to legitimate people on OfferUp, but having to deal with scammers on a daily basis is very time consuming.",2
725,"Flaky sellers/ buyers: The app itself is alright and seems to function well.. but don’t even bother looking for anything to buy  unless you can pick it up that second. Can’t tell you how many times I can’t pick something up until the next day, then they sell it to someone else even though we had already made an agreement. The level of frustration involved with this app is infuriating. If they made it so you can “lock” in your spot by paying on the app or some other type of system... It would make it a lot easier. But frankly, it can be a huge time waster to find things and agree on a price only to be backstabbed. Maybe 1/5 things I make an agreement with I actually end up meeting with them and purchasing. Very frustrating to deal with the people on it but I have found a few good deals.",3
726,"The world’s most annoying humans all on one app: The humans this app attracts are honestly just the worst. This app is way more sketchy than Craigslist. It’s just filled with scammers and trolls. People offended if you make an offer they don’t like. Trolls who are out to rip your offering to pieces. And zero tools for sellers to be protected - you can’t just block someone, you have to go through an entire reporting process (which is just a black hole and no one ever addresses the issue) - and there is no policy in place if you sell to a buyer who happens to scam you (which happens all the time. eBay case in point). We tried to sell a camera on here and the dude who wanted to purchase it organized our meet up so it coincided with another seller meet up to pit us against one another. The other seller was so clearly selling cheap knockoffs and couldn’t even answer questions about the product for sale. One of countless examples. I am not going to use this app anymore.",1

728,"Garbage: I have made sure to reach out on every platform I can think of to write about this app. I’ve been nothing but disappointed with every transaction I have attempted to make. Completely frustrating dealing with potential buyers, and I think a survey should be required before allowing people to download the app. Constant battle with people trying to bargain with items already at a discounted price, atleast for me. I also don’t appreciate the fact that there isn’t a security deposit on items sold, you purchase OfferUp shipping labels and they get delivered within 2 days half way across the country to the buyer, but then the seller has to wait up to a week to acquire the money the item was purchased with? That’s not a fair trade in my eyes, not too mention their insanely overpriced “fees” for selling an item that 9/10 times you are selling at a reduced price already. I will be deleting ASAP.

PSA: Stick to craigslist, OfferUp isn’t worth the hassle.",1
729,"The ads have gotten very obtrusive.: This app used to be a lot more user friendly, but they’ve really gone all-in on spamming you with ads.

If you search for an item, expect to see a dozen ads for that item slipped in with legitimate results. You’ll probably click one by mistake. Cha-ching!

And, even more egregiously, your message inbox is going to be packed with a bunch of fake non-messages that look like messages so you’ll click them, but they’re really ads. And they’re not at the bottom where an ad should be, but sneakily slipped between legitimate results. And since you’re going to be jumping in and out of multiple messages if you’re hot after a certain item, you’re guaranteed to click one, which will hijack you and drag you into Safari to look at another ad. It’s a deceptive and scummy practice. Shame on OfferUp. 

Used to, I couldn’t find anything to complain about. It worked well. But now, I find myself unintentionally clicking an ad almost every time I use the app and it’s gotten to the point of being extremely frustrating and user-hostile. Why use their app if the developers have such little respect for you? This is hardly ever my first stop when shopping for used items anymore, but it used to be the first place I would check. 

Use at your own risk.",2
730,"I like the legitimacy: There is a review for the seller. If you would buy from them again. You can say if you sold somewhere else not offer up. The only thing I don't like is too many people don't edit their ad to say sold and items show up that are a year or 2 old after posting(and no seller contact). I've reported a few but haven't seen anything happen. Ads are still there with sellers not responding.

Updated issue: seller title with no description for a game said blackops 2 and advanced warfare.  Son wanted black ops 2 so I purchased for $10 and $5 shipping. When I received the item the game disc wasn’t blackops 2 (the other was correct) it was cod ghost.  Seller responded with disc was pictured in last pic.  That was terribly misleading.  That stuff is normally illegal but offer up...they’ll refund me $8. I will lose $7 in the process. Never shipping again. Only dealing with someone in person.",2
731,"Not as good as it used to be: I do a lot of buying and selling on several different apps. Offer Up used to be my go to when it first started but it only progressed downhill. 

Cons: Fees are high for sellers who receive payments through the app, shipping used to be very simple but now is “not available” for any of my items regardless of category, several lost sales due to glitches, subpar posting review criteria gets postings deleted, the app confuses numbers in the item descriptions as phone numbers and deletes necessary information.

Pros: easy to use as a buyer or seller, rarely do you see any scam posts or receive messages from scammers, you can almost always find what you’re looking for when the app is working properly, easy transaction process through the app as a buyer.",3
732,"No one to talk to: After posting a legitimate item, my item got removed and the it send me a message that said “if you think this is a mistake, repost it again.”  After I reposted it my account was closed and no one has been able to help me, they just allow their computer to make these kind of automated decisions.  I could even send in the item that I post it for sale so that they could see that there was nothing illegal with the item but no one from their team is available to look into this situation.  I also was supposed to get a month trial and then it charged the subscription right after I received a message that there was already an existing account.  This is continuing to be charged even after they shut down my account for no reason at all.  All I want to do is prove to them that the item was a legitimate item and hope to get my account reinstated.",1
733,"Suggested improvements to improve experience: The app is good in the sense that it basically does what you need; lets you look at stuff for sale and reach people to sell to. That being said, there are very basic tweaks that could improve the UI and user experience. 

For starters, the sort doesn’t work. Never has. Does anyone QA the app before pushing to prod? One listing might be from 2 hours ago the next from 10 days and the one after that 5 days. What is that? Please fix the sort and actually put the listings in chronological order. The feature is there but it doesn’t work. It still scrambles the listings. This matters because older listings are less likely to be active. 

Another useful implementation would be to upgrade the search function. Currently if you search “table cloth -red”, instead of removing listings for red table cloths, you get only red table cloths. This is counter intuitive and does not allow users to fine tune their searches.

Lastly, there are unfortunately users in many areas that spam listings and businesses and otherwise clutter search results. Users need the ability to block users so ALL their posts are automatically hidden.",3
734,"Customer Support is useless: For years, I always had a good experience with buying and selling my stuff on multiple platforms, until my most recent transaction on OfferUp. The buyer bought my item in near perfect condition, and then proceeds to file for a refund after she clearly wore it (by the obvious strong perfume still lingering when I received the item back along with multiple stains left) & OfferUp authorized it. My item is now frankly disgusting and unsellable. I reached out to their customer service and was basically told that they do not care, they’re not doing anything about this transaction or the seller as it is complete on their end and they don’t have a seller protection in place. I will be filing a police report on the buyer but I hope anyone using this app is aware of this situation. This is the worse customer support I have ever received and I hope no one else has to experience this.",1
735,Fix this please: I rather have letgo by itself instead of OfferUp being with letgo. It’s much more simple because letgo is a really simple and easy app to use for buying and selling but when it comes to offer up everything is just a mess for example if a person post a listing on OfferUp the listing can stay there for up to a year even though the person is no longer using the app and it’s not just one or two listings it’s almost all of them. There should be a date where the listing expires within a month and the person who post the listing has choice to Renew the listing or mark it as sold or delete the listing it would make much easier for the person looking for something to buy so they only see listings that are ACTUALLY available (‼️thank you please fix would make app 10x better ‼️),3
736,"Bad experience *PLEASE READ*: If you are choosing to use this app ONLY purchase through Offer Up! I have had two bad experiences where sellers mentioned that Offer Up takes out too many fees so they rather use PayPal/ Cash App. Foolishly I believed them and made one transaction with both payment methods using two different sellers. Even one seller (Named: DIRECT SALES) text me videos and images of previous sales they made and images and videos of the item. Both sellers never sent my items so I had to file a dispute for both parties. One seller stopped answering my calls and the other deleted their account a day later. I am choosing to delete my account with them, I’d rather use amazon/EBay. So as far as meeting in person I definitely wouldn’t trust it, if these individuals will do this not being seen it worries me what they will do in person to get your money and not sale an item. Just please be cautious!",1
737,"Disappointing: I have used offerup 5 years selling my art sculptures as a means of making ends meet.  It was working great getting me through some tough times until suddenly one of my customers that contacted me through offer up send directly to my home to see why my account was gone. Then it hit me why I was no longer receiving inquiries for the art that makes the ends meet. To my surprise I can no longer log on and I never received an email,text or phone call from offer up. They just grave cut me off. I never violated the terms of service. I always sold my art without incident and received great reviews. Now I’m waiting for a response from offer up after trying repeatedly to get an answer, meanwhile I’m using Craigslist, letgo and Facebook marketplace to try get my art out there.  A word of advice do not depend on offer up as your first source of offering something up. Any time they want.  They will take you out without notice.",1
738,WORST APP TO SELL THINGS. NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP.: I have no problems listing the product. Just the whole process after you receive payment is tedious. First they make you “guess the items weight” for the purpose to making more money off your item. They say it’s for the shipping label but I could’ve sent out the package for cheaper! ($5 for pre paid shipping label) And to make things even worse they took a $9 fee off my $80 listing. Not only did I have to wait for the buyer to receive and review the item for 2 days (which is think is stupid! I post bunch of pictures of the condition for each item VERY CLEARLY) I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 4-5 DAYS FOR MONEY TO BE DEPOSITED. so in total I have to wait roughly 2 weeks for my money to be transferred in my bank account after sending out the item. Never using this app to sell things again. Strictly sticking to eBay or Facebook market place. AND I SUGGEST USING PAYPAL IF YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY TRANSACTIONS ON THIS APP. Just so you don’t get ripped off.,1
739,"Got chewed out by support: I wish I did not have to write a bad review but the Rules and Policy police were rude about deleting a post I made where I had lowered the price by $10 but in the body of the description I had not corrected the price from $90 to $80 and I know why. I corrected it twice in the body of the description and looked at it but my internet connection was spotty where we were visiting. I had to correct the price in the header price twice also. This is all just typical for a new member to OfferUp in adjusting to a new App but then I got news that my posting removed and a non detailed message that I need to follow the Rules and Policies. That is fine but I had to ask what the issue was. Of course, I was ready to fix the issue once I realized there was a $10 discrepancy in the body of the text. I have used Craigslist for years and deleted OfferUp because I felt no support and got no interest because we are in the SF Bay Area and nobody uses it.",1

We searched OfferUp for a desk. Originally, we thought we wanted something modern. Then it hit us, our house needed a vintage desk to add warmth in the midst of all the new upgrades. We changed our search and found a few options almost immediately. In the end, we chose a beautiful vintage desk that gave our home office the feel it needed. And for only $40! We ended up giving the family a few bucks extra because it was a jigsaw to fit it into our Honda Civic. And they were kind enough to help us get it in the car. LOL",5

Now my account is not showing offers, I really don’t care, but what a waste of time, trying to contact tech support, asking myself what happened, but the only thing I can do right now is delete the app from my phone and leave my bad experience with this review. STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP, if later you reach many good reviews selling stuff and later you got banned there is no way to get your account back to business and it is not fear.

I knew about their two day policy about getting a refund, I missed the deadline because the seller shipped the item several days later than they promised and when it actually arrived I was out of town. When I got back and saw it I immediately tried to reach out to the seller but he deleted his page so I couldn’t contact them. I contacted offer up about the issue and they said that because the two days were up they couldn’t do anything.

I was sending a message about computer parts. Now I can’t communicate with anybody via messages. 

I’d say roughly 1/10 posts (especially vehicles and RVs) are scams. You can tell because it’s from a brand new account, the price is a fraction of the realistic market value, the content is typically copied from another post, they want you to email them instead of going through the app. See below for an example.

On the negative side I have reported over 100 obvious scams that can easily be identified by an extremely low asking price and the poster wants to continue the purchase on Gmail.  These posts are seldom, if ever,  removed and I have reduced my time on the site because of the lack of attention regarding removing these posts as they are redundant and never seem to be removed and take up a slot where a real seller could have an item in that block that a buyer might actually be interested in purchasing,",4

The way this goes is first message is it available second message is will you do this amount and it’s always almost half of what you are asking. Piece of advise go over what you are selling multiple times in your description and post as many pictures as possible including places that show prices. Tried to sell an Apple Watch cellular series 4 with an extra cable, the box, all the bands that came with it and a charging stand that would basically stand the watch on its side. Asked for 200 when most places sell it for 280 used. 15 people messaged me and every single person asked if I would take a lesser amount one starting with 100 and I didn’t reply so a week later offered 110.

Other than that I find the site very helpful in finding items that I don’t want to pay full price for because I’m only going to use them once or twice.

How can you be “really interested” all with names with certain initials and who just joined during the month you post items. All working used is the same and now they have started adding fake pictures. 

The coding and algorithms need to change and spot these people so they are stopped from making accounts. The amount of times I have reported and blocked people is more then I can count. This app should make people verify the account using 3 different approaches.",3

Now, of course, the two have merged so I have to use the offerup app. Honestly, I really don’t like this app. The idea of shipping is cool, but the ui of letgo was so much easier to use. Not to mention, there was no way to “merge” the accounts, so I lost my listed items and my messages about items I was interested in. Super disappointed in the decision to use the offerup interface instead of the letgo interface. Letgo was more popular in my area it feels, too, so it’s like I lost the local marketplace in the switch. Everything I find listed where I am now is from months or years ago. I know it’s a lot to ask for a simpler interface, but I really believe that’ll make the app more successful.",2
749,"Don’t waste your time!!!!!!: I enjoyed the OfferUp app for 6 months. Had 30 sells with all 5 star reviews. Never had a complaint and possessed a fully verified account with a face picture, linked Facebook, ID verification and phone verification. Then a few months go by and nothing sold. I would message people to buy stuff or give offers and never got a response. Created another account with the same result. After doing research this is extremely common. They shadow ban users for no reason. Instead of telling you your banned they shadow ban you and allow you to waist hours upon hours of your time on there app. That’s uncalled for and sinister quite frankly. When I contacted them they informed me nothing was wrong with my account! Could be a great app but unfortunately it’s run by people who get there nuts off on messing with people. Hopefully they get a change in management or another app comes out. I despise this app and hope they go bankrupt!!!!",1
750,"Sell your stuff in offer up!: I love offer up. I have sold a few things and so far so good. People show up and do pay what ever you negotiate. At first, I was a bit scared since you hear crazy stories on the news sometimes. As long as you go to a local place with cameras like a Wa Wa gas station, Walmart or Home Depot people know there are cameras and are less likely to jack you. Lol. Anyway, what I don’t like is how you set a price and people automatically low ball you and want more than half off. Or how some people sell their stuff for the same price they got it for. That’s not cool but the app itself is awesome and notifies you immediately. I love to hear the “cha ching “ notifications. Anyway, be careful but have fun using the app.",5
751,"Unimpressed overall: Ive been a user for years, having made this company a lot of money between sitting through their ads and paying their selling fees and I have seen very little improvement on very basic issues. Their app is still glitchy and slow, and if you want to use the computer instead, you are out of luck because they removed the ability to post or edit listings on desktop a while ago. (An absolutely useless and fruitless decision, from my perspective.) 
You cannot delete any listings, and the messaging system is fraught with bugs. Overall I dislike having to use this app so much and can’t wait for something better to take it over if they cannot address these problems that have persisted for years.",3
752,OFFER UP SUPPORT!: I am so upset I made a purchase on offer up and got scammed used my 2 day purchase protection and was told to wait while offer up reviews my claim and that I would get an email. I waited a week an a half never received an email from them or anything i contacted offer up support about it and was told that I failed to respond to the email and send proof when I never received any email from OfferUp! And there’s no way to email or call offer up only though the app with there OfferUp support which is so annoying they take like 30 min to respond and you don’t get any notifications when they do so if you got busy with something else and check later they already replied and you missed your chance to talk to them bc they will just leave after 5 mins which is sooooo frustrating and now out $600 bucks and still trying to figure out what to do!,1
753,"Strong Marketplace, Crappy Notifications: I’ve bought and sold a lot of items on OfferUp and the volume of users, messaging, and user rating system is effective. The search result notifications are pretty bad though. I regularly get daily notifications on my saved searches that say there are 20 items matching my search and there are either no new items or there is one old item that has been relisted. I reported this via a case a couple months back and they admitted that it’s a bug but it hasn’t been fixed. This is a core piece of functionality that craigslist, ebay, et al do well and the bug makes it useless. It’s frustrating but doesn’t overshadow the rest of the marketplace experience to warrant 1 or 2 stars, it just makes me prefer C-list over OU.",3
754,"Why do you need access to devices on my network?: I opened up the app the other day and it asked me for permission to connect with other devices on my network. We already share so much of our private info with this app, why would they need access to our networked devices? With the already sucky user experience and massive amount of ads, I’m about ready to delete it.

Aug 2023 - I hate endless scroll, and trying to bloat the search and filtering with duplicate posts is really annoying. I don’t have time to be on your app all day. 

Also the ads are not only annoying, the full size ads will take up the entire screen where you’re supposed to click a small x to get out. Sometimes there will never be an x, and the only way to remove the ad is to close the app. At this point, I just close it and move on with my day rather than opening the app back up.",1
755,"Zero buyer protections and awful customer service: Offer Up is allowing sellers of counterfeit items to to run rampant because they don’t have policies in place protecting buyers beyond a 2 day inspection period. The problem is that many buyers are not professionals with the ability to accurately spot a counterfeit item. Employing such a professional often takes weeks, if not months. But Offer Up does not care about anything beyond 2 days upon receipt. 

To add insult to injury, their customer service department is callous and hides behind this 2 day inspection period without caring for their buyers at all. The only thing they suggest is to contact the authorities. Which is also a problem considering they do not aid in directing a buyer to the correct authorities. 

So, sellers, feel free to bilk buyers any way you can, because if the buyer doesn’t spot a counterfeit item after two days, you’re home free.",1
756,"Delete: So I’ve been using this app for about two years, getting rid of anything I don’t use anymore. The biggest thing that bothers me is the fact that the offerup does not allow u to delete post that haven’t sold, doesn’t allow u to removed a item from the sold section when it was placed by accident. They recently introduced jobs but most people already have them or they use other websites, instead of jobs y not allow people to rehome pets? Maybe connect them to local shelters. Maybe introduce the same function that Facebook has where after a set amount of time u have to relist item with a new price. Overall OfferUp has better potential than even Craigslist but they are doing a horrible job in making the app way better.",3
757,"Stuff mostly good, app is trash: While of course the people posting on here for the most part are fine, that's despite a lot of problems in the app. It's impossible to only turn on notifications for messages and even when promotional notifications are turned off, they still come through. It has some of the most aggressive personal data skimming I've ever seen. It's pretty difficult to update your location if you move in the app so listings can show as a bit off. Good luck getting people to see your item if they're not looking for that exact thing or you do the also pretty awful ""promoted posts"" thing. The interface to view posts is slightly better than when it was let go, but not by much. This type of app has been around for nearly a decade now, it shouldn't be hard to do better with the amount of ad revenue they must be raking in.",1
758,"In my experience, it's a waste of time: I won't pretend that my experience is everyone's experience with the app, so take what I say with a potential grain of salt. I downloaded it looking to by a used camera. It seems like hardly any of the sellers were still active on the app. I purchased one but the person isn't active anymore it seems so that has tied up money. I tried purchasing another camera from someone else and he decided to cancel the transaction due to information requested  by the app from the seller and so that has more of my money tied up. All the while the ONLY way you can reach customer service is via email which takes 2-3 business days apparently. Once I am refunded for both items, I'm deleting my account and uninstalling the app. I'm not sure how unique my experience is, but this has been way more of a hassle than it has been helpful by far.",1
759,"Random ban: Love this app but recently got shadow banned can’t message people about items i am intrested says “ delivered” but they actually do not recieve the message, items that i list for sell dont appear for other people i have wasted 10$ trying to post two of my vehicles i had no idea i was shadow banned i did nothing wrong i have 5 star ratings and have sold alot of stuff over the years with no issues till now! I am very frustrated since this is my go to app to purchase items i dont want to pay full price for I’ve tried contacting offerup support team with no response…. Why make such a wonderful app but not help consumers when they need help? If my problem gets resolved i will be happy again! Till then i am very disappointed, also tried making another account same issue as if i have been banned completely for no reason! Help me offerup team make this right!",1
760,"Wish you could select a buyer for items they didn’t inquire about: I enjoyed using the app to basically have an estate sale at my dads house.  I had offer up users that came over to look at one item but bought several others.  When it came time to remove the item the only choices were sold to another user who might have made an inquiry or sold somewhere else.  I understand if that would be hard to do since you could possibly be rating someone who didn’t inquire about an item and it could be away to harass someone.  Maybe just add a toggle in the feature that says “sold to offer up user” or something, just to help you track your data.",5
761,"Doesn’t hold users accountable: The other day, someone who had purchased a piece of furniture from me: (1) showed up at my house at 10:30 pm to pick it up; 2) failed to bring proper transportation; (3) and decided she no longer wanted the heavy item after I spent 30 minutes helping her carry it to her vehicle, it got scratched because she couldn’t hold up her end, and we had no way of getting it back into the house. I refunded her money, left the item on the side of the road as trash, and assumed Offer Up would take steps to prevent her from doing this to other people. Instead: I couldn’t write a review, my one star “rating” of her didn’t affect her score, and, when I wrote to Offer Up, they said only that they’d “note” that this happened. In short, don’t expect this app to protect you in any way or to be able to test other users any more than you would a stranger on Craigslist.",1
762,Improvement suggestion: The curation of relevant posts for local pickups is getting ruined by a deluge of “private sellers” that are actually local outlet businesses posting and reposing too much and too often. The results when searching broad categories like furniture are too cluttered similar to Craigslist like when a local mattress store posts 300 of their items and so all I’m seeing is overpriced mattresses until I scroll way down. Would be nice to have a filter/hide option for a user to remove all the posts from any seller accounts they're not interested in buying from to stop cluttering their results. Maybe also vet “private sellers” better and stop letting local businesses abuse your platform that’s meant for the reseller market with free advertising for themselves,3
763,"What a mess: This app could be great, but its the small things that hold it back, and cause big headaches. Stop defaulting the distance to 30 miles. 30 miles is NOT LOCAL, no one is using offerup to travel 30 miles for a 5$ ps3 controller. The distance defaults to 30 even after setting your location. Even after setting your distance, it will default back to 30 after every single new search. This is the single most frustrating thing about the app, and i wont give higher than 1 star until we can save our preferred setting without it changing every single search.

They added TOO many ads, ads are getting more and more overwhelming. There should be 15 listing tiles at any given point, however, ads take up 2 tiles, and when there are 5 ads on one screen, that leaves just 5 legitimate listings per screen. Its awful. Im fine with ads, but this is a disgusting amount.",1
764,"Reporting To FTC: I listed a rifle scope. The listening was promptly removed because of “safety concerns”. OK, fine. Then why are other rifle scope listings still up? Some of them for months. Wont be using this useless garbage app.

Update: Customer Service replied with a prefab response sent out automatically. It basically deflected the responsibility onto me and told me to report “Prohibited” posts…??? How is it that my post for a scope was removed immediately and other posts for actual fire arms are still up after weeks?! Scopes don’t fire anything yet they’re a “safety concern”? I’m trying to recoup after a serious financial hit from covid. They wanna play games with my wallet then they’ll pay the consequences. They better get some folks to their computer screens and start screening those posts that are already up and stop wasting my time. They’ve been reported to the FTC for unfair business practices and fraud. Have a nice day!",1
765,"Experiencing Same Issue as other Reviewers: Same issue, to where I can no longer send messages to sellers, along with my post I submit for items I am trying to sale are not actually submitted, and are not posted. Horrible, no communication from customer service on how to fix. Have already tried updating the app, deleting and re-installing. Nothing.
I now just have a useless account that I am unable to use. Reading others responses i’m seeing this might be due to being banned from using the App? Although I have 40+ good ratings,do not post prohibited content, or re-post. Would have been nice to receive some sort of warning or notification, “thanks” offer up! Ridiculous.",5
766,"Deleted my  post for no reason: I was selling a paintball Gun and at the time I didn’t know it wasn’t allowed and they took it down. I tried again and it lasted for about a day or two and during that time I also decided to sell my keyboard and mouse. They caught me and instead of deleting that post they deleted all my post that I had for sell. I don’t see the big dealing of selling a damm paintball gun, also there are many other people that sell their paintball gun and they don’t get caught, many of them show that their post has been up for more than a few weeks and they still don’t get caught. I have tried to repost my keyboard and mouse at least and in 5 min it too!!! Deleted!!!. So I tried again and every time I tried it would says Error. I do like the idea of the app but to be honest it not good and don’t recommend. Letgo is another app that’s the same and there you can sell paintball guns and they not that strict. I recommend Letgo.",1
767,"Staff don’t follow through with complaints: In June 2018, I got burned $1500 for 4 stair railings by a guy who posted on OfferUp who lived 1 hour away. 
 I took screen shots of there active account (4) OfferUp post ( Pedro daughter established) of the same information so they can get more business from viewers . 
 It was Metal stair railing posts that his daughter created for him and he works and does stair railings on the side. They live in the California Central Valley.
He (Pablo) came to my house and measured (two )three steps stairs where I needed stair railings. I hired him to do 4 stair railings $1500 and he completed one railing and installed it. He said he needed more money to finish the other three railings so I paid him. 
I would call him and he would not answer or he would tell me a date and never show. He finally stop answering my calls. Never heard from him again. I did two complaints with OfferUp and only got a robó email back and never heard back by OfferUp .  Offer up is only good to sell items locally where people go pick up at a local location. I learned a $1500 dollar lesson. Never buy out of state or far away from your home.
I buy only in my town after I seen the items. I sell only if the person comes to my house and physically sees the item.
OfferUp has disappointed me.

768,Never received funds: Sold an item on offer up about a month ago customer received item i never received funds. Offer up canceled my sale after 6 days of “no tracking info” from post office even though i shipped the item the next day! I messaged the customer when usps stated it was delivered to check if she received the item she confirmed i asked the customer if the funds were back in her account she said they were and she was confused as well as i was. I contacted offer 8/20 about this they apologized and said my funds would be back in my account within about 10 days still no funds i messaged offer up again very upset they sent me the same message back! Looks like I’m out of $40 and the product i would recommend any shipping with this app one they take a cut two you may not ever get your money for what you sell best bet if using this just meet local so they can’t take your money! Happy selling! ~Mandy <3,1
769,"Why do I only have the option to place on hold using a credit card?: This app was my FAVORITE selling app, but I recently noticed less and less sales. When my daughter opened an account for herself, she went to my page just to see the items I was selling to get a feel for how to post things. Then we noticed that you no longer have the option of paying with a card or cash. It’s strictly credit card use and I think that’s ridiculous. Many of my buyers buy things from me for the garage sale low prices I have and if you know anything about garage sale people, they only carry cash. Also, not everyone wants to give their credit card numbers to another app that could potentially be hacked into. This was a bad update OfferUp and I hope you have had enough complaints to change things back. When people would ask me where I post items I was always glad to recommend OfferUp, but not anymore. Sorry",1
770,Ehhh...: Its a good app but theres a lot of “bots” people who just make offers but never show or actually buy anything. A lot of people who message you such a low price that its almost like a slap in the face. And then when you tell them no thanks or no way they start mocking you and disrespecting. Even had people say ok where can we meet and never show up.. its pathetic.. another big problem is if you’re selling like a car in order to post it more than 3 times you have to pay 4.99.... which is stupid as hell.. why can you post everything else a million times a month but once you trying to sell something with more value do you have to pay.. isnt it a free app... anyways. Could be a great app but too many kids seems like I constantly have people writing me and never show up or always waste my time having dumb conversations about me dropping the price,2
771,"Offer Up App: Overall it’s a useful app to sell and buy whatever locally or from a far, but I’d like more detailed protocols for screening people because the majority of messages I’ve ever received are very inappropriate. Yes. You can block a person, but that doesn’t stop them from creating a new account to continue to harass me. It’s a detail that should be reflected more over. Overall I’m still on the app. I like the customization of products from sellers I can easily communicate with. The shipping on offer up is also ridiculous, but there’s other ways of being able to purchase products, just be careful the person is actually real.",5
772,"Great app, horrible messaging system: This is a great app to use, it is easy to understand and fast to navigate, the customer service is also great. The biggest problem is is the frustrating message system which stops working often making me unable to send any messages as it will just give an error message, the website will also instantly delete any new message I send.

While customer service have given me some advice like restating the phone, reinstalling the app, and logging out and logging back in, these tips no longer work and the only way this get fixed is when I directly contact the company on Facebook messages. I am currently dealing with my fifth error for the month I been using the app and it is absolutely frustrating. Please check the messaging system. Thank you.",3
773,"Worst Customer Support!!: The wait time is ridiculous! I can't get anyone! Is Jake the only live support available? Who doesn't answer immediately and after you can't wait anymore sends you a message that the chat is closed? Their buyer protection is absurd. They don't do anything to help! You are on your own. I have to deal with USPS on my own. Never buy from outside your area! It is so hard to get a refund! They are deceptive! My item never arrived! It's been 28 days! Their customer support is not reliable and available! They don't help! I paid $167!!! They even sent an email that if I don't send a copy of the pictures within 24 hours the claim is void. How can I send a picture when I have not received the order? Customer support is garbage!

774,"Disappointing: Rare to receive responses from ppl selling items, many items overpriced or trash (literally- ppl who are trying g to avoid taking items to the dump). New “feature” of inbox makes it look like you’ve received a response from a seller only to find out you’re being targeted by marketing of new items from companies or sites outside of the app and not spam but paid ads sanctioned by OfferUp.  Not much better when trying to sell items. Was able to offload a couple very inexpensive items but had to sort through messages like “is this still available” and left hanging never hearing back from ppl after providing add’l details. Must be verrrry patient when using this app. I reinstated the app to give it another go but looks like it’s not getting g any better and I’ll be saying my final farewell soon.",2

776,Account banned for no reason: This app started out great. Sold a couple things without issue.  Received positive reviews from buyers. Did not have any duplicate postings.  Then I tried to list and sell a couple more items.  Haven't had any activity on my postings in over 6 months.  None of my items for sell show up when searched for.  No reply from OfferUp when contacted regarding this issue.  After doing some searching online this is a common practice by OfferUp to shadowban accounts for insufficient reasons such as posting too many items or frequent editing of your posting.  They don’t review individual account circumstances they just automatically turn you off so to speak without contacting your knowing.  This platform turned out to be garbage.  Save your time and use Nextdoor or something else with better customer relations and usability.  Zero stars if I could!,1
777,"Disappointed with the app - got locked out for no reason: I used the app for a couple of weeks to sell my stuff as I was moving. It was great at first. But then later when I made agreement with multiple buyer for my various items, the app stopped my communications with them and I couldn’t communicate with those to pick up my items. The app was still showing that my messages were delivered, but none of them were shown “seen”. I got suspicious and sent a message to a fired. Proved the theory right that the app never sent my messages any more. Very weird cause I have a 5-star rating on my profile and even use the Promote Plus feature. The app is horrible because it didn’t indicate that I was locked/banned/whatever. My items were not visible to anyone either. Truly disappointed with the app as it wasted so much time for me. Facebook Marketplace has served me way better.",1
778,"New updates = New Problems: I’ve been using Offer Up for years now and loved it. But at some point the updates made it so that I can pick my location and choose local but I can’t scroll far enough to narrow down the area to 5 or 10 miles away. Anyone in California will tell you, 30 miles could take 2 hours so you really need to be able to narrow it down. I’m using an iPhone and as I said, did not have this problem until the last update or two. I looked at all the FAQs and couldn’t find anything about it. Additionally, having the amounts appear on the phone app would be so helpful without having to click into the item. Still use it and still happy to buy and sell and give away stuff but wish it was better.",3
779,"Amazing app, just needs details..: It's such a great app to buy and sell almost anything you want. It just has so many ads and people wanting to commit fraud to scam people for money. Also when i save something, i hate that i have to find that certain item i saved through all the others instead of being in the top of the list like it used to a while back. I have gotten scammed a couple of times and actually lost thousands of dollars due to it. There should be regulations for safety of others where if they are selling a certain item they must be verified. Such items could be cars, jewelry, something of much value. Then again those are just my key points. Great app though!",4
780,"Super user friendly!: I’ve always been a bit wary of apps and sites used to buy, sell, and trade items, but as of now I’ve had absolutely no issues with feeling unsafe or anything while purchasing or selling anything. The only semi-negative thing I will say is there seems to be some people on the app that are attempting to use it as a dating app 😂 I have had multiple occasions where someone will show interest in an item I have for sale only for their next message to me to be something super creepy, such as “Come cuddle, I swear I’m not a rapist). This is obviously at no fault of OfferUp, I just wish there were a way to weed out the weirdos who seem to think OfferUp is Tinder. Other than that, awesome app!",5
781,"Easy fix for a 5 star review: I hope you guys read and pay attention to feedback for your app because it really is a good app, one of the best IMO. A huge problem with fake accounts and scammers though. Correct me if I’m wrong, but there are no filters to list only TruYou members. If there was a filter that you could apply to only show listings from certified or even more reputable sources, it would take a LOT of the hassle out of finding something like a ps5, Xbox series X/S, Nintendo switch etc. especially considering most of your traffic or at least a good chunk of it is due to people trying to find those products. Although this alone doesn’t directly confront scammers, it indirectly does and that will make a positive impact on both the certified members and the customers",3

With no place to pay that fee no instructions how to pay it, no amount that the fee is, no clear place where a person addresses this issue. Poor and crummy worthy of reporting the app to Oregon for business practices that might be legal elsewhere , but not in Oregon when your model is that it’s a free app to buy and sell stuff that’s exactly what it should be if there’s a fee that should be stated clearly for the consumer and Upfront  Hidden fees after the fact that aren’t stated clearly aren’t legal in our state.

So they STOLE THE MONEY FOR THE ITEM. Yes, you read that correctly. MY ITEM I SOLD and they STOLE THE ENTIRE PROFIT. A class C misdeamnor. What’s worse?

Please change it so it will at least remember the new address you put in for shipping, it’s been 5months since I last shipped anything and last week I ordered something and it still has my address from a year and a half ago so naturally I forgot to double check and now I have to do the walk of shame to my old house to get my freaking package.

785,"This app is so frustrating without these features.: Here is what is needed to be done for this app so I can be more user friendly and more functional. I will switch to different platforms until these features are added. 

1- Add an option to filter out a seller from search results. There is one retailer in my area whose listing their entire inventory on your platform. There is no way to filter their listings out if I don’t like to go through them all. 

2- please add price tags to the thumbnail pictures of search results. Why do I have to click on the listing to see what the price is?

3- Irrelevant results show up. For example, when I search for iPhone 8 256 gb, I see all types of phone including the non apple ones just because they have 256 in their titles. You need to add more metadata for phone listing and make them mandatory to be filled by sellers. Then add advanced rearch option so that buyers can use it to look for what they exactly want. 

4- Add an search option to filter out  by time listed. I don’t want to see 2 years old listing which owners never updated after selling their items. I also would like to have the option to see today’s listing or this week’s listings and also have the option to apply more filter to after viewing this page. 

I hope this feedback wasn’t a waist of my time.",1
786,Nothing but internet trolls and spammers: I’ve used Offer up since it came out but lately it seems to be filled with nothing but scammers and internet trolls. Very sad because It was my go to app to sell and purchase used and new things. Seems now people just want to get info from you like where you live and claim they’re coming to buy an item and they never show up or you set up to meet in public place and they never show up. I’m not sure what the developers can even do about it because it’s not they’re fault by any means. I’m an honest person and keep my word and when I say I will be there I will be there! I do not understand why people are doing this to anyone and I’ve spoke to a lot of other folks offer up users and they say they have the same issues. Once upon a time I loved this app and I hope something can be done about these issues.,2
787,"DONT SHIP ITEMS!!: I’ve been with offer up for 6 years! Just recently when they implemented this shipping method, I wanted to give it a shot. So I posted an item, allowing it that it could be shipped. So when a buyer purchased a item on a Thursday, I had some hard time getting to post office due to medical reasons. I could not do it on time but a day after it was shipped. Long story short Offer up ended up sending money back to customer and I lost my item and never got paid for it. I spoke to them via email and there saying they can’t do anything even with proof that I shipped the item and that I never got the money. Defiantly recommend LetGo or Craigslist before selling something on here again!",5
788,"I loved it until.....: OfferUp was the fastest and easiest app to use for buy/selling until an update over a month ago created persistent errors. Since then updates made it completely unusable. Each time I log in I get the “logging in” message immediately followed by “logged out”. 

I have deleted and reinstalled numerous times, I shut down I hard resettled. I changed passwords all to no avail. BEST YEt, I contacted support, who will only reply that they appreciate your contact but no follow up or feedback AND, the best part, support will only acknowledge you if you spam them with numerous support emails in a short time. Otherwise, nothing. Going on 5 weeks and my account still can’t be accessed. No help from support. Google the issues and I am not alone!",4
789,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER: I am a sneaker reseller and mainly used Offer-up to make local trades or sales. 
However, they would shadow ban my account and then when I would contact them about the issue, they would go on to delete my account for “selling replicas” like??? 
I came to your support service for help and all I get is a deleted account without response for 2-3 days after each email. I would then create a new account because my account got deleted by their support team, then they would somehow track the account down and shadow ban me again whether that’s through ip tracking or some data storing they don’t have any right over, which made me repeat the process 3 times already. I even would verify my identity through TruYou, which they make you do before you can list any items for sale, and STILL would get deleted again. Absolutely atrocious support team.",1
790,"Commercial stores abusing app in order to advertise their commercial products: Stores, especially those selling kitchen appliances and air conditioners, flood a category and make it almost impossible to find local sellers. This greatly reduces the usability of the OfferUp app.  
The app would be much improved if OfferUp would find a way to flag or prevent these commercial vendors from doing this.  As it is, there is no way to contact an OfferUp admin to report (much less discuss) the matter.  Recently , for example, there were over 100 kitchen appliances advertised for a single store in Jacksonville, Florida.  It took me over an hour to find the 3 local sellers that WERE NOT the store, an effort that would have taken less than 10 minutes if these commercial sellers were not abusing the app.",3
791,Forced to submit my id: Why am I being forceful to joini truyou ...I even submitted   my id and it keeps saying that's it can't recognize it or it's unclear when I know it's very clearly with no blurr or glare..I think it's unfair to me and others people to force us to submit such personal information just to buy or sell items on a free app..and more un fair when my wife has been using the app for a few year's and has never been asked for her id..I feel as it flags random accounts for this ..unfortunately it doesn't make anyone feeling safe to submit such personal information due to the fact that thier are still people who dont have to submit thier id and are scamming other's..this will cause many people to stop using the app n turn somewhere else to sell n buy items..I will stop using thistle app as i am uncomfortable without this process and feel as if OfferUp is taking advantage of the user by randomly flagging accounts,1
792,"Horrible App and Customer Service: I only had the opportunity to use the app for a little less than two days, but in that time I learned just how awful it is. 

By far most of the sellers are listing their product for the incorrect price in order to draw people in, and many of them demand that potential buyers conduct the purchase outside of the app and through other, less secure, means. Any offer with the seller’s phone number in the description is a sure-fire scam. 

But the biggest knock against OfferUp is their customer service. I had just submitted an offer to someone, when I was flagged for review and then summarily banned from OfferUp with no warning or justification other than a vague response that I ‘violated the terms of use’. I immediately replied to the email, as suggested, to dispute it as I had not at all violated their terms. 

The only response I got was a rewording of their original email, with absolutely no further explanation as to why my account was suspended. Though they did add to their reasoning that I had violated posting rules. I find this incredibly hard to believe, given I had not made a single post. 

Any other email I have sent them has been met with silence. 

TL;DR 
If you’re looking for an app to buy and sell stuff, keep on looking. This one isn’t it and you’re likely to be randomly banned.",1
793,"So many ads: The app is decent. The service it provides is as well. I had to take away one star for all the ads when searching through items. Then I had to take away another star because it’s so many ads. For example say you search for trucks. It will pull up trucks and many auto parts available on the site when I just wanted to look at trucks. What is frustrating is while scrolling the majority of the trucks are actually just ads. 
    Another feature I do not like is that you can not scroll from post to post. You must back out the post then choose another one. The back button is easily missed which cause the app to full screen the photo. This just makes browsing the app less functional and time consuming in ways it doesn’t need to be.",3
794,"Terminated for no Reason: After I posted my first item on offer up, I used another computer to see what it looks like when someone else would see it except it wasn’t there.  To get this straight, only I 
was able to view my listing.  I contacted customer support (which is through twitter and not on their website), and they asked for more details and all, and then they assured they would look into my issue further.  Later that day though, they emailed me saying that my account got removed for violating community guidelines, and I wasn’t allowed to make another account. I asked them what guidelines I violated and they replied that the decision is final and couldn’t be appealed with no answer to what community guidelines I had violated.  

I don’t see how Offerup can last very long with this poor technology and bad customer service.  Until they step it up, I would recommend a different app for buying and selling stuff.",1
795,"Easy to use but now flooded with advertisements: OfferUp was great to start, not their greed for money has soured the experience. Originally, OfferUp made buying and selling easy to use by phone, compared to Craigslist. However, in recent years, they have done 2 things that have made the experience DIFFICULT and UNENJOYABLE. One, they have flooded the search with ads for similar things you have looked at. This makes it difficult for me to quickly skim for items I want locally. I am using OfferUp to find things near me, not to buy things online. Second, they have ‘false’ alerts on the app icon, which makes it seems like I have unread messages but really they are just reminding you of your past searches. This makes it difficult to know when you received a message from a potential buyer or seller vs. just more advertisements. Because of this, I’m out.",2
796,Good app but one big flaw…: I like OfferUp otherwise but there is one big flaw in it. When you go to the inbox and go to one the message threads there is no way to go back to the Home Screen and continue your search. The only way back is the back arrow. But if you have gone to several message threads and messaged people you would have to click the arrow button so many times to get back to Home Screen that it feels such a waste of time. Often I would just clear the app all together and open it up again to get to the Home Screen faster. It puzzles me that there’s not even a drop down bar where you could choose Home to get back to the search page.,4
797,"Let go with so much better: Once OfferUp took over or merged, whatever they did, I believe took over for let go. This app completely went downhill exponentially. In my opinion for the many years, I’ve been on here. It seems to me like they suppress you actually getting qualitative messages unless you pay to advertise, whereas let go was not like that. The only people you get to reach out to you or tire kickers that want something basically for free not even worth the time to go meet the individual. Not to mention the majority of the time they never follow through with a time to meet up gotten to the point where I’m probably just going to delete this app as a whole as it is basically just a waste of time. and for the love of God, stop listening to my conversations when the app isn’t open and then sending me products I might be interested in.",1
798,"Buggy and needs improvement: The app has issues when trying to type in the the search bar. Very often will it duplicate the script written, or dictated, and mess up the search. ”Search items for sale” also displays while typing in the search bar which obscures the words being typed. 

It would be great to have certain settings saved as a default option. Such as the shipping or pickup. That way it doesn’t automatically load both together. 

The free section should have set parameters and more oversight ability to reduce the amount of people posting an item under free, but want offers made.  Either create a “offers only” section to separate entries out, or have special designation for truly free items.",3
799,"Good UI, but not enough demand: This app has way too much supply than demand. As any other VC-backed app, they want to grow, grow, grow at any cost. Well, there is a ton or garbage here (including paid ad merchandise from large retailers like Walmart), and just not enough people looking for things.

3 years ago and I used this app to sell everything from my home before moving within a week. Presently, I cannot sell a couch and a bookshelf for like 2 months (yes, they are in great condition, and yes, they are very fairly priced - just not enough eyeballs). I even paid for their 3-day promotion, and still nothing.

However, I was able to sell chachki staff under $50 easily, again to my point, that this app is more of a flee market than actual marketplace for volume & quality.",3
800,"My first source for used items: Offerup is so much more user-friendly than Craigslist. It isn’t perfect, but getting quick responses from sellers makes the purchasing experience more efficient. Searching local is also a plus, because for certain items I’m not willing to drive more than a certain number of miles to go pick up. What would be nice is if the app deleted old listings. It can be frustrating to find an item, only to see that it was posted many months ago. The app should automatically deleted old listings, unless the seller has indicated to Offerup that the item is still available.",5
801,"App is ALWAYS BROKEN!: Every time I go to post something, the description box doesn’t scroll down with the screen while typing. Also, no matter how strong my internet or 4G connection, it ALWAYS FREAKING FAILS to upload the photos. It always makes me “Try Again”, like 40 times, until, for no reason, they upload. Not to mention the lack of accountability and features to make sure people either don’t flake and scam, or at least get IP banned if they do after 2-3 times. It’s annoying dealing with the same people who are allowed to run wild and never be taken off for their actions. Obviously the app does its job, allowing you to sell & buy, but that feels like the only thing this app has to offer. It feels like there’s nothing else being done to make this app actually user friendly. I’d probably use it daily if they actually fixed the user experience.",1
802,"Buyer Beware: I’ve bought a couple of items on this site. Two shortcomings. First, many of the items listed have been on the site way too long.  They should set a reasonable amount of time for a listing such as 3 months and then delete it.
Second, the acceptance/return window of time is way too short, being around 3 days. Some items, such as a clock that I purchased, need more time to test. I found myself in the position of being beyond the deadline when I determined that the $300 clock had significant problems. Seller declined to refund money. I protested the charge to my credit card and luckily, after 3 months, received a favorable decision. Also, Offer Up blocked me from giving the seller a poor rating so I could warn others.  I’ll not purchase any expensive items on this site in the future.",2
803,"Great App for Selling Suff!: The App itself is easy to use and I have already sold several household items and a car!

While most people on here are reasonable and normal you will get the occasional “outliers” of society. If you don’t know what that means you weren’t paying attention in your statistics class. In plain English you got some weirdos, wack jobs, creepazoids, low ballers, etc. that ask stupid ?’s, are idiots, or up to something. Sign of the times but that is Not the fault of the App. Some people just could do all of us a favor and go get a Darwin Award. On plus side I have also met several buyers now who I think we’re great.

Recommend this App. Just be cautious with who you deal with and you should be ok.",5
804,Buyers beware: Suddenly my account was disabled and I was not given a reason why other than a generic email. When I contacted no response. I had purchases being shipped that I could not get tracking on and 1 never arrived. Then because I’d bought things on my fiancé’s account before I had my own they disabled his too. He also had items being shipped as well as a return in process that he could not complete without access to his account. He lost his money for return and I lost mine on my purchase. I did nothing to violate any rules and offer ups staff is non existent. I had a 5 star rating with 200+ purchases as well as 100+ sales and was treated like garbage. I also run my own eBay store so I’m very aware of protocol when buying and selling. No one was there to help make sure transactions were completed therefore they do not value their customers. Highly disappointed and do not at all recommend this app.,1
805,"Good but has flaws that make it just ok: So I have been able to make sales. The process is easy but they need to make improvements to help sellers. For example, it should be mandatory to submit a review after a purchase. Otherwise even though you are making sales some people don’t bother to rate even if you do so for them. 
Another thing is missed meetings. There should be more consequences for buyers who miss meetings and stop responding. I had a buyer do this and even though I reported he still manages to get five star reviews. How is this possible when the person is obviously not reliable and not courteous enough to explain he cannot make the meeting. At least there should be a way to review as a buyer and as a seller. 
Anyway this app could overall be better though the concept is great.",3
806,"Trash Customer Service Help: My account got deactivated because o copied and pasted an offer for scalped PS5 that was still over retail price. So now I cannot message potential buys of my items do to my account status. 
When I emailed them for help to trouble shoot the issue, they say my account is now activated but I still cannot send messages and it’s ruining my online reputation. I’ve sent multiple email asking for assistance with this and I just get automated messages saying it’s now activated but no change has actually happened. 
This app has soo many bot postings but they can have the time to ban my account. It’s ridiculous and a double standard. 
I cannot contact any live people for help with this issue. They can allow scalpers on the site but I get penalized for negations. 
I was not rude, crude or disrespectful but this issue has been ongoing for a week and I’ve lost a lot of potential sales. Absolute rubbish of an app and community.",1
807,"Letgo was more user friendly before the merg: I was a big user of letgo, I found many things to furnish my home that I love.

I am not a fan of having to use offer up now and here are my reasons why:

-too many ads, I use this app because I want to find used furniture/things (reduce reuse recycle, I am a big proponent of small everyday actions that help our planet’s waste) so having ads in every line of brand new furniture is frustrating. 

-too many listed as “sold”,  this is a waste of time for me to see in my feed. Seeing things that are what I’m looking for but not available for purchase. 

-because of the ads and sold items taking up the feed, there are few items in between actually available. But the images of the feed are small and I can’t find a way to adjust settings where images would be bigger and easier to see. I thought letgo was very user friendly and it was easy to see items for sale without zooming in. 

I have tried using offer up many times but my time with the app always ends up in frustration. I wish there is a way I could use the old letgo format, even if on the offer up app.

Please take my feedback into consideration. I love the idea of this app and used letgo all the time before the apps merged. 

Thank you",2
808,"WAYYY BETTER THEN CRAIGSLIST!!!: I’ve been using the app since it was new and there were not many people on it. Now there are thousands! My favorite part is that you can set search alerts. So when something you are looking for is posted, you be the first to know and it gives you an increased chance of snagging it up before someone else. 

The only thing I wish they would add is a way to “hide” listings from your feed that you’ve seen but didn’t fit what you were looking for. When I was looking for a new iPhone for example there were hundreds of broken ones so I wish I could have hid them as I searched so I would just be left with the options I was considering. 😊",5
809,"Horrible Experience: I was introduced to this app by a really good & although I was skeptical at first, I ended up using it to make my first purchase! After that I created a few list of stuff I would potentially like to buy and spent a lot of time organizing everything! Little did I know the people over at offer up would just disable my account in the middle of my second purchase. They charged my card but the seller wasn’t able to ship out my headphones because he said my payment method was being reviewed. Shortly after the simple disabled my account and gave me a link to contact them. That didn’t work and when I tried calling their customer service number they said that their offices were close and it was around 10am mountain time! Ultimately I missed out on a great paid or gaming headphone which normally cost $330 and they seller was willing to let them go for $200! Such a huge waste of my time!!!",1
810,"I like it..: But there’s room for improvement.  For instance, filters to weed out all the scammers.  They advertise quiet repeatedly, same verbiage, multiple pictures of the same item posted from a year ago sometimes.  Lowballing their own items to they attract people.  

Another thing, the Quick Save feature.  There’s got to be a quicker” way of removing the items rather than 1 at a time.  Whereas you can just delete the created Boards entirely, done, gone.  I was happy clicking and racked up over a hundred items and I’m at 64 now.. (sigh).

I like OfferUp .. it’s so much better than Craigslist.  I feel that it’s more of personable and a “face” to whom you’re speaking to.  It’s easy to use, quicker response time.  Thank you OfferUp, I’ve been a happy seller and buyer.",4
811,"BEWARE!! THE APP ERASED ME!!!: I used to LOVE this app! It was such an easy way to sell old stuff for cash as a college student, and find cute stuff for myself for reasonable prices!! Then everything went left. I wasn’t getting views on my items anymore when i tried to sell, i even tried to search my items in the search bar and NOTHING would pop up. Also everytime i tried to message a seller for their items the message would never be seen, even though i could see on their profile they were active! It was almost as if I was erased from the app!! I tried to create another account, but the same thing would happen! I tried to contact OfferUp’s customer support and never heard back! I was a Tru You member on the app so my identity was valid, i only had 5 star reviews, and no complaints from sellers/buyers I’ve interacted with. It just makes NO SENSE. I was such a huge fan of the app, but I won’t waste my time with it anymore.",1
812,"Opportunity: OfferUp, just a brief note to say thank you for this community exchange App. I can’t remember how I heard about it, but this App has been a real tool for me.

It has allowed me to declutter a lot of corners of collectibles than I need to turn loose. Also make a few nickels in the process. Meet new people, give to those in (real need) and help one another within our local community. 

I would like to know or meet the genius behind this App, and their continue being a part of its growth.  Count me in on the advancement growth. 

I do have a few glitches that freezes up from time to time that will make me shut down and reboot. Also when I am meeting my buyer, I have trouble communicating back with the App. So if I need to update please tell me what and how.

This App is one of the best by far I have experienced for buying and selling. My only concern how long will it continue to be for FREE! Will you eventually become another EBay giant! 

I certainly do appreciate the Opportunity you have extended me, and the design of user friendly for someone like me who isn’t very tech savvy, thank you OfferUp.",5
813,"DO NOT GET THIS APP: It is simply the worst!! I am pretty relaxed when it comes to this stuff, but this app has so many problems. I think the whole offerup company has problems, I've been trying to get it to work for 3 weeks, I missed out on so many deals and it always has an error or a reason why things don't work, then I try to call customer support, but surprise surprise, you have to send a message and wait for them to respond. WHICH THEY NEVER DO. And I had to make 7 different accounts, they either get deactivated for some unknown reason or just don't work all together because there was an ""error"". Like I said, I'm a pretty relaxed guy but this app has made me vivid. I wish I could give it no stars. It has gotten my hopes up and disappointed me so many times. I'm just done with it. You want my advice, don't give yourself the head ache. And I'll definitely change my whole mind on this company if they RESPOND TO MY D*MN SUPPORT MESSAGE!!",1
814,"Easy to use: This app is a great way to buy and sell items, and is very easy to use. My only feedback is when you click in to view an item, it would be more user friendly if you could just swipe right to get back to the previous screen. The only option now is to click the little tiny arrow in the upper left corner which is hard to click and also requires you to use both hands to surf the app. Pinterest used to be this way, but a couple years ago they updated it and now you can easily click into something and then swipe back to the previous page with the same finger. Other then that, usability is awesome and I would recommend OfferUp to anyone looking to buy or sell with ease.",4
815,"LETGO IS THE WAY TO GO! Offerup isn’t faithful to good customers: If I could give this app NO STARS! I would. After a carful amount of time reading a lot of reviews on here I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ve been “dumped” by OfferUp. I’ve been selling on this app for about three months now and all of the sudden my items stopped getting views and I haven't received any messages for my new items?! This is their way of taking something good away when you don’t pay them to get your items bumped!?!? If you’re looking to make a lot of money or are already successfully making money through this app you’ll eventually get BLACKLISTED! You think they could at the very least inform you that they no longer want you using their app, but NNNNOOOOO they continue to let you waist your time posting items that never get viewed because they never got posted!!! Don’t wast or time posting items on their app anymore go somewhere else!!! 

BYE FELICIA! 👋🏼",1
816,"Make multi-post and delete/repost feature: OfferUp! Its been long enough. For heavy sellers like myself, it would great to have a feature that allows users to post multiple listing at the same time. Facebook Marketplace has the feature. Its too time consuming to post one listing at a time. They’re also needs to be delete/repost feature that allows users to delete and re-post their ads without having to re-upload photos of each particular ad. The current platform allows users to re-list ads with existing ad details but the photos have to be re-uploaded which can be time consuming when there’s multiple ads to post. Fix it baby Jesus!",4
817,"Horrible app with horrible services: So first of all, my items are constantly automatically removed by this app for no reason, “cigar humidor” and “Dell laptops” apparently are against their community guidelines. How? They never explained it and just send me a link to their policy page, great, very helpful. Everyday I have to send them report tickets to fight for my items to be restored. Today I sent them another ticket disputing the fact they removed my “Dell laptop” again, and requested contact from their customer support supervisor, because I wasn’t file a complaint. Guess what? In retaliation, they removed ALL my items, all my conversions with potential buyers, apparently my other items are against the guidelines too haha. Cost me several opportunities to sell my items. I’m done with this app, will be switching to Craigslist. Sooner or later this app gonna go out of business. Bye bye",1
818,"Huge step down from what Letgo used to be: I used to be a frequent user of letgo and I had a great time with that app with both buying and selling, but it has been quite the opposite here. On this app you have to trudge through miles of ads and obvious scam offers to find a legitimate item you want to buy. On the other hand, when trying to sell I have had terrible luck. I came to this app with the intent to sell some old airsoft guns but for some reason that’s considered a violation of the terms of service for being too “dangerous” which is just ridiculous. And the items that I have been able to post get no views let alone any offers, no doubt because of the excessive amount of ads and scams. I never had any issues even remotely like these with letgo. 
Update: every few months I want to buy something and come check this app, only gets worse.",1
819,"Worst App Ever: OfferUp used to be good, but now this is the worst selling platform. I put up a couple of items to sell and nothing sold. Not to mention, the two messages I got were inappropriate asking if I could sit on someone’s face. I tried the three day trial for premium and it didn’t do anything. On the day I got charged, I messaged them requesting a refund due to the terrible experience I had. I took down all my posts to not use their service anymore. They said no. I continued to plead with them since I had such a terrible experience and I messaged them that day. Many companies refund the subscription that day if you contact them, but OfferUp continued their terrible service and refused to refund the money. I’m sincerely disappointed at their lack of customer service. I will never EVER download this app or use their services again. Recommending everyone else to do the same.",1
820,"Promotions: I have used this app for several years.  Great app easy to navigate less scammers then CL.  I dont think promotions really help the sales of merchandise,  what a person is selling is what makes the difference and how fast a person reacts.  You cant wait all day to respond to a offer and not expect the person to find a better deal in a few hours.  I feel the promotions thing is for lazy sellers.  The people that used the app in ots early days are what aloud for the analysis of data to make it what it is today sometimes i feel like the app forgot the others that helped it get to where it and that is its users done ranting the app is great.",5
821,"Good but needs work: When I search for sneakers/shoes I can’t filter by size so I have to scroll endlessly until I find something that’s the right price and the right size. The user interface could use some tweaks it seems a little bit confusing especially for new users giving the app a try. 

Selling is ok there are too many bots, on top of the fact you have to pay for promo just to get your product noticed. It can be a pain to sell if someone is just trying to making a quick couple of bucks unless you 1. Buy promo or 2. You’re already a pretty established seller.

Other than that the app is pretty good just would love to see quality of life features",4

I emailed their support asking what I did wrong and they simply replied that they reserve the right to ban people for violating community guidelines and that I’m not allowed to make an account under a different email address. I read the community guidelines thoroughly and I definitely did not break any. My follow up emails (all very kind mind you) have been met with silence.

It should’ve occurred to me that this app would be a hotbed for time wasters and people who think their junk is is worth more simply because of the memories they made with it. Worst of all, EVERYONE will lead you on up until the point they actually make a sale with someone else. I have a one star rating because someone falsely stated I bought an item from them, and then they stuck it to me by giving me 1 star. Great. There’s an option to dispute it, but it doesn’t work. When you click it literally nothing happens. Too many people have no profile pic. My advice, skip this sorry app and just stick to Facebook Market place. There’s more items posted there, the communication is much quicker, and you can actually see the individual’s profile page for added security.",1
826,"2020 November App Update: OfferUp great app for buying or selling items.

In my opinion since the new App update this November it made the search for your next buying deal a little more restricted with the information gather from the seller’s profile. Before the update you had the option of clicking on the map and getting an idea of the area you might be going to. Some city are bigger than others and some city are unfamiliar to me, so looking at the map and getting an idea of the traveling distance really helps with the purchasing decision.
Secondly you were able to follow a seller or get followed and that option went away too.

I’ve sold a few items with no issues, but trying to purchase, especially recently, has been frustrating. Sellers are unresponsive. Overwhelming number of duplicate items from furniture warehouses. There’s no way to rate a seller (or buyer) for their non-responsiveness before a purchase, so the reputation “ratings” are total BS. My biggest frustration as a purchaser is the number of people who post, accept your offer, and flake out at the last minute (whether it’s they made other plans, they don’t respond to your Messages about pickup once they’ve agreed). I’ve experienced a string of these lately, (which is completely rude) and it’s incredibly frustrating to see their 5-star reputation ratings when all I want to do is give them zero stars for lack of follow-through. 

Honestly, if the seller is unresponsive about an item, and it’s been on the site for months, it should be removed to stop wasting other people’s time. I wish Offer Up would manage this better.

Like everyone else mentioned, their customer service is TERRIBLE. There are better, more reliable places to sell and buy online. OfferUp is no longer worth the time or effort.",1
829,"Refunds: I love offer up and I’ve made a living out of it. I recently tried to buy some AirPods but instead got scammed and lost $110. I asked OfferUp support if I could get my money compensated but unfortunately still have not received my money. In order to do so I was told to go to my police station and file a report. I had no information on the man that stole from me but they insisted I file a report. My point is, if you get scammed you will most likely not get your money back. I get that they can’t just give money to everyone who yells “I lost $$$” but I gave them sufficient evidence but I was not given a refund. On the other hand, it’s a great app to buy and sell items, just watch out for scammers",5
830,"Horribly buggy app that will lock up your phone: With the latest iOS and the most recent version of this app installed, even uninstalled and reinstalled, I’m still unable to get this app to work reliably on my iPhone 10, even when no other apps are open or after my phone has been rebooted and OfferUp is the only thing I immediately open.  My phone has about 200GB of space free, and all my other apps work flawlessly.  OfferUp will even at times lock up my entire iPhone.  Never had that happen from anything else in the 1.5 years I’ve had this phone.  

This app tends to lock up as soon as I open it, sometimes during chat, sometimes while browsing, and there’s no conceivable way to contact the developer - at least not a way they make easily accessible or apparent to you - to try to get assistance.  

LetGo gives a far better user experience, but OfferUp has a larger user base so you have to put up with this awful app if you want to reach more potential customers to sell to, or if you want a larger user base of offerings to search from.  

Their mobile web version seems somewhat better than the app but it has its own issues as well.  I’m suddenly made no longer happy when I need to open the OfferUp app.  

Hopefully your experience will fare much better than my own.  Good luck.",1
831,"Great for buying, but....: I have purchased many great things on here, but selling can be painful at times. I get people contacting me at odd hours of the night , no shows, low-balling etc. There appears to be a lot of fake accounts, and people who just like to flat-out mess with you. 

I try very hard to be a good buyer by keeping my appointments, and messaging if I can't make it or decide not to purchase. I won't ask for a lower price unless I see it's been posted for a month or more. That being said....if you sell, Mark it ""sold"" people!! 

A better screening/monitoring process would be great...for those of us who are serious buyers and sellers, we would appreciate something that would keep those who are not,  from so easily wasting our time.",4
832,Get Rid of Furniture Store’s Listing: I still use offerup a lot but I hate that they aren’t trying to keep furniture stores from listing products. If ppl wanted to shop at furniture stores I feel like they wouldn’t be on offerup. The furniture store listings are so obvious I feel like they could set up an algorithm to catch them or at least have a report button for users to report if they see a listing from a store not private sellers. They could fine these stores. They list the same products repetitively & it makes it almost not worth it to use this app for furniture anymore since it is so hard to weed thru these days. Still giving it a 3 bc if you hve something specific in mind it is great but the store listings are really becoming more & more of a problem.,3
833,"Make OfferUp Great Again 👎: I have been a seller on OfferUp since 2015
Every year I have done the most sales  on OfferUp versus other apps and website I ship through and I do not even ship through OfferUp. In the last few months I have noticed FB marketplace has become the majority of my sales. OfferUp has been very temperamental lately (glitches probably related to all the ads). Today I am told I hit my limit of posts for the month and need to pay $.99 per extra post. I use to sell cars on OfferUp went from free to 3 a month to 1 a month to not free… I have had 9,700 views to my profile this month and the site utilizes ads and video ads now yet you want to charge a seller like me money when you make so much ad revenue from sellers like me that bring/keep customers looking. I get making money is great but how do you tax the people that make your company successful?",1
834,"This app suuuuucks, has never functioned properly: So many functions don’t work, and have never worked. How are they still alive? The app doesn’t sync with the desktop version even if you sign out and sign back in. So once you’ve arranged a purchase, you can’t access your messages from the app, so you can’t reach your seller/buyer once you’ve left your house to meet them unless you give them your cel number (which OfferUp tells you not to). You also can’t leave your buyer or seller a review on the app. But the desktop version doesn't allow you to leave a review. It tells you to do it through the app. So no reviews are possible. There’s also no purchase history on the app. Basically whoever’s been running this app all these years should get replaced with someone that has skills.",2
835,"Annoying scams: When I first got this app, I made a few sales and everything went smoothly. That was about five years ago now all the messages I get are from scammers. Asking me for my email or phone number. Asking if I can text or email them the pictures of the item as if the picture on the actual app is not good enough. They are trying to get personal information from you. Not buy your items! It’s annoying! I sold my house and now im trying to sell everything within the house before the new home owners move in. I get so excited thinking someone is interested, just to find out that all they are interested in is my personal information. It’s already hard enough trying to respond to messages while I am busy, at work, etc.. but even more so now that im wasting time talking to scammers. Something needs to be done about this.",1
836,"Prepare to Banned/ Blocked: I have 1500+ items listed on this site they repeatedly deactivate my account (ban /block) for literally no reason all it takes is for a buyer to complain and you suddenly can not use the app appropriately, the chat looks like it sends but doesn't , you then become aware that you are ""gone"" when you go to send a link outside of the ap to a potential buyer making you look super shady , to fix this you have to contact customer service (email only) and cross your fingers you get restored . Customers are not always right and this being how they treat sellers means you could be banned and not ever know why as sending emails doesn't result in a permanently solution as it's only a matter of time before you the seller find yourself banned blocked again . It is for this reason I give this 1 star review . This practice of Offerup needs to stop",1
837,"Good app except for bugs: I like this app for purchasing items but there are consistent problems when trying to post. After you post one item it keeps the pictures and description when you try to post another. If you try to delete the photos there is an error and it won’t delete them. When I then close the app and try to post again sometimes i will be able to post a new item, but then sometimes it is still stuck. Lastly you will think you have posted a new item but the app will revert back to the previous pictures so you get a bunch of messages like do you have pictures of the item you’re describing? I have tried to reach out to support but the only link is to apple support.",3
838,"Beware of OfferUp’s Fraudulent Business Practices: I listed a vehicle on the app. It prompted me to pay $4.99. I paid immediately. Listing went active. 10 mins later listing disappears. I emailed support asking why it disappeared. Bizarrely I received very rude reply accusing me of trying to avoid paying the fee. I was shocked. I explained again that the app required me to pay the fee and I did. (it was impossible to list without paying the fee). I provided screenshots of the payment and asked for clarification. The anonymous customer service rep (no name, no contact info other than email) ignored everything in my previous email and simply sent me a link to the Apple Store. Yikes. I imagine most people won’t lose sleep over 5 bucks but this type of fraudulent business conduct and OfferUp’s clear refusal to resolve or even address stealing money from its users begets a class action lawsuit.",1
839,"Non-existent Customer service: There is no phone # to call customer service wher you can reach an actual person. I’m a new user to offer up and was apparently blacklisted as a scammer and was sent a threat by this seller with obvious “anger issues.” Since then, I have been unable to reach any other seller in offer up and  also have been unable to post an item for sale. I just completed my first purchase with a seller through my husband signing up, and although it was a smooth transaction, and the seller tried to give me a positive review, since I initiated the messaging process with the seller, he was unable to do it. Offer up needs to protect new buyers to their system from sellers that have anger issues and overly suspicious of new buyers. I had saved the full message trail of this dubious seller as proof that he threatened me unnecessarily, but I have yet to hear back from an offer up customer service representative!!",1
840,"It could be a lot better: I was introduced to this site by a friend. There are a lot of good qualities to it but the thing I really objected to, is the fact that businesses are so prevalent on this site. I want to do business with people to people not people to businesses. When I go to look for a piece of furniture I don’t want to see 10,000 mattresses for sale, just as an example. I’m sure you’re not gonna change this so I’m going to have to find a different site that fits my needs. I’m very sorry about this because you do have great qualities.  Just as a thought maybe you can put businesses under a different label, and people to people under another one. Just my thoughts",5
841,Before you use!: If you are using this for purchasing items throughout the US just know. This platform doesn’t have any direct support line. Therefore if you have an issue you can only get assistance through email support. They indeed have a Twitter. But in my experience the Twitter will send you a link to the support email. So if you have a time pressured issue you will not get assistance in a desirable time. They state covid has affected support but I’ve experienced this prior of covid. If you have a question and would like an answer on that same day you won’t receive that you’ll be left to wait either 48hours or longer. I don’t understand why this platform can’t have a more direct line of communication like a live chat support. That is the one downfall of this company. Hope this helps,2
842,To many scammers on both apps: There has to be a way for all these scammers that keep supposedly selling stuff and steeling peoples delivery money to be verified when a profile is created cause this is getting out of control already. These apps can’t be trusted to have real people listing real items for sale on it because there is way to many scammers creating fake accounts. Then you ask them to verify their account and all they do is get rid of that account and create some more fake accounts. All this scamming makes me keep paying to Facebook cause you can’t scam on that one because it’s linked to your actual Facebook page. Please figure out how to fix this very big problem. You can’t even trust that if you pay for something to be shipped and you pay for shipping it will be shipped and you will not be ripped off. This is a big problem and my reason for giving these two apps a 1 star.,1
843,"Users don’t respond to messages and offers.: Here is the main problem with the app:  sellers post an item, and they quickly forget that they even have this app.  I can’t tell you how many times I sent an offer, and that offer was completely ignored.  I can’t tell you how many times I messaged a seller and that seller never got back to me.  It got to the point where I would make 3 offers on the same item sold by 3 different sellers because I knew that odds of one of them actually seeing it were very slim.  Offer Up knows that they have this issue and, desperate for active users, they relaxed the policing of “bad apples”.  I just got called a c-word by one of the sellers and told to “get a clue, loser” after making an offer that was less than the asking price.  Completely unprovoked.  I reported that user to Offer Up and they did absolutely nothing.",2
844,"Complete morons and “customer” want everything for nothing: They are idiots and keep taking down my listing for a Louis Vuitton handbag saying it is not authentic.  It’s a $1500 Bag and couldn’t be any more authentic.  They shouldn’t accuse someone of something if they obviously don’t know their stuff!  I get it people sell fakes on there, but then Offer Up should educate themselves on what real ones look like vs fakes before they take action.  Twits!

All the “buyers” on site are looking to offer close to nothing for valuable items.  A complete waste of time listing as people just send ridiculously low offers that you have to respond to.  I get it everyone wants a deal, but people need to be respectful of people’s time and the fact that no one is listing something to just give it away.  Sellers just want to get at least a small portion of their original cost back. If buyers can’t respect that then they shouldn’t be there.  It’s so rude.",1
845,"No support feedback: I’ve used this app since around the time it emerged. They have received at least a dozen messages from me reporting on issues such as fake merchandise being promoted on their app, as well as scammers who prey on those who have no clue. I have reported an upwards of 100+ illegitimate sellers and products ranging from clear and obvious wire fraud scams, counterfeits, as well as drugs! That’s right DRUGS are openly sold on offerup. It’s disgusting to see this happening around my community. But offerup has not once responded to my complaints about the user experience as both a buyer and seller. Please fix the problem but addressing the reports you receive, or expand your team to efficiently tackle these problems!",5
846,"Great selling platform!!: Offer Up is a great way to buy and sell things! When you buy an item and the seller agrees to ship, the Offer Up teams sends a reminder to the seller to ship the item if a couple of days go by without an update. They also provide you with a tracking number. It is great! The only suggestion that I have is to have an option for the owner to return half of the price of the item to the buyer if the item can be proven to not match the description. Other than that, the Offer Up support team is great and very responsive! Had my first reply within 15 minutes of reporting an issue!! I will continue to use this platform for sure!!",5
847,Best prices and safety for your junk: Buyers have more confidence on this app then CL. I’ve sold an entire apartment of furniture and appliances here. Sometimes I’ve sold items within a few hours of posting. Most items sold within a week. Most offers are serious and buyers were friendly meeting in person. Never a sketchy transaction. They key difference is every buyer and seller has a profile with ratings and verification. I did have two sketchy scammers posing as buyers try to get personal info that posted as buyers so beware! I notified offerup and blocked them. I even sold an old dresser I posted and sold it 2 hours later for $50!,5
848,"HELP!: i’ve been using offerup for almost a year now and have never had any problems. it’s my favorite selling app. however, yesterday my offers all had “item unavailable” on them which was unusual. i deleted the app and tried to login to see if that would work, but now i can’t login! it says “network error” and when i try to click on my profile, it prompts me to login again. i tried logging in on my PC also but it won’t load. i’ve tried to contact support but they haven’t gotten back to me yet. i’m only so desperate because i was supposed to receive an item yesterday but it didn’t arrive and i don’t want to miss my window to file a report if it’s needed. i’m not sure how else to get in contact with the support team as i cannot join the community forum either. offerup is a great app and i’d like to continue using it, but now i cant.",2
849,"Great but...: This app has been great for selling items I don’t need anymore. One thing tho, anytime someone sends me a message it doesn’t notify me until I actually open the app. Then it displays the little notification in the messages section. I have an IPhone X and I’ve checked my phone settings I’ve checked the app settings and I can’t find anything. I’ve even deleted the app and downloaded it again thinking there might have been a slight bug but still the problem persists. Everything else on the app is great but the only way I know if someone’s interesting in the items I’m selling is if I actually open the app multiple times a day, which I don’t have time for. I’d like a notification when someone sends me a message just like the other sale apps I have like “Let Go”. I used to like offer up way more but if this problem doesn’t get fixed I may delete it and solely sell on Let Go!",1
850,"One thing that would be nice: I use offer up a lot and I do really like it. That said it’s really sad that people can rate the seller and the buyer but, there’s no way to rate the flakes that never show up so that you can warn other sellers. If a person dragged you along for days on end with one excuse after another as to why they couldn’t make it on the appointed time, then I think we should be able to rate them and say hey watch out for this person don’t waste your time on them. I know there could be issues with people trying to sabotage one another but if you made it that the person had to have sent you a message and you replied before it can pop up and say hey did your communication with this person go good. Just sayin",4
851,Beware: I got this app and verified my email as requested.  After using the app and just really understanding it I was sent an alert that stated I will not be able to use my account unless I submit an ID.  I have hundreds of friends who have used this app and this has never been requested.  I contacted my lawyer friend and asked if this was normal.  She advised not to submit personal information or documents to any app.  She also said she uses the app and this was never requested of her.  Most likely this is a scam to obtain personal information.  What a waste of time setting up an account using it then later being unable to log in without doing something a lawyer advised against???? Shame on you Offer Up if this is a requirement let people know as soon as they create an account don’t let them use the app then spring this on them!!!! Seriously a waste of time!!!!!,1
852,"Customer service is trash: The customer support on this app is trashhhh. You don’t get to communicate with a human you just get automated responses. At least on other apps you can communicate with customer support, I could explain my end of things and a human helps you. This app has none of that. My account was removed for no valid reason at all and I couldn’t get a straight answer even after contacting customer support multiple times. I got multiple automated messages listing different excuses such as infringing intellectual property, harassment , posting against guidelines ? none of which I did! If someone reports you on here for no reason your account gets taken down and there’s no one you can communicate with as to why. It seems pretty discriminatory and not well managed at all. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone just because of trashy customer support",1
853,"Love and hate it: Been using for years. Use and enjoy it over local CL but still missing proper features that Craigslist (and every market place for that matter) has over them since the beginning. Main issue being that they don't delete old postings. This is amplified by the fact that it searches for ""best match"" by default. So you'll see something you like and realize it's years old. How hard is it to implement an expiration timer on postings that aren't maintained? Making postings auto delete after two weeks to a month or so would alleviate this. Added bonus would be that you save on hosting costs and people save on headaches. You're already charging for boosts, so you could add auto renew to that. Come on now.",3
854,"DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY THROUGH THIS APP‼️‼️: It’s unbelievable how many scammers are on this app and nothing is done about it. I’ve been looking to purchase a second hand Nintendo switch for two days and it seems like I get the same rundown every time. They ask for my number which shouldn’t even be necessary seeing how the whole point of the app is everything could be done through there. Not only that, every time I make an offer the money goes through perfectly fine, but once they are “ready to ship it” they tell you their card isn’t working on the app and try to make you send the money through zelle or Apple Pay. In theory this app should be perfect for buying second hand items, but it’s just ridiculous how easy you guys make it for sellers to scam buyers at this point. PLEASE WORK ON THIS!!!",2
855,Was great now they wanna coerce you out of money: Used to be a good place to sell your stuff for free. All there were before was Banner ads and some fake post ads that would be easy to mistake as real posts. Nothing too obnoxious. Now they have pop up ads they show up everytime sell something and then it pops up and says if you buy the premium subscription you won’t have ads. Dumbest decision y’all could have made. Between that and the bit problem that’s been happening for a while this app is slowly going down hill and at this point Facebook market seems like the better option. If they removed the pop up ads that take over your screen I could recommend this app again but until then this app will remain a zero. I’ve been using the app since 2016 so it takes alot for me to not recommend OfferUp it was great before.,1
856,Worst selling app ever: Let start of by saying this app and it’s customer service are trash id love to give this app Zero stars only bc I have gave this app serval attempts & on all of my attempts I’ve had no luck on iOS creating a account so I’ve reached out serval time to customer care and haven’t heard a word I’ve also purchased their subscription and all they did was take my money and basically won’t allow me use their app. I’ve posted serval items and all I get is zero to 1 view not sure what the heck is going on but stay away from this trash all they do is take your money and ignore you! Trust me your better off with 5 miles or Craigslist. I’ve still yet to try and get my refund bc I can’t manage to even get a email back from these people! Warning iOS users stay away from offer up its a crappie expensive subscription that won’t guarantee anything!,1
857,"Not great: Obviously it’s about the only online app to sell besides ebay and CL, however it could be so much better. There are ads everywhere you scroll and there is an algorithm they use to make the ads more sensitive to touch recognition (I’m hypothesizing, however you roll your finger over an ad and it auto opens safari or whatever browser you use constantly). There is no policing on category selection. You find cars in the motorcycle category, food in the clothing section, etc etc. Finally, it’s obviously not against any rules however there are so many brick and mortar stores advertising on here like tire shops, car dealers, pawn shops etc. If I wanted their crap I would go to their store. I’m trying to find second hand slightly used items at a discount. Overall it’s your only real choice for online app shopping from people and they know it.",1
858,"Needs to add ability to hide nuisance sellers from searches: App could be useful, but is ruined by nuisance pro sellers who list things for low prices ($0-25) which are actually not the price of the item. The price is either a down payment for an item on credit (mostly phones/electronics sold by stores) or a person listing something they want you to make an offer on. (These people should list their ideal REASONABLE price and put “offers considered” in the description.) The shops listing phones/tablets for $15 (that is just the down payment) list DOZENS of items that clog up your search results and make finding something for a certain price an ABSOLUTE CHORE. 

This app needs to add the option of “Hide Seller’s Items From Search Results” to eliminate these nuisance listings from your searches to make this app more useful for buyers and the private sellers this app was ACTUALLY INTENDED TO SERVE.",1
859,"Brand new to OfferUp and it’s awful: Let me start off by saying a friend of mine recommended me to try using OfferUp to sell my custom made coffee mugs. I created an account and did the shady Tru You verification where I had to take a picture of my identity and I was verified. I posted two listings of my coffee mugs and I noticed there was no option for me to promote my listings so I messaged support and when I woke up this morning my account was removed....?  I went through all of their guidelines and it does not say anywhere that I violated any terms of use selling coffee mugs, I also have a brand new iPhone 12 that I purchased from T-Mobile.

I will be contacting Apple about security measures I can take against this app, good luck everyone.",1

I reported the issue to OfferUp and the person that emailed me said they cannot kick him off the app (I don’t know why) pretty much saying there was nothing they could do even though I showed them the police report and the contract signed by that thief and yes that guy is still with OfferUp. If they do something about it I will update this rating but for now it will stay as it is.",5
861,"Really Nice App With a Huge Downfall: I’ve been using OfferUp for about 2 months trying to sell an item. I loved the interface of the app and how easy it was to use. Over the 2 months i’ve gotten more than 15 offers on my item. However, every single offer that i’ve gotten have turned out to be scammers. Even though i have my account verified in every way possible and i have background and profile pictures to make it look legit, I haven’t seen a single person who isn’t a scammer on the app. I’ve tried to make offers on 2-3 different items and all of them turned out to be scammers. It almost feels like the legit buyer/sellers are only 1/100 of the entire userbase. I feel like this app would have a lot more potential if a more affective way of preventing scammers was found.",3
862,"Some small issues that can be fixed: I want to say that this is a great app. Been using it for a while now. You guys are pretty good at fixing the issues when needed and I appreciate that. 

Here is an issue that should be addressed 

People are not leaving feedback for others and I think you need to make it so people have to leave feedback. I made many sales and purchases that the person on the other end of the deal never left feedback. The feedback is important for us to know about the person we are dealing with on the other end. So somehow we should be basically forced to leave feedback. Hope that makes sense. 

Another issue I’m having at the moment is I’m not seeing local items. I’m seeing stuff from all over. I set and saved my location and it seems to change on its own. I then removed and reinstalled the app to see if that would fix it. Well I’m still having the same problem as I type this. Hope this can be fixed. 

Other than small issues every once In a while, the app is great. Keep up the great work. Thanks",5
863,"Needs Some Work: This could be a good app overall but some simple fixes would make it that much better. The biggest one, move notifications out of the DM chat! That is the absolute worst spot you could put that. You go in thinking you have someone interested in what you’re selling only to have to clear out something you probably don’t even care about anymore but can’t figure out how to get rid of the search history to stop getting the notification in the first place. Secondly, I have my notifications set to persistent and still manage to miss DM’s on a regular basis. Don’t know how they’re getting by me as I’m pretty good with staying on top of things on my phone but yet have lost out on a couple of sales because I didn’t reply fast enough etc. Please fix these things.",3
864,"It’s ok: I’ve recently sold something I had to ship to another state and I have to say it takes wayyyy too long to receive your money. On top of the 9.9% service fee they want to charge you an additional 1% to receive your money instantly. If you don’t want to pay the additional 1% you must wait 4-5 business days and that’s on top of having to wait 2 days AFTER your item has been delivered for them to release the payment. It’s frustrating, my item was sold, shipped and the buyer is satisfied but yet I STILL don’t have my money 😕 probably won’t sell anything else with the shipping option again. This makes me nervous because my product is now gone and I have nothing to show for it.... no type of protection 😔",4
865,"Non-Existent Support. Horrible UX: I’ve never had a more frustrating experience using a commerce app. I listed two vehicles for sale for my parents. At first I was happy because of the influx of responses. The problem came with the follow up. I sent the interested buyers the contact info so they could schedule with my parents when they want to check out the vehicles. Shouldn’t be a problem, right? WRONG! I started getting an error telling me to read the community guidelines. So I’m stuck there. Tried looking for contact info for customer support so I could solve the issue but that was nowhere to be found. I kept trying to find different ways that the buyers could get in touch but every time the app would either delete my message, throw that error message, or mask the contact info in the message.

When i responded explaining what a concert ticket is, and that they had no just cause to remove my post, NIDIA stated “i understand this can be an unpleasant experience for you and feel free to report this and our decision is final”. This rep basically encouraged me to keep complaining. Following up over a week later, I see SEVERAL other users selling the exact same thing for days, up to a week, long. Crooked!

868,"Certain searches full of spam, blocking does nothing: Tried to search for a day bed and found out not one but two nearby furniture stores post every single one of their dozens of inventory items on this platform every single day to get free advertising and drown out all the normal people trying to sell one used item.

Reported and blocked the accounts but nothing appears to have changed (not sure what blocking accounts even does if you keep seeing their items anyway) so I can only assume ""free advertising for any scummy business that wants to take advantage"" is considered a legitimate use of the platform. Had hopes this app would be better than Craigslist but even Craigslist offers an option to hide duplicate listings instead of forcing people to look at an endless parade of the same 10 pictures with occasional actual listings sprinkled in.",1
869,"Eh..: I know it’s not the app’s fault when people are irresponsible, tell you they’ll buy and then then negotiate or just plainly waste others time but when I’m getting notifications “related” to something I never posted..then there’s something wrong :/
I NEVER owned a BMW..that would be the last car I’d ever even look at-and yet I’m getting these notifications that are‘ related’.  Seriously??  I believe it’s the same app I already deleted once because of the same issue.  But back then it was Honda Accord.  Yes..that one i posted but all of a sudden I started getting hundreds of ‘offers’ on Hondas I did NOT posted.  And people were negotiating for 5!!! bucks!!  Ridiculous!!
So I guess I’m deleting this again.
I just wanted the ‘good’ sellers and buyers to be aware…",3
870,"App so bad I’m obligated to review: I downloaded OfferUp in hopes of selling a pc. I posted the pc and I tried to boost it (give them my money) and the boost option was not there. I went to Reddit and Reddit said OfferUp falsely flags an enormous amount of real posts as spam robot posts. I went to their in-app support service to have my post unflagged and the chat bot is so messed up I had to enter my credentials 6 times before it let me type anything. It then said it would take me to a human agent and nobody has responded in about a week. I haven’t gotten a single human response and the chat bot is so painful to work with. Then they had the audacity to ask me to rate the support experience… still not a single response from support. TLDR Not only can I not post anything, I can’t give them money via boosts and they don’t have real human customer support

Update: they banned me after I posted this",1
871,"Does the job…: …of allowing you to post and sell your stuff. Unfortunately, it has a lot of issues with scammers and fake accounts, as well as limited tools to sort through search results. This can make it frustrating to use when you can’t filter certain vendors who love to spam. You can only look at the same post again and again before you just give up and close the app. Also, the latest version introduced very intrusive, full screen ads, that you can’t dismiss. This also has caused frustration to the point where as soon as the ad comes up, I just close the app and do something else. 
And now here comes the generic developer response “We are here to help. Email us at blahblah” 👇🏽",3
872,Great app ruined horribly. Use Craigslist: The bones of the app are fine. But OfferUp turned it into a pile of garbage. 1) Forced notifications. A pop up says “never miss a message enable notifications”. And you CANT CLOSE IT. You have to force close the app. 2) Ads litter every search 3) You can’t filter by owner/business. Businesses spam every page with crap 4) Car ads are on every search. I’ve searched for so many items and guaranteed there will be several car ads from businesses 5) The big ad they put on the bottom of a post has the lowest touch setting possible. I’ll scroll down and if you even get close to the ad it opens it up 6) Full of scams Craigslist is much better. It’s absurd how they think it’s less safe than offer up. They’re the same thing. Yes offerup verifies you but it’s simple to bypass (as you can tell by the endless scammers).,1
873,"Glitchy and slow. Massive amounts of notifications.: I use this app quite a bit and never once have had a smooth experience. So laggy down to typing into the search box. And the app will randomly quit unexpectedly. I never write reviews, but it’s get annoying enough that I felt compelled to. I don’t have the latest and greatest iPhone, but it’s not like I’m running an iPhone 6. Please optimize! Ty. 

Also, WAY too many notifications, which you can silence as per iOS, but it’ll still show as a flag in the app and deceives you into thinking you have messages when it’s just notification telling you to more items are listed. Feel like this is incredibly manipulative to get you to check the app. There’s literally no actual need to merge these constant reminders with the messages tab.",2
874,It’s legit and I would highly recommend it for other people to use this app to find things: I already found a couple of items around my city and been with great luck and I highly recommend people to use this app to find things in case if you can find them in thrift stores or online with craigslist or eBay Legos another alternative to find things that other apps probably don’t have at the moment I found a lot of good classic Xbox 360s for $15 in perfect condition what should be worth something in time to come so I highly recommend people to use this app once again I say things and repeat sorry,5
875,"Offer up is dead. :(: This is the first time I’ve given a review on any app. The year is 2022. When I first started back a few years ago with LetGo and Offerup, people actually were buying things or at least making offers but now it’s only “Is it available?” And when you answer them “yes it is available”, they seem to disappear from the face of the earth, never to be heard from again. Lol I don’t hate the app itself but the community. But that’s not necessarily a special phenomenon that only happens here. That’s literally all that I’m getting at this point. I have thousands of views on my listings but it doesn’t seem to be as active as before years ago. I really think this app is dead and should be best for you to move onto other marketplaces. I have very good success on three other marketplaces but this is not one of them. Offerup is dead. :(",1
876,"Alerts: I am very happy with Offerup. However, I noticed a change when the extra alerts were added( alerts that aren’t solicited and aren’t related to a message from a potential buyer). When these were added, I noticed people on the ap didn’t respond to my messages and often missed my messages because they just thought the alert was an unsolicited and not an actual message from a potential buyer. Maybe if OfferUp used a different alert for messages it would make people pay more attention to the message alert knowing that it is a actual message from someone who wants to purchase their merchandise. Thank you for listening. Love OfferUp.",4
877,"The Vast majority of for sale listing are inactive: Listing that are a year or Multiple years old should be prompted to be renewed by users via push notifications, so that they’re inclined to either bump it up to currently still available, or remove their listing if they’ve long since sold it.  
As a buyer, you’ll wrestle with sending messages to sellers who have been completely inactive and may not even have the OfferUp app on their phone anymore, in a futile search for what you need.  Sure, you can sort by “recent” for more current but fewer results, but if the sellers of old listings were prompted to renew theirs (and be bumped back on top for recent listings, showing that they are active and the item is still available) periodically until marked as sold, countless more transactions would be made.",2
878,"Full of old ads no one removes or responds to: The intent of this app is good, and execution is at times, but more often then not one wastes a lot of time looking at and contacting dead ads that no one removed or responds too. I rarely even bother with this app anymore because that describes the majority of ads local to me and there are better options for those serious about making a purchase. 

I also had a recurrent issue with my account being hacked and I will say the customer service was excellent. Eventually I secured the account with their help. But it is of little good when no one responds to inquiries to purchase a listing.",5
879,"Gone downhill.: In the past months of use, I have noticed MAJOR downturns on the support and service end of offerup. Just recently I had a post removed for being “prohibited” (it was a Star Wars Boba Fett toy) and when I inquire as to why, I got AI response that “we could not restore because the item is prohibited. Please see prohibited items list”. So I click the link, deeply wanting to understand how I’d screwed up, and to my surprise THERE IS NO PROHIBITED ITEMS PAGE!  Shocker. I took screen shots to backup my claim, am STILL awaiting a response as to what exactly was prohibited about a popular child’s toy? It was VERY clear in the response that there was no human ever looking in to this case. Deeply disappointed, I used to love the simplicity of this app, and it somehow went from “great new app!” to just another bloated and misdirected app. Would love to see this actually get fixed; I’ll eat my words and re-rate.",1
880,"Meaningless notifications: Every time I see that I have a notification from offerup, I think that someone is interested in buying my car. Everytime I click on it, I open up messages (which is where the push notification is in the app), and everyTIME I’m disappointed to find an ad telling me that there are new listings in the area. I absolutely hate these ads. I know there are new items in the area because obviously people are using the app. 

Dear UserInrerface Team/ Marketing Team, please get rid of these ads and I will rewrite a proper review. I wish I could properly use your app, but 8/10 times I open it I am constantly reminded that you are giving me clickbait.",5
881,Ios app is lacking features: There is no way to follow someone or see your followers or anything like that on the ios app. I  have version 4.2. When i  log in to the website from a browser it is there but not on the app. Also there should be an easier way to scroll through posts without having to exit each one. And when u open a post it should have related items. Also i  have to change the mileage every time i  open the app because it doesn't save. And like 8/10 items it shows is always around the maximum distance of 30 miles. I  rarely see posts in my area and i live in a busy part of Los Angeles but all the items i  see are all literally across the city at least an hour drive.,3
882,"Good way to buy and sell: I have been buying and selling things using this app for awhile now. While I like the listings are not removed after a set period of time, I do think older ones (6 months and older) should be removed if the seller fails to respond to a potential buyer’s inquiry in a timely manner. The app notifies a buyer when a saved item has been sold, so it should also notify a seller if they don’t reply to an inquiry in a timely manner.

There also should be a way to block people from listing an item for $0 but say in the description they want a buyer’s best offer and that the item “...is not free”. I have also seen many items listed in the wrong category. The app should notify the seller of this issue.",4
883,There is almost no point in trying to buy used cars from this app!: I was thinking of looking to see if people can buy and sell cars on here but it’s not regulated at all. I was scrolling and almost every car that I seen was like a car that’s meant to be sold for thousands of dollars and it said on sale for 1000 with one picture and the seller has no profile picture. it’s most likely scammers or stolen cars. The commentary section always say “I’m selling this for my aunt” and it always insists everything is fine with the car but there’s like one picture. There are so many scammer profiles and fake cars that I can’t find what cars are real and which ones are fake and the fake cars out number the real ones. Facebook regulates car shopping way more. There is almost no point in buying a car from this app. There should be a way to take out the fraud accounts. I miss the old let go.,1
884,"No longer a great app: The ratings and reviews really need to reflect the apps current status. Filled with mostly scams from department stores who don’t have items in stock. To being scaled for your money with no protection through the app. Customer service nolonger works or responds to people like me with a 70 person 5 star success rate being they are currently being rated 4.8 stars. I ask that people please be honest so they can fix the problem. There are random stores on there just asking for free reviews. It’s just disgusting and distasteful. Now I have no way of selling my merchandise that just gets washed away with stores that spam the whole page with merchandise you can even pick up. It’s so upsetting. You cannot return a item through offer up if you never recieved it so please don’t waste your money thinking that you’ll be protected by customer service. They don’t care!
Real Review Real person",1
885,Kinda scary not gonna lie: Ummm so first things where going smooth and I didn’t sell anything yet cuz I had the app for a bout five minutes. I put these emoji pillows up for sale for five dollars and this guy asked for them you know thinking he probably has kids or grandkids or he just wants emoji pillows. Nope. We had a deal that he would be their one day and then never showed up. I texted him and asked if he was coming and he said tomorrow. I said ok whatever. Then he asked if he could ask questions. Me thinking it was about the pillow so I said yes. The questions where very inappropriate and sexual. I obviously got freaked out. So then I told him Never mind I’m not selling the pillow. Then he proceeded to tell me that if I answered those questions he would have paid me 2x the amount I asked for. I mean that’s not the apps fault but I wish the people on the app weren’t trynna traffic people and just sell things they don’t use and not people.,1
886,"simple, safe & straightforward: I've had a great experience with this app both as a buyer and a seller!  For buyers: I strongly support the idea of buying used whenever possible for the sake of living with a smaller footprint but do not have time for the sometimes endless search for specific items I need at the thrift stores in my area.  This app does the work for me. I type in what I'm looking for and it shows me who is selling it. It's so simple!  For sellers: I've sold a couple of things on OfferUp and find the process so simple & straightforward. I love that all the communication happens through texting in the app so I don't have to give out my personal number. I highly recommend OfferUp!",5
887,"Needs better messaging: The OfferUp app provide a great opportunity for the community to buy and sell, used and new goods. Definitely try it.

I have but one correction I wish the offer up team coders would work on. -improve Message delivery between buyers and sellers. Often times you receive a message from a seller/buyer right away. Other times you will not receive the message, rather, have to open the App to notice that the person texted you 5, 10, 20 minutes ago. But it never showed up on your phone. Other times the message shows up right away. This needs to be improved.",5
888,"Terrible customer service: My account was deleted with no warning, explanation or violation. I have over 100 5 star ratings and have been selling since 2016 with no warnings or issues. I cannot get anyone from offerup to explain why my account was suddenly deleted. I cannot even get a response at this point. I filed a complaint with the better business bureau and it seems like they have had this issue since August of 2018 and do not respond to their requests either. If anyone from offerup reads this review, I want to see ACTIONS take place to fix this situation, not false promises. I will edit this review if they resolve my situation and it will remain the same if they do not.",5
889,Offer up is the scammer: I’ve Been using Offer up for an year now being a seller. Ive never had a problem in my account with sales other than the usual people trying to scam sellers. I recently sold an item on April 11 and it was delivered to the buyer on April 14. There were no complaints from the buyer.. Its been a month & the Balance for my sale hasn't shown up for me to Transfer it to my bank. I have contacted offer up in their selections of topic for “when will I get paid?” and they have not responded like other reviews that say offer up fails to respond when they don't want to pay up. . I wondered why there were many negative reviews about offer up only cares about you filling up their pockets & could care less about the items you buy or sell. The reviews are true!! Offer up let me down. They just care about their own pockets.,1
890,"Already “downhill”: It’s not going downhill. It’s already there. I never write these reviews, however, I felt compelled to do so. 1. There are so many scammers beware A. I report these scammers and I get an email that I submitted a report. But they do not do anything. Deal is too good to be true? It probably is. The scammer to get you off the app. Don’t do this. Report them. Once reported, this company will not do anything. No follow up either. The same scammer lists the same type of product with the same title. Come on, ppl!!!!! Easy algorithm to limit scammers? Lazy. I pointing to you guys. 2. Ads? Your business model is failing to now incorporating Ads? 3. Where is the saved searched items? They are done. 4. Control price gouging. Maybe this is a far fetched request, because you can develop a simple algorithm to catch scammers and obviously resources are thin because you implemented Ads. 5. Bye",1
891,"Refusal to remove Sensitive info and denied access to sell my car: I’ve included personal information into deposit methods, and this sensitive info cannot be removed as there is no specific choice allowing you. And I mean this for when someone transfers money to you, that deposit. I even asked for it to be personally removed but was denied. On top of that, I tried to sell a car and has been removed TWICE without ANY reason, with limitations as I can only post one a month. Frustrating to work with and not likely use.

I’ve also been shadow banned following this incident, as it seems I cannot AT ALL, but or sell anything. Even when I posted a car for sale, they promptly removed it and took it down even though it does clearly state ‘1st car sale’ free. It’s unfortunate to think how they have it set this way over a few simple issues.",1
892,"Not Good: I have always hated offer up, but when let go merged with them, kinda had no choice but to use it. Now I hate them even more. Annoying in app notifications, not being able to efficiently remove old saved items, not being able to just quickly “like” something without then having a pop up tell you to select a list or whatever to save it on. Anything you search, only the first few listings are actually recent, the rest are from months to even YEARS ago, which is annoying and definitely deters me from using the app. Listings should expire after a few months like how Craigslist does it, just make it so people can go into their account and renew the listing easily if the item is still for sale. Pointless to use as it is now, I have much better luck on marketplace or yard sales.",1
893,"UNFAIR DISABLE!: today my account was disabled for violating guidelines which i found very perplexing & caught me off guard. i had put some items up for sell yesterday & was respectful with the people that i communicated with so i don’t understand why i got banned from ever using the app! i even tried reaching out to offerup support but of course they were no help whatsoever. they didn’t even explain or give any warning warranting the supposed violation(s) to the guidelines which lead me to being banned! they have completely ignored my emails demanding for an explanation or to have my account looked at again because surely there’s been a mistake. i find it VERY odd that out of all the scammers & creeps that are littering the app, I’M the one getting kicked off! all i wanted was to sell some clothes but NO! this is absolutely ludicrous & i demand an answer & my account unlocked! thank you.",1
894,"What a joke: Lots of problems with this app. There are a bunch of ads that open when you do not even click on them and open a separate safari browser which is very frustrating. Also the feed is plagued by car dealerships and other businesses that post every item they have multiple times per week. So if you are looking for a good used vehicle all you see is the same cars from the same car dealerships over and over. Why not have an option to filter out dealer vs private seller? Also the highest search radius that isn’t “maximum” (what does that even mean?) is 30 miles which is pretty low. And to top it off there are scam posts all over the place that never get taken down. The entire feed is relisted items from businesses, scams, and ads with no way to filter it. Not surprised most people just use FB marketplace.",1
895,"Need to get rid of scammers: Pretty much the whole app when it comes to tech, 90% of things posted are scammers. I spend most of my time reporting scammers than actually finding the product I’d like to buy. If the Devs could literally just verify people properly. Let vendors take actual photos of their product rather than just finding a stock photo of it on the internet. As well with taking pictures within the messages. It’s just not safe. With the little action that’s been taken so far. It seems OfferUp isn’t bothered by their app being a haven for scammers. It shouldn’t be this had to vet genuine products by genuine people. Rather than having most of their app just being posts about scams. Please OfferUp, you took over letgo, implement some of their previous systems. It will be to your benefit.",2
896,"Account problem: I have this application for 6 years, had no problems so far. They ask me to verify my email, my phone number, and I have already done it and they will not let me do it again because they have already verified all this information, I cannot send messages, I cannot buy. I have sent many customer service emails to help me, they tell me that they will help me, then they no longer answer me or they tell me that the person in charge of my case is no longer there and that I will help me, but they have not helped, I really liked this application, but I think I have to delete it because no one has solved my problem.

I opened another account. but I liked the one I already had because I had been with it for more than 6 years. And I had sold quite a few things, bought there I also already had my stars.",1
897,"SPAM SPAM SPAM: I did enjoy them being on different platforms but I semi don't mind them being together. 
Yes, I do sell more on Offer Up than Let Go and getting items in 2 places really helped getting it to more people but that's not even the big issue.
The one BIG thing I hate about them joining is all the spam i'm getting of accounts with no info, reviews, or items for sell wasting my time with copy and pasted messages when they don't even take out quotation marks and don't reply after you answer. Now half of those are even asking for my personal number or email. No thanks! And I used to get this often on electronics or larger items on Let Go. Now i'm getting them on every new post on Offer Up no matter the item within a few minutes of them being up.",3
898,Simple things could make it a million times better: I’ve been a member of offer up for quite some time mostly for car purposes and I just wish they would do something about all the scams and bots that are on the cars and trucks section. So many “people” will post the same car with pictures they found on google and say to email them and no matter how many times it gets reported nothing happens. Another thing they could fix is making a separate section for dealers posting that the car is only $1000 and then when you ask they say it’s the down payment. Why can’t I have a section just for private party sellers and deal with them directly instead of the scammers?,4
899,"Never works: Feb 16th 2020 

I downloaded this app posted a pic verified my email and phone did everything correctly... I posted several good items, iPhone 10x , 55 in Sony flatscreen, air pods 2gen, things that sell very fast and easily, I didn’t get any views other than one so I went as far as paying to boost my sale on front page.... 1week later I was still at 1 views ,... I tried to message other sellers to buy items I like and none of my messages were being viewed and responded too.... I then knew something wasn’t right I went back on a friends page and typed my exact headline to my items for sale and nothing pulled up , my items were showing posted on my end though, ... there berly a way to contact customer service so I had no luck and deleted a pointless app. This app is not worth it I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy, I went back to let go , also this app is part of 5miles",1
900,"Offer up is loaded with scammers and they refuse to take them down when you report them.: Offer Up is loaded with scams. My sound advice is to skip this website and move on to the next and tell everyone you know this is a garbage site. At least half of the posts are originate in Nigeria and Ghana and when you inquire into an item or offer to buy, the fake profiler will ask you for your email to conduct business. If they do this report them and block them. But Offer up won’t do anything about it anyway because they don’t care about conducting good business. They are a joke. Skip this site. Unless you want to be ripped off or hacked.",5
901,USE TO BE GREAT BUT NOW UNORGANIZED: I remember when offer up first came out the purpose was to help people who needed quick cash ASAP so you could post & meet someone in your area to make the deal. Now when you search for an item they show everything that’s in a whole other state so at the end of the day there’s no purpose of them asking to enable location until you make a purchase to have it shipped to you. If there is anything in your city it’s going to be scattered so you spend your time clicking on different items trying to find the one closest to you. They need to at least show all the items in your location first then the ones out of state but nope they’ve become unorganized and now trying to compete with let go & posh mark etc since they also ship.,3
902,"I have the same complaint that someone had 2 years ago. Still no change!!!: Nice app but still buggy even after I delete the app and restore it. 

Why is there a delay on showing the dot to indicate a new message or new notification?? It doesn’t show up until after I tap the INBOX and then the dot shows up after taking its time to load. 

Also, why, when I’m trying to delete SAVED ads that it scrolls back to the top and if I deleted something several scrolls to the bottom that I have to keep scrolling to the bottom again and again to delete another ad further down the saved list (tedious after saving more than 50+ ads)???? Someone complained about this two years ago!!!! And still you can’t figure out how to make it more efficient??? How about putting checkboxes next to the ads instead of having to open each one individually, only to find it was UNLISTED? Why does it not show UNLISTED the same that it shows it was SOLD??? So I can delete the ad right then and there???

Frustrating app when the other features make it a reason to stay on my phone. But fix the above ASAP.",3
903,"Issue!!: I recently let my fiancé log into my offer up because hers was acting up. When she was done not a single person got back to her. I logged back in to see if it was just her phone but no one got back to me too. I got in contact with customer service and they said I have violated community guide lines and posting rules! I’ve been using OfferUp for more than 5 years and not once did violate anything on the app! This was the reason why no one would get back to me, my account was blocked. I got in contact with customer service once again and asked if they can tell me the reason why they blocked me because I went through their guideline and posting rules and no where on there specifies my issue. All they did was officially log me out of the app. Great way to keep users Offer Up. No warning no nothing. Horrible customer service.",1
904,"Sold an item, shipped it, customer paid, but offerup won’t pay me the funds. 7 days now: Locally buying stuff this app is alright. But recently I sold an item on offerup and shipped it out of state and the funds have been in “payment pending” status for days now even though the customer has paid the full amount out of his account. Caused huge confusion between customer and myself when really it is OfferUp who wont give me my $. I should be able to trust this app but i feel they are stealing. Beware when shipping you won’t be paid for weeks after item has been delivered which makes the whole app feel unsafe and makes me uncomfortable dealing with money with these type of guys who run the app. Seems like a scam for sellers who arent technologically inclined on how to contact offerup. I email with no response. I feel offerup has stolen $$$$. More than $100",1
905,"Great App but...: I love this app,But there needs to be a time limit on how long things are posted. Maybe six months if it doesn’t sell delete the ad and then re-posted if you need to. I found some Disney/Jim ShoreItems that I really wanted. They were close to me and I could’ve gotten that day. Then I found out they were posted over a year ago. I’m not even sure the guy still lives in the area now. I wrote him but I never got a letter back. So there needs to be a time limit on how long and ad can be place for. If it doesn’t sell but you still wanna post it then re-posted at least it’s correct and people don’t get their hopes up. Just be safe out there.",5
906,Disgusting app: It was used be a nice neat platform before but not it’s becoming worse and worse everyday and OfferUp left the platform to the scammers and doesn’t really seem caring about this platform anymore. I am selling and buying some type of stuff and I can easily say that 7/10 listings and buyers are fake. This is unbelievable. Since OfferUp doesn’t do anything prevent scammers they grow day by day. They are mainly bots and shipping is not a smart option now on OfferUp. Before I sold hundreds of items and now I just closed the shipping option. Because I cannot manage all those scammers. They raised the fees and left the app unattended. It’s so hard to find real items and real people anymore. Many of the menus on the app and on their website is not functioning anymore. It has been three months now and I still cannot see my purchases. I threw maybe 10 emails regarding this. Nobody cares on OfferUp.,1
907,"Loved the app but keep running into accessibility issues: I have used offer up for about six years now and I lost my vision about four years ago. At first I was able to use the app with just minor accessibility issues, and found little tricks to get around them but since letgo has now joined OfferUp it seems like all accessibility is gone. I almost can’t even use the app at all, I am willing to give advice on how to fix it and what needs to be fixed. I know quite a bit of other blind people who use this app, offer up seems to be better than Facebook marketplace in a couple different ways. so if the accessibility issues can be resolved awesome, if not seems like me and the rest of the blind community will have to delete it since it doesn’t work for us.",3
908,"The app is great but: But there are a few things that would be great if they changed like making it easier to mark an item as sold... they should put an option to mark it as sold when the buyer send a message, so that if you have a big listing, you don’t have to keep scrolling down to mark it as sold even more because when you have to go all the way down and mark a few items as sold, you are only able to mark ONE item because when you come back to the listing window it automatically goes back to the top.
Some things can be changed but while they don’t do it, the app is still great for sales.",5
909,"Poor customer service: I have been using OfferUp for 10 months and I have enjoyed it a lot until 2 days ago.

I was trying to post vintage license plates which you can find a lot of on OfferUp. Every time I tried to post my item, they said it was against to their policies and they banned my account (I have sold over 100 items and have 5 star rating). After a couple of emails they have finally activated my account but unfortunately my posts weren’t there anymore. 

I think this has been a common problem for a long time now and they cannot fix it.

If anything changes or the issue resolves itself, please let me know. In the meantime, thank you for your patience and apologies for any inconvenience this may be causing.",1
910,"Beware: When selling there are a lot of “buyers” that are scammers. The most popular and common one is “I want to by this item at your asking price, and I’ll pay you $100 (or whatever amount) more for all shipping to my loved one, daughter or mother in another state.” Then they try to get you to use an outside pay source like Cash App. Offer up allows you to report the person but if they delete their messages to you on the app before you can report them you can’t go back and access them on your end. Since their messages are recorded in my email, offer up still doesn’t add that report option through that scenario. I originally got it to sell some things lying around but I got more scammers than potential buyers so I ended up just getting rid of the app!",3
911,"Offer up allows scams 😡😡😡😡: I used the app a while and sold a few items. One thing I disliked was a lot of either fake people or I don’t know what to call them. I would get questions about the items or interest and poof then they disappear. I noticed in the reviews that this happens way too often and offer up is not doing anything about it. I deleted the app today because there was one person giving a phone away for free for someone who could not afford one, I told him about a person I know who could benefit from it. The person then asked me to send money for shipping 46 dollars and to do it through PayPal (friends and family) big red flag because I would lose my money if the item never gets sent. I reported to offer up and hours later the listing was still active in fact it may still be active because  I don’t think offer up cares how many people get scammed.",1
912,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!: THIS APP DOESNT EVEN GET A STAR THIER HAD BEEN AN ISSUE FOR WEEKS SIMPLY TO JOIN TRUYOU I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE AN IPHONE X OR SELL THE NUMEROUS ITEMS I UNFORTUNATELY STILL HAVE MOST UNSOLD AND I SADLY I WISH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AS THIS APP VALUES INTEGRITY AS DO I BUT COME ON DONT PREVENT SOMEONE FROM VALIDATING THIS AND NOT DO MORE TO HELP IN DOING SO! I HAVE SOLD ITEMS SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE AND NOW IM LEFT TO USE OTHER APPS! I WILL ADD THIS.... At least this application is it like “LET GO” which is full of scam artists because they lack true you or something similar let go is full of people trying to utilize Western Union or have your item shipped in a manner where they can gain the upper hand and scam you out of your money there’s flaws in a lot of different systems in paying through shipping...PayPal delaying and holden cash....Western Union seems to be the latest tactic that they utilize asking for information so they can “send”you money don’t fall for it! 

I would’ve left us up with no stars but I had to go to this one to get this posted!",1
913,"Great App needs work: Overall I love the app. I have sold and bought many things without a problem. My issue with the app is all the scammers posting false advertisement requesting they receive e-mails for the items being sold. My parents have been scammed in the past not using offer up but these post are very similar to the ads my parents responded to. I wish the developer or developers could screen a little better. Especially in the car area that’s where you usually get the red flag. Who sells a brand new vehicle under 30K miles for only $2,000 that should be the first red flag. Then the request of contact through email. If phone numbers are automatically erased should emails also be erased automatically? That way there is some type of monitoring of these scammers?",3
914,"Nice App: Really like it it's very helpful when buying thinks you need but don't want to pay retail for them. I love it to because it's a nice way to make some extra cash by getting rid of things you know longer want or use. It's also a good way to meet people that are into the same things that you are interested in. The app does freeze a lot and can act buggy, I also don't like when you typing how it tries to correct your spelling and changes what your trying to say that's very annoying. Just be safe and meet in a very public place you can even meet at the local police station. It would be also nice if like C.L. You cold renew your post without a fee.",5
915,Better a algorithm: The app is great but the way you have to scroll through items selecting item and going back I said it was just swiping right or strping up which should be more helpful also the way people can just flood the feed with their post especially when they already posted them multiple times I tend to find myself going to Facebook marketplace just because the algorithm Narrows stuff that I want more towards meI’ve been using OfferUp for years and sold over 100 items I just wish she was a lot smoother easier and more user-friendly also an AI that could spot out scammers,5
916,"Ads are ridiculous: this used to be my fave resell app, i barely ever used others like FB market, ebay or craigslist anymore. but recently there’s been an update in the app that now includes Ads. honestly i don’t mind Ads, i get it’s another revenue for them, but the ads are impossible to close, and this is after i sat there and watched it. i click on the ad to hopefully get it to move on back to OfferUp but it doesn’t. an ‘X’ does eventually pop up in the top right corner but tapped nothing happens! so o close the app and hope it goes away, then of course after viewing 3 items another ad pops up, now this app is just a waste of time. Sellers won’t get nothing sold because of this. buyers don’t want to sit there through an ad every couple minutes. please change this! i’ve deleted this app until this gets fixed.",1
917,"Needs improvement: I’ve been on the app for years and have had pleasant buying experiences, but the save function is awful. They don’t have a sort feature and when you add items to a list they don’t even stay in the order you add them. Also to delete items from a list you have to go through one by one and it loses your place. It makes keeping organized on the app an absolute nightmare. These issues have been discussed for YEARS in reviews and yet they have never been fixed which suggests to me that the creators have no intention of ever addressing them which is extremely disappointing. I really do love the search alert feature but other than that, the app needs a lot of work.",3
918,"It works: Can’t delete old conversations and what’s the benefit and purpose of not being able leave contact information in the post.

The review above is from 2 years ago and it ain’t changed….items that sellers have long sold or gotten rid of are still here sometimes 3-4 years later!! Who does that but OfferUp.  You guys want to be good but you’re wallowing in mediocrity. I use it because it a cheap platform to get some extra cash. Upgrade and update…posts should expire after 90 days and require you sellers to reactivate the posting. And contrary to what you guys think it’s easier and faster for me on my laptop than my phone…no…wait ..I forgot I can’t post from the website …I gotta use my data and squint to use a phone instead of my 13” MacBook Pro…..get it together ….",2
919,"FIX YOUR APP!!!!: FIX YOUR APP!! If you are thinking of looking on this app for cars, FORGET IT! Every single listing I was scrolling through is a scam of a car that’s 1/10th the price is should be. Please just find a way to have people who have buying and selling accounts to make sure they are real people and NOT just the same person on a fake account. I actually had an iPhone stolen from me when selling on this app and we had no idea who he was because he just put in a fake name and that was good enough for offer up. We ended up catching him because he made ANOTHER fake account and tried to sell it. Just please! I like this app, but it is terrible now that 90 percent of the people on this app are just fake names and people scamming. Learn from Facebook, and make sure the people are REAL before you let them buy and sell everything from phones to cars!",1
920,Nice app except for the perverts: I have done fairly well selling my items on offer up . The only complaint I do have is that people who want to can temporarily put up a profile so they can make sexual comments to women to get sex! Ugh! And others that have actual verified accounts that are male see you selling a mini dress or  nice lingerie start asking for sex or telling you what they want to do. I’ve reported them but their still up there. Sometimes you try to block them and it works sometimes not. Other than that it is a great place to sell items and works well for me once I tell the pervs to get lost!,5
921,"Is it just me or…: There seems to be a very large amount of scam accounts. People selling cars or other high priced items and listing then at unbelievable prices. Lo and behold the description asks for you to email them. Why isn’t there more of a push to delete and remove these users. I found multiple users that list the same item across the USA. For example a car for 800 bucks “no issues drives great” yet they want you to email them and they have the same item listed in many different states. 

Other than that this app is useful and convenient. Almost everyone on here will low ball you but I see this app as a way to make space and get rid of what you don’t need anymore…. I guess that is the trade off.",3
922,"OfferUp: Good but not great.: I often use OfferUp to buy used iPhones for various members of my family. I have found some incredible deals over the years, but I noticed that there is an abundance of fraudulent posts on OfferUp — especially for used iPhones.  They are easy to spot because the posts request that you text the seller’s cell number instead of through the app.  (I have no idea what the seller has to gain from asking a person to text his/her cell phone.) Other posts have too-good-to-be-true prices and some story about how the seller wants to give away the phone because it is his anniversary or his son died. Strange stuff.
 
OfferUp can just weed out any posts that have phone numbers or mention of the words “anniversary” and “died” and “passed away.” The solution is that simple.",2
923,"Shopping on OfferUp experience: Hi I’m cc young I’m a great fan of this app every since my daughter showed me this site it’s like a magnet I’m drawn to look for what ppl have to offer I’ve gotten great deals and I’ve made made some great sales I’ve been scammed and had ppl run off with me stuff I always try to be honest in my dealings just so I can keep good karma mostly I’m very pleased looking and buying on OfferUp I recommend it to all my friends because its a great place to get good deals I’ve also met some great ppl that I keep untouch with just be safe and be careful in your deals 🥰 and keep it real , thanks for allowing me to be apart off something bigger than me and connects me to some great people.",5
924,"It’s an easy going app just wished..: That it tried more to get people to take down offers that aren’t marked as sold or they just simply leave the post there forever, like it should send them a notification or automatically take them down after there’s no activity on their account also Idk why it’s so complicated to delete post you favorited and are no longer interested in. Besides that it's clean, it's organized, and all around well executed. It's basically just a online garage sale that you can do anytime you don't need to pay fees or have a business, it's easy to sell and you just find yourself going on and window shopping lol 
TIP: don't take pictures of tangled/dirty messes in a darkroom with flas",4
925,Great and bad: The app is amazing sell wise. I sell more on it then any other app. Fee wise it’s the worst! Highest fees among most seller apps. Spam/fake profiles are also very bad! I have not had to deal with so much spam before! I will get spam messaging trying to get me to click on links or give personal info on every item I post! I will report and block and 5 minutes later I get them again from same person using different accounts. It’s hard to make sales when my messages are being blown up with spam. If they can fix it to where someone needs to be verified before messaging about items and fix it to where no more then 2 accounts from same IP address that would help a lot with the spam,4
926,"LOVE it!: Recently moved into a smaller home so have been buying and selling a lot. Furnished and decorated my entire home for less than $1000.  OfferUp is hands-down a MUCH more user-friendly app then LetGo. Easier to upload your pictures, make changes to what you've already listed, talk to people, etc.  Also SO much better to buy on as you can see multiple items on the screen at once, can easily check out who you're buying from and see what else they're selling, the descriptions are easier to read, and locations are more accurate. Also doesn't bombard you with useless notifications like the other app. I'm an official OfferUp addict!!!",5
927,"Fake sellers that con people out do the good ones: I started using this site to buy things and at first I received items very quick and good quality but only ordered one or two items that were a little pricier than some sellers, I read reviews and once they built up trust I have lost out on 7 orders that when u go on site late night they have very good deals so once I ordered between $50-$100 at one time with one seller the shipment never came and then don’t want to communicate and when I put a bad review they said customs fault then out items but promised I would get them when 6 months went by said going to complain to customs they offered refund but I forgot which card I used so got tired of asking and they stoped communicating but I won’t use sight no more. Especially when one seller has different busissness under different names. To bad those ones ruin it for the honest ones",1
928,"Forcing to join truyou take business elsewhere: Used app for a couple of months.
Now required to join truyou to message anyone for sales/purchases.
Why is it required? 
Send help to socialcare@offerup a couple of times and received the same generic response. 
Told them to escalate to supervisor. Heard nothing back. 
Heard from escalation team (whatever that dept is), was told to use government ID.
Offerup, why would I give my government ID to you? Is it mandatory. No. Do I work for you? No. So why then? For a $20 item? 
Let me put it this way, you are willing to lose hundreds /thousands of dollars because you are demanding I join truyou when it’s not mandatory? You can’t even explain to me the reasoning? 

There are better mobile phone applications that don’t require and are willing to receive compensation on the basis of sales/purchases from the end user.  Offerups 10% commission is higher than other businesses. 

Btw offerup, don’t bother responding to email socialcare. I’ve already did and it’s the same generic response.  Do you use bots? 

Thank you future users. You will be disappointed. Offerup clearly lacks capital to offer to its users a guarantee if an order is misplaced, lost or damaged or scammed. They are here to take your money and demand your government Id for a $20 item. 

Thanks but no thanks.",1
929,"Horrible customer service: The app itself is pretty great to buy and sell on but the customer service... I bought some AirPods which had been said to be authentic and bought them through offerup which means I had buyer protection. I inspected the AirPods and quickly realized that in person they were fakes. I submitted a buyer protection claim and they responded decently fast. Well I shouldn’t say “they” as it was just a automated message but after sending some pics of the Airpods and reasons why I wanted to return them, after a few more days someone from Offerup support replied telling me a specialist would help me resolve my issue. It has now been over 2 weeks since I have received that email and no one has contacted me since. Honestly quite possibly the worst customer service for shipping through the app, don’t buy through the app they don’t care if you get scammed they only care for the seller.",1
930,"16 Days And STILL Waiting To Get Paid: I sold an item and shipped it through the app ($30 commission to OfferUp), and agreed to an additional 1% so I could get •Instapaid• after the buyer has had three days to inspect the item. Well, he’s had it for fifteen days, loves it, and I still haven’t seen a penny. And yes, all of my payment information is already set up and verified. Knowing in advance that sellers would be agitated about these extended delays, the developers made it very difficult to contact then over this matter. Oddly enough, they made sure they didn’t have to wait for the commission fee on my sale. They took their money from the buyer immediately. Go figure. So, to be honest, it’s a decent app for selling things locally face-to-face. However, I will never bother shipping an item again.  I did get a congratulation message from them yesterday that the money had been deposited to my account, but it wasn’t.",1
931,"Great for selling but.....: Another Update: if you’re overseas, in my case Thailand, they won’t let you access the app or the website. Dumb.

Update- the app trolls everything to feed you ads. Also dumb policy that doesn’t let you add any outside link to a product. Ex. I’m selling a tool. I link the website to HomeDepot where I got it. OfferUp delete my account. Trash app

I have good luck so far selling stuff, but I’m not a fan of all the ads. I know the company needs to make money, but they place ads in the selling wall based off of things you clicked on. It’s kinda a creep mode and I’m not a fan of it. Also it doesn’t always notify me when I get a response to an add. And the email notification is strange and does not come right away and if it does it sends multiple emails. App needs work.",3
932,Went to crap: I use to love his app and used it daily. All of a sudden i am banned without any explanation. Once i inquired they told me it was because i was reposting old posts instead of bumping them and paying money. They gave me access and told me to archive instead. Which i did. And suddenly am banned instead. There are people frequently selling guns or robbing people or selling fake Rolex’s and you guys would rather ban someone with five stars and over 100 sales. That is the dumbest thing i have ever seen a successful company do. Give me access back to my account or i will continue to share my story and slander your app. Don’t punish positive and good sellers. Aim at targeting the bad ones.,5
933,"People: The app Is great. And I appreciate how they don’t ask for a piece of your money. The infrastructure of the app is pretty solid too.
That being said, I have some ideas that might help. It would help to know a little of what the person you are talking to is like. I thought of having either a section for reviewing( and viewing reviews of) people you communicate with. Also, to see reviews that have been written on people(be able to write about a buyer/seller)
I believe this would improve the experience of those who just want/need to buy and sell. 
There are way too many people that say they will come but never show up without any notice.",5
934,"Ease of use and big plus: The app is cool and very user friendly. You can have a thought in your head to sell something and in the same amount of time have it listed. The only thing is( I feel bad because this isn't really offer ups fault) the people who offer usually offer a stupid ridiculous price. This makes people create unreasonable asking prices. Like if I listed $400 sofa for $200 people offer $$25 and $50! I guess they figure it can't hurt, it just waste time. The other is when you accept an offer I rarely have someone follow thru. It takes a lot of prodding to get a response. These aren't necessarily the apps fault it's just the experience",5
935,"Search & Presentation needs improvement: Can only search in 10, 20, 30 mile increments for location then it jumps to unlimited.  Need to be able to search in user defined perimeter or add 40, 50, 60, etc mile increments.  Although you can sort by closest location, it should be part of the interface & user definable.  The app lacks the price of the items listed unless it is an advertisement.  If should have the price in the lower right corner & the two letter state abbreviation in the top right corner.   Can only sell from the app, should be able to sell from a laptop version of the interface.  Photos from the previous posts remain on the sequential post, shouldn’t have to deselect previous posts photos.",3
936,"Horrible Ads: I could see a one time $2 take ads away. But it’s absolutely crazy they want to push a month sub for a classified app to take the ads away. The ads themselves are intrusive, have nothing to do with my interests, often are in languages I don’t know, can’t be closed out of, and sometimes the embedded ones pop up when scrolling even though you aren’t clicking them. I use the app a lot, as it’s intended, but feeling more and more like I need to find something else. It’s such a lame money grab. Offer up, why mess this up? You took out CL, you are the top classified app. You have a massive amount of users and data. Make money off of that and stop making me close app. Eventually it won’t be worth buying and selling on this platform, because mostly people are never going to pay for this greedy sub. Do better.",1
937,"Would be better if there weren’t so many dealership ads.: I think the app would be a lot better if, at the very least, you could either block or filter out certain sellers. There are too many stores/dealerships listing hundreds of postings for items they have in stock at their physical locations. I’m only interested in local listings from individual people selling and giving away their old items, yet my feed is crowded with hundreds of listings from salespersons (cars/phones/mattresses/new furniture, etc.). Even typing in items I’m searching for, filtering through categories, and doing whatever it takes to not get these local ads, they ALWAYS pop up and flood my search results.",3
938,"Will block your account for no reason: I’ve sold on offer up and let go for years. Suddenly, my account is blocked for no reason. I sent a request to customer service and it says I should expect a reply I’m 24-48 hours. Never got a reply, sent another request explaining I already sent a request and attached previous request with it. Receive a message back stating I have multiple accounts. Not true, I have one account. I tried to change the email associated with my account, but never tried to create another. Responded to offer up support telling them this, still haven’t received a reply. It’s been a week and a half. Definitely past their 24-48 hour quote. My husband and mother in law both had issues with being blocked for no reason as well. All 5 star reviews, all legitimate sales and no illegal or banned items.",1
939,Used to be a good app.: I would honestly leave 0 if not for the fact you actually find 1 or 2 posts that are legit. 1st of all there is SO MUCH spam/scams on that app now it’s not even funny. #2 almost every post that is there is duplicated upwards to 10 times. #3 the filters are just horrible and because people put low prices on everything just to get you to look at the items when you try and filter for something ACTUALLY in your price range you still have to scroll through all the scam posts and duplicated posts just to find anything especially dealing with cars. #4 when looking for a vehicle the amount of dealerships that are on this app is ungodly these profiles and posts need to be reviewed in some kind of way to prevent scam and dealerships on this app. Like the title says this use to be a wonderful app not it’s just a bunch of crap.,1

941,Hit or miss: I feel this app may work best in larger cities. I have sold some but it is hit or miss. I receive a lot of looks so I feel either people just scroll through and look and if they are interested that it’s too far to come. A bone of contention for me is that buyers need to understand that you go to the seller if you want it. It’s no different if you pick up in store-you go get it! It’s a little annoying when buyers expect you to jump through hoops for an item especially if we are talking low prices. I have had better sales through Craigslist because people are searching for a particular item usually. I end up taking stuff to consignment to split with them just to move it out of my house.,3
942,"Blocked and acct disabled!: Finally we have decided to leave the offer-up!!! There are a lot of other app that has much better options and “customer service”.

Our acct suddenly got disabled (we used this for business) tried contacting customer support, all we have received are automated response. Weeks had passed and still no response. So we decided to make another acct thinking it’ll work. It actually worked for few weeks then suddenly got banned again. Of course! Again… no response from them. This time, months has passed we even tried getting new number to work with this app but results are the same. When a ‘customer service’ finally reached out.

It looks cleaner, but it’s missing a lot of functionality it used to have. In messages, you could swipe up to reload, to check if they were any new messages from someone, that’s gone. When viewing someone’s profile, you could look at their followers, and the people following them; this is gone, and replaced with just a number of followers. Additionally, the ability to follow anyone at all is completely gone now, which is incredibly frustrating. I don’t understand why they felt the need to remove such a basic, useful features, but that’s what they’ve done. I was hoping this would just be a minor UI bug but it has persisted this way for multiple versions/updates in a row, I’ve lost hope that this will be fixed.",1

Update now I bought something on here and the person said I could have it free if I only paid shipping and once I said I would the person deleted there post led item. But now I paid 71 bucks to receive the item and I keep messaging the person for my money back with no response. And I used cash app to pay for the item. So lesson here don’t pay for anything off the app unless u have Your cash app card as your primary card to give and receive payments on. This app Was great until I could not open the app. Fixed that!

However, I do recommend so changes to improve the user experience. I find it inconvenient while scrolling to check each listing for the price. It would be wonderful if the prices were listed on the thumbnail so that I can easily sort between what is in my budget. Additionally, adding swipe features (swipe down to exit, etc) would allow for easier app navigation. Overall, I won’t stop using the app but those would definitely help with accessing more within the app!",5

I send them an email to get assistance but all I got was some BS automated response about how “certain items” required this added verification.  I replied back explaining the reasons why I will not disclose this but never received a response.  I have bought and sold on Craigslist, eBay and Facebook for years without being forced to give full access to such sensitive information....

949,"Flakes, fakes, scammers, and cheapskates.: Yup, that’s right. This app is filled with nothing but flakes, fakes, scammers, and cheapskates.

Been selling on this disaster of a platform for a few months now. Here is what I have learned:

Rule #1. Plan on listing your item for double what you’re willing to part with it for. Doesn’t matter how good of a “deal” the buyer is getting, they’ll ALWAYS offer you 50% of your listing price.

Rule #2. Learn Spanish. 99% of the users on here “speak Spanish” which explains the need for rule # 1.

Rule #3. Be prepared to waste your entire day waiting around for people who will never show up and don’t have enough common courtesy to let you know they won’t be coming. Definitely related to #2.

Rule #4. Now that you’ve agreed to take half of what you were originally selling your item for, you’re now expected to deliver it too?! That’s right, most of these people don’t have cars or are too lazy to come to you to buy the stuff they grinded you down on your price for.

Rule #5. The majority of people using this platform are low life scum. Once you get this through your head, you’ll realize selling on eBay wasn’t that bad after all. Ebay has lots of checks and balances in place to keep the trash this platform is filled with off of eBay.

Good luck, you’re gonna need it...",1
950,"Do not get this app: I joined offer up during the holiday season, just to make some money. At first everything was going well, I was selling well, I had 5 stars!

Then a few days ago I listed a Forever 21 purse, they quickly sent me an email letting me know that they removed my listing, no details given, I contacted them, and believe me it's VERY, VERY hard to get a hold of offer up, the ONLY WAY is via email. They replied and let me know that the reason they removed my listing was because they said I could not use professional pictures, I told them that they were my pictures, I painstakingly took these pictures so buyers can see the items clearly.

The next day, I listed another item, I noticed that there were NO VIEWS, I listed another item, same thing, no views. I started noticing that none of my other items were getting more listings, as if it had all come to a screeching halt.

I still don't know if I've been banned or what? I sent them an email, but NO ANSWER!

The first one, we went for a ride, they liked it, pulled out a bag with cash and we had to go to the bank to have the teller count it. It was too many bills for me. I had to turn the other two prospects away. Received the asking price minus $250 from near $5K price. 
My neighbor wants to sell a nice snow thrower. No calls so far.  I told him to download the app, he is smiling already with hope after he saw how I did so well.",5
952,"Scam app: Please do not download this app , the owner of the business is scamming every person on this app , they either make you pay to promote your item so you can buyers or they disable your account for no type of reason while your account still have your card information on there . They tend to take money from you even if you account is disabled, plus when you try to get your account  from being disabled they’ll something like they made changes to your account, it’s all lies they taking money from every person downloads this app , it use to be a great until it started adding ads and making you have to pay to promote whatever item you trying to sell nor can you buy products on here because no never replies because of the app , so I’m warning you please do not download app it’s a scam",1
953,Terrible customer service..: I was a faithful everyday user of this marketplace and posted and sold - browsed and purchased thousands of items from day one. At one point I went a couple months without receiving a single message or offer and i found that odd considering I was a 5 star verified seller with long history and a bunch of cool stuff priced very well so I simply wrote a message to offer up and within a few hours I was back receiving messages.. fast forward a couple years and same thing happens and of course I send them a message to let them know.. and another ..and another one.. you get the point.. I even upgraded to premium and still no messages received no offers  for my postings.. it’s been over a year and a half  I haven’t been able to even message other sellers.. thanks for that offer up!,1
954,"I USED TO love OfferUp… Now you have to pay!!: I used to *love* OfferUp. It was one of my favorite apps. However now they are charging users $8 PER MONTH just to use their app, and if you don’t pay it then there is constant pop up ads and also additional ads scattered in the regular for sale items that take you to TEMU and a lot of other spammy places. I never leave reviews, however I am happy to leave a review for this because I am so frustrated as a user. I used to love OfferUp, now every time a stupid ad pops up I just close OfferUp and look elsewhere (Craigslist, Marketplace, etc.) where I don’t have to pay to view things that I want to buy, or see constant annoying ads! VERY DISAPPOINTED and wish they would go back to the fabulous app that they used to be without charging a stupid amount of money monthly just to search for items. 😫",1
955,"Too slow after 5mins: The app becomes slow after just a few minutes and starts to lag. After looking at a few items it gets longer and longer to load each listing you click on after that. You have to click on a lot of listings to see the price as well as filter out the spam/fake/broken/“sponsored” listings to get to some actual listings. After several minutes some listings just don’t load at all and the entire app gets slow. Offerup has been up and running for over 10yrs and at least seem to try but fail to make the proper adjustments of the basic necessities of any app like decent loading times to become a real competitor with the better marketplaces like eBay, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace and even Craigslist. I wouldn’t pay for a subscription or for upgrades, I’m glad I didn’t.",1
956,"Ok app, but disruptive notifications and ads: Pretty solid for buying and selling. No complaints on that front. 

My complaints are with how the application is intentionally designed. First the advertisements within the listings appear to have greater clickable real estate than other listings (shady tactics). Then there are the full-screen advertisements… which is fine, but not something that you have to deal with in other buying and selling apps/sites. 

My biggest complaint is that I have gone through all the notification settings within the app and turned all off except for messages. However, OfferUp continues to send notifications for things that are turned off in the settings. Strongly considering uninstalling the app and only using OfferUp from a browser.",2
957,"Woks well enough: Unfortunately the saved lists are difficult to manage and can’t be sorted, so each list is a mishmash of saves. The app often refreshes automatically if you switch apps, even if you’re looking at a specific listing, so you have to search for it again. There are ads sprinkled in with the listings to get you to click on them, which takes you to other pages, some of which are scam sites with counterfeit items. Plus now there are intrusive, full-page ads that pop up all the time and interrupt browsing. I acknowledge the need to turn a profit, but the ads are sneaky and intrusive, popping up while you’re scrolling and trying to get you to download other apps.",3
958,"Timely replies: The only thing that irritates me is when I reply to an ad to either ask questions or purchase something it sometimes takes the seller hours or even days to respond to my request. I understand people who sell things have a life but if your selling something it would be nice and courteous if the seller could make contact to the potential buyer in a timely Fashion. Also I noticed a lot of things that I have potentially thought of buying maybe stolen? Example: I met a seller in a safe location, his appearance was questionable? His vehicle looked like he was living in it and when he opened the trunk of the car and it was overflowing with Brand New Dewalt power tools still sealed. Let’s just saw say I didn’t buy what he was advertising, he got upset and accused me of wasting his time. After that I have slowed down viewing OfferUp.",1
959,"Annoying adds: I just “clicked” on the apple music add for the 7th time in less than 5 minutes!!! Interesting how I don’t even click on it but if while sliding down the app my finger stops on it or just touches it a little bit it takes me to the web browser!! No other ad does that!! Super annoying!! I really don’t want to give up on offer up because I think is a great app but with these apple music ads I don’t even want to open it anymore!! Also, my husband bought an item from a person and this person made a mistake 3 times, every time this guy would cancel the order and asked my husband to order it again, next thing we know, my husband’s account got locked, he can’t use offer up anymore, tried to contact customer service and no answer. He downloaded Mercari. I am leaning towards market place 🙄",1
960,"The program is not working as before.: At the beginning I made good purchases, but for some time now, despite the fact that an update of the application has already been made, it seems that I was in an insistent chat, where I did not get any response, from any seller, it was not for a matter of writing At the time of publication, it also happens to me that I put a range and they give me articles from areas of other cities, I looked in their support option but I did not get any answer to my problem, I hope they can solve it, I like the application, but no It's working correctly.",5
961,"Great but it could be better: I really like most of the features on Offerup however I don't like that people are able to list the same item multiple times. It is extremely irritating when browsing for something and having the same item pop up multiple times. Also, a seller or buyer should be able to rate a potential seller or buyer in which they have had interaction with regardless of whether or not the person purchased the item. One last pet peeve...someone should be monitoring that a seller lists their item in the correct category. I am amazed at how many items are listed in the wrong category.",5
962,"Great, but needs a couple improvements: The app itself is a great idea and I’ve been using it for a long time. Im pleased with the overall experience. a few improvements could be made to the messaging system which often delays incoming messages. i very much dislike not being able to turn off notifications for the apps notifications and think it’s a bit obnoxious that I get pinged for what I think is a message when it’s just the app trying to get me to use the app. Not cool.  I used the free trial to get more traffic for an item I was selling and it did absolutely nothing. If these few things were improved the app would be 100% great.",4
963,A month later and still waiting on deposit: Still waiting on my deposit a month later. I have contacted customer service three times and spoke with three different representatives. Uploaded my ID to verify my account for payment only to be told they never received my info. Second time i was asked to upload my ID i was told they finally received it and would hopefully have it resolved within the week. Still waiting and have not heard back from the representatives about how much long my deposit is going to take. This app is horrible with customer service and payment processing. I waited a whole week and a half for my deposit only to be told i needed to send them a picture of my drivers license. Keep in mind i had to contact them about why my money was taking so long after the buyer accepted their items.,1
964,"Not as good as LetGo: OfferUp lacks a basic features that LetGo used to include:  OfferUp does not allow users to filter search results by date posted. I really appreciated this feature when using LetGo. The lack of a date filter makes it too difficult and frankly too frustrating to find relevant results that are still available.

For example, many times when I’ve found an item I’d like to save or purchase, it will turn out it was posted months or even years ago and unlikely to still be on sale. I realize you can sort results by newest to oldest but that doesn’t help me when I get to basically the second page and all of the listings are too old to be relevant. For every search, I’m left clicking on random items over and over again as I browse just to keep track of how old the listings are at that point on the page. It’s disruptive. 

Additionally, here are a couple other features that would make it easier to navigate the app, and prevent users from being repeatedly disappointed by irrelevant listings: 1) a filter to remove items that have already been sold, 2) price/posting date information in the thumbnail. 

I miss LetGo. I’d be really excited if OfferUp added these features so I can be a frequent user like I was before. 

Thanks!",1
965,"Annoying: I got sucked into Offerup through their acquisition of Letgo. After several months of giving it a shot, I hate it and I’ve taken it off my phone. I’m likely going to cave in and go to Facebook. I live outside of a major metropolitan area ( though still within 60 minutes of probably 250,000 people) but it’s extremely difficult to find relevant ads. I’m on a classified site because I don’t want to have something shipped and I know how to get to eBay on my own. It also drives me crazy to search and find ads that are a year old!!! That crap is gone, don’t show it to me. I’m not going to buy an atv from California when I live in Michigan. I’m not going to buy a used hammer and have it shipped. Developers: Pay attention to to the community you acquire and look at the attributes that they signed up for. Letgo is welcome to contact me if you want more ideas on how to fix this junk.",1
966,"Sad: Letgo was awesome. Would sell
Things all The time. Now we got stuck merged with offer up. Havent sold a thing on here. Refuse to use shipping as my items are cheap and 12% of my profit would goto offer up no ty. 100% for me not the app gets money too. I’m so disgusted letgo merged. They were the best. Ive used listia, fb, Craigslist but letgo was THE best. I’m suffering now in offer up. No stars On this app so I’m guessing I’m not the only one who believes this. I wish letgo would go back to being by itself. Was quick, easy and had repeat buyers. What a waste merging . Guess I’ll have to keep looking for better apps . Letgo you were able to get cash in hand none of this middle person. This is the worst app ever. Spoken to others who are quite angry letgo merged and they all said same thing this app is horrible. Please letgo, go back to your original for. This app is a flipping nightmare 🤬",1
967,"Great app, terrible sellers: I love OfferUp so much but I a big problem with the sellers. I’ve contacted over 20 different for different ps4s. And only 2/22 have answered me back within a week. Out of those 2, I was ready to purchase the ps4 the next day, first thing in the morning. He held it for me and everything. I even pushed back my plans that morning so I can go to the atm and pick it up. 1 HOUR LATER, he tells me he sells it to a person for $10 more. The next girl, I’m ready to buy, but she’s shipping, she only takes cash app tho, long story short, she blocked my number and my offerup account as well as kept the $20 I sent to make sure the payment would go through bc the full amount wasnt. And to the ppl that haven’t answered back, are you guys really serious abt selling your products or not???",2
968,"Great, but clearing items is nonexistent.: I would give this 5 stars, except that I can’t delete items that I sell on other apps or decide not to sell anymore.  I have to mark them as sold or archive them.

Other apps allow me to delete postings, no matter the status.  LetGo for example let’s me delete items, it even has a timer for items that automatically deletes them after thirty days if they don’t sell.  It is very frustrating to message a buyer who posted something months ago and doesn’t respond at all because they probably deleted the app and just left the posting.

OfferUp is full of dead accounts with loads of spam items that never disappear.  This makes it hard to find the active accounts that are selling stuff.",3
969,Good but one very bad issue please fix it: The app works fine but if the shipper does not ship to item in a certain amount of days then it automatically cancels it and I wish you guys would take that off because that’s not fair to the buyer because what if it’s something that you can’t buy from a different like website or place so it makes it very invaluable so can you please fix that I would love it if you’re going to fix it could you extend the time for like two weeks because that’s an a good amount of time really plus the money doesn’t come in as soon as you wanted to so could you make the money come in exactly when the person next to purchase right then and there.,4
970,"Needs Improvement: I enjoy this app but I would like to see a few changes. First, the categories should be broken into more detailed categories to browse listings more efficiently. For example, if I want to look at bicycles, I would like the option to select a sub category for the type of bicycle that I'm interested in. An option to browse Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes, and BMX Bikes would be a huge help to narrow my search. Also if I decide to browse motorcycles it would be convenient to select between Dirt Bikes and Street Motorcycles as another sub category under motorcycles. My last complaint would be to keep the option to archive posts but also give the user the ability to delete a post permanently. It is a pain to have sold items or unlisted items archived.",3
971,"Dont bother: App started off pretty good. Then all the sudden you get all the fake spam accounts, the “we buy all iphones acct”, and their locations are awful! They have items popping up on my feed that are 60miles + away from me, not exactly local. Then the ads that are local aren spread throughout the really far ones! Also it seems that you can’t post multiple times without it being flagged when all you’re trying to do is get exposure for your item for sale! But then again the app wants you to pay to “bump” items! Why can’t we just keep posting without them being taken down? Some accounts seem to be able to spam tons of the same ads with zero issues!! If nothing changes im deleting and will be using “let go” and stick with craigslist also! At least with craigslist you expect lowballers! Here everyone wants over 50% off for no reason!",1
972,"Piece of s#!+: For more than a year I’ve been trying to sell stuff . I didn’t realize at first it was that nobody saw my post . Using another’s person phone tried to see what I posted and they just didn’t exist . I can see what other peoples sell but I can’t contact them either . Contacted costumer service and I said I even created two accounts with different emails and they replied that was illegal to do . Really ! But they didn’t fix the freaking problem. I just sent another complain , I was told they will send an email and the email haven’t come in either . What the heck ! Your CS are the worst",5
973,"Ads, ads, ads! Popup! Popup! Popups! 😡: I have used this app tremendously since 2016 when I parted ways with Craig’s List. OfferUp was great for a long while there. Even after the Letgo merger. LetGo was terrible and I was afraid there bad design would infect OfferUp. I’m not sure if it’s the case here or not but it’s gone by the way of corporate greed. Constant Ads and pop ups, constant. Can’t shop anymore with out being bombarded with ads. Click one item and boom ad! Scrolling, looking, boom popup ad. Some even seem to click or activate themselves and take you out of the app. 

I am a heavy’ish user. 219 5-star reviews. 300+ items sold. I’m sure over 1,000 purchases. 

I loved and shared my love for OfferUp with everyone. But now with the ads and the amount of scams it’s time to move on. FB Marketplace may have scams too but at least I can shop and sell in peace.",1
974,Full of Scammers!!: I remember when Craigslist first came out people had integrity. Not on offer up. Please watch out they are full of scam artist and offer up is not doing anything about. I purchased A 2002 Honda CR-V from offer up about a month ago and when I went to register the car it was stolen they seller changed the vin number. Offer up is doing nothing about this matter at all. I am out of 3k and offer up only responded to my email with a automated email. I wouldn’t trust this site at all. Trust me Facebook marketplace and eBay are much better. Please don’t get scammed from this app!! The scammers are getting really smart. Also never pay first. They added this feature and scammers are selling items they don’t even own. It’s so easy to screenshot a item and sell it and get a fake address on google. Please I’m begging you don’t use offer up!!,1
975,"Not as good as others: I used to us CL to sell stuff and was highly successful but this app , though free to use, gets no action. I’ve tried selling high end and mint condition furniture here and not even a nibble. Tried selling a table and chairs that are worth thousands but I dropped price to a few hjndred so either everyone’s broke, they have no clue what posh or rich people use, or simply do not see the deal because it’s buried in a mess of scattered junk people are desperate to sell. 
I’ve tried selling a few other things that are I guess too nice to buy. 
I’ve compared my sales with others and not only was my stuff almost brand new or never used, it was top brand and very fine quality. I look at the competition and it’s old used beat up stuff. 
There’s literally people on here trying to pawn off old shoes they wore and asking ridiculous amounts. 
Overall Offer up is more like Offer hidden so try and navigate the truly high end things from Uncle joes sewing machine. 
Go to categories and start the task of scrolling down for an hour. 
CL is free in most states but in NC they think it’s ok to charge users. 
Offer up is a dud try FB market place or pay and use eBay.",2
976,Regarding sellers: I wish there was a way to report a seller who actually sold me an item told me it was mine and then he decides to sell it to someone else and I believe for a higher price. I honestly believe when a person does that you should not be on here because you’re not a man of your word and when you are born you have your word and your character in this person destroyed his character and he’s not a man to me he’s a coward he enjoys money more than being a manThat’s just not right it’s really upsetting to me after driving one hour there in one hour back to pick up the item with a coward all he cares about money instead of being a man of his word.,4
977,"Go ahead, get scammed. No customer service.: They “offer up” zero protection for fraud. This app is worse than Craigslist for scammers. They changed the one star review I left for someone who blatantly lied about the couch he sold me and purposely hid damage I SPECIFICALLY asked him about from a 1, to a 5. That is by far the most shady thing I’ve ever seen a selling app do. He was clearly really good at what he does and part of the reason I trusted him was due to all of his 5 star ratings. Then I watched them change my 1 into a 5. Whoops. Makes sense now. I filed for help and offered 100% documented proof of my claim and have received zero return correspondence. Zilch. This is the first time I’ve seen an app actively help a scammer by not only not looking into the issue but having the nerve to hide honest reviews which mark the scammers. Every deal they make receives 5 stars whether real or not.",1
978,Scammers !!! Don’t waste your time: I bought a series x Xbox November the 11th a day or 2 later they said it was preparing the shipping through offer up...They sent me a email saying that the tracking number was made but the person never shipped the order out...They then sent me another email 2 days later saying they reminded the seller to ship the item...I was told that if it wasn’t shipped by 3 days my money would be back into my account...I checked my account today to see bc they had it pending on my card the whole time an then today it was actually charged an not pending...There isn’t any customer service which is crazy only different topics to get answers from..I now see the seller with the same product he was selling to me back on his profile with a higher price...I need my money put back onto my card or I’m going to take legal action with offer up...,1
979,"Horrible experience! forcing you to give up ID: OfferUp would rather harass their trusted sellers than deal with the thousands of spams account on their app asking for your phone number and private info! OfferUp will shadow ban your items, flag you if you ask to pay outside of OfferUp even though the point of the app is to meet up and  will disable your messages, all so you can give up your ID to their TruYou program which apparently makes you a trusted seller. I have over 100 sales and all perfect stars yet I’m going through this! Never once had an issue with a buyer yet OfferUp is forcing me to give up my ID because I got flagged by the spam accounts? Makes no sense! Nor do they ever take the time to actually fix their issue! Just horrible experience! I can almost guarantee most of their reviews on here are purchase as if you google their reviews they are a 1 star app!",1
980,"Buying or Selling: This is a great app. No problem with the app at all, easy to use and keeps track of buyers and sellers. It's simple and anyone can use it. 
The problem lies with the people. You will get lots of window shoppers who make offers an never get back to you even after asking a low ball price. Watch out for those low balls, most the time they don't have a car and want you to drive across town and deliver a $3. Item. It can get down right ridiculous. Other than people wasting your time, overall it's a great app. You can rate your buyers and sellers. Too bad you can't rate people who make lowball and have no transportation. All and all its great!",5
981,"Horrible!!!: Ever since the two apps have combined the app is NOTHING but scams and “promoted” post. You’ll see the same items over and over again. If you report people for scams they do nothing about it. People who try to sell cars on there want you to pay and then they will “ship” the car to you, ya okay no thanks I would rather keep my money, I would not trust anything that has to do with shipping. Not one single trustworthy person on this app that I have come across yet. Wasn’t the best app before but even worse now. Step your game up people. The scams are everywhere! Terrible terrible. Just so your customer service team knows that sending the exact same message over and over to every single person will do nothing. Any emails I got back were clearly just copied and pasted. How about do something about it instead of copying and pasting the same thing to everyone.",1
982,"Money stolen from me, OfferUp glitch: I’ve sold and purchased items on OfferUp locally with no problem, great.  I noticed 2 items from a seller so I reached out to him and negotiated a priced for $100. plus $20. for shipping.  I went onto OfferUp payment transaction to input my credit card and OfferUp consistently replied “credit card BLOCKED”, knowing the card was valid with available funds I still tried with the same response.  Exhausted all efforts and afraid the items would be sold, I sent $120. through PayPal and my items were never shipped.  Long story short I forwarded the police report and all needed info. to OfferUp and the thief acct. was closed but OfferUp never responded once they realized this was primarily their fault for not allowing my card to be accepted because of OfferUp system app glitch.  Unless it’s a local transaction I will NEVER use OfferUp.  Total disappointment and I’m still out of $120., THANKS A LOT OFFERUP 😡😢😭",1
983,"Sale & Shop you take your chances: I have found some great deals here & I have saved myself some money. When ever I have sold people have paid a lot less than what they are worth but got payed more than a yard sale. 

I really hate when people say they will buy something and they take forever to respond and end up saying no. You really have to have patience. There is a lot of people who will just ask say they want to purchase but won’t buy your item for what is worth some people can seriously be cheap. It can get annoying. Hopefully they better the app because sometimes it’s just a waste of my time. I deleted the app twice before because of how frustrating it can get.",4
984,"I Love OfferUp: I love using OfferUp but it looks like I may be punished for a seller’s error, and an easily fixed glitch. The seller wrote me that they mistakenly shipped the wrong item. I’m happy to return the item but it sits at the post office while I’m out of town for a week. I have not yet physically received this item. And will not be home until after the 3 day examination period to follow through. Submitting Buyer Protection forms have not addressed the specifics of this issue. It would be helpful to have a Customer Service contact number in the Buyer Protection reply for extenuating circumstances not listed online. This would  alleviate unnecessary stress on both buyers and sellers. In all other transactions I have loved using OfferUp and continue to encourage my family and friends to use it as well. If not for this one issue I would easily rate this a 5-star app, and hopefully will be able to after this is resolved.",1
985,People bargain just to bargain: I got banned at one point. Either because I would delete an old post and repost it or for taking higher offers and taking the highest bidder. Both are not ban worthy imo. But VPN fixes that. People on these apps bargain just to bargain. I post what I want for the item. Don’t low ball me. I could offer something on here for free and people would be like “pay me and I’ll take it”. I don’t sell things for someone to profit and resell. It’s grimy. If you don’t like the price go buy it new. I’m asking less than 60% of new price on most items. People on this app love to use the prepared messages this app creates. 90% of them will ask if it’s for sale and when you say yes they don’t reply. It’s like they have no idea what they want or are just wasting peoples time. I’d give it a one but at least there’s an app for this stuff,2
986,"Great app, Still not compliant with privacy policies: While I love this app I started to question what TRUYOU was and found out that there were multiple breaches of data in Maryland and that they have a 1.2% BBB approval rating. I tried to deactivate my account which cross-linked me back to Facebook even though I have no longer a Facebook account. As somebody In information security it’s not the app I really have a problem with it’s the fact that I had to give them my drivers license number and they can’t tell me why or what truyou  is. I highly suggest that they post something about that and become more clear to the consumer as it is a very sales friendly application but with market climate changing they’re going to lose business if they do not clarify their privacy policy.",3
987,"Mostly ok, but a few common UI design flaws: Fairly straightforward operation and not difficult to learn how it works.  The app is not immune to the most common error in user interface design, that of occasional blind alleys where there are no apparent options to undo or back out of a screen or operation.

Photo selection from the camera roll uses an interesting flagging solution that is conceptually a good way to specify which photos are uploaded for use.  However the scrolling and selection UI needs further refinement.  It needs a scroll bar to separate that operation from touch selection of individual photos.  Mixing the those two touch/drag operations results in confusing, inadvertent, photo selection while scrolling.

The app is optimized for small phone screen use.  One hopes the developer will eventually support scaling for larger screens such as the iPad series.

Messaging is way better than the utter chaos of Facebook but a wish list would include options to graphically better display the number of messages and time stamps in a thread without having to open each one individually.",3
988,"Subscription for Premium is misleading: Most people have the experience of starting a trial subscription for some service with the intention to cancel before it renews, and subsequently forgetting to terminate the subscription resulting in a fee. In my experience, when this occurs, contacting the company ASAP to explain the situation and ask for a refund results in a full or partial return of money and end to the unwanted subscription. 
I did just that today following my debit chard being charged for Offerup Premium. While the response was quick, it was completely dismissive of my request. I would have been satisfied with even a nominal portion of the subscription fee being refunded. And for the perceived unwillingness for OfferUp to refund me I have rated it 2 stars. Work on your customer service. 👍",2
989,"Bring back let go: Okay hear me out. Wether you bought out let go or saw eachother in the same market and merged I think everyone can agree and admit one thing. The people at let go knew how to do this. it’s a good concept like a local eBay I used let go to start my retro gaming collection and got to meet some cool people, however I have never once been able to get into contact with anyone on offer up either the post is dead or the people were scared away by poor development. Here’s the thing, if your use let go instead of offer ups version of this idea you will be a lot more successful, absolutely run ads that’s fine you have to make money but be smart and use the better of the two apps.",3
990,"banning with no notice: Edit: Support was very helpful but infuriating that I had to reach out instead of being informed

I’ve used this app for years. In the past couple months I’ve felt that no one is responding to my messages. Turns out Offerup has a policy to shadow ban accounts with no notice. So I’ve been using this app. Messaging people to no response. Browsing for months. Spending time every day FOR THE APP TO BE SECRETLY DISABLED. HOW HARD IS IT TO EMAIL ME THAT MY ACCOUNT IS DISABLED. Now I’m emailing support and the account I created a day before to be able to purchase something because my main account isn’t working is against their terms of service and I’ve gotta delete the account with an active purchase waiting to be shipped is sitting. Quality of life is not something they remotely have considered.",2
991,"Offer up? More like offer sensitive data: My gripes lie with the platform, app, and management.

In concept it’s a great site. If it weren’t run by someone in a basement that is. You get scammed? Email support sends no response back. No phone lines either to call. You get banned? Emails you a link to appeal - link doesn’t even work. Only way to do a tru-u verification setup is through the application. Only way to make listings is through the application.. with no way of sharing photos or other data, it creates a scenario where what you see in a listing is all you know. Unless you want to go spend your time to head out in person and discover that “new bike” is a rusted pile of junk and you just wasted gas to go across town. 

What’s that? You need to tru-you verify so you can message sellers or make listing? But you’re already tru-you verified? Guess you have to wait 4 months on empty eggshell promises that they’ll update the site and fix that issue while you’re bombarded by messages asking about items you’re trying to sell. 

With layers of anti “scammer” protection so thick, you can get banned over miscommunication and for reasons not even told to you. And with no way to appeal. This platform makes Craigslist look “safe”.",1
992,"1st customer was scammer: A fake profile named Benjamin Peterson started asking for personal information like phone#, address. He claimed he was wanting to make a check transaction and mail the check that was $1000k more than the item i was selling. Sounded too good to be true. He then wanted to make it my responsibility to pay movers and stated that after the check clears he would give me contact info for the movers to come get the item. He was making excuses for not wanting to talk on the phone, but when he eventually did his voice did not match up with his profile picture in which showed an older white man. I’ve had a few african friends so im familiar with their accent. This “buyer’s” voice was a young African male that also had a fake phone number when calling back.",2
993,"It’s ok, but be ready!: The app is ok sometimes.  You can sell stuff but be ready for lots of wasted time on the game playing, fakes and fraud.   OfferUp needs some big time changes as they make it way to easy for people, can’t call most of them buyers, to just push a button to say “is this still available?” and other one touch questions that are used 95% of the time by fakes.  It also needs to automatically delete old post as most are old to extremely old.  Don’t have to take my word on that, just try a search and you’ll get post’s that are months to many years old.  They keep them on the app as that’s how they make their money.  
So if you have lots of time to waist dealing with the trash out there that don’t have a life, this app may work for you.",2
994,Got banned for nothing and shadow banned: I didn’t do anything wrong I’m not sure if this is a mistake but I got a email saying I wasn’t able to use offer up and said that I couldn’t make a new account to post again and now it seems to me that I can’t get views on any of my posts I tried to repost on the new account and I don’t get any views my account that got banned was shadow banned then token down🤦🏻‍♂️ I think offer up was better before it had letgo and think they need to fix a few issues with there app and the bugs and how there is false accusations when I’ve never been banned or shadow banned from any apps I’ve sold numerous of items and bought numerous items and traded numerous items and got 4 star ratting and had a top of the notch account with 4 out 5 verified reputation on offer up never did I do something wrong,1
995,"Lots of scammers be careful: OfferUp is not a bad website only problem is that theres so much scammers that it makes you want to regret posting. I post 1 shoe and got 48 messages in less than 5 minutes and all of them are scammers and trying to send you codes to hack your google account etc. Please be careful while on this app. Hopefully OfferUp will improve their protection against these scammers soon. December 3 i got scammed once again but this time i recieved counterfeit money. I did not have time to check the money because the guy sped off in his car and took my $350 shoes. There is no way i can identify the scum that scammed me because offerup has not made any improvements to their app and just lets people make fake pages. Highly disappointed because i lost my shoes, money and time and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Great going OfferUp 👎🏼",1
996,Scam?: I had a rather scary experience on here and it might’ve been just specific to me. I tried to sell three kpop albums and one user replied to all of them and would not discuss buying unless I gave my number and I refused so they gave me theirs but I still refused to. After I would refuse to talk over text they stopped replying. One good thing though was there was a tip the app gave as soon as it recognized the person was asking for my number or had given me their number it said to not give out my phone number to anyone. I almost gave the person my number because I thought that was how the app worked or something like that but that tip is honestly a good safety feature and I’d like to see more like that. Thanks!,3
997,"Only Attracts Rude People/Time Waster: I don’t know what it is about this app but it is the worst way to sell things online. I have had nothing but rude people, no shows, people who agree to buy then cancel 5 minutes before pickup. I really thought I could make a few bucks on the side, but mostly it was people chatting about an item for 30 minutes and changing their mind or being rude (and then somehow calling me rude for confirming pickup. Sorry, “just wanted to confirm if you still want the item because you missed our meeting.” Is not an inappropriate or rude question. Total waste of time! I don’t know how you can fix something that is part of the app culturally.

Enjoy spending 30 minutes of your time talking to each person who is interested in your $5 item that they are not going to show up to buy anyway.",1
998,"No customer support whatsoever: I would have given five stars but unfortunately I can no longer use the app.  It’s been literally a year and no one has ever gotten back to me to fix my account.  I was frequently buying and selling stuff on offerup and then one day I realized my account wasn’t working.  There was no indication or notice I only found out my account was screwed up because I was never getting any responses at all not a single one but my cousins account does. 

This app has ZERO customer support.  And to add insult to injury you almost have to be verified to use this app so once your verified you can’t make another account if yours gets screwed up. That’s it you’re just done no warning either doesn’t matter what you were in the middle of negotiating either.",2
999,"Ugly format: When I heard they were going to merge with letgo, I was excited. I thought offer up would have a more user friendly sleek look. I open the offer up app, and it’s still cobblestone/ mosaic tile layout. There’s too many ads for Walmart, eBay, wayfair, etc. I hate how the homepage still leaves items that are marked sold. Why are those items still on the home page? It is impossible to find the favorites/saved item window without looking up a tutorial. You are also unable to read buyer/seller reviews. I miss letgo’s layout.

Update, haven’t bought anything since the merge. If I have messaged sellers, either the sellers don’t respond to the messages, or they’re rude. I don’t know why my location always suggests 30 miles away and including shipping. I just want local pickup! I hate how there’s furniture stores on here too. I’m here to buy a used item that’s discounted.",1
1000,"Helped me find what I lost: Okay so to start this out, is not about me buying off of offerup for what I lost a while ago. A couple Months ago on eBay I found a really nice original graphic set for my dirtbike, and within a week of about to purchase it, it went unavailable. Flash forward 5 months of constant searching and asking companies IF they could make them, with no luck... now today, scrolling through offerup I saw an ebay ad, it was my graphic set that I lost 5 months ago. I am seriously in debt to offerup for helping me out with my vintage dirtbike restoration for this one. Also buyers and sellers on offerup are a LOT nicer than other websites/apps!",5
1001,"It could be better: I feel like they really tried to give the interface an Instagram gallery  type look by just showing you the images of items being sold. It doesn’t really work for a marketplace app. It would be more useful to have the image and price of the product being sold together. Also, there’s so much false advertising on OfferUp nowadays. A lot of people post their items as “free” or for a $1 so that their items get sorted as cheaper if you apply a sorting filter. However, once you click on those items a lot of posting will have “not free” or their actual asking price in the description. There should be a way to report these false advertisements. Fix these things and OfferUp would be a five star app for sure. It would improve ease of use and boost the integrity of the post.",2
1002,"Do you’re self a favor, use Ebay: ebay has been around for almost 2 decades so they’re more established. I bought two things on here. I bought a PS4 in person, which did not work and then I got blocked by the seller IMMEDIATELY after and there was nothing I can do but blame myself, fair game. BUT, I then bought a Switch controller and the guy who was a CERTIFIED SELLER made a mistake and sent me a vest. So I contact him he goes yea I’ll give you a refund after you send back the vest. I go will you refund me for the shipping, and he goes “Im refunding you for the controller that should cover it”. So let’s do the math. I spend 10 dollars to ship the vest back, then i get my money back for a controller I don’t have. I’m out 10 bucks so I try to explain this logic to him and he reports me and now Offerup thinks i’m crazy since he’s a certified seller and i’m just an idiot I guess and yea i’m out 50 bucks now DONT USE THIS APP EVER PLEASE!!!",1
1003,"Buyers beware!!! Allows scams, with no refund.: I bought what was supposed to be a 14k gold necklace for $70.  When I got it, the necklace was fake gold.  I opened a case to get my money back.  OfferUp sent me an email saying to tell them more about it.  I told them that it was fake, if it was real it would have been worth over $900.  The necklace weighs 38.5 grams.  Since then I have not received an email back.  This was 4 days ago.  There is no phone number to contact OfferUp either.  This is not right!!!

So I get an email a day or two after posting this from them saying reply to the message they sent.  When I try, “Non-deliverable”.  I take it I’m out $70 dollars.  Due to “buyer protection “  being a lie.  I’ve bought on OfferUp a few times and have never had a problem, *with the sellers.  Until I came across this scam artist, who OfferUp would rather have use their site as opposed to a returning buyer.",1
1004,"Horrible customer service is a joke: I ordered a iPhone6 from someone had it shipped then once I received it it was absolutely not what the add said except for the fact that it was a iPhone6. The add said 64 gig unlocked with hard case and charger gray color. When I got it it was a 32 gig locked sprint phone, gold color no case no charger. So I opted for one of the two options. Return for a full refund or partial refund keep the phone. I kept the phone and asked for a partial refund because I was taking it to Brazil for my girlfriend and I was leaving in 3 days. So I did not have a decision. Over 15 emails later back and forth talking to 5 different people who never even read my emails.... I got screwed out of my partial refund because they said it was not a option after... dishonest company. Crappy app. Horrible customer service. Less than one star would be more of an accurate rating.",1
1005,"worrisome issues that shouldn't be: We've been using this app for over a year now.  We are grateful for the added spare income..... BUT..... we are baffles by at least a couple issues.  There is no easy way to change your mailing address when you move.  There's not even a place where your address is listed to change or edit.  The best you can do is change the location to your general location by zip. Getting paid is an adventure as well. You must literally check your bank account daily. There is no indicator in the app to tell you: ""hey, we sent your money!"" Then there's a very weird message about having to add an account to receive funds..... very strange. A Seller's address and ""especially"" payment info are like 2 important features.",2
1006,"Updated from a 3 star: Down to a 1 star. I was already displeased with the app lately but just got another update and that’s it. I quit. I will no longer be using this app. I hate Facebook but at least their marketplace doesn’t make me watch ads when I hit the back button. Before it was barely functional to do what I wanted but now it’s cumbersome. I used to browse OfferUp causally on the toilet and such the way some people would use Instagram. Not if I have to spend half that time watching video ads, all to push your premium model? Bite me. I would have actually bought your premium service last year, but it seems you’ve deliberately made your app unusable UNLESS people pay. You were already making money, you got greedy and I won’t enable that by paying your racket fees. I’ll just move on to a new platform.",1
1007,"I miss Letgo....: I sign up for this app at 2017 and I did not understand how to work this app. I try to sell things like my TV and my console. But it took like eight months for someone to notice it so I deleted the app. Then I found a app called “let’s go” and I was getting more offers than offer up. I was selling things left and right I was making money. Now when Let Go merge with OfferUp in 2020. I did not like it. The offer up I had to experience from 2017 still had complication. I mean it did have some upgrades but still I do not like it. I am selling a bunch of stuff right now and I still didn’t get an offer at one bit. The upgrades for crappy, the extremely over price for something and get that much.",3
1008,"Terrible job in handling scam and bots: I have encountered so many bots pretending to be potential buyer: significantly more than real people, making me wonder how many real users are on OfferUp. They begin with asking if the item is still available and then proceed to asking for phone number for private chat and third-party payment, I can confirm these are bots because they only respond when I reply with certain keywords. To be fair, other apps also have fake accounts and scams asking for sharing phone number, paying for shipment, technical issues with payment, etc. but OfferUp is by far the worst I have used. Is it so difficult to immediately block users asking for phone number? Why does it have to leave to customer to handle scam spamming? Literally seconds after posting there are bots asking in the same way.",1
1009,Thumbs up for the most part: Hi - for the most part it is a good ap- easy to figure out if you are not computer savvy - I sell a lot more on other sites - like poshmark and mecari - and those two sites I have never had any problem with scams or perverts - offer up I have had a few weirdo’s but no big deal- the only problem I have is my photos only half up/ down load ( what ever it is we do)  or they won't go at all?? Not sure if it's me or offer up not working right? Back to the not computer savvy! Computer illiterate!! Lol besides the photo thing I give it a thumbs up! And if someone could help me figure out how to post pictures that would be GREAT! Thanks,4
1010,A company that doesn’t monitor their own website: This company is crap! In my experience I continue to find old outdated advertisements by individuals. These individuals leave there sale ad up for years and don’t update nor remove them. Doing this takes up space and it’s aggravating. This website employee’s fail to monitor and remove old outdated ads. Personally I think this website is crap. Most things on here are junk. Leftovers from yard sales or just crap nobody wants. It’s also flooded with Scammers. Obviously this website doesn’t care. If I can see the scams so can they yet they do nothing. This shows this website doesn’t care about the people looking at it. It should like many other websites that don’t monitor the websites be shut down until they are ready to do something to improve its services.,1
1011,"Account and messaging not working: My account and my messaging is not being seen. I lot 2 sales and I’m sure the people I was chatting with now think I’m a flake. This is the second time this has happened and customer service has been slow to respond. Super disappointed. Hopefully someone will restore my account to proper working conditions soon. I didn’t even know there was an issue until I noticed no responses to my messages. I had to ask someone to check my listing to find out there’s an error attached to it and nothing is showing to others. I also lost a few purchases that I wanted to make. Again, I’m the one who looks like a flake to sellers. There has to be a better way.",3
1012,"The worst: Offer up is one of the worst selling sites I’ve used to date.  The one item I was able to sell on here, worked out fine. However, NONE of my other items ever get any messages besides SPAM. AND A LOT OF IT. This app is infected  with fake scam artist profiles and they’re not caught until they’re reported by multiple people/multiple times. Not to mention, I had a listing on here for more than 6 months and when I finally updated it to drop the price they flagged it, took it down and said it was in “violation of their authenticity policy.”  Now I don’t know if that’s because someone who was shopping reported me or because the app genuinely and all of a sudden after 6 months of listing decided that my item was not authentic but none the less, it was incorrect and now OfferUp will not make the commission on the sale.",1
1013,"Not bad, but not great also: It’s an ok selling app, managed to sell some items but for the love of god can you please get rid of old post. They dilute the searches and most of the time the items just repeat over and over again. Also what other people have pointed out is all the fake accounts that just spam you with I’m interested only to leave you hanging. All I ask is that you remove post that are one year or older to make room for new items and always keep everything up to date. Another complain I have is how the app automatically always shows you offer from around the country, so every time I open the app it shows posts that I’m not interested in because I don’t want to pay for shipping or even trust it to that matter. So please have me add a default search for just my area.",2
1014,"To many scams: I see the exact same trucks and cars posted 100 different times they won’t communicate on the app they want you to email them, people selling brand new cars for $1000 - $1500 its almost comical how obvious the scams are but it’s not really funny because a lot of people probably fall for it. You guys need to figure out a way to weed out the bots there are WAY more scams than actual stuff for sale like 75% of the adds I click on are scams from people who can barely even speak English.
The only reason I’m giving 2 stars is because after several hours talking to bots and reading scam adds I finally found a real one a good deal on a decent car close by so 2 stars but I’ll probably delete this app after I buy this car because it’s a real waste of time scrolling through thousands of scams.",2
1015,"Letgo was Better: This app is just okay to me. It’s great that the premise is the same as Letgo and a bit better in that you can buy not so locally and pay through the app; however, the developers of this app seemingly try to push the non-local sells. You have to CONSTANTLY change your settings to show local sells and specify a range, but even then, the map is ALWAYS off and always shows sells well outside of the range you’ve chosen. It would be great if you had the option to set a default range. 

To prospective downloaders, know that if you so much as SPEAK about an item you’d like to have while your phone is around, tons of ads for the item will start showing up in your search results. In short, there are definitely some privacy concerns.",3
1016,"Horrible Customer Service for sellers: If you plan to sell on this platform, don’t ship. You would think they would take care of their sellers considering they take a 12.9% rate from both the buyer and the seller. For what? This is so both the buyer and seller are protected. Someone recently bought one of my items, with vivid pictures. Didn’t feel the need to describe the item considering i posted 10+ pictures. Then the guy gets it and complains that theres a couple scratches and expected a like new item... what? In the description it said used (normal wear). The guy filed a report, the app NEVER contacted me but only to say they approved their claim and are sending me back the item. I was completely surprised considering its highly unreasonable but no worries. The guy got the item cheap (the app ate 52$ so i got 52 less of what i wanted, and he paid 50 more of what i wanted). This app is a rip off",1
1017,"Charged for promotion: I bought promotion 1 month ago, paid 19,99$ for it, then I cancelled subscription for 1 week or less. But today I was charged again for 19,99 dollars even didn't use it for a month. I go to my iCloud purchase history and saw that I again subscribed on this promotion. Contact to apple support and they propose me to deleted this app, because if I will just log in I will be charged again and subscribe again... what does it mean...?? This app is free and I paid a lot of times to advertise my product and now I have been charged just for log in?? I want my money back and doesn't want to be subscribe on that crazy 20$ promotion..",5
1018,"Annoying: I hate when you’re looking for something free on here and people put $0 then a day a price or best offer in the description. That’s false advertising. Place a price you’re looking to get if it’s not $0 the state Best offer in the description. It’s not that hard. Offer up needs to start pulling people’s items if they say $0 then something different in their description. It’s false advertising and decreases your chances in a quick sale. 

Most consumers want what they are looking for. If it’s not what’s described then they go somewhere else. $0 filters into the free section. I’m super annoyed by it. When I want to buy things on here I will and I’ve purchased a lot on OfferUp. When I want to snag something free then it’s free. I don’t want to keep running into free but then you says it’s a best offer or price in the description.",2
1019,"Banning for no reason: There seems to be some fundamental technical problems that have gone unresolved and I have had little to no help from the support team. I’ve been looking for a motorcycle for months and have sent dozens of messages with no response. All of a sudden when I go to the messaging section I see “something went wrong” an unknown error has occurred. I’ve already deleted and reinstalled, same problem. A few months before I was getting messages but I received no app notification so I would miss the messages even though notifications were turned on. Technical quality has gone completely down hill to the point where I can’t use/spend money, sad.

Fast forward: after innumerable requests to customer service. I was finally told that I was banned. No reason, no explanation. Extremely rude and unprofessional treatment of customers trying to utilize the app/services. 

I found the only way to resolve the matter was to complain to the government. This company has a habit of banning people for no reason. 

Upgrading to 3 stars since I can now use it again, but for god sake fix the inappropriate banning situation!",3

I think i’m blocked or something i have no idea why i would be hopefully this goes away but i paid for 3 days of promotion & i cant check to see if it’s actually being shown or not. :/ 👎🏻

1021,"Updates get worse and worse. Annoying notification system: I’ve been a registered OfferUp user for over two years now and nearly 80 transactions. I have to mention how disappointed I’ve been with the app updates, to the point I avoid updating at all. First, OfferUp removed the price of items at first glance. Now you must click on the item to see the price. Then, OfferUp put redirect ads in the listings which directs you outside of the app and has been an annoyance for users like me. Then OfferUp devs added an annoying notification section next to messages which randomly notifies me of random items for sale based off search history. It gets worse with each update. Please revert the app to the simpler format without the annoying notification for general items and prices at first glance.",2
1022,"Could Use Some Updates: I love OfferUp just because it has awesome deals. However it is so frustrating that the price isn’t shown unless you click on the ad. I could save sooooo much time if I didn’t have to click on an ad to see the price. Major turn off for me. Also there are a LOT of people who list things and then either don’t have notifications on or have deleted the app. I have made offers or sent messages on many things that don’t get opened, let alone never get a response. OfferUp needs to find a way to filter these people out/delete the listings because it’s super frustrating. For the most part though, this app is pretty great for finding good deals.",4
1023,"mysteriously banned!: i was at the airport posting furniture to sell in anticipation of my out of state move at the end of the month. (my flight was late and i already had the photos).

when my flight landed, i checked my email and saw I had a few responses of interest to my furniture! i clicked on the link to answer and said I was denied access to the website, blocked by the owner. i tried the app, i was, too, denied. i tried my computer, again, denied. 

HOWEVER, i was able to respond to people via email by replying to the message. this is a problem. it seems that when Offer Up blocks you, they don’t delete your account. so you’re still getting emails, unable to edit your listings or take anything down once they sell. i’m also unable to contact customer service... at all. (they blocked my IP address).

i wish there was an explanation to the blocking. the only reason for the blocking that i can think of is me posting the Ikea web address to refer people to the specs of the furniture i was selling. however, the photos displayed were my own. i don’t know. 

there enough alternatives to OfferUp out there, that this doesn’t hurt too much. if they don’t change their ways, i’m sure everyone who uses offerup will experience this at some point.",1
1024,"Buy/Sell at Your Own Risk: So in my first experience using OfferUp, I was ripped off by a buyer. The cash he handed me at the transaction that was less than the amount agreed upon- I didn’t count it until he was leaving. My mistake. So I message the guy and tell him that he shorted me. He claims it was an honest mistake and he’ll come back and give me the rest of the money. Long story short, he ghosts me. So I leave him a negative review and report him. Well after endless back and forth with OfferUp “Customer Care” (more like DON’T care), I find out that my negative review will not be posted because I reported the user. Huh?!? So they will reprimand the user (his account has remained active) and he will continue to rip other people off due to my review not showing up. Way to maintain the integrity of the system, OfferUp!

The app was not working and I have not been active on the app for over a month but yet they deactivated my account they did not even give a reason as to why the account was deactivated. I contacted them and I am waiting for a response. They deactivated my account in error. I’m definitely not satisfied with this app.",1
1026,"Tons of spam from the company now: Used to be much better. I guess out of desperation OfferUp has decided to use the permission you grant so buyers can contact you to also start spamming you. I get constant push notifications for garbage from them. If I ever search to see what others are pricing what I want to sell, OfferUp starts spamming me forever with notifications when another of these get listed- and no clear way to stop it! Other bothersome abuses of the Push feature of the app, and don’t get me started with the frequent weekly email from them telling me about all sorts of things I could care less about!

I keep the app because it’s occasionally found a buyer faster than CraigsList, but the downside of having it on my phone gets quite bothersome.",2
1027,Red dots forever!: Even after clicking on a notification from someone interested in something you have posted the red dot will not go away. There is no way to get rid of the red dot. You check every single incoming message from someone interested in something you have posted and it will still not turn off the red dot. It’s really irritating because then if you hadn’t heard a notification you don’t know if someone else has actually tried to contact you. I had issues with people trying to contact me and I didn’t receive a notification and then I have constantly had issues with the red dot on the app on my phone. Very irritating this app is glitchy.,3
1028,"The app has been glitchy for 2 years: The only thing worse than dealing with the people on the app who are always trying to get something for free is using the app itself. It’s very very slow. Click on something and you just wait, and wait. It’s been like this for 2 years. At first I thought it was my phone. It’s not. There’s scammers as with any app but when you report them nothing happens. They post things for a third of the price and only accept shipping. You can report them and 2 days later it’s still there. It’s needs a lot of work to be on the same level as other apps but it doesn’t seem like they’re trying. Every update seems like a step backwards.

And now they’re throwing useless ads in our faces with no way to escape other than t close the app and guess what? The ads are scams!",1
1029,"Needs some basic UI design: You can’t see prices unless you open the listing. You can’t change the cash register notification sound. There is no way to set a universal preference for a certain distance and pick-up only. Every time you search you have to filter back to what you want because it always includes shipped items by default. The new Jobs button is too easy to fat finger when you’re trying to search for another item. The app is always notifying you when something you’ve searched comes up for sale, and puts it in your inbox so you think it’s a seller/buyer message waiting for you. Offerup on a computer browser is tolerable, but the app is a pain. Craigslist and Facebook marketplace are much easier to use.",2

On checking the tracking history I found out that the package was received by the carrier in my city but was returned to sender because of “insufficient address information.” I messaged both Offer Up and the seller about it but neither responded.

Ultimately I recovered my money by a dispute resolution through my credit card company. But I likely will not do any more transactions on this app.",3

Worst of all even after multiple attempts to contact them to look into my account (if they would just look into my account they would see that I didn’t break any rules) but their customer service is absolutely abysmal. All they do is send a generic reply over and over again. Horrible customer service, especially when relying to legitimate user …plenty of scams on the site and you would think they would want legitimate users with quality reviews but my experience with them says they don’t care one bit.",1

Wow man you guys are really taking greed to a new level. 5% is fair not 12. Too bad for OfferUp because I do quite well on other platforms and have a excellent shipping system awesome customer service too. I’ve been at this a long time and wouldve built a nice following on this platform as well. App is deleted. NO ONE should pay that much in fees. That fee should be at least half of what it is. If you want to sell on OfferUp, go for it but you are going to have to charge outrageous prices to make up for that this company wants in exchange. Apple please look into these user reviews. I believe many of them are fake or paid for spam bots. No seller in their right mind would use this rip off. One star is generous.",1
1033,"OfferUp has Shortcomings: The biggest problem, imho, is that there is no way to affect the rating of a seller that flakes out, disappears, ghosts you. If, after driving hours to get to his location the guy evaporates, there is no way to report or affect his rating as a seller. That is a HUGE FLAW with “seller ratings.”

Some other problems with the app is that it’s sometimes very slow to notify you of new listings you have set alarms for.  Hours can go by before you get notification, and in the meantime you have missed out buying something you really wanted.

Also, apparently, listings never expire on OfferUp. So you can waste hours chasing down old listings for items that have been sold months ago that the seller didn’t bother to mark as having been sold.",2
1034,"Full of old listings and flakes.: Wether you are a buyer or a seller, this app is full of old, outdated listings and people that don’t show up or respond.

The keyword searches return all kinds of unrelated items that don’t have your keywords in the titles. There’s no option for title search only. 

It is very frustrating as a buyer when you have to sift through tons of irrelevant listings to find what you are looking for. When you do find what you are looking for it’s likely that it is an old listing that the seller won’t respond to any messages.

As a seller, the app is full of time wasting flakes that ask all kinds of questions, ask for your address, say they are on the way, and never show up. Most of the buyers want the item for free and lowball you with insulting offers.

Basically it is worse than Craigslist for the sellers. A huge waste of time and effort. With most of the sellers also being unresponsive, the time of the buyers is wasted in searching and messaging.

You can find some good deals on the app, but you have to work for it and put up with the flakes and time wasters.",3
1035,Terrible don’t download: This app is terrrible everyone on the app are fake. As in they do not show up to meets they waste your time. And offer up doesn’t do anything doesn’t remove them anything. Download another selling app. I’m telling you everyone on this app wastes your time. I have had so many people say they are going to meet I have gave them my address then they haven’t answered again. So many people ask me to save the item and hasn’t shown up and I have ended up loosing a sale don’t download this app waste of time. I think everyone on this app is a bot made my offerup to keep their app relevelant. I cannot speak badly enough about this app. If I could give a 0 star I would. I’m just giving a 1 star as I needed to write a review to warn other people who are downloading this app so they know they are making a big mistake.,1
1036,"Almost good: This app is terrible.    Sure it pretty much does what it should in terms of browsing items for sale.  Putting items for sale on the app is simple enough too.  

But here is the problem it simply does not work for buying or selling items.  I post items for sale and right of the bat, I am asked if I will take 50% of what I’m asking.  Then the multiple inquiries if it’s still available.   When you finally get to someone who agrees on a price and to purchase, they stop responding to the conversations.   Same problems when trying to purchase items. (I’m just as guilty for having does these actions too :(   .)  You may say that’s not the apps fault.... but I say it is.  Don’t download it and save yourself some frustration.   There needs to be a way to be accountable for buying or selling items.  If they figure that out, this app would be awesome.",1
1037,"Run from Offer Up, dont use this!!!: I sold an item for 150$ on Offer Up (I should get 130$ and buyer, i asked him ,paid 165$!)and after around 7-10 days they semt me an email that money will be deposited to my account...ok , it has been over one month I haven’t gotten my money. Contacted‘customer service’( which is a frickin joke) they answered money was released to my account, thats it , they can’t do anything more?!?!? I emailed them asking to send me a proof of deposit or to send me item back or something because there so no any traces of money from Offer Up on my bank account. They won’t respond you!! Again and again (5-6 times)i ask for help on help center page and they don’t want to respond!!!! So don’t use them.
If something goes wrong , you dont get money or similar, they will not help you and will not respond you . They work for thiefs and scammers i guess.",1
1038,"Distance setting: Distance setting needs to be corrected. It should accurately show correct distance from set location when choosing how far one would like to search for items.  Very annoying to find what you’re looking for that ends up being a farther distance than that which was actually set. Also, it would be nice to have some sort of “commit to buy” button to help improve reliability when buying and selling. This might help weed out the many flakes who’ve already gotten an address or phone number from the buyer and end up not showing. No one wants to have given out this information and then have them not show up. Those who make that “commitment to buy” may feel more obligated to follow through.",3
1039,"I deleted the App. Great Idea except....: I was hoping this would be a good app for “online garage sale” type browsing, but (1) the app has too many retail listings.  As soon as you click on something you MIGHT be interested in, about 3 pages or screen scrolls down you will find yourself being pestered by retail adds for similar type items!!  (2) The other thing that really bugged me about the app is you will keep seeing the same items over and over mixed in with items you haven’t seen yet to make it seem like the list of items for sale goes on forever.  You have to put up with the repeated items to scroll through the other items.  Drove me crazy!  Someone should make an app for online garage sales like eBay started out but not be cluttered with retail items and charging 10% sellers fees!!!",2
1040,"Best selling app: I barley ever rate let alone type reviews for apps here in the app store so when I say this is the best app to sell or buy items I mean it. Selling stuff is way to easy, I love it! I have had such great luck selling my old phones, cases and other items on this app. I also love how your able to rate your buyers and how they can rate you so others can see if your a worthy buyer/seller. Buying stuff on here is great because the people on here are real unlike some apps/websites. Please do yourself a favor if your still reading this review and just give this app a try, you will be shocked! Thank you Offerup for making selling/buying stuff easy!! 🙂",5
1041,"Nice but needs fixed: Maybe it’s just me but I have pretty skinny fingers but still run into constantly trying to back out of a listing I’m looking at (by trying to press the “x” in the top left corner), and instead, it doesn’t close or back out but clicks the picture of the listing bringing me to a close up of the picture I was just trying to get out of. Then you try to “x” out of that picture and it doesn’t work half the time. So sometimes I get very frustrated being stuck in a listing I’m trying to get out of and can’t. I think they need a larger button to back out. Other than that, the app is nice and very easy to use.",5
1042,"Problems: Having some problems with the app.  Sometimes I pull up an item I want to see and the app freezes.  Nothing I do gets it to move on.  I shut OfferUp down then bring it back up and it’s still frozen.  

Other times I open the app and I get two of those rotating loading icons, one normal and one in a box saying this app needs internet services.  The normal one goes away after a couple seconds but the internet one just stays there spinning.  I’m on WiFi and other programs are working.

I love this app and use it daily but if these items aren’t fixed, I may be forced to use Letgo or some other local sales app.",5
1043,"Starts out great and then stops working completely: I don’t know what is going on with this app, I used to LOVE it, but it is no longer working right. After a few days it stops allowing messages to be sent and received. Also my items for sale don’t show up on the feed and show zero views. I have had to create two new accounts in the month! The first one worked for about two weeks before it stopped working. The second lasted only 5 days! I’ve updated and everything so not sure what’s going on. I am now about to create a third account so I can shop and sell. I lost some really good deals and sales due to the app not working and I am not happy. Not sure what the glitch is but if you google it you will see that a lot of other users are having the same issue. Get it together OfferUp!",2
1044,"Horrible customer service and experience.: My experience with this company has been nothing but horrible. The interactions with sellers/buyers is so unprofessional and rude. No one knows what they are selling but just selling it to make a quick buck or two. And when you report these unprofessional people you may or may not end being targeted and getting your account deactivated. If you dare to ask for actual proof of why this happened they just give you the good old robotic automated response to read their terms and services or your response/request is ignored. I’ve tried multiple times requesting a response with actual proof of why my account was being targeted without one good response. You can’t get an actual human response. 

So if you want to deal with professional and knowledgeable people when buying or selling your products don’t do it here. Waste of time.",1
1045,Too Many Trolls: Maybe I just had a string of bad luck but I tried to sell a couple of items here. The reason for the one star rating is that I was inundated with offers to buy my products from unusual personalities who then backed out or stopped communicating minutes before they were to pick up the items. I realize that happens from time to time on sites like this but the volume of instances where this happened was out of the ordinary and the people all had weirdly similar profiles.  We wasted too much time waiting for “buyers” who never bought. I think other sites have more serious communities using them.,5
1046,"Filled with Annoying Pop Up Ads: This app used to be more functional but is now filled with annoying pop up ads every few minutes of use, they also constantly send you ads if you turn on notifications, so you have to turn them off which means you won’t get updates on messages you’ve sent or received. They are now pushing their job listings feature so that searches are first run on job listings, forcing you to redo the search—it will search under jobs instead of items by default. Furthermore, 1/4 of the listings are just internet ads for items on other websites that are unrelated to what you’re searching for. Offer Up is now vastly less useful than Facebook marketplace or even good old trusty Craigslist.",2
1047,"Needs to improve: I have used offer up for a while now, it’s becoming a disappointment dealing with lowball offers, no communication from the buyers, or in the rare cases being scammed or dealing with a scammer. Yes the first time he offered me $850, was naive back then sent me a check for almost $3000, and had enough reported to the bank also police with evidence. Gotten scammed after watching Berm Peak formerly Seth bike hacks, had issues selling for over 6 months took good photos from his perspective it’s worth, and clearly didn’t work it’s the reputation. Am still bitter over the issue, wished Offer Up can do better as a site to combat the issues at hand example being buyers not communicating, scammers, and etc otherwise I am left with no choice but stop using Offer up.",2
1048,"Illegal charges: They will charge you when they offer you a free trial and won’t even respond to emails. Check their bbb profile they are a horrible business. Here is the response I received when I inquired about why the promotion that was offered to me in the app resulted in an immediate charge on my account. Additionally, upon investigation, you had activate your promotion before on June 17, 2019, that's why your account had been charge when you re-apply for promotion, as only new subscribers were eligible for with a 3 day free trial after that it will automatically transitions to a paid subscription, or when the user re applied they will instantly be charge. Update they never refunded me or tried to remedy the situation but they did delete my account with 20+ days of promote plus still remaining that I was tricked into paying for.",1
1049,"Can’t delete your account or info.: Update: OfferUp still refuses to delete my account and personal information that it sells to third party companies. After writing the original review for my information to be deleted, OfferUp sent me a message to email them. I emailed with my request and they still refuse to delete my account or information, stating that my account is ‘deactivated’. 
** Caution: Be careful with OfferUp. They are quite unprofessional with your information. 

This app doesn’t allow you to permanently delete your account or information. So once you sign up you are essentially signed up for life. They state in the details while signing up that your information will be used by third parties. The lack of privacy, free use of your information, and the inability to delete your information is NOT worth this app.",1
1050,"Bring back Let Go! Offer Up is horrible!: Way too many scam things on there for cars just look for yourself and see how many things are priced at 1000 or $1200 there’s no way the cars and cost that little also no pictures or any other additional information. So that’s a waste of time. Also when you look at one item because you can’t tell what it is in the picture so small, it keeps bringing up everything pertaining to the item across the Internet for advertising. Maybe I don’t wanna see 500 the same thing then it’s aggravating.  It was so nice to have let go when you had local stuff and you can see the trade with local people and get things done. I quit selling things on offer up for sometime now.  I’d rather do it on neighborhoods or next-door app., any other app but offer up!",1
1051,"worse User Experience than LetGo: I started using OfferUp when they bought LetGo. The interface is just not as pleasant and user-friendly as the LetGo app, and even though the marketplace is good, I don’t like to use this app & thus don’t use it as much as I would. 

There are too many ads among the posts, it’s way too easy to accidentally click on an ad that will open up your browser. The interface is more dark and cluttered for no aesthetic or functional purpose.  They also could make some simple changes to make the user experience more smooth, like showing the prices on the main listing grid screen, and allowing you to swipe through listings instead of having to go back to the main search grid each time.",3
1052,"Sellers Won’t Respond: Using the first account I ever made with OfferUp, I reached out to a number of sellers (all with good ratings) about their items, but none of them ever responded (even after a few days). Afterwards, I made a new account and messaged one of the sellers I had attempted to message with my first account, and instantly received a response. However, once again, after having brief contact with this seller, my messages are once again not being read by the seller and I am getting absolutely no responses from anyone I reach out to. On many occasions, I have reached out to the seller about their initially available item, get no response, and then see later on that the item was sold to someone else. Whether or not this is an issue with my account or my device, this definitely was not the experience I was expecting when I decided to download OfferUp.",1
1053,"Can’t delete posts ?: If I have something listed on OfferUp and then I end up giving it away to goodwill and it’s not for sale anymore there’s no way for me to get rid of that post. I don’t understand that. Why won’t OfferUp let me delete my own post?
 What happened was is I was moving and I was selling a bunch of stuff, then by the time I was done moving I had all this extra stuff that I hadn’t sold so had to bring it to the Goodwill store. A half a dozen of those things were still on OfferUp and people were wanting to buy them, and I didn’t know what to tell them ...it’s not available anymore. But the listing just sits there...
????",5
1054,"Great place to sell...if people actually buy.: It’s a very personal place. I’ve made a few purchases and the people are great. I’ve noticed with sales, people ask a lot of questions and then disappear. Even after they say they’re coming. But anyway, overall I’m happy.

UPDATE: When I wrote that I’d been using
Offer up a month or so. But just a month longer and I’ve had my account hacked- the hacker was also able to hack my Facebook. Offer up did nothing!!! On another occasion I sent money but the guy never sent the item and and wouldn’t reply to me and offer up didn’t even discontinue his account - so he can still scam others. Every seller has a 5 star ratings because they only have to let you review them at their discretion. If you had a bad interaction they simply don’t allow you to review. It’s a biased shady site. Just 30 days later.... Not happy.",1
1055,"It’s ok: App is great, good for finding things that you want for cheap. I’ve bought many things below retail price and it is really useful if you are on a budget. However, there is some flaws. 1) Lots of scammers trying to scam you and no form of verification. You can easily make an offer up account and that makes a lot of scammers make an account to scam other people into thinking they have a buyer. 2) People don’t read the description. Once you meet with the person, they always say “everything works?” and this is what really pisses me off because they obviously did not read the description. Make people read the description before buying, I am not sure why people do not read the description it’s like they do not know how to read.",3
1056,"Great but needs improvements: I use it to buy stuff all the time but it gets frustrating to not be able to just scroll thru all the items instead of having to back out all the time. We should also be able to edit our favorites at once, not item by item. And after removing an item it should take me back to where I was before, not to the top so I have to scroll all the way down to find my place, this process is way to time consuming. Glad so many people are using it though, finding way better stuff than Craigslist. Very annoying however when posters don’t check their notifications and respond in a timely manner.",4
1057,Horrible customer service: I would never buy a high priced item through their “money back guarantee” shipping option. I bought something and there was a problem with the product and it took weeks for a response from offer up! Crazy! I have a defective item I paid for and the company won’t even respond to me... When they finally did respond it was the most unhelpful person and it was through email. It actually went through several different employees because each said they would transfer me to an expert lol. Thank God I worked out a solution with the seller because I would have lost my money if it was up to offer ups “money back guarantee”... nothing like eBay or other sites program. Buyers beware! Offer up employees do not care. They might respond saying they are sorry but the lack of help shows how “sorry” they actually are.,1
1058,"The better local sell site: OfferUp is a pretty good site for selling items in your local area...far superior to Letgo, which offers a confused, ill conceived, and poorly maintained platform (ie. preferred settings have to be reset upon each use, alleged order by most recent posting date is a non-existent farce, loaded with previously sold and out of date postings, etc. etc.) that constantly bombards you with unwanted solicitations...very annoying, and seemingly full of more flakey buyers and sellers than anywhere. On the other hand, OfferUp is pretty well organized, maintained and easy to use, and having bought and sold on Craig’s List and eBay I would certainly recommend OU as a good place to buy and sell.",4
1059,"Useful app, but buggy and bad customer service: I’ve had some success buying and selling using this app, but the performance is frustrating. It often notifies me that I have new messages when they’re actually messages I’ve already read. This results in me sometimes ignoring the alert when I have real new messages. 
I’m also incredibly frustrated at how hard they make it to send them feedback. A good app developer would solicit feedback everywhere so they could make their app better. I’ve looked for feedback forms multiple times and even logged in to there forum. I couldn’t find anywhere to post. The “contact us” area doesn’t even have a form or email. This is why I’m leaving them public negative feedback instead. I hope they can build up the app to be more robust and performant.",2
1060,"Easy to sell but frustrating to search/buy: I’ve sold several things off this app but unless you know ✨exactly✨ what you’re looking for (“White IKEA Glenn chairs”) it’s hard to find relevant results. 

For example - I one time accidentally clicked on a car listed for sale. I do not need a car. I do not want a car. I am not buying a car anytime in the near future. I’m looking for nightstands. Why why WHY do I have to keep seeing cars for sale when I am specifically searching for furniture 

Please make a feature that allows me to turn off suggestions for select items.",5
1061,"Searching for an item impossible: The one problem I have with this app recently is finding an item , I search certain items and results are everything but that specific search keyword. I even look at the items that are showing up and none of the items in description have the keyword I searched written anywhere? I only assume that I’m getting results from people that pay for “Premium “ which is senseless even paying for Premium  their items are showing up on top but the odds of someone searching for it is slim to none. Maybe putting a word limit on titles and use search keywords only give title results and not words used in description.",3
1062,"Not convinced you can actually sell on offer up: The app itself is fine, though the subscription is worthless. But I’m not convinced this is used by actual people, as I’ve never had anyone follow through on a deal. I regularly list things on the usual websites (fb, cl), and I have yet to sell anything through offer up. As an example, I had an item listed for a month on offer up with a couple messages before putting it on CL and selling within a few days. Maybe it’s the user base, maybe it’s how listings are presented, maybe it’s the lack of effort needed to message sellers, but there doesn’t seem to be any way to actually engage with buyers. They just make an offer and then disappear into the mist after you’ve accepted. Really strange stuff.",2
1063,"Used to be Good: Ever since the merger of OfferUp and Letgo, the app has become an algorithmic nightmare. The best way to use the app nowadays is to stay signed out and when you find something you like, sign in and save it or contact the seller etc. Otherwise, if you stay signed in, once you click on something, the algorithm will essentially ONLY serve you the same thing OVER and OVER again. Then you click something different, and the cycle repeats. I just wish the algorithm would CHILL OUT a little. Let me naturally find stuff. That was part of the fun of the app originally. I kinda liked aimlessly looking. Now I can ONLY find the last item I searched for or clicked on. It’s very annoying… but I guess helpful if you are looking for specifically one thing at a time.",2
1064,"0 stars if it were possible: 1) Scams are rampant now. I’d say a good 20% - 75% of the ads are obvious scams from people with no profile picture and no selling history. Really ruins the user experience. 

2) Okay - scams are difficult to detect. Fine. How about being able to block posts from certain users? For example, I want to block posts from past scammers or annoying resellers/shops that are constantly buying items for cheap and trying to flip those items for a profit at a higher margin. You can block messages from those users, but you cannot block their posts.

3) Filter by min/max price was REMOVED. I need not say anything else about this. I can see the reason why the devs would want to remove this, and it’s all related to trying to increase exposure/engagement, but at the high price of user experience.",1
1065,"Other sites are better: I was super excited to start using Offer Up as a seller to help my mom sell some of her furniture and other things following my dad passing. At first, everything was going well. I posted about 6 items and was getting many messages of people being interested. That lasted about 4 days and then nothing. About a month later my account was locked. I have not had any negative interactions and had followed offer ups rules. I sent a message informing them it was an error about 2 weeks ago. Never heard back from them. In the meantime, I posted everything on Facebook market place and was able to sell everything and then some. First off, had less scamming messages and everything went in 1-2 days. It was much easier. I wouldn’t waste your time with Offer Up.",1
1066,Awful! Get banned for no reason: I’ve used OfferUp for YEARS with over 200 5 star ratings and have never had any issues. Out of NOWHERE I tried to post items that never got any views or I could not find where I had posted it. Tried to contact customer service and was told my account had been deleted for violating guidelines. What?! Was not given a warning and not getting any responses from their customer service team and unable to even make another account. If you want your account to be deleted without a reasonable explanation go ahead. Garbage 👎🏼 but people that are constantly trying to scam everyone somehow get to have accounts left and right. I’ve seen dozens of people with the same issues and OfferUp not even having the decency to try and resolve the issue and just ignoring us. I WANT AN ANSWER OFFERUP!,1
1067,"SCAMMERS…but there’s buyers protection.: I have NEVER successfully bought anything through this app. It’s a lot of scammers who block you after you send a payment. Luckily for me I get refunded when the seller doesn’t send anything. Offer up has a problem with a lot of listing’s descriptions encouraging buyers to text sellers through their personal numbers and to make transactions outside the app. Offer up should be better at finding, monitor, and banning those accounts which aren’t hard to find (look at PS5 listings). Also, when trying to find a legitimate seller it’s hard because you can’t see reviews or what the seller has sold in the past, like in similar apps like 5mile. Needs work for sure.",3
1068,Do not use. Better to use craigslist. Depends where you live.: So offer up suspended my account the first day I tried to inquire on some items. No wonder the items are one month to one year old. The app is not working correctly or that’s why there is so many bad reviews on here. For now you’re better off with craigslist but it depends on where you live. None of the items on offer up were for recently listed. I was looking for a vacuum but everything was older than one month. I wonder why?? And they have the option to prove who you are. Do you want to scan your drivers license into this app. I think not. Just look at all the bad reviews on here. It also appears Apple deleted my review I did A few days ago. The reviews are behind on here and not up-to-date like other apps. Shame on you Apple.,1
1069,"Review: I really don’t like it when a seller lowers his/her prices, then you guys leave the old price on the listing and cross it out. 

This gives buyers doubts about our products for sale because they see the last asking price as wonder why we dropped our price. So they don’t buy be cause they think there’s an issue with what we are selling. When there is no issues at all sellers sometimes like to clear out stuff to make room for their other stuff. 

Please remove the previous crossed out pricing off the individual posts who lower their prices. All sellers need to see is currently price. Not what it used to be. Thanks again.",4
1070,"What a buggy mess this app is: On an iPhone 11 this app barely works. I’ve tried everything from completely uninstalling it to “unloaded” it to you name it. And now finally after I loaded 6 items on with photos and description it just stopped working completely. I have no way of responding to the guy that thinks I’m going to pick up his fridge nor to any of the people wanting to come and see my items. I still get notifications that they wrote me though!!! And I’m sure I’m still being tracked but the app is useless and since it’s through apple I can’t log in through my computer either. I tried uninstalling it from iPhone storage 3 times as reinstalling it and everytime it takes me to the same place “Sorry, something went wrong” with this stupid looking bandaged up bear…. Useless programmers.",1
1071,"Overall Satisfied as a Seller: As a seller OfferUp is a good platform because listing your items is simple and they give you many ways to describe your item, and freedom to sell and transport it in a way that works best for your needs. I have used OfferUp exclusively for sales and purchases of home goods. I have not tried the shipping feature, but as a buyer I have never had issues with a seller. As a seller I appreciate the safety and security of the app for selling furniture and revealing my location. Sometimes it is hard to sort through the listings but that’s the nature of buying second hand and just the varying items that are listed at the time.",4
1072,"My side gig: I enjoy selling stuff online it’s so much easier and faster at times ,specially with everything going on it helps everyone out ,I’m currently not working so I enjoy what I do . I want to continue and sell a whole lot more . It can be risky at times there’s some mean people out there . Safety  is my priority and I usually do a voice verification and continue the communication. I don’t mind doing deliveries or meeting them at my apt complex outside .. I have experience doing this over 10 years ,I love this offer up app !!! Thanks guys for helping me out !And I always Check for counterfeiting ..:)",5
1073,"Big flaw: One issue I’ve had over and over with purchasing from OfferUp is, people don’t remove old listings and they don’t get deleted. I searched for something, made several offers at asking price, and they all expire. Likely because the item isn’t for sale any more and they deleted the app. 
Because of this issue, it’s hardly worth the time invested. Plus, they put a hold on the funds when you submit an “offer.” This is especially frustrating when you don’t know if the person selling even has the item and you don’t want to buy one from someone else, because they may accept and ship it to you. I will be deleting all of my listings and the app. There are too many other good online marketplaces to stick around and wade thru the swamp of old listings.",2
1074,"Meh. There’s a lot I don’t like, but it does just enough that I keep using it.: I only want to buy used items from people near me. But there’s no way to filter for that like there was with LetGo. I really don’t want to see stuff that has already sold or ad links to external websites. So there’s a lot of annoying garbage to sift through to find what you want. 

Also, I swear that when you actually search for a specific item it only shows you a handful of the new listings and the rest are years old. They really want you to have to browse without key words. I’m assuming it’s so you’re more likely to accidentally click on ads. 

Wish I could pay a few bucks for the features I want and to remove the ads that I will never use.",3
1075,"Buy items have unarchived: I do like this app but not every change is good. Most recently my buy items that I have archived have reappeared. I can’t get rid of them. I don’t want to see a bunch of sold things that I was interested in and archived keep showing. Also, I used to be able to set a place for meet up thru the messageing but can’t seem to now. Have to go to google and cut and past. Then how to get rid of low ballers and people that are not serious buyers, are late, or don’t show at the last minute regardless of how close u message them. I still keep using the app hoping for improvements or in some case going back to what works but I’m afraid it may become more complicated and invasive on personal info OU wants on me. I hope not.",3
1076,"Could've been better.: It would be a much better app if it respected my rights as an American to conduct trade without restrictions on such things as a pocketknife, a slingshot, virtually anything construed as what other countries consider harmful as a weapon.

Gunparts are not a weapon, a collectors edition pocketknife is no more a weapon than a collectors Lamborghini. Both items can be used improperly, yet my rights are infringed based on fear. 

This app is prime example of why it's not better used, it's because most things can't be sold here besides used clothes and worn out tires and even then your pestered with upgrade and promote for top dollar for items that most likely won't sell.",5
1077,"Even with the holds...: So, the whole holds thing is nice. I don't quite like that I'm forced to put my card info in and I do think the ""release payment"" button should not be located directly next to the send button just incase it's hit by mistake. But even with the holds items get sold to other people or I get ghosted (as in they agree to it and are out of town or something and then never reply about a pickup date). So I can see how it's useful but the problem of sellers copping out on you. (Which by the way has happened a number of times when I'm midway in rout to pick something up) so I imagine it doesn't solve the problem of buyers copping out. Which the few people I have managed to buy from in the past all complained about. Just an FYI",3
1078,Please remove inactive listings and non-responsive users: This app is so frustrating. Maybe I live in a city of morons that list something for sale but never respond to questions or offers. I’ve completed only 2 out of about 20 offers successfully. I’ve had several offers accepted but the sellers are worthless and never pick a meeting location and time and never complete the transaction. Do I report every user that doesn’t respond? But how do I know they even receive my messages. Can you provide an update to receive a read response once the seller or buyer reads a message? Also please delete old listing. Listing should be deleted after no activity for 2 weeks.,4
1079,"The best but: This app is very useful unless you’ll like to sell something on the app marketplace not only Iv gotten robbed several times trying to buy something but also had to deal with them canceling my account when I’m the one that has gotten robbed and reported the scammers.
The price to list items it’s too high I thinks it’s too much when you just want to sell something to gain a couple bucks.
Talking to a representative it’s nearly impossible since they hold no responsibility and they rather close your account before dealing with complaints.
I love using offer up and I hope they take action to lower their costs and to actually pay more attention to the consumers needs.",3
1080,"Things to do to improve site: 1) screen items for sell. Often the seller tries to sell badly broken or damaged goods. 
2) find a way to ensure items look the same as in photo. Many times they do not. Sellers should have to post photos of item(s) from more than one angle.  
3) only serious inquiries should be made. Too many times ppl inquire about items but never follow through. 
4) devise a system where money is exchanged on offer up (not in person). If a item has to be returned the seller will be charged a fee. This will eliminate a lot of bogus transactions.",5
1081,"GLITCHY: WHAT is going on with this app? Go to search box, everything freezes. It’s constantly putting me in the jobs tab that I have zero zero interest in. The x button on the text input field is also broken so I can’t easily clear my search. Daaaang you guys. This app is busted. If I am in a 15 minute session with trying to find something I have to reset the app at least 3 times. When I scroll listings it’s accidentally triggering an ad that might be in the page which is a full screen take over and I have to wait for the done/close option to come up. If you don’t want me to actually find things to buy and engage with the app, just let me know. It’s that bad. This is constant! Don’t chalk this up to, “well I’m not seeing these issues” my precious Product Managers. This experience is awful.",1
1082,"Used to be great, now it’s meh: What happened to this app? It used to be such a great app to find used items from locals. Now it’s infiltrated with commercial sellers and people shipping items. I’ve tried numerous times to save searches that only filter to people in my area for me to pickup from and yet still I see results for people who ship or are selling new products from their warehouse store or whatever. There are also just blatant ads for various companies selling related items. I get it, the app developers need to get paid too. I don’t even mind that ad much as the people trying to pass off as authentic sellers of used items or whatever. It would be nice if the money from all the ads were now being spammed with went to curating the content.",2
1083,"No-shows and lowballs in local; do not trust for shipping.: Local selling is a nightmare. You are bombarded with bot accounts, people never show up, and you are oftentimes offered exactly HALF of whatever you ask for your item. I have better success on Craigslist.

Online selling is dead-on-arrival. There is zero moderation of listings. Nobody wants to do it the ""official"" way through the standard checkout process, and they will flagrantly defy the TOS in the description by demanding only cashapp, PayPal, Venmo, or other non-legitimate payment methods because they don't want to take a 12.9% hit on the selling fee. Going the non-protected route means they'll ship you a box of rocks and scuttle off with your money with no recourse for you.

Whoever is running OfferUp is obviously on auto-pilot. They're collecting their ad revenue checks every month, letting quantities of reports auto-moderate users (which results in a lot of unjustified bans with no recourse of appeal), and doing extremely little else to improve the site. It's sad. 

And what was the point of buying out LetGo some few years back? All they did was kill a competing selling app. This is all by far the worst, most stressful experience to endure if you are a seller.",1
1084,Too many auto dealer posting!!!!: It is extremely difficult to find private listings for vehicles with so many auto dealership posts. Can you please add an option to sort by private owner or dealership please. I use the app often and it’s extremely inconvenient when looking for vehicles. We would really love the option to filter out the dealership ads. It’s literally like a 15 to 1 ratio when looking for vehicles. Way more dealership posts than private. This makes it so the seller doesn’t get as many views due to so many dealership posts….please change this. Thank you! I would like to sell a car here also…one day. Please add the option to filter out these dealerships. Have a blessed day !!,3
1085,"OfferUp protects users, but..: There are SO many fake posts on here. To the point that it seems like nothing is real. I’ve scored a few good things though. I wish OfferUp had a better way of filtering the fake users and posts out, but I understand how that could be hard. Thankfully, Offerup gives you buyers protection when you make a purchase, and they’ll automatically cancel sales that aren’t shipped fast enough. DONT COMMUNICATE OR PAY PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE APP. Unfortunately I had to learn this the hard way and received an Apple Watch that I can’t use because it’s activation locked, and I already paid for it outside the app because it fell through on the app.",4
1086,"App is being overrun by scammers please fix ASAP: This is a great app if they could just block out all the scammers. About 90% of postings from new users setup in the current month in the Video Games section are scammers. Same postings and scams over and over. They are easy to spot after you have seen them for a while, but it makes folks not want to use the app and have to sort through all of these. It is only going to get worse closer to the holidays and going to be bad when folks don’t get there items for gifts. This either needs to be fixed on the app side to identify and block or more easily flag these, or there needs to be a filter to remove postings from accounts that have just been setup and not fully validated or confirmed.",2
1087,"Crumby interface: Not wild about having to select a board to quick save every time. Quick save should be one button, not three (heart, quick save, X out)
You also have to reset your search parameters every time. I never want to drive more than 10 miles away (in Los Angeles, are you kidding??) and am not interested in having items shipped. If I modify my search, I have to reset those parameters. If I leave the app and come back to the same search, even for a minute, my search has reset and I have to start over. 
Very frustrating user interface, I highly recommend hiring a good designer. There are MANY examples in these reviews stating the exact such issues that need attention.",3
1088,"App keeps saying “Sorry, something went wrong”: I stopped using the app for a while since I had nothing to sell. I updated to the last version and when I received a message about an item I’m selling I went to open it and I got the message “ Sorry, something went wrong. We’re working on a solution and will fix this as soon as possible”. I deleted and instales the app again and it didnt fix the issue. Next day, the app works again and the buyer bought another person’s item instead. That was a week before. Today, I received a msg for my item again and when I go open it, everything is broken again. I guess it will work tomorrow again when the buyer is no longer interested. Please fix this glitch otherwise I have no use for this app. I’m running it on Iphone 11 Pro 14.6",1
1089,"It’s was great app but now it’s just okay.: I use to love offerup but now it’s just okay. 
Before the updated version...If I wanted something, before I would go into the stores I would check offerup first. It has saved me a ton of money and I have made money from selling items on there. However, with this new updated version, it is no longer enjoyable to be on Offerup. The biggest things that I didn’t like is that it is very slow... it also doesn’t allow you to follow anyone and it doesn’t let you go back to your deleted messages. It now updated again!! And will not let you know if someone has read your texts. It shrinks your front post page which really messes up the photo bc it zooms and shrinks in. Plus it takes away all your messages that you enlist without asking.",2
1090,"This Feature Would Be So Helpful!: Please add a feature similar to the like button, but it crosses out or darkens an item’s thumbnail while scrolling through items in the gallery. It could be a ‘dislike button’ next to the ‘like button’ (the heart).
I always end up scrolling through the same listings every day with only a few new ones scattered in. ‘Disliking’ it or crossing it out would save time by immediately showing it wasn’t what you were looking for last time you checked. The seller wouldn’t be notified that it was disliked/crossed out, as the feature would mean the buyer simply isn’t interested vs it being a bad item.
This would be soooo helpful!",4
1091,"Too many ads: When OfferUp first started it was a decent app, but with more updates it goes downhill. You can no longer see the price before you click on a listing which wastes a lot of time. Also the amount of adds is ridiculous almost every other listing is an ad these days. They also don’t filter out listing for new furniture from furniture stores which is really annoying because if wanted to pay a new price for a couch or dresser I wouldn’t be on OfferUp. I also noticed that when i message someone about a listing and then go to the messaging tab it’ll show me an ad for the exact same thing but on eBay. Which seems kind of messed up because they’re literally trying to take sales away from their user base. Facebook marketplace is probably a better option.",2
1092,Offer up: I like offer up more than the other buy and sell apps. I like the fact that the items are from around my area. I have bought many different items and have had mostly good experiences. But with that being said there are entirely too many items that are over a year old that have been forgotten about and too many items that you get no response to when you try to enquire about the item. I feel there needs to be a check and balance system of some sort. But as i said that have had many good experiences and the stated issue is my only negative thus far.  🙂,5
1093,"I have always loved Offer Up but: Never had a complaint at all about the app and I love the customer service and communication when it’s needed. I will say the update for adding ads is quite annoying. I think they can be incorporated into the experience better. Maybe adding them to the scroll feed could work better but having them interrupt my searches completely feels rude and is agitating. Sometimes I’d rather close the app than deal with it in the moment.
Just thought I’d let the developers know for the sake of transparency. Great app otherwise!",5
1094,"Password retrieval impossible: I'm still waiting for that ""link"" to be sent to retrieve my lost password. It's been a month. I did finally get an email that they were working on resolving the issue, which others seem to be having. In the meantime I opened a whole new account with another email until I could access my old one. However, I just got an email that they are closing that account for violating ""community guidelines"". What!? I didn't violate anything, I just had baby items posted for sale. OfferUp needs to get their act and communication together on many levels.

Update: Never got old acct back. Will loose lists entirely every few months. The adds have become unbearable. The app used to be great. I wish a competitor would step up with a new app so everyone could switch over.",1
1095,"Disappointed with Recent Changes: OfferUp used to be a great app for finding good deals on used items. However, the recent increase in irrelevant and intrusive ads has made the experience significantly worse.
	•	Annoying Ads: The constant barrage of ads for dating apps like Bumble and unfamiliar stores like Temu disrupts the browsing experience. These ads feel out of place and clutter the interface.
	•	Temu Confusion: Clicking on an item sometimes leads to Temu's website instead of OfferUp listings, making it difficult to understand where the product is actually for sale.
	•	Missing the Old OfferUp: The app's functionality seems less intuitive compared to the past. It's hard to tell if you're browsing OfferUp listings or external sites.
If OfferUp could focus on improving the user experience by:
	•	Limiting Irrelevant Ads: Reduce the number of ads and prioritize those directly related to buying and selling on OfferUp.
	•	Clarifying Listing Sources: Clearly distinguish OfferUp listings from external sites like Temu.
	•	Streamlining the Interface: Make the app easier to navigate and understand.
It would be a much more enjoyable platform.
I hope OfferUp can return to its roots and become the great app it once was.",1
1096,"Frustrating and limiting verification process: I had a good experience with the app right up until I was about to confirm the sale of my item with the buyer. Suddenly they required TruYou verification, and archived my post as well as prevented me from sending (and probably receiving) messages until the verification was approved. Except I have been unable to get TruYou verified since I don’t have one of their three required types of identification. I do have a legitimate, US government issued form of ID, they just refuse to accept it, even when I go back and forth in emails with their customer service. I feel bad for the person who I’ve effectively “ghosted” and am super annoyed since I spent a good amount of time on this app responding to potential buyers, only to be locked out of being able to buy or sell anything here.",1
1097,"Don’t use them!!!: I’ve had an acoustic with OfferUp for years and have always remained a 5 star buyer and seller. I hade a couple of purchases between yesterday and today and all of a sudden OfferUp disabled my account and canceled it out. They claim I violated their policy and when I asked them about this they didn’t bother to respond (because you can only email them).  I’m more upset about the fact that I placed orders and have had the money taken out of my account but now there is no way for the seller to send me my items and OfferUp refuses to reply back to me, which means I’m out a lot of money at the moment. I’ll update this review if there is a resolution.  

Side note:  If anyone from OfferUp manages to read this review, know that I will be perusing legal action for this due to the fact that you essentially stole money from me.",1
1098,"Used to be good. Now bad.: I enjoy using Offer up. It’s much cleaner looking and doesn’t force notifications on you like similar apps. I use it frequently and recommend it if you are looking for app to buy / sell used things on. The only negative / feedback from me would be how it handles your location. It seems like it wants to show people my address. The radius it shows on a listing for your location is too small and it could be easier to change. Thanks for an awesome app. 

 UPDATE: Offer up now constantly annoys me with useless notifications and is cluttered with ads. I deleted the app after a pop up filled my screen and wouldn’t let me close until the end of a ~5s timer. The percentage taken for sales is too high already and you want to take more with ads. I don’t recommend it.",1
1099,"Recent updates have really slowed the performance of the app: Not sure what has changed on the development side of the app but ever since I’ve updated to the version that introduced the unskippable 5 second full screen ads I’ve also been getting extremely poor performance to the point where I need to force close the app. The UI is much slower and less responsive than before and Just switching between home to inbox can take 5-10 seconds now whereas before it was near instant. Also the same issue of there being a huge delay between receiving a message, and the inbox actually updating itself to reflect that you’ve received that message still exists even after all these iterations.",2
1100,"Deleting saved items!: I agree with the last comment I saw about needing a better system for deleting saved items. One I think if the item has been sold, it should automatically be deleted from the saved item lists!  Also it would be awesome if we could make our own automatic messages. Like the “Hi is this still available” or “what’s the cars history”. If we could save short messages to reuse of our own that would be great 👍🏻.  
   Regardless of the issues it’s still my favorite Buy, Sell & Trade app. On the market, so kudos to you guys for creating it!",5
1101,"Good not great: The format and lay out is great. I’m able to buy and sell like crazy it’s a sweet app. The software on the other hand is second rate, messages take along time to send and update, I’m not able to go back to a previous search result and the worst part of the app is it will not let me switch between multiple apps and come back to the same exact place I was at when I was using it before I switch. On top of that the app restarts from scratch not even the section of the app I was in let alone the page or I ten I was looking at. Other than that great resources for sure. Just update your soft to mesh more with phone OS",4
1102,"Great to aggravate: I’ve used offerup for years. It was a better more user friendly alternative to Craigslist. Over the years I’ve been able to purchase, sell and trade many things and was very happy with the app. In the last two days I’ve tried to do my usual scanning and searches but am being absolutely berated with pop up ads. I saw the same nike ad with the tennis women five times in less than two minutes. I couldn’t even make down three scrolls of the page for all the ads. I understand the developers need to make money some how but my gps let me use the program some before you beat me up with ads. 
I’ll give the app a couple more tries but if this continues I’m sadly going to have to leave it behind. It’s been a good run I guess Facebook marketplace is going to have to suffice.",1
1103,"Get more emails from app than from buyers: This app hasn’t impressed me yet. I had it one time before and all it did was send me emails about items to buy or how to upgrade to sell faster. But never got any interested buyers. So, I stopped using and deleted the app.

Second time at trying the app. Again, I post two popular items reasonable priced and I immediately get an email from the app welcoming me to the app and get other emails suggesting items to buy. But not a single interested buyer contacted me.

I tried responding to the message from the app welcoming me as soon as I signed up. With a question I had about not being able to adjust the distance my items are visible to buyers, but got absolutely no response from the app’s staff - now two weeks later.

Apparently this is an automated app that is just setup to send you emails and entice you to upgrade to sell faster, but has no personal connection with it’s users or allows you to sell without upgrading. Just wants you to upgrade to get more out of you to sell your items faster. But don’t try selling your items the least inexpensive way. They won’t allow it. Or respond to any questions you have about the app.",1
1104,Returning user highly unsatisfied: I was a user on LetGo several years ago. I stopped using the app at that time because it wasn’t really a useful selling tool for me at the time. I rejoined the newly branded OfferUp by LetGo recently hoping it might be useful this time around as some family friends recommended it to sell some things. I have received no serious offers. The majority of people who have contacted me are scammers who wanted personal information and a few extremely lowball offers from non scammers. Given my past and recent experiences with this app I would not recommend it for anyone trying to make sales. I sincerely think sellers would have better luck through Facebook marketplace or Mercari as I have personally had much better luck with the same times on FB and Mercari than I’ve had through LetGo.,1
1105,"Horrible, Spiteful Customer Service: So I was attempting to post a pair of shoes to sell locally. After finishing up the post and following every one of their rules, I attempt to post it and it says it was successful. Upon checking my “selling” page in my account, nothing is there. The item wasn’t listed at all. I tried posting again, nothing goes through. I then attempt to reach out to their customer service and ask them what’s going on. Instead of helping me, they’re threatening to shut down my account due to “posting multiple items”.

Crappy UX on their end leads to me not being able to post an item and then their team threatening me.

I’ve never experienced customer service like this in my entire life. Honestly at a loss for words.",2
1106,"Attention Developers ❗️Your Last field ‘Location’ is not retaining the saved value: Developers Your Last field ‘Location’ is not retaining the saved value. 
           Fact of reference: 
1.  Account bears the right value
2. Location finds the proper location.  Plus Save is Selected and program announces the value is Saved. 

Note: In my case - I save Lakewood - the program announces it is save. 
IF I return to modify my post when I arrive at the last value of location the program does not show what I set /save before .. “Lakewood “
For the most part the saved value has changed, in my case it has Changed to Arvada or Denver. 
  My apologies to put this 
Notice to the Programmers 
in the Review area. 
No other option to Contact exists. 
       If you would give a contact option in the app or an Contact the Developer’. in the description area when you choose the app from the App Store - I would have definitely used that option 

Everything else seems to work great- I thank you!",5
1107,"Where’s my boards?: OfferUp has helped me sell and buy numerous times over the last 3 years. That being said, not sure what happened with the quality of the app. I’ve found numerous “local” ads with the same pictured item that’s priced waaaaay below what it’s worth and barely a description. Clearly some sketchiness is afoot. But I’ve reported all of them so we’ll see.
However my review is about the lack of access to my boards, collections of saved ads, pretty much wishlists lol. I don’t know which update this has happened, but I cannot access my boards on the app. I can still save ads and create boards, but there isn’t a page or link to view any of them. And that’s just weird af. 
Hopefully it will all be fixed soon. Thanks for viewing",2
1108,"Display of item: The offer up / letgo  is a great app to use thus far. The only disappointment is the time length the app allows items to be displayed. The app shows items displayed 1 , 2 to 3 years or more. There should be a time length then the item is auto deleted. It’s disappointing to make an offer on an item that been displayed for years and never receive a response. The person probably deleted the app. Besides it makes the app look junky as well displaying items that no longer really exists. Many of my friends has voiced the same opinion. I truly hope you take this in consideration.",5
1109,"Letgo was the superior app: I have been forced to use Offer Up due to the  acquisition of Letgo, and I must say that I'm very disappointed as I strongly feel that Letgo was superior, not just for to the number of users, but also the branding, app functionality and overall ease of use. I had installed both years ago and after posting the same item on both decided to use Letgo as it was easier and my items got more traction. Not I have to begin from scratch with an inferior app without any user history (they should have found a way to validate users on OfferUp) and at the very least don't a good job at communicating the chance instead of just removing access to Letgo. Disappointed but I hope reviews like this force company to adapt.",3
1110,"Wonderful App: I’ve really enjoyed using the OfferUp app.  It’s very user friendly and responsive.  It’s easy to search for what I want and the built in chat plus ability to make saves lists is very useful.  I’ve only noticed a couple of bugs such as when removing an item from your saved list, it takes you back to the top of your list instead of continuing where you left off and also when you have a chat with someone, if they deactivate their account or “Unlist” the item (after you’ve purchased from them), it removes the chat history.  All in all, it’s a great app and I recommend it.",5
1111,"Letgo made me lose business: I have been an avid user of letgo. Buying and selling items often over the past few years. I built up a strong reputation through buyer and seller reviews of being punctual, reliable, and trustworthy. When letgo and offferup merged I was in conversation with 2 different sellers to buy a pairs of shoes, as well as in conversation with a buyer about selling a personal item. Since letgo has made their “legacy” login process so difficult,  and OfferUp hasn’t offered a way to transfer items being bought and sold previously on Letgo, I am no longer in contact with the shoe sellers who I had already negotiated a fair price and meet point with and I have lost money on my personal sales. At the same time I am hesitant to use OfferUp. I find the user interface confusing and not intuitive. In addition, my seller reputation has evaporated. I am upset :(",1
1112,"The only non-Craigslist local app worth using: I love OfferUp. It’s basically Craigslist with a much better interface, less bots, and a little more information about the person you’re buying items from. Many other local selling apps (like Letgo) exist, but they have succumb to levels of ad placement and UI manipulation that have effectively made them useless, unless you enjoy visceral rage. 

Don’t get me wrong, OfferUp has more than enough ads. The app is just much better at keeping them out of your way and providing a clean, quick interface for finding local items and chatting your way into a great deal.",5
1113,"Worst buying app I’ve used.: I purchase an item for $220 plus $8 shipping so $228 using the BUY NOW button. I paid in full and then the seller denied my sale because I’m a new user. Really? We spoke back and forth and they changed their mind to sell the item and gave me a long run a round. Then I purchased the same item from a different seller and he was asking the same$220 free shipping.  I paid and he rejected because he said he would only make $187 with fees. I then said fine, I’ll pay $250 to cover fees. Seller then told me to follow his Instagram account. I did that, then seller said I can’t sell it to you because they’re going for $500 on eBay. So I tried TWICE to buy from sellers and both bailed or was scamming me.  Offer Up needs to hold sellers accountable! This was a big waste of my time, could have been money as well.",1
1114,"Fake post by scammers, Year old post: I love the app. I use it to shop for many different things you name it I’ve shopped for it. I always goto offer up first but however recently it’s seems to be more and more post from people trying to scam others out fo their hard earned money. Especially during these time. I wonder if anyone from offer up checks to see what’s going on especially in the cars and truck section. Also the year old post are pretty annoying when you find something that you really looking for or ready to buy 90% of the time they don’t have the item and 10% no reply when messaged.",4
1115,"Great app concept, beware of interactions with people: TLDR: App is great, chat is a little buggy. 
BUT People, please be considerate of other’s and let people know if you’re going to be late or not interested anymore. 

Long version:
The app concept is great. It is a very convenient way to sell and buy items. But the way that the chat is set up with people is a little hard to use and buggy. 
I wish that you can see all of the messages that both people sent because it seems like you never replied to people. 

The biggest issue I have with using this app is the people. More than 80% of the time, people are flakes and do not show up to meeting times even though I would message them an hour beforehand asking if they are still available or interested in the item I am we have scheduled to sell and buy. I have had more than 10 interactions like this, so it is not an 80% rate out of 5 people. This is very frustrating and I feel terrible for reporting people. 

So user, beware. I know this isn’t a problem with the app so it’s not fair, but it’s still a community and maybe we can do something to prevent this.",3
1116,"Worst selling site I have ever used!: This is BY FAR the worst selling site I have ever used! First, on just the second purchase I made on here, the guy selling scammed me out of $63 on the other end (I was the buyer). I immediately reported this to OfferUp and all I ever received was a generated email. That said they would get back to me if further information was needed. So I messaged them again and received the same thing.

Trying to find some way to get to someone live, I discovered their site was “being redesigned and reconstructed”, so many functions were not working.   

Then to top it off, the scammer who ripped me off left ME negative feedback! This system is a joke on here. Nobody cares to protect people from scammers and the feedback system is a complete joke! 

I have contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge, doing a chargeback. I have screenshots of everything. Including the entire conversation between me and the scammer seller. As well as emails. 

And it will be the LAST TIME I ever use this site if they don’t correct the issue and remove the scammer’s negative feedback he left for me! 

They have a very broken system, if a person can scam you, then leave you negative feedback. And for the jerk who did it, you are a real s@@m bag!",1
1117,"Sellers should not ship: I’ve been using OfferUp for years; never once did I use the shipping option until recently. What a nightmare! OfferUp has created an umbrella where they profit at each step by 1) selling you the shipping labels (you never see the shipping money), and 2) being forced to give them financial information to get paid, so they cna take a further cut. By the time all is done, they’ve taken over 10% of your sale value, and that is A LOT! Also, they somehow have created features that make it so the most important user on the platform is the buyer...when in fact, the sole life of this app is the seller. Without sellers, this app is dead. Such a nightmare. I’ll continue to use for local sales...but if my item ever gets held for 3 days by a user who ends up not buying (another one of their buyer-driven features), I’ll start using other apps.",1
1118,"Reviewing buyers is useless for those that ghost: I started using this app to sell a lot of items before I moved out of state. It has a vast user base so that has been helpful in selling my items quickly. However, 50% of the people that sent me a message of “I’d like to buy your x for $x amount” rarely follow through. Another 10% will say they will pick things up and then never bother to show up which is very rude and wastes my time. I have no way of reporting these people as no-shows. The only way to rate people is if they actually buy the item. This flawed review system consequentially only shows you reviews for items they followed through on purchasing. 

There needs to be a better rating system. If someone messages you then ghosts, they should have negative marks against them.",2
1119,"Customer service is nonexistent!!: It’s beer well over a week now that out of the blue I noticed the messages I send don’t get read at all. Nor my new listings get views or put on the live feed. I tried numerous times contacting OfferUp about the issue... well no luck. I finally left a one star review for the app and was contacted by the “developer” and asked me send in my questions to another OfferUp customer service email, he/she provided. Well I did, and here we go again with the non existent customer service. It’s obvious there’s something wrong with my account. I started using my wife’s account and same thing happened. Don’t ask me to reach out to you and seem concerned about the issue when you can’t even reply... this is so frustrating, I’ve missed out on items I really wanted to buy and can’t sell my items either. Going back you 5miles and letgo!!",1
1120,"My offer up experience: I have purchased off of OfferUp before and that always went well. Selling on offer up has been a different experience. First off I have been tried with scam artists which I’m smart enough to know the difference. It’s really annoying!! Also half the people who inquired don’t show up or don’t even have the decency to call or offer an explanation! That’s life ...
The ones who did show up took a look around and wound up purchasing a lot more than what they came for- some items I did not yet get around to posting. All in all the experience has been pretty effective . Thanks",5
1121,Offer Up: I enjoy this app & find it the most reliable of the sell your old junk apps and I have had lots of luck selling items of mine I'd normally just toss out & I have found & purchased tons of hidden treasures through this app that others didn't have any use for anymore if your looking to try a sell and buy your old items app I'd recommend you try offer up ..& keep in mind some people will flake on you or stand you & just plain waste your time on here but that's just the gamble of the buy & sell apps but be patient your bound to hit the jackpot & it makes dealing with all the flakey people worth it trust me.,5
1122,"Great app for selling and buying: Great app for selling and buying. Great messaging feature they didn't have to know my real number. One thing i wished to add, you can send and receive pictures, because sometimes there are other choices the seller wants to show and the buyer would want to send the picture back the choice that he made. 
Another thing I hope the app will automatically delete the ones that are really old like for example more than 3 months and above would be gone. A lot of them has 1year old. Not a month though, I was able to buy something posted a month ago.",5
1123,"Pros and cons: It’s a great app to find just about anything you’re looking for. But, the bad thing is…. Scammers. I was victim to that. I trusted two ladies, and it turned out that my email was being used in another city. When the offer is to good to be true, most likely it’s not!! When they ask to contact them by personal email . Then they ask to talk by phone because they are having problems with the email. That’s when they get you!!! Just be carful with those people, don’t get scammed like I did. And you’ll have a experience with OfferUp. Stay safe and be well.",5
1124,"Not All Bad But Is Bad: I have sold an all right amount on this app. However, there are some serious things that need improving:

Bug reports:
• When creating an ad and navigating to the Details screen, the app quickly scrolls downward and displays a white screen. In order to keep editing your ad and make the form reappear, you have to navigate back a screen and go forward again. Please fix this incredibly-annoying issue quickly.

Slow:
• The app has long, been slow and clunky, and in need of a ground – up revamp. It did improve on a newer device, but it still is not the snappiest.

Automatic Responses:
• Please—for the love—remove these stupid automatic-response buttons such as, “is this still available?“ Whether it is here, on Facebook, marketplace or elsewhere, I am sick and tired of people lazily hitting these buttons with no intent to have an actual conversation. I am sick of wasting colossal amounts of time responding to these people only to get no response. If you are interested in my ad, you should write me a message. If not, you should leave me alone.",3
1125,"Be aware in this app: I can only tell you my experience, I have been with this application since 2016, I have worked very hard on this app, I have dedicated and invested many years so that in the end those who make the decision are computers, they deleted my account, being a real, serious and I have just had more than 2,000 sales with more than 500 5 stars and I have been a victim on several occasions of scammers and customer service always responds in the same way, despite all that offer up has closed my account arguing violation of the rules of Posting is the first time something like this has happened to me in 7 years. I have sent thousands of emails and it always responds automatically. I can only warn you that this app is not for serious people, it is 100% for scammers, be careful.",1
1126,"The developers of this app are absolutely terrible: I’ve been using this app for about two years now. It is plagued with extremely old listings. There needs to be a feature that removes old listings after of period of time. I have seen listings that go back over 2 years. Another complaint I have is the number of spam/fake accounts that are on here. The developers don’t make all users go through verification so being scammed is extremely easy. I’ve seen thousands of accounts made in 2023 that have suspicious listings and no verification. The newest update added pop adds that are hella annoying and take forever to go away. Lastly, the customer support for Offerup is absolutely trash. This app makes Mercari seem way safer and better. Developers need to listen to their users suggestions.",1
1127,"Lots of counterfeit items: This site is riddled with counterfeit items, and there is very little protection for the buyer.

Offer up should not allow sellers to rate buyers when the buyer has received and has had to ship back a counterfeit item! I made one purchase on this platform and it has been a terrible experience from the seller.

After returning the item, I was not able to rate the seller or mention a counterfeit item was sold. However, the seller was given the ability to rate me and gave me 1 star. When I sent an email to offer up support I was just told “a rating cannot be changed once submitted”. So a seller who sold a fake cup goes on selling with a perfect rating, but I was scammed and now have one star. I have deleted this app and will not use again until more protections are in place.",1
1128,"Scammers everywhere: This app runs extremely slow and destroys my phones battery in a matter of minutes. The amount of scammers on this app is unbelievable. I have many apps like offerup, and none of them come close to the amount of scammers this app has. I’ve seen verified accounts with multiple 5 star reviews attempt to scam me, and it often takes hours and hours for them to finally get banned. I’ve made many purchases on this app, and more than HALF of the transactions end up getting refunded to me because the sellers stop responding and never ship the item after I buy it. On the plus side, MOST of the accounts I report end up getting banned fairly quickly. You can find the occasional good deal on here if you try.",2
1129,"Never sold anything on it: The app is really well structured and it’s functionally fantastic, but I have never sold anything on it. I cross post everything that I put on offer up on Facebook marketplace and let go, and I’ve only ever had things sell on Facebook marketplace. I don’t know if it’s just the fact that I don’t live in a massive city, although I do live in a college town so it is fairly populated regardless, but it’s weird that I’ve posted tons of things on the app and never sold anything on it. If you are in a particularly big city I think it is a fantastic option but if you live in even a fairly large town or a small city you’re probably gonna have better luck elsewhere.",3
1130,"Great App but the Stores have ruined it: This App used to be amazing before stores made profiles and starting taking over every search with their brand new full priced goods, they spam the same items over and over again and for every couple of items being sold by actual people there’s 10+ by a retail store . People don’t come on this app looking for this kind of stuff, they come looking for deals and decent second hand goods. Craigslist has a search function where you can filter by “owner” and I really think OfferUp should take note or put more effort behind eliminating these types of sellers. This makes me not want to use the app and is honestly just flat out inconvenient and annoying. It 1000% ruins the user experience.",2
1131,OfferUp has gotten way better: I like the fact that you guys are paying much sooner you’re processing times are faster all that still has improved a lot of the advertising is improved everything the only thing maybe we could do is allowed to have maybe a multiple items system on the app where I can load many items of the same type without having to do each itemLike if I have two of the same item I can put down that I have two quantity instead of just one and then I have to do another one.,5
1132,"Cannot cancel trial subscription!: This app is designed in a way that makes it impossible to cancel a subscription to promote your item. I signed up for the trial and canceled a few days later when I noticed there was ZERO increase of views, nor was my product promoted as promised. I canceled my subscription and the link timed out, giving me an error message. I went back to check my subscription listing on my phone (under ios settings) and it was not here so I thought it worked. NOPE! Not only was I charged for the full promotion cost but the app offers no way to cancel the subscription. Go ahead, try to find it in your app. There is NO way to cancel a subscription and there are conveniently no FAQs offered in the app for people who want to cancel. This is how the company makes your money. They steal it.",1
1133,"They're the worst!!!: They are the worst if you're selling high end authentic items! They seem to only allow fakes/replicas to be listed but they'll flag and remove authentic items! The excuse from their tech support is that the ""brands"" help them identify fakes which is laughable! If that was the case then 90% of the replicas listed on their site would need to deleted!  I sell on high end sites like The Real Real, Poshmark and Mercari where they authenticate items and OfferUp insults me by telling me that most of my items are fake! my items are probably the only ones that are 100% authentic! 
They're the WORST!!!!!!!!!",5
1134,Great app: Awesome app for making side cash just need to get rid of the scammers who are trying to send you checks and telling you to wait for it to be available in your account. Only one problem the checks are probably fake and they aren’t waiting long enough for your bank to tell you something. Then they send some scary guy by your house to get what they didn’t pay a nickel for and your screwed. So be sure to flag all those scammers when they try that check crap. Don’t hold something for anyone. Never have anyone meet you at your house. Good luck live long and most of all help me make lots of money . Ike,5
1135,Garbage: I posted a review about a month back about my recent experience. Having an account for 4+ years they all of a sudden deleted my account. They said it was removed due to a violation of their community guidelines and posting rules. I am a mother of two and all I do is sell me and my kids used unwanted items. Glad to see other people recently writing reviews on how terrible this app has become since the merge with Letgo. The “developer” reached out via email asking for my email for the account to fix my issue and they NEVER reached out. They sent me the same generic automated email saying I violated their community guidelines and posting rules. Garbage is the only word I have for this app now. I told everyone I know to delete their Offerup app before their accounts get randomly removed and to just use FB marketplace. I would give 0 stars if I could.,1
1136,"No customer service: There are way entirely too many scammers on this app now. They just make an account and do nothing with it and ask for your phone number and blah blah. Basic scammer garbage....

Also...

I used to really love this app. I thought it was safer than Craigslist and you didn’t get spam like Craigslist. But I’ve had a couple problems and no one is there to help it. They don’t have a way to reach them. They say you can fb message them but I’ve talked to three people and they say ohh yea we can help and then never come back to me. I sent something to a lady, she received it and OfferUp never gave me my money. So that was $15 dollars I’m out, plus I’m out of my item. Another lady offered me $5 for an item but OfferUp took $1.99 out of the $5. That’s such an insane service fee for $5. They are definitely getting money hungry and can, so they will.",1
1137,"Improvements needed, especially on iPad Landscape.: I like OfferUp and I have a verified account. I like that it helps to filter out the spammers and fakes. However, the reason I’m only giving 4 stars is that I use the messaging feature to communicate with buyers and sellers. Since I use an iPad with a keyboard, the messaging bar at the bottom of the screen is overwritten with the iPad toolbar, and I can’t see what I am typing. I love that OU works in landscape mode. But this issue is significant.

Another feature I would like to see is a Preview Mode that allows me to see what the buyer will see when they select my item for sale.

Otherwise, I still enjoy the app enough to keep using it.",4
1138,"Potentially unsafe, poor customer service: Scary and unsafe- There’s a guy theoretically coming to my house today to pick up an item. Thanks to Offerup randomly deleting my item for being “intangible” (it’s actually a bunch of landscaping rocks, as the photos clearly stated), I now have no way to contact the human who now has my physical address and may or may not still be showing up. Who may be angry because the listing is deleted, who has no way to contact me. 

How is this good or safe?? (You can only contact people through the app, and if your item gets deleted so does the message history). Which means I have to rearrange my day for something that may not happen, and some potentially angry guy with my address who thinks I’m ghosting him but who can’t contact me. 

Someone made really dumb design decisions for this app, and it’s backed up by either idiots or a stupid algorithm.",1
1139,"No Customer Service: Sure the app is great. But I have almost sixty items listed and sometime in mid December I just stopped being able to receive or send notifications. I tried to contact support at least five times. I got an automated response to one, that it was received. No one ever contacted me. I erased and downloaded app several times. Tried it on my computer. Changed my number. Created a new account. Nothing! I even changed my phone and it still doesnt work. I used this on my ipad and iphone. This is how I make money. Its ridiculous. Last night I realized in my profile it says I have many items listed, but when I search for them, they are not there. All I need is one person to contact me. You might have a Fortune 500 company that makes you a lot of money but personally a company is only as good as its customer service. AND YOURS IS NON EXISTENT!",1
1140,Find another app! OfferUp is terrible: OfferUp 👎 No customer support. Disabled account even though other users/accounts have the same listings. They remove listings even though similar listing are posted. You have to pay to post cars. Any type of promotion offer you have to pay monthly and if not cancelled in time when trying free trial you’re linked/charged to your account even though you have a deactivated/activated account. OfferUp is a third party. It’s not the same anymore. You’re better off using another selling app. All your selling rating reputation you make goes down the drain. Onto the next app!,4
1141,"They keep making this app worse and worse: This app used to be great…. It’s been on a steady downward trajectory for a while now…. It’s gotten to the point now where it’s bordering on being plain not worth the trouble to use…. I can’t even scroll through the feed without hitting on an advertisement and leaving the app… like 5 min on OfferUp and I have 15 safari tabs open for toro lawn care products…. What the hell…. When the ads started it was mildly annoying, but now it’s so bad that almost every time I go to scroll it opens a tab because I touched an advertisement. I would estimate that the feed is probably close to 40% advertisements now…. I know they are losing users too because I have started to hear ads for OfferUp on the radio….",2
1142,"Not the same as they use to be: Before this app was amazing around 2016 when I was using it heavily. No though, ads are everywhere and it feels like they push you so much to buying their premium options. For example, your post is hidden from the general public for 30 minutes. The search engine is terrible now, it's extremely laggy compared to before, it's like they downgraded their servers. You can't even type without misspelling because the app is so slow. The actual listings are littered with stores and shops, if you search a phone good luck finding someone who actually sells it, 80% of the first 100 listings are retailers. This app fell off perfection so far that it's unusable, really unfortunate. With all these changes it's obvious they won't be changing or reverting these changes.",1
1143,"Easy to use but slow to edit; Notification Badge bug: The app is pretty easy to use, making a post, but tends to be very tedious to edit because you have to walk through each individual section. You can’t jump to one section that would make things a lot easier to make minor edits and updates along the way.

Also, more annoying is a continued bug in which the notifications badge icon on the app continues to stick and you can’t get rid of it no matter what you do. This seems to go on with different updates and even persists after deleting and reinstalling the app.",4
1144,"Well developed app, pesky marketing: Although notification settings are customizable, you will still receive plenty of unwanted push notifications about new items, items you’ve searched for, etc. It’s invasive and annoying that the only way to avoid being pestered is to disable all push notifications which hinders prompt buyer/seller communication. There are far too many duplicates and business ads on the app which makes shopping unpleasant, especially when there is no option to block ads from the spam accounts. After going through so many spam ads, you lose interest in the item you were shopping for.",3
1145,"Needs to be updated: I use to love this app but recently they been having problems. I message a few people to items I’m looking to buy and the seller never reads the message or replies. At least 5 different sellers. So that made me wonder. 
So I messaged my fiancé page on one of her items to see if she gets the message. 
Message was never delivered. So that’s why no one reply to my messages because they never received it. 
Then I post a item of my own to sell and after a entire week, not one person saw my post. It’s impossible for NO ONE to see that post. Something is wrong with their app and needs serious looking into. They are losing a lot of customers this way. PLEASE UPDATE APP!!!!",3
1146,"App doesn’t sell: I have been reselling and selling my own items as a small side business and your site doesn’t sell anything. When i first used it i made a few sales and then just nothing. Ive sold over 200 items on mercari and poshmark making 4,000 just in profit over the past few months. I’ve mentioned it before but this site doesn’t allow views and doesn’t sell. Your losing alot of profit in the reselling 3rd party platform industry from customers just like me that wont list profitable items on here due to no sales. My suggestion allow views and also allow likes and offers directly to customers like the other sites. I dont wont to promote items due to the fact that i have hundreds of items to sell not one or two. Promo does nothing anyway. Thanku best regards, Carissa Boisvert",1
1147,"Too many charges for buyers and sellers: Last couple of days I was trying to buy an items from Texas and it was $1000 worth and 3 boxes should come together . But there is no way a seller can sell items more than 18 lb weight because the largest deliverable item should be 18 lb max. Anyhow I was agreed with the seller to pay the actual fedex delivery charge out side of OfferUp or pay extra for the item to cover the delivery fee. Then when I send the offer , then seller need to pay 12.9% as service fee to OfferUp . It was more than $100 loss for him. I have to pay another $93 as tax. $1000 item to buy from offer up , I had to pay 1200 for the shipping and tax and the seller will receive only 890$ or less. We have up the sale and used fedex cash on delivery",2
1148,"Needs improvements: I like that I can maintain communication through the app and not have to give out my phone number. I like that it suggests places to meet at and those places are police stations. What I would like to see is the option to filter by owner, filter by dates (past week, month, 60 days). There are so many posts that are from dealerships with the down payment as the asking price (really annoying). Also, there are many, many, many posts that are years old! There are also many fake ads, which are really easy to spot (similar descriptions, pictures, low prices). 80% of the time I spend on the app goes to flagging the old posts and scams.",3
1149,"Lot of talk, no action: This is probably my third or fourth time giving this app a chance and each time my opinion has gotten progressively worse. Nothing but an endless barrage of messages asking if something is still available or saying ‘I want to buy your item.’ Great…SO CLICK THE BUY BUTTON! And why would you ask if something is still available if it’s posted and listed active? Literally none of these messages so any farther than that. Seems to me this app is nothing but bots and spam or scammers (and not very good ones either). Also a lot of people saying they want to buy something, arrange a meet up, and they never show. 

Now, I know the issue isn’t me because I have sold over 230 items making over $3,000 on Mercari with a 97% 5-star rating. 

Don’t waste your time.",1
1150,"Painfully long wait to be paid: This app Is great for local sales, if you plan to ship your item be prepared to wait a painfully long time to be paid, it took me almost a week to receive the shipping label, then I had to wait for usps to deliver the package. After the package is delivered the buyer has 2 more days to inspect the item, if all goes well expect to wait another week for the funds to hit your account. 1 month after the sale you can expect to have the money in your account. The service fee to sell item is also absurd at almost 10%. I will continue to use this app for local sale but definitely will never use this app to ship another item and will continue to use anything else such as eBay",3
1151,Terrible: Waste of your time when you post an item your gonna get offers for less than half or even full price offers then ghosted. The administration enables this behavior by not enforcing any of their community rules and guidelines and allow scammers to continue to pull off their scams when it’s obvious. They shadow ban you for speaking up and or cancel you for telling them why are you allowing this behavior after I sold 500 items in 6 weeks with a 5 star rating but the time I wasted playing games with the scammers and low ball offers that the allowed after reporting these people wasn’t worth it. I would stay away forever until change has been shown to improve it because most of these scammers have 4-6 accounts and bid on single item to beat the price down. Good luck Jake,1
1152,"Terrible app.: Never in my life have I ever desired to write a review because I’ve never cared enough. My hatred for this app is only ever growing.

When I join back in December nothing was that bad. I use the app to buy and sell phones so that I can support myself - it is literally my job. Through the app I verified my identity using a third party service called “TruYou.” I verified myself back in December and just today it will not let me send any messages unless I “Verify” myself with TruYou. See the problem?

ALL THE TIME I go to try to send messages and it just does not work. I’ve had my account shadow banned because competitors report me for bogus reasons.

There is no filter. This app is absolutely LOADED with scammers and they seem to do NOTHING about it. Frequently I’ll see pictures of an item I posted 10 days ago being ‘sold’ by someone else. I report them and say this is my item, look at my profile. Nothing ever gets done. The lack of care for customers is just absurd. Never in my life would I EVER suggest anyone download this app.

Never in my life have I EVER been so frustrated with such a pitiful excuse for an application. Never download this app it is an utter waste of your time.",1
1153,"Disappointing: I have been using this app for years now. Offer up and let go. When they first launched they worked great. Personally I feel letgo had a better selection and they got rid of ads when they aged out. Offer up in my opinion doesn’t work well because at face value it has a bunch of listings until you click on them and they are (over a year old) they never take down listings that don’t sell. So it looks like there is several listings in your area until you find out no one responds because their listings were 1-2 years old and they deleted the app. My suggestion do it the old fashion way like craigslist. Ads have to be renewed, and if a person deletes the app it deletes their listings .. fix your app so it’s not just click bait ads and old listings",2
1154,"Ridiculous: I was banned for no reason and I didn’t even sell anything. Only reason I started noticing because nobody would see my responses. The company didn’t give a reason, they basically just cut your communication and made me wander in the dark until I figured it out myself. I emailed back about three times and each time they just copied and pasted the same response that I violates their terms but didn’t say what I violated. 

Honestly I hope future sellers see this and don’t try making a future on their platform when they don’t even tell you what was violated and then ban you with no warning. Why would anybody build a foundation then? Just sell what you need and get out. 

As for the app and the company: I hope you burn

Yeah I saw developer response as I suspected they would. As I already mentioned, I already emailed three times to “share my concerns” but all they did was copy and paste the same exact response. Don’t be fooled by them responding to reviews. They don’t care about their customers, they just take your money and ignore you. I DARE them to actually respond and tell me what I did wrong. Because they didn’t tell me in the app. They didn’t tell me in the email. Let’s see if they tell me in the reviews.",1
1155,"Nice design but ultimately unable to sell anything: Visually better than Craigslist but I got only scammers on my items. When I browsed stuff to buy it was lots of advertisements for other sites, and it’s pretty easy to click on. Then the app kept sending me notifications to buy things I had viewed/searched that were just distracting and stupid. 

Feels engineered to mine my data and sell me ads. Craigslist has its share of scammers too but at least it’s all anonymous and they are not promoting content, sending useless notifications, and probably stealing your data. Not to mention no ones on this thing. It can’t even identify what town you live in. I don’t have a car so only was interested in things within a 1 mile range. Not an option to browse. Has to be minimum 5",2
1156,"App seems to work fine for friends, but not myself...: I started using Offerup almost a week ago (today is Dec. 10, 2020) after making an account back in mid-November. My friend says Offerup is an awesome app that he’s made a decent amount of money off of, but for me, that’s definitely the opposite so far. I currently have two items up for sale, and the buyer (who was already determined through another app) who wants to purchase them sees no “Make an Offer” option and for myself, I do not have a “Buy Now” option that I see it gives you on the “shipping” section of when you make your post. I really want to like this app but I’m just not having a good time with it. My payments are verified, my FB is connected to it, and everything else needed to post/sell/buy is confirmed. :(",2
1157,"Get rid of spell check!: The most recent update added some ridiculously aggressive and incorrect spell check. Most all searches now incorrectly spell check what I was searching for. All searches now consist of: search for the item, click the link at the top of the page saying “search instead for” because offerup thinks you misspelled what you were searching for, look at items. To get to every search is now twice as many clicks as before. Infuriating!

Edit: after OfferUp reached out and suggested I contact their support I did. My review changed from two stars to one. They continued to tell me the issue was that I couldn’t spell (wrong), the keyword I was searching for had no results (wrong), I needed to log out and log in again (not sure how that will change the functionality of the app, but it also did nothing). Terrible CS.",1
1158,"As a Seller, I Hate It: People on Offer Up want garage sale prices, but if I, as the seller, have to coordinate a time with the buyer and meet them somewhere, they need to pay for my time and gas. Honestly, it is easier to box and mail things through EBay than to deal with meeting flaky and annoying people locally. I don’t sell a lot of things, but have 100% feedback on EBay and have been selling stuff there for over a decade. I have tried to sell five things through Offer Up and had to deal with so many annoying people, it’s like forget it, I’ll stick with Ebay. You get way more money, as a seller, on Ebay also, because people compete.  On Offer Up, whatever price you set, people think you should sell it for 50% less. I’d rather donate my things to charity than sell to people like that, who act like they are reselling the items anyway.",1
1159,"Messages broken; scammers allowed.: Most of the time, the OfferUp app either makes no sound for new notifications, or fails even to display a badge on the app icon. This has resulted in lots of missed messages and lost sales opportunities for me. Yes, everything is set up correctly, and I’ve contacted support repeatedly but just get form-letters that don’t help. Additionally, the app endlessly demands your attention with “_____ items for you!” notifications that you can’t disable, so even when I do actually get a notification, it’s often just spam... I’m about to delete my account as even craigslist is easier to deal with than this.  #### ALSO: I just ran into a seller who tried a bait-and-switch scam on me; despite super-clear evidence of this in our chat history, it took two days for OfferUp to respond... and the fake item is STILL posted for sale!!",1
1160,"Great, game changer once they allowed you to ship nationwide: I’ve made so many extra dollars using this app. It’s really been a blessing. Currently in a season of life where work has been inconsistent due to pretty major health issues and using this has allow me to make some timely extra dollars here and there. I’ve tried that other popular one ‘Let Go’, and it’s pretty terrible; never sold not one thing using it. Up here I’ve sold lots of different items either face to face or shipped. I’ll continue to use it unless they make some major change that makes it more complicated to use. For sure 5 🎖",5
1161,"Very Trustworthy Site: Offer up is awesome as the site protects the seller and the buyer. As far as myself posting on here, I had to confirm my email, my phone plus I posted a picture of myself!
I will tell you there is another site that has been around for years, it breads every scam artist , every pervert and I will never post another product on that site!! 
Offer up protections are rare and I highly recommend anyone posting on here, follow their advice and you can’t go wrong!
I just sold 2 items I have been trying to sell on the other site and within 2 days, I sold both items!
Thank you Offer Up!!",5
1162,Wonderful Resource!!: I am a Real Estate agent with more than 15 years experience and I just recently had a contractor of mine suggest to me to post items on OfferUp that needed to be hauled off at a home for a seller and client of mine that I was remodeling to list on market and I was able to list and sell and over items for free pick up that would have otherwise had to be hauled off at sellers expense and I was able to take that money and purchase items toward the sellers remodel. I will keep using this resource and I’ve had a wonderful experience being a new user of OfferUp!,5
1163,"From bad to worse.: Just overall not a great app. I use 5 “buy and sell” applications and Ive watched this one go downhill for some time. It never quite caught up to “LetGo” in my region, but now it’s almost unusable. Seems like it has some regional attention but it’s a dog. It’s slow, the support is non existent. I’ve reported multiple scams and they are VERY slow on the cleanup. Now they have a disguised imbedded ad system so it’s an absolute scam land mine game. Not to mention don’t dare look something up by name or you will have have 1/2 a page of adds for exactly what you want but it will take you to an ad browser. Also, don’t expect to click on too many items as it will force you to watch an ad. (Easier and faster to just close the app and reopen which likely boosts their engagement numbers.",1
1164,"NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW MY ADDRESS YOU FREAKS: WHY on EARTH would you require a return address??? You know VERY WELL we are PEOPLE NOT BUSINESSES. THESE ARE OUR HOMES. I do not need a dozen plus random people across town, the state, or the country,  knowing my address. You guys need to have post offices already approved for returns. We are selling MOSTLY USED items. Unless you’re paying over $50 there is NO reason to be returning something if it’s faulty or broken. Nobody should be expecting perfection unless it’s specifically stated as brand new. If someone gets a faulty product do you really think the seller is going to fork over any amount of money, especially if they know it’s a scam? You get NO MONEY until it’s shipped which is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS  AND VILE. Beyond money grubbers and selfish reprobates, these are just fools trying to get a dime off of other people's work.",1
1165,"App is now slow: Offer-up used to be great, I have used it many times in the past and is still a good resource. Now it is a bit hard to use. The ads have slowed down the loading time of everything (almost seems buggy) and now they just pop up out of nowhere and take over the whole screen. It is not seamless anymore as it used to be, now using the app is a hassle. It would be great if the quality and use of the app improved over time instead of it getting worse. The old offer-up (before the latest major update) was such a great app to use. I understand ad revenue is important to a business but it seems to be at the expense of the overall quality and experience of the app.",2
1166,"Randomly banned accounts: OfferUp has faced criticism for its questionable business practices, including banning users without apparent cause. My experience with OfferUp was limited to being a buyer who primarily engaged in local purchases. However, I suddenly found myself shadow banned, with no convincing explanation other than vague claims of violating their selling guidelines and policies. Unfortunately, many others have found themselves in a similar situation, suggesting that this is not an isolated incident. Moreover, it appears that OfferUp is struggling as a platform, inundating users with numerous ads and aggressively promoting its premium, ad-free services. In comparison to more established platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Mercari, and Craigslist, OfferUp seems to be facing challenges. With these concerning practices, it wouldn't be surprising if OfferUp faces difficulties in the future.",1
1167,"Banned and blocked account: Still disappointed that my account was banned and disabled because I posted fetish items that were against their guidelines. When I used Letgo , I was able to sell these items. But I guess it changed when these two apps combined. Anyways I wasn’t aware of this guideline because I didn’t read it, Staffs didn’t update or educated me and banned my account 
My friend gave me their account to use after I told her about my banned account, to sell things but that account was blocked too and all listings are hidden. The account is there but all listings are hidden. I guess they track you with mobile device or IP address. This app is very confusing and not user friendly. I recommend other apps where staffs are more helpful and actually value their sellers/buyers",1
1168,"The weird people who you encounter!: I love the app but their are surely some weird people who use the app. I was accused of being a scammer because I wouldn’t lower the price of my item and I refused to meet the person at a location I never agreed to meet. My listing clearing stated, I would only meet at the Sheriff’s Office in my town. The person got upset and sent a message attempting to judge my character. I literally had to block the individual. I’m tempted to no longer use this app because of the weird individual. Other than that encounter, the app is a great way to unload things that are of good use but just not being used by you.",4
1169,"Better than Facebook Marketplace!!!: I’ve sold most of my next gen consoles on here locally. This app does a nice job of showing your listings locally. 

Let’s face it tho Facebook marketplace would be better then OfferUp if Facebook actually promoted your listing and didn’t penalize you for every little thing. When Facebook does actually work it’s amazing but as of late. All my listings I post on Facebook sit at 0 views / interactions but are “accepted” listings. I literally have a listing up for an Xbox series x that has been up there for 24hrs with 0 interactions. It’s very clear I’m being profiled / harassed on Facebook.

Meanwhile my next gen console listings on OfferUp are getting on average 450 interactions and a bunch of conversations. Within 3 days. Without paying for promotions.

I recommend everybody to use this app. If you’re trying to sell locally. They have shipping options as well. But this app shines the most locally. I highly recommend over Facebook marketplace. 

For being completely free it’s god sent.",5
1170,"Trash app that bans people for submitting offers: Garbage app that I’ve been with since 2016 banned me for my offers not “being good enough” and I had over 100 5 star reviews. It’s sad that a company is banning people from their app that is actually helping their app grow. It’s not at all a bad idea to provide users with warnings or maybe change terms of service to not be so extremely sensitive. These days your constitutional rights don’t even matter, even just offering a listing a certain dollar amount has to be up to par or looked at to ensure no one’s feelings are getting hurt otherwise you’ll get banned for life.  The app is called “offer-up” not “offer a good enough offer so you don’t hurt others feelings”. It’s despicable and disgusting that they abuse their powers and ruin some people’s side hustles. Clowns.",1
1171,One feature missing makes this app useless: The inability to search by recently added makes this app useless. It will show you the same five things posted over a year ago over and over again rather than what is new. I stopped using this app when they got rid of this feature a few years back. I was hoping maybe they came to their senses after this time and placed it back in but apparently they don’t care that Facebook marketplace is beating them due to one feature alone. Search on Google and you will find a ton of other people asking about how to do this. So either it is present but not very obvious meaning terrible interface or it isn’t capable meaning offerup just isn’t very usable. If you are looking into using this app Just Use marketplace. It’s better,1
1172,"Horrible. Will never use this app again!!!: First Of all, this app is NOT verified, mostly everything is fake and poor quality and they advertise it as real. I purchased something from this app. I got the item and it was defective and wasn’t anything like what I wanted and I requested a refund, the seller was completely rude and told me that I can’t return it and denied my request, so I contacted support and they gave me the run around for days and I finally submitted my claim and explained everything to them, why I was upset about my purchase and that I feel as a customer if I’m unsatisfied I should have a right to get a refund or at least credit. I was willing to send them pictures and they denied my refund also. Be careful what you buy because they will not accommodate you AT ALL if you are not satisfied.",1
1173,"Set up to allow scams.: I placed a shipping order for a watch and when I received it it was not functioning. I immediately let the seller know and requested to return and get a refund. I did so immediately and sent the tracking number. 
I also created a dispute case on the app which was put into the chat and said that the seller had two days to respond to which the seller responded 1 minute later. And agreed to a refund upon return of the item. Every time I asked for a follow up on my refund I keep getting excuses from the seller. The seller even claimed that he would do it using another app. But still hasn’t done anything.
I’ve reached out to offer up but their response is it is past the 2 day return window. But obviously I already expressed discontent within that window! Absolute rip off.",1
1174,"Review: I’m overall happy with app; however I believe that when submitting offers, sellers should accept or declined within 24 hrs or less, and seller should not put dollar amount on offers if they are not willing to meet them.
Buyers should also have a better process and way to be able to request refund, discount, when disputing a purchase; and make it an easier process to provide pics of damages, etc.; on the same page, and have customer service contact buyer immediately after requesting for refund/discount in case they cannot access the process of making such requests.",4
1175,"I want previews back and the miles filters don’t work: Now every time I click on something just to make the image big enough to tell what it is my feed gets populated with similar items despite my having no interest in such things - stupid! I can’t tell if somethings a good deal at a glance without navigating from search which takes more time from looking at things I might actually be interested in buying. Again, STUPID with all caps!! Trying to search for a car in your area is also a nightmare because changing the filter to 30 miles does not work and driving 80 miles takes 2 hours in the Seattle area, so I have to constantly deal with clicking on cars that I might want only to find they are too far away, which is very disappointing and frustrating.",1
1176,"Too many scammers and bots: I love selling on this app. It’s super easy to post and the money gets deposited quickly. However, every single time I post an item I get a message from someone with no picture, who just joined offer up, and they always ask if the item is available. It’s always within 1 minute of posting. When I say yes they will ask for my phone number. I always say no and block them right away. When I have engaged they always say they need to make sure I’m a real person; which is really ironic because I’m pretty sure it’s bots that send these messages. It’s incredibly annoying. This kind of thing doesn’t happen on Mercari or Poshmark.",3
1177,"New Update is bad please go back to previous one: I Love this App. That’s why I give it 5 stars. Though I will mention, It use to be so simple, fast and easy! Even fun to post on OfferUp. Now, it’s a challenge typing a description as the typing line repeatedly moves all the way to the top. I have to tap, tap and tap to try and adjust the typing line where I want it. The first picture (cover photo) blows up your picture so much that it cuts off completely the side of your picture picture. These are just a few unpleasant, frustrating, annoying things. I wish it could go back to its simple form.",5
1178,Best selling app: I’ve been using OfferUp since the beginning and I appreciate how easy it is to use. Not once I felt that the app was difficult. The new update seems more modern but kept its originality. I’ve tried other selling apps but it seems like theyre always trying to sell on their own apps. With offer you get a more professional look of other businesses selling. OfferUp is convenient and probably is the number one selling app today. I remember Craigslist was number one at one time but that has changed over time. Now OfferUp is in charge. Let’s see if OfferUp can continue what they are doing..,5
1179,Hate new version loosing hidden messages: Honestly so many people are losing their items and you’re losing business because there’s no way to find a hidden item hidden items now and to go back and continue conversations as far as I can see I can’t go to my hidden conversations hidden items  I have lost so many items that I was going to purchase because they automatically delete or they go in a place where I can’t find them anymore and I can’t go back and continue to track items down it’s ridiculous if you guys have made it so you cannot see hidden conversations anymore I when I could see them I could go and have them continue conversations with items that I was still looking at to check if they had been sold soldAs far as I can see I cannot see any of the hidden conversations anymore,1
1180,"Getting crowded with fake\outdated & sold post: I have been using this app for years and would have given it a 5 star. If it wasn’t for all the fake multiple postings with fake accounts, then you have items listed for years and you reach out and there’s no response and finally who the hell is really interested to see an item that was already sold in the live feeds.  No point if it’s no longer available for purchase.  

Offer Up here is my suggestions from someone who works in IT.  if you want to continue to have users use your App.  Nobody wants to waste their time looking at outdated or irrelevant data.

1) Please verify users and post using dual factor authentication.
2) Have users reconfirm post are still active after 3 months to confirm availability. 
3)Sold items should be removed from active listings.  If you must show off sold items please remove from active tab and create another tab such as “Previously Sold”.",5
1181,"My first Offerup purchase: The first thing I ever purchased was hot tub steps!! I have been waiting to get my hot tub fixed for a while and after the pandemic and all the issues I finally was able to get it going and now I really needed to find steps to get in easy. I had been googling online and they were all over $100 !! I went to OfferUp and searched in my area, saved it and it pinged me when someone near by had exactly what I wanted!!  30 min later and only $50 spent, I as able to meet up and buy the steps and met a great individual that had other things to help with my hitting!! What a great experience!!!",5
1182,Displeasured x offer up customer: Just wanted to express my displeasure with offer up. I purchased bears tickets from someone on offer up. Ends up the tickets were counterfeit. I informed offer up of the issue but received nothing except an automatic reply  nobody ever contacted me to ask any questions. When I continue to use the app I seen a good number of scammers I confronted them and also let offer up know that they were scammers. And nothing was done others appeared.  Then they tell me I’m being kicked off the site for harassment. I worked hard to save that money and go to a ounce in a lifetime event. Doesn’t seem right.,5
1183,"Filter out the scammer!: I love this app! I sell and by stuff all the time. I look here for a lot of things. I've sold a couple of cars this way. BUT! I wish there was a way to filter out the scammers! Especially in the cars & trucks section. Seriously, they're selling a year old Lexus for $15?! Or trying to sell the same Chevy Tahoe in 35 different cities across the US?! Can there be a way to require a description for every item being sold. Year/Make/model/vin/miles. For goodness sake people, why do you block your license plate? It's on display for millions to see daily. If you don't want it viewed take 30 seconds to remove it from your car before taking pictures of it.",4
1184,"My experience wasn’t good: There are awesome reviews here, and this app might be great, but I want no part of it any longer. I paid for an item that was supposed to get shipped the next day, no communication with the shipper, item never came, yes my money was refunded. But, the refund was besides the point, the fact that my time was wasted was an issue to me.

Furthermore, I wasn’t allowed to review the user to give other buyers a fair chance to decide whether or not they wanted to risk dealing with this particular seller in the future. I’m wondering if she was unprofessional with other possible buyers, and I could have avoided wasting my time with her if I had known.

Customer service did not penalize her for not keeping up with her part of the sale either. So I’m done with this app, once again just my experience. Looking at other reviews, I seem to be in the minority.",1
1185,"I hate this app so much: And mainly because I continue to use it. My main issue with it is that this app creates “things you may be interested in list” and then posts a notification alert which makes it look like someone has messaged or replied to your inquiry. You open the app, and it’s just advertisement. Drives me crazy!! Another issue is a design decision. On Facebook marketplace you can see right away how much something costs, here you have to click on it first which makes your time searching that much longer and annoying. So there, I use the app because others do as well but I hate it and will continue to rate it 1-2 stars until these things have changed. Be nice to users and they will love you for it, use underhanded advertisement tactics and you’ll get this.",2
1186,"Quality app: I’ve been using OfferUp for a couple years now and I’ve seen some really great improvements on this application. It’s easy to post an item and communicate with other users. I would like to see an improvement to allow users to bump for free. Right now you have to pay. On Facebook Marketplace you are allowed to post up to 5 times after your item has been posted for 7 days. I would like to see the same model with OfferUp. Maybe, they could allow 2 free bumps and pay for additional bumps. Either way I still find this application to be very useful and a staple on my phone.",5
1187,"Gives illusion of more items than are there with Ads and already sold items: There are things I like about this app, it is fairly active in my area, the messaging function is nice, and the rating system is a good idea.

Not a fan of the excessive ADs that are targeted based on your previous searches and designed to look like a normal item on the site. They also keep sold items on the site with a small sold banner on top. I suspect they keep items that are more desirable (eg get more clicks/ inquiries) around longer to give the illusion that there are more desirable items than are actually available. 

I find that the targeted ads and retention of sold items make offer up a worse choice than Craigslist",3
1188,"Horrible AI and Support: I had put up my first item for sale the other night (PAX West badges). Knew it was ok as it didn’t go against any of their posted guidelines and other users had also been selling their badges through the app. However, my post was taken down with the claim it was a gift card. I figured it was an error, and I emailed back stating that my item is not a gift card but a badge for a local event (event is in Seattle, OfferUp offices are in Bellevue, WA). I received another email. This time from Carlos. Or copy pasted Carlos. It was mostly another automated message explaining that items with a balance on them can not be accepted. I responded again that it doesn’t have a balance. It is a ticket to an event that I had even provided a link to. I never received a response back, but that’s ok. App has been deleted and I wouldn’t recommend it at all to anyone.",1
1189,"Car dealers have hi-jacked this app: Please put a REQUIRED field for dealer or individual owner. The car section is inundated with so many dealers that I almost want to stop using the app. A search filter would provide buyers a choice/option of who they want do business with. Dealer prices are also different from private, or trade-in prices. CAVEATS: Dealer like to post as individual to draw more/all business. There should be a way to allow users an option to flag posts that are posted/listed wrong, or in error to listing rules when this happens. I’d like to give five stars but you’ve allowed dealers to hi-jack the vehicle section of your app.",5
1190,"Too many ads!: I do enjoy the basic premise of the app. I wish there was a filter to filter out businesses or pricing. The app has changed so much. I’m not a fan the new part of getting an ad every time I look at the details of an item, then I can’t close it right away. It’s frustrating. I already get ads when I’m scrolling.  Which is weird, because the process makes the buyer pay and can also pay again to upgrade there item.
 I would like to see a price or dollar signs on the thumbnail picture, it would help a lot.",5
1191,"Imposible to sell items at a normal low price!!: While I appreciate the opportunity to connect with potential buyers through OfferUp, I've encountered several challenges that have made it increasingly difficult to conduct successful transactions. Specifically, I've noticed a concerning trend of encountering low-ballers and unreliable buyers.
Many potential buyers seem to engage in negotiations with no intention of following through with a purchase. I've had instances where individuals express interest in my products, I provided my address, and then disappear without any further communication. 
Additionally, I've encountered buyers who commit to purchasing an item, only to inform me later that they've found it elsewhere.

These experiences have been frustrating and time-consuming, making it increasingly challenging to rely on OfferUp as a viable platform for conducting business. As someone who relies on selling items to support myself and my family, these setbacks are particularly concerning.

As Sellers here in this application we are having so many issues with people that just do not want to purchase.

Offerup is the name it does not mean that everything need to be open to low offers!",1
1192,Fix The Bugs!!!!!!: I have been on offer up for years and have never had an issue with it until this past year. The app crashes more times than I can count and I can’t even post what I want to sell because it absolutely will not upload pictures from my gallery no matter what I try to do. Keeps telling me to either “choose a cover photo” or “photos cannot upload try again” I have gotten so frustrated with this app these past two days trying to post this one thing I have given up. Please fix these issues I would like to enjoy offer up again and change this 3 star rating to a solid 5 but it’s just not there yet.,3
1193,Good vibes: The set up is very precise. It guide you through to get what you want and sell. When I need something that might not be able to get it in the store I go directly to OfferUp. I’ve only had one bad experience but not due to OfferUp just due to the person that I was trying to get the merchandise from. I feel that OfferUp is a very good way of getting things that you necessarily can’t get in the store. And also ways of selling what you need to sell to others even though I have not sold anything not due to off work but just no takers thank you .,5
1194,"Liars , thieves , scammers , counterfeiters , ghosts , and low ballers.: Let’s not forget that these crooks , and con artists steal your money , and get away with it. After all , their profiles are fake , their goods are nonexistent, and reporting them to OfferUp has zero effect on them. There are no secret shoppers helping combat these people. Even  businesses on the main feed are not being watched , thus allowing cyber criminals to create fake websites , post ads with lower priced goods to lure you back to their site where they have more fake goods taylored to your most recent searches from the OfferUp app in an effort to rob you blind, and all the while OfferUp affords no help , accept zero responsibility, and will never contact you ever for any reason. The motor is running , but there’s no one behind the wheel.",2
1195,"Great, but could be better: This app is pretty awesome for finding things locally. The search results are pretty easy to navigate, but I think I would prefer fewer results per screen so that the pictures are larger. I would also like to see the listed price for the item before clicking on it for further details. 

The are also a ton or scammers on the app and it would be such a better experience if I didn’t have to feel paranoid every time I interact with people. I wish there was better screening in place cause these people are very active. I was glad that the reporting feature was easy to use.",4
1196,"Banned for no reason: I've been using Offerup for at least 5 years now. It's a great app since it allows me to buy/sell things locally. But for some reason this week, my listings are not getting any views. It's most likely that another local seller reported me just so they could remove the competition. When my wife tried messaging me from another phone on OfferUp, I got a message saying my listing is blocked from OfferUp. This is very frustrating because I have not done anything wrong. I know I did not commit any violations. I've sold hundreds of items and I'm always professional to other users and all of a sudden I'm banned from OfferUp without any reasons. 

If anyone at OfferUp reads this, please help me. I would like to be able to get my account back rather than going back to craigslist",1
1197,"Account issues: Love the app and the ability to buy and sell things easily but when I ran into account issues that the FAQ didn’t cover it was difficult to reach them. The “contact us” information does not include an email or phone number so I had to search around other sites to find their point of contact. It took about 24-36 hours for them to send a reply and I was back in the system, however, I didn’t receive any reason for the issue. Glad to be back on, but hopefully there isn’t any more account issues and they make their contact info more accessible.",4
1198,"Good place to sell items fast BUT…: This is a good way to quickly sell your items, but there are a LOT of false “buyers” on this app. They will message you and act interested, then ask for your information to speak off of the app. Report these people!!! They are scammers who will come up with an excuse as to why they “can’t pay via the app” etc. it’s all a scam and lies. Offer-Up should get these people off of the app 100%. If OnlyFans can look at DMs between people why can’t OfferUp. This is a very negative part to any app, I do realize this. It’s not 100% offerup’s fault, but they should make a conscious effort not to let these people make several accounts and harass sellers. 
Overall the app is good!",3
1199,"Truyou is literally so dumb: I don’t really care if you guys need to verify that I’m a legitimate person, but at least make it work. I’m forced to be truyou verified or else I can’t text anyone back about listings, which is literally so stupid. It would be fine if the truyou thing actually worked, but I start the ID scan and it fails to recognize my ID. No matter what background I have, I tried fully black, fully white, hardwood, everything !!! It doesn’t ever scan my ID, so this means I can’t message anyone back which concludes to the app being useless to me. I emailed “tech support” which I’m pretty sure doesn’t even exist because I haven’t heard anything back from them in days!! This is so ridiculous, I don’t care if you guys need to verify my ID but at least make it work so I can actually use the app.",1
1200,"Love Offerup!: I absolutely love Offerup and have been using their platform since they started and then later merged with Let Go. I like that it is convenient and easy to follow for posting your listing. However, know every company needs to make money, but I think once you reach a certain amount of sales, Offerup should allow them to have free access to sell their items 2x faster, since we have been so loyal. I still recommend offer up to my friends, family and acquaintances. Overall, one of my favor apps to us to sell my things.",5
1201,"Doesn’t Deliver Results: I’ve downloaded, deleted, and re-downloaded this app many times over the years (even before the merge with letgo) and I’ve never been able to sell anything here. I don’t know what their algorithm is for getting your ‘for sale’ items to the right people but I will always get 1 or 2 messages from potential buyers for only a couple of my listed items, and then it’s a ghost town. And I’m selling quality furniture (light used bed frames, dressers, book cases, etc.), not junk from around the house that no one wants. I can turn around and sell the items just fine on Facebook market place. Not sure why that happens. I’ve never used the app for purchasing things so maybe it’s better in that regard. I also get a lot of scammers from unverified accounts asking for my phone number to send me codes.",1
1202,"Great app but ...: I love this app , it has helped me buy most of my furniture , that’s if I get lucky if sellers actually respond back . The downside is that sellers won’t change it to SOLD ... i have found several items that I’m interested in but ends up with a reply “sorry it’s been sold” from something that was sold days ago , waste of my time to be honest or don’t even respond back to you which is annoying . I feel like that’s something it should be changed where the app forcefully makes you rate (or ask you if it was sold) after messaging a buyer whether it was sold or not. Like that the item will always be updated for future buyers like me.",4
1203,"3 stars until you fix this, 5 when it’s updated: I love both OfferUp and LetGo, however my biggest complaint and the best feedback I could offer would be to remove the old old listings. I’m sure it makes it look like you have more for sale than is really available , but listings from 6/7 months or a year ago aren’t doing anything for anyone. It’s annoying and I’m tired of wasting my time clicking on vehicles that are obviously long gone and someone was too lazy to update the listing. Please remove/scrub listings older than 3 months at least. Most specifically I am referring to vehicle listings. I know I am not alone on this one. Does OfferUp really CARE about user feedback though? That’s the real question at hand.",3
1204,"Terrible customer service: I ordered a desk from someone through shipping. A week or so later I got a notification saying the item was delivered to my address, I checked my porch and the sidewalks near my house but no package. I tried to put in a buyers claim well within the 2 day time limit but was told I was past the 48 hr time limit (I tried to put one in within an hour.) I hunted down customer service and was told through email to submit a buyers claim and have been going in circles trying to resolve this problem ever since. 
Maybe this app is good for pickups in person but I feel like I’ve been scammed and the service through this company has been terrible for me. I probably won’t use it again out of principle and hope that this review serves as a heads up for people who want to order items through the app. Just be careful.",1
1205,"Could use some features: The OfferUp app and platform is relatively straight forward which I like. My only complaints are:

1) I should be able to swipe left (or right) to delete notifications without having to open them... or options to delete, mark as read, etc. 

2) Old listings that stay there forever. Some listings have items that were sold many moons ago or the seller just forgot about the listing altogether and aren’t responding. Maybe when a listing reaches a certain age, listers should receive a notification and maybe be presented with options to either keep listing (second question: update listing or continue as is) or remove listing (for reasons like: not for sale any longer or sold already)

It just feels sloppy to have all these really old listings that aren’t valid or relevant any longer. Also, another suggestion- maybe allow buyers and sellers to both leave written feedback and post on seller/buyer profile in addition to the little keywords labeling the buyer and seller respectively.

1206,"Good but few things needed (UPDATE NEEDED): App works great and shows exactly what I’m looking for when searching things unlike some other apps. Everything works great other than when it comes to un-saving, saves items. I have a lot of saved items I’d like to get rid of but it takes a lot of time because when I scroll all the way down to the bottom of my saved items, it automatically scrolls me all the way back to the top after un-saving the item. It would be much easy if they installed a way to select items that you’d like to un-save so you can do it all at once. Other than that, great app.",4
1207,"Really not safe place to pay money: I bought item on this app, so I paid and was waiting for item to be arrived, but somehow my account was locked out. So I contact the support, and they just mentioned my account had inappropriate access so they blocked my account and only they mentioned that they have all right to block all of the user. But WHY? I didn’t do anything wrong and just paid on this app and they just steal my $500. I used this app for more than 3 years, and I’ve never had problem until now. Really disappointed and now I have to contact my credit card company to cancel my transaction which was madden on this app. My recommendation is not, just use Facebook marketplace which is much safer and reliable to spend money. Please don’t use this app and lose your money.",1
1208,"Favorites lists suggestions: Everything has been pretty smooth with this app. I have success buying and selling. My favorites lists/boards are getting too big and I need an easier way to manage them. For example, a one click button to clear all sold items from a favorites lists rather than going in one by one and have a 2-3 click process. That’s takes too long and now my boards have too many items to manage. 
I could also be more successful at buying if I could see my favorites on a map. That way I could meetup with more than one seller at a time while I am in that area of town to make multiple purchases.",4
1209,"Bought one thing and will be deleting the app: I got the wrong thing. I told the seller. The seller kindly agreed to a full refund....but didn’t know how to initiate it. I said I would figure it out. That was 36 hours, 4 emails to Offer Up, and countless futile attempts ago. No answers. Their how-to articles online seem to be designed to send you in circles on the issue of a refund, with links taking you from one page to another. When I finally found the right set of instructions, it told me to click a button within the app to start the refund. But there is no button. 

Seller has so kindly, again, agreed to just refund me via venmo. 

This app has juuust enough functionality to facilitate a purchase. Nothing more. The support staff is either non-existent or severely over-worked, and the online explanations are unhelpful. I’d give it 0 stars if I could.",1
1210,"Worst customer service: My account has been locked for 3 months after someone a bought an item for canceled the sale. I’ve asked for help through Facebook, Twitter, and email. Today I finally received a message back that basically told me to go f myself and that after receiving 10+ 5 star reviews that I violated their guidelines and can go kick rocks. By far the WORST customer service I’ve ever dealt with. If you ever have a problem consider whatever you had lost gone. There is no office to call for help, there is no way to talk to an actual person unless it’s months later and after dozens of complaints, and when you do receive their responses they are useless. They will never help you with any problems. They will just ban your account and block all future accounts with your name attached as well. Truly despicable and outrageous.",1
1211,Great app terrible buyers: This app is great for posting items to sell it’s easy and for buying things off of its great but when it comes to selling the people are so cheap and want to pay less than penny’s it’s ridiculous I wanted to sell my baby clothes for twenty dollars and there was a lot of clothes most of them brand new and people were literally asking me if I would sell for ten dollars like if they can go to a regular store and buy a bunch of clothes for ten dollars it’s ridiculous and then they want you to drive 40 minutes away to meet them the people on this app are incredibly cheap you won’t get close to the price you want on items you’re selling,4
1212,"App is great! Support is the worst.: Use OfferUp all the time, especially the shipping feature which is extremely easy. They make buying and selling very simple and safe. Their customer support however is the worst I’ve ever encountered. They don’t take reports seriously because I see the same users posting scams daily. They also implement features that are not available for use, such as their partial refund option. Was told that the option is only their for testing purposes after agreeing to this with a seller. Their support team needs a lot of work and should have other options then just email based messaging especially when peoples money and bank information is used on their app.",3
1213,"Charged for an Item I Never Received: I tried the new “shipping” option but the seller never shipped the item. Maybe start with OfferUp never verified my address. But I gave the seller my address through the in-app messaging. Anyway, the seller became unresponsive and never shipped it. So I opened a support ticket after a week. I got told that I had to wait until five days after the transaction! That means the customer service rep didn’t even look at the transaction! Then I was told they would refund my charge. Now, a month and three trouble tickets later, they still haven’t refunded my account. So, I’m disputing the charge with my credit card company and I’ll be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. If you do use the app, don’t use the shipping feature. It’s very poorly implemented and the company doesn’t really offer buyer protection.",1
1214,"Useless: Posted a listing for a car for sale that I'm looking to sell quickly. Was told my listing will be archived and not shown to any Buyers until I finish verifying my account. Now that I've completed the verification process - including uploading my driver's license - my listing has totally disappeared. I can't even see it from my ""listings"" page at all. Then when I go to repost my listing, it's saying I've already used up my free cars and trucks post for the month and have to pay $8 to relist it. The support email only gives you computer-generated responses and will do everything in its power not to give you a live person and a live response. If I could give zero stars, I would. I will CONSIDER revising this review if this is resolved promptly, but as of right now I consider this app USELESS.",1
1215,"My items are not posting and on vehicles $: I was posting a truck i had for sale went through the process and at the end you have to make a 5.99 payment for the use after your free monthly posting, well i posted one everything went good but after an hour i had no views, i waited maybe it was my service, after 24 hours no views again ZERO views on my post, the deal was for someone to buy it the same day, maybe i had made a mistake of the post so i spent another 5.99 to make another post same thing one hr, then 24 hrs. went by nothing waited 1 week same zero views, contacted yall through email and never resolved my issue, used Crvig5li5t and sold the truck the same day!! OFFER UP what is going on with your app? Im sure others have had the same issue..",1
1216,"Horribly designed: If you search for some thing in the app you are constantly spammed with notifications of “similar“ items that come up in listings. You cannot stop it from making suggestions and notifying you of listings. Not if you wish to keep your notifications on that is. Then, in addition to having to pay a fee to list an item you have to suffer through some of the most poorly implemented and intrusive advertising at random times while you’re using the app. Talk about taking a cut from both ends! Furthermore there always seems to be an alert that you have one unread message. It seems like the app does this just to make you open the app to try to check your messages.",2
1217,"Could be much better: The search function is too broad and returns many items that don’t specifically match what you’re looking for.  Many posters show the item for $1 and the items actual cost can be a few hundred dollars to over $1000. I wasn’t expecting anything for $1 but there should be some integrity in the pricing. A “local” search to within 30 miles of my location has returned items from California and I’m on the east coast.  An item I have for sale doesn’t show up in any searches yet it shows a view count of over 30.  Many item listings are over a year old. I get it, it’s not ebay and it’s free, still it could be better.",3
1218,Full of scammers-BEWARE!!: This site is no better than Craigslist. Every single seller that you attempt to get in touch with either never gets back with you or once you buy the item ghost’s you and the apps “3 day shipping guarantee” that they have posted with every sale that states if the seller has not shipped your item within 3 days you will automatically get a refund is a lie as it’s actually 6 days and if you are waiting to receive an item and know it isn’t coming because the tracking number has never been activated 6 days can be a long time to wait to free up money that you need to then start the process over again (not on this app)!! It doesn’t seem as if much about this app is above board so just save yourself the time and stress and just stay away!!,1
1219,"5 year user, 200+ 5 star ratings, deactivated my account for no reason!!!: I have been a active user on offerup since 2018. Have sold and purchased many items and have only had good experiences, except when it came to getting help from them. I got deactivated suddenly and have tried to explained what occurred in detail with attachments in email, and they always just send an automated you’ve been deactivated and cannot use it anymore email message. It’s very frustrating that someone who uses it daily and has amazing feedback all 5 stars gets treated like this without any justification, I can’t even speak with someone. I wouldn’t give it 1 star if they were kind in responding to me and weren’t so cutthroat automated to people like me who have worked and made the app what it is today.",1
1220,Selling all the stuff that is weighing you down: Get it out there with Offer Up. Release all the stuff that has been your and your parents and your grandparents accumulated treasures for the last 80 years and put it in Offer Up! Lighten your burden. Maybe it’s a sentimental item. Take a picture and sell it. All of the items that’s you’ve been moving around with you for too many years can be sold on this Offer Up platform. It’s an amazing thing to actually get a small bit of cash for something that has really weighed you down for so many years! Sell it with Offer Up!,5
1221,"Annoyed: Don’t force people to update and have bugs on updates! For some reason now I don’t have access to peoples messages or can’t tell if it’s working because I haven’t updated the app and not seeing movement. I know people who updated the newest version and having a horrible time from the bugs and layout.

Update: had to write offerup and ask why I am not getting messages. They looked into it and magically I started getting messages from people. Assuming they deactivated something. Then I was hit with notifications for not following guidelines for posting wanted items to trade for my items then they deactivated my account. I had those there for over a year and no issue and now I cannot get on.

It’s unfortunate that Lego sold out since it was a much better app.",1
1222,"Utterly Disappointed - Don’t Waste Your Time: I haven’t used Offer Up frequently, but my limited experience is enough for me to know I will never use it again. In the process of a move out sale, I posted several items that needed to go. Not long after I posted the items, I learned that I had been “shadow banned.” I was never notified about being “shadow banned.” There was no explanation why I was “shadow banned.” I only received confirmation after a friend informed me that my posts, which took significant time to prepare, were no longer visible. I needed these items to be moved, and they will now go to waste because I wasn’t given a proper opportunity to sell the items. This practice is unprofessional, callous, and shady. What a disappointment. You’re better off on Craigslist or eBay.",1
1223,"App works great———DEVELOPER: Hold my beer: Offer up was just flawless, nothing to complain about it. Now, if I search for any item, let’s say a guitar, every time I open the app I will see a bunch of guitar sales either as an ad or as someone selling their guitars, even if I’m not interested in them anymore. It use to be only ads, now I’ll get old posts of guitars that I’m not interested in anymore. I need to search for another item in order to have a different feed but of course, I will get a bunch of sale posts of the last searched item every time I open the app. 
Opening the app and seeing the newest posts of things people were selling IMO was great, that’s why there’s a search bar, to see posts of stuff I’m trying to buy",2
1224,"Offup are not prepared for the technological change: This tool only works for owner sales, it does not work for car dealership. The administration of the advertisement is a disaster, they do not update the post in real time, they mark as sold cars that are still available and available those that are already sold. They do not have a customer service line or technical support (everything by e-mail), if you have an issue you have to call the salesperson who, 90% of the time, has a busy agenda. Clients cannot see new posts, as the algorithm is not programmed for this, therefore, of 150 cars published during three weeks , not a single sale is achieved. Cargurus is more updated and effective, wich not only generates traffic, they actually generates sales and you have all the leads right at dealercenter.",1
1225,"No accountability for bad business: It looks like there is a way to rate sellers but I don’t think you can unless you actually do business with them. I tried to buy an item for 2 weeks, got ghosted in the middle of arranging pick up the first time and then the seller apologized so we started making arrangements for pick up again and they sold the item to someone else. Then I tried to buy a similar item from someone else and they didn’t respond to my offer, but they definitely saw it. this app does not hold people accountable for poor business so you have no idea what you’re getting into when you’re dealing with someone. And since I keep getting screwed, I’m not really motivated to use this app anymore.",2
1226,"Unprofessional group running app: Used the app for a week, then got “shadow banned,” for not understanding the process. No email or message, just shadow banned. (I mentioned paying for an item through Venmo, which apparently is a no-no.) A professional company would warn me or notify me via email, but they just shut down the public side of my profile while from my side everything looks fine. It wasn’t until a friend said my profile was blank that I realized. Very passive aggressive of them, and not good for the community. 

As far as the app, it’s slow and cumbersome to use. You have to go through each page for an item just to change the price. Also annoying you can’t update the description via a computer, since typing on a keyboard is faster than a smartphone.",1
1227,"Scam: I sell on Poshmark and mercari and had heard a lot of people say they like OfferUp. So I got an account and started to try and sell. I live in the middle of nowhere so I only sell shipped items, maybe people who live on higher populated areas have better luck with this app where you can meet people instead. 
  As soon as I started listing I got scam messages like crazy person after person asking for my phone number or address.  I was so sick of scammers I was ready to quit when I made an actual sale.  Then after I make the sale the app tells me I can’t get my money unless I provide them with my full SSN. I’m sorry I don’t feel like that is necessary considering none of my other apps ask for that, also considering they didn’t specify that before I made the sale, AND I’ve had scammer after scammer contact me. Yeah I don’t trust this app",1
1228,"DON’T USE THE PROMOTE SERVICE: Love Offer Up and now that they have merged with Letgo they are only all about the $$$. I have used the promote service in the past and it was worth the extra money, now that same service has increased to $20 for one item to be promoted. With that you are able to review the additional views for your items. I have received 2 extra views according to the service and tried placing the promote on other items to see if that would make a difference. No change and their customer support was in willing to address. I will only be using the free option. I even have screen shots from day 1 to day 16 with only 2 extra views since I paid for the promote service. Saddened that this has now become a money hungry app that won’t take care of its customers.",2
1229,"Newest version is terrible !!!: I’ve been selling & buying on OfferUp for over a year. I just automatically received the newest version of the app. It is horrible.
I have 111 followers but you cannot see who they are or click on them. I am following 44 people but it does not even show who I follow . When I click on a seller to view their page/profile there is not even an option to follow them. I updated my phone , deleted the app , reinstalled the app, completely shut down my phone etc etc. It is very hard to navigate now. I feel like I’m in the dark.
Again , there is not even an option or tab to follow someone or a way to view my followers. I hope OfferUp puts out another update to fix the bugs. It’s hard to function with the app this way. Others I know have not received this newest version like me.",1
1230,"Don’t even waste your time: This app is honestly bs. I am able to post things but nobody can view them why ? Because I got to be a true you member right ? So when I become a true you member what’s the excuse this time ? Exactly what I mean, you let everyone else but a small percentage of us aren’t even able to go on for the same reason. Im not going to post things if nobody is able to see them that’s just flat out stupid. Thanks for wasting my time offer up and thanks for getting my social information and not even helping the problem. Not only that but I’ve made multiple accounts and still nothing. I’ve sold over 20 things on OfferUp, bought over 20 things on offer up and this is what happens to me. Fix your app soon because it will go down if not. Unblock me and let me post what I need to and buy what I want to !",1
1231,"Awful. Helped someone rob me: Wish I could give them 0 stars. So I sold some snow boots/bindings and had my shipping extended on the item, as I was having an issue finding a box big enough. Of course, I was in contact with the buyer through all of this. So I found a box, dropped the boots off at UPS and activated the shipping through the app. Right after confirming the shipping was completed through the app, it cancelled the sale on me. Now in speaking with (no number, no other contact at all except emails) someone from escalations they’re pretty much telling me , too bad, so sad, this is our policy. Why would you not cancel the sale BEFORE allowing me to confirm shipping so I knew NOT to drop the item off? Even after explaining all this, they didn’t care and I lost out on $100. There’s no seller protection with this company, AT ALL.  Please don’t get scammed too.",1
1232,"2 Thumbs down: I’ve submitted 7 request for response between questions and requests with 0 follow-up. The people I’ve requested from are mostly 5 stars so evidently the star ranking does NOT equal good to do business with. I have no way to impact anything- not to reach people or to grade for poor communication. ha! - IF I had positive feedback, which seems unattainable, I assume there is a streamlined way to provide. This may sound like a I am making a community complaint (lack of communication) but all of this should be managed by the app. And, if my frustration seems extreme it is because it seems like the purpose of this is commerce and trade within communities and in my experience there isn’t anything to support those base objectives.  
And interestingly I’m unable to submit this without giving at least 1 Star. I guess the star is for what I hoped it would be.",1
1233,"Offer up will be deleted: I have perfect feedback over 56 transactions....not counting the transactions people did not leave feedback on. I would consider myself an honest and prevailing user of OfferUp. That being said, the new no cash system is absolutely absurd, useless, and will cost this app dearly. Facebook marketplace, let go, and even Ebay will see massive increases due to this ridiculous update and policy. If you have not recently updated your offerup app, I strongly suggest you do not do so. And if you are considering selling an item, I would suggest using any other means, as this update with cost offerup millions of users.",5
1234,"Lots of “posers” on this app: I’ve listed close to 20 items and have successfully sold 2!  My other items have had many views and just as many requests to purchase but when I respond, I never hear back.  In fact, every item I’ve listed I’ve had someone contact me “wanting to buy” but when I answer them I never get another response.  I feel it’s just people just trying to waste your time...Even when I’ve agreed to their offered price.

There’s also no way to review someone if they haven’t bought your item.  I’ve only been asked to review from the 2 people I’ve sold to.  Ready to just list everything back on Craigslist....I’ve found more success with that.

The aspect I do like is you can see information on who you are buying and selling to.",2
1235,"Was good...too many scammers now.: This app used to be fantastic for selling, but it has been overrun by scammers. It’s the same scam over and over again. They want to buy “out of state”, or some other excuse as to why they can’t meet you, they only want to pay with PayPal. I report every last one of them but they are endless. For every one legit offer on my items I get dozens of scam offers. 

Using the word PayPal in chat should be an auto-ban and a warning to sellers that don’t know any better, at the bare minimum. If you get offers like this DO NOT SELL TO THEM, this is an old scam. They will pay with a stolen or fraudulent card or claim non receipt of item. PayPal will take the money out of your account long after you send the item to them and you’ll be left with no money and no item.",2
1236,"Needs more oversight: Nice app but seems too many people get away with wasting people’s time giving useless unrealistic offers and no shows with no response and report features that probably don’t change much due to broken algorithms.

Add report features for people like this so when they get 3 reports or something it emails and warns them.

Best example is people who say they want to buy it for X but never say anything again and their profile says they were active recently. This should be a “stops messaging” report but so many people do it  that it seems OfferUp doesn’t care.",5
1237,"Horrible customer service.: I sold something on this app. Sent it straight away to the buyer with the label they made me. The buyer messaged me saying nothing was in the box when it arrived. ( why would I ship an empty box) anyways I thought maybe it was stolen in route. So the seller filed a claim they got their money back and I get nothing ??? They automatically take the word of the seller. Ok whatever. That makes no sense to me. I try to file a claim with the tracking number at USPS that I was given from the label offer up had created for me and it doesn’t exists in USPS system. I reach out to offer up and it takes over a month to get an answer, so I have to send another message..... just for them to tell me that there’s nothing they can do. Won’t be working with this app again. I will stick with let
Go that I have never had an issue with.",1
1238,"Terrible site: The app is just ok, but the OfferUp service is horrific. I’m convinced that most of the listings are fake. Nobody ever responds, and they hardly ever mark items as sold. 

The little check mark indicating a message was read is a great idea, but there are no consequences for a seller refusing to check their messages or respond. If somebody lists an item but doesn’t respond to messages for more than a week, the listing should be pulled. There should also be better monitoring of “active” listings where the item is clearly no longer available. Even Craigslist, which has little to no oversight, will deactivate a listing after a certain period of time unless the seller extends it. 

Without the slightest oversight by the administrators, the site just becomes a jumbled mess of listings, most of which are dormant or fake. Complete garbage. Don’t waste your time.",1
1239,"Notifications Are Broken: The app still fails to properly separate the notifications that you want on or off. While the app does have the option to turn off “Highlights and Deals” and Item Recommendations,” turning these off actually disables message notifications and leaves all other notifications on. 

I discussed the issue in length with customer support and the final response I received was that “I have verified your account and there is not actually anything wrong with it... if you turn off notifications then all messages will be restricted. We currently cannot provide you with an option to separate the type of notifications you would like to stop or keep on receiving.”

This seems like a pretty simple feature to fix but without it working the app is more annoying than useful.",1
1240,"Better depending on State: I believe that items are more readily available and in better condition, regarding furniture and household items, depending on what state you live in. 

I have also noticed that there can be a huge shortage of other items including, children and toddler toys, collectibles, moving boxes, and the free items are in excellent condition depending. 

For example, I lived in one state where there were so many beautiful free items that I could have opened a store selling household furniture, and antique type furniture, with the amount of free furniture that was available on OfferUp.",5
1241,"TOTALLY DIG: If it was based on merit alone, ease-of-use, and user friendliness, offer up would be the singular selling app around. Unfortunately they don’t have as many listings as their less efficient and more confusing competition. But, if you don’t need 1000 listings for X product then you’re fine. Offer up is definitely the most complete and easy app to use and understand. My only suggestion to the developers Is for the consumer to be able to see the asking price as soon as we view the ad, not have to be in it. Thank you, Offer Up! I’ve made and saved lots of money thanks to you☺️👍. Keep up the good work n let’s keep eliminating the competition. 👏👏",4
1242,"Banned without an opportunity to explain: I recently had an unfortunate experience with OfferUp where I was banned from the platform without the opportunity to explain my situation. While I understand the need to maintain a safe and respectful community, it’s disheartening to be banned without any clarification or chance to address the issue. I believe in transparency and open communication, and it would have been greatly appreciated if I had received a warning or the opportunity to provide my side of the story before being banned. This experience left me feeling frustrated and confused. I hope OfferUp can consider improving their ban process to ensure users are treated fairly and given a chance to explain any misunderstandings. Open dialogue can lead to a more positive user experience for everyone.",1
1243,"Offer Up ignores fraudulent listings: I just deleted my Offer Up account after having been on the app for 5 years.  I used the app successfully to buy musical gear…   vintage keyboards, drum machines, etc.  I have come across a handful of fraudulent listings but one  was so disgustingly egregious that I reported this listing. The scammer had copied and pasted someone else’s listing and was selling the identical item for an unrealistically cheap price. I reported the listing to offer up and even alerted the original seller too,  who was horrified.  My report fell on deaf ears.  Offer Up never replied and they never took the listing down.  It’s been up several months.  It’s still up TODAY!  That’s why I’ve decided to leave. I will stick to buying music gear on Reverb because Offer Up does not take action against fraudulent listings.",1
1244,"Why are the sellers, buyers, and randos so awful: Edit: My time may be done with this app. I sent a message to a seller I had to sit through a 2 min ad. You get money from the sells, why do you need ads?!? 

While this isn’t entirely the apps fault everyone on here just wants to waste your time. No one shows up, sellers included. People will ask non stop questions that could be answered by Google or reading the listing only to not buy, people want to low ball or ask you to bring it to them. Sellers will not commit to meet times or have tons of people come at the same time and now you just wasted gas and time. There has to be a way to remedy this. I have become so bitter, people can’t be this dumb and selfish. I’m trying to sell two more things and then I never want to see this app again.",1
1245,"Ok but don’t ship: This app had always been amazing and easy to use with reliable buyers. I shipped a few times - under 5 and Mercari did not pay me. They claimed they did a direct deposit for two different sales and they deposited it into a closed account. I disputed it for almost 6 months and even showed them my account was closed, and that deposit was never made and yet they still never paid me. So for that reason I do not trust them. It was not for very much money but 40 bucks is 40 bucks and I’m sure I’m not the only one that has experience this. For this reason, I only sell local on here. There are two other apps I used over this one that are much better. Unfortunately, this app is a 3rd back up.",2
1246,"They offer up doesn’t work and the administrator doesn’t want to help me: I love the offer up used to use it all the time it help me sell some of the things around my house I really didn’t need anymore but one day off or up stopped working I was not able to communicate with people I was trying to sell things with deleted the app we tried to download it and nothing when it linked to let go it made my Lego account not work anymore as well I don’t think the administrator likes me hopefully this doesn’t happen to anybody else
!!!!",5
1247,"Not so great: The app is pretty ok BUT they have a nasty habit of banning accounts and phones from using their app without warning. I emailed the support email about how I don’t know why I got banned and if they could let me know what I did to violate the rules and they blatantly told me that they why do not need to tell their users nor warn them of any violations before banning account and that they will not unban it. I was really ruffled since this has happened before on a wording technicality and I got my account back but the emailer just sounded annoyed I even bothered this time. It’s not like Mercari where they warn you of a posting or email you, they just simply ban your account and won’t elaborate on how you could get it back. Be careful when using it because the support team aren’t welcoming or really helpful.",1
1248,"Great but frustrating: This App is one of my favorite apps to use. I recently ran into a shipping issue and there is NO human contact for support. It has the option for buyers and sellers to ship etc but the app doesn’t allow you to check the status of your payment and when you ask for support or help, it says server busy. When it comes to money, this is not okay and it’s quite frustrating when you ship something for a good amount of money and it was scanned and delivered and buyer confirmed but your account is just stuck and you can’t get any help. That’s not right and I will not be shipping again through this app for lack of security and comfort. Other than that, it’s nice for local meet ups",3
1249,"Lost all data and listings with no warning: Locked out of my account though I paid for a month of service. When I attempted to contact for resolution, (either a refund or access to my account) I received another server error. Most of my items listed on Offer up were sold using CL for free. Waste of money and time. Hope to get resolution here, but doubtful seeing this exact error is an ongoing problem with this site. Update: per customer service “my account was accidentally flagged” so I was locked out and lost two significant days (Moving in March) communicating with buyers which is very disappointing. Still skeptical of this ap but will try till my month subscription expires. Having more success on CL.",3
1250,"Intrusive and Invasive: The functionality of this app it great but its abuse of your privacy is horrendous. This is the epitome of what’s wrong with the internet today. It tracks accross sites and by accepting its terms you are giving your search history not just to offer up but the platforms it runs on. 

They are making you agree to give up all rights to Privacy. A company that doesn’t  take precautions to protect you but rather monitors and records everything you do and then passes your data to anyone it chooses is not worth doing business with.

Using this app is a danger to you and free people everywhere. Also the rating posted of 4.8 is a lie. False advertising .Also notice the canned responses to complaints. The people who own this are absentee owner who care more about tracking you and selling your info than being an e-commerce site",1
1251,"Amazing App, but I have a suggestion: So I have been using OfferUp for more than a year and it has been amazing. I have gotten a lots of things here and I save a lot things on my boards to see if I can get it later on if it’s still available. But my problem with those saved items is that they stay there if they’re sold. As a suggestion, if the item or items has been sold in your boards it’ll automatically remove from the boards so it could save space for more saved items instead of piling up and manually removing it yourself for each and every item.",5
1252,"No trust: I downloaded this app to expand my online business. I had only been selling on Poshmark previously and wanted to open up to other platforms. But when I started posting, inquiries would come flooding in of people asking to verify my phone number and only text/call instead of using the app’s messaging feature(even though I told them I was shipping all items so we don’t even have to meet up). As soon as I told anyone I wasn’t comfortable with doing that, they stopped messaging. A day after posting an item, no more inquiries came. I’m not sure what the lack of trust could be caused by other than a bad buyer/seller guarantee, but that experience made me distrust this app as well as stop listing items to sell because no one is interested in just using the app to communicate or getting items shipped to them",1
1253,"Been using for years: The first issue is all of the random notifications “want to make extra money?” And whatnot getting you excited for a response message only to have offerup hoping to get your attention in case you forgot about it. Additionally the community on it has just gotten absurd, countless times of people offering 10% of the price, harassing you to accept their lowball prices, and when you don’t select “shipping available” you still get messages over and over of “will you ship”. I’ve specifically come to this app so that I don’t have to go through the shipping on eBay. I know that it’s an issue with the user base, but they don’t seem to take a proactive effort to keep these people the minority, instead they make up the bulk of people on the app.",2
1254,Be aware of Sexual Predators: Although this is generally a good platform to sell. Women need to be VERY careful. There are a lot of men reaching out to yoga pants I sell.. and some other stuff. Often they hide their identity pretending to be a female or it is men that ask you to “deliver”. Obviously you should only meet In a public space. One man claimed to be a woman and said since it was clothing “she” needed to try it on first. Since I lived within close proximity I said I wouldn’t mind dropping it off. But the more I got to talk to this person it was clear something was off. The person turned out to be a guy who wanted to me to come into his home and “model” my clothes for him. Women pleaseee please be sooo careful. Send your husband if you’re selling something like yoga pants.,3
1255,They banned me for no reason. NO ONE CAN SEE AND REPLY MY MESSAGE . NO ONE CAN SEE MY POST. Too sad!: Hello my account recently stopped working and I would sell a lot of stuff on offer up. I have waited about 3 days and it still won’t let me post send messages or nothing. I was suppose to meet with a couple of people but have no way of contacting them now. It was easier to use!!! I had 100% feedback and one day it just stopped working. I contacted them right away . that was over 2 weeks ago. I’m truly heartbroken!!!!! Can anyone help me??? Can you guys please help me fix this issue.,5
1256,"Horrible support: App is good if you don’t have to deal with their support. Unfortunately, I had to deal with them for a posting I had on this app. First of all, their technology can not tell them if the posting is via their app or web. And when I am trying to explain them the real issues in detail, all they are doing is copying pasting the same canned response without even reading my email or comprehending what the actual issue is. When I got frustrated and told them don’t bother to respond if you can’t read and they followed my advise immediately. Lol. They STOPPED responding. Haha. Unbelievable. 

 I am surprised this company is still in existence in the world where customer experience and satisfaction is the new marketing. But I guess, free postings are something that will keep them afloat.",1
1257,"My new best companion: Offer up I’m so glad u came along.i love shopping from bed and I love that u show 3 rows of products at the same time . Offer up is my new slot machine cause I’m gonna win no matter  item I choose because of the great deals they post. But the fun part is when I purchase a item and I’m waiting for a response from a buyer  and I put my phone down or I walk away, I love when offered up send me a text with the cashier drawer sound  with the bells chiming... I get excited and say yay I got something and get excited to see what it says .. so thank u offer up for my enjoyment..  luv shopping with u guys 😀😀",5
1258,I love this app more business here than anywhere else: When it comes the apps of selling stuff offer up has way more people on it then any other app including Facebook marketplace offer it makes let go and look like a joke since I downloaded this app I haven’t even thought about craigslist if you have a Lotta stuff you want to get rid of and sell fast this is the app for you Always pricing is higher than you expect to get if you want 60 bucks post it for 100 you want to hundred dollars postage for 150 you want $20 post it for 40 you will never get your asking price,5
1259,"Terrible customer service: I had over 100 transactions and 54 five-star ratings when a buyer bought an item from me and didn’t know how to use it. She thought I sold her a broken item and reported it as fraud. I sent her two messages to try and alleviate the situation. She never responded. When I realized that my account and all listings had been frozen, I reached out to customer service. I reached out at least three times through the app and direct through email and never got a response. Now I have a useless account. Back to Craigslist.

UPDATE: MONTHS after the experience above, I get a response to my review saying, “Send is a DM so we can investigate.” OfferUp people, as I mentioned, I did this at least three times MONTHS ago. Are you just responding now to make it look like you care about CS without having to actually do anything?",1
1260,Doesn’t work anymore “Network Error”: So this use to be one of my favorite apps that I used to sell my unused items as well as my own person products. My wife and I have essentially made a living using this app and some others which I will not mention. Don’t know what happened but it keeps saying I have notifications and I open the app and it says network error every time. So I figured I would uninstall it and then reinstall it. Still no success with the app. It’s a real bummer because this app really connected us with the community and I feel a little lost with out it. PLEASE HELP FIX,5
1261,"Not a good app: I was a long time user - over 3 years. Only positive feedback , more than 30 reviews on my profile. I was both a buyer and seller. Woke up one day and my account was completely removed. No email explanation or any sort of communication. My account was verified and they have all my personal information. Bro my knowledge I didn’t break any rules. I only sell items from my house that I do not use anymore. My full time job is as a RN so this is just an app I use to clean stuff out every once and a while. 
I would have expected better customer service or at the very least , since they have so much of my contact information- they could have notified me. As far as getting in touch with customer service , it’s basically non existent. I will stick to better apps like letgo , eBay, Mercari and posh. No need do this hassle.",1
1262,"Nonstop notifications & a lot of flakes: For a selling app, it lets you list items, search for items, message buyers/sellers, and all the other basic stuff perfectly fine but, overall, it is a frustrating experience using OfferUp mainly due to other concerns. I leave notifications for the app on in case someone messages me but even when I turn off notifications within the app for promotions, search alerts and deals it continues to shove notifications in my face. On top of all that, I’ve only ever actually made 2 successful exchanges through the app because the vast majority of people end up flaking. They let you report no-shows but as far as I can tell, the reports don’t do anything to prevent or mitigate the issue because flakes continue to give me headaches.",2
1263,"Don’t like the new updates: I never really had a problem with offerup I like the layout and categories and easy to add a product. I don’t like the new updates though. In the beginning they added the shipment possibility which was okay. But now they added online payments and ability to hold items until they pick it up. I couldn’t even offer a price on a product because it wouldn’t let me click anything other than “hold for pickup”. I don’t like all that. Also, I wish they have what letgo has where your posts expire but you can repost them by one click of a button. It helps filter out those inactive people! (A lot!)",4
1264,"Garbage: The app is terrible. I used it for about half a week and it stopped working. I posted an item up for sale and was getting offers but I couldn’t get back to a potential customer because the app suddenly decided I needed to sign up for TruYou. I couldn’t offer, ask, or reply to people without having to apply for TruYou - which is a total violation of privacy (requires government ID to apply). I don’t know if I was banned, and if I was, it would at least have been nice to know the reason. Also, trying to find who to contact is another problem. There’s no email or page to contact administrators to report issues. 
All in all, when it was working, it was a cool app, but since it doesn’t, and support doesn’t seem to care enough to even address their app users, it comes up as a frustrating experience.",1
1265,"Empty Apologies In Reviews Aren’t Enough: ***AVOID THIS APP AND THIS COMPANY**

This will be my second time writing this review because apparently, OfferUp had my other one taken down.  

Let’s get a few things straight — this app is very similar to something like Craigslist.   Anyone can post anything for any price.  Fair enough.  But you come across A LOT of scammers/fake posts/people trying to rip you off.  

When you let OfferUp know about these things (which you should)  — they simply brush you off.  It is VERY CLEAR that CUSTOMER SERVICE and INTEGRITY mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to this terrible company.  

I have been ripped off in this app, reported it, and not received even A SIMPLE FOLLOW UP EMAIL.  I’ve also shared my experiences with multiple others who’ve had THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO THEM.  

I also tried to help by reporting posts I knew were scams but again, OfferUp did nothing.  The fraud accounts that ripped me off are still ripping others off.  

OFFERUP — If you can’t keep up with moderation of your own site, you need to either shut down, or hire more people.  

Your customer service is egregiously non-existent and no amount of cut and paste, fake apologies to bad reviews in the AppStore will change that.  

****AVOID THIS APP AND THIS COMPANY!***",1
1266,"‘Something Went Wrong’: Hey guys,I love this app to start off. I use it regularly and it’s helped a ton. But recently it’s been a problem to send messages as well as offers to people. Once I click to send an offer or message it’s gives me message saying ‘something went wrong ‘ ‘Trouble connecting to server’ this has been going on for about a week now, and is honestly getting quite frustrating when I want to purchase something and can’t even contact the seller. Hope you can fix this soon,I’ve deleted and re downloaded the app and this is still going on. Thank you",5
1267,"Great virtual market.: I really like OfferUp to search for second hand products around me or the distance I choose to shop.  I can get the products right alway without the hassle of shipping. Also, it is great to sale items, since it’s fast and easy to list over the smart phone. OfferUp gives a better search engine, very simple user friendly, and the people are more reliable than other local sites I’ve used in the past. A great feature that other sites don’t have, is you can go to the seller page and look all other items they have for sale. And it is FREE!!! thanks OfferUp",5
1268,"Technical glitch??? Messages and offers not going through: Tried several times to message sellers about their items and bid/place offers and they are not going through. Contacted offer up on several occasions in this matter and they either don’t respond or send an email to restart, delete and reload the app again, in which I have already done ,again on several occasions and it is still not going through. Not sure what is wrong but I am not the only offerup user it’s happening to. Ended up deleting app and just not using offer up any longer.",5
1269,"it’s ok,,,: Good communication, however, if your meeting place is your address, it stays there. I recommend to meet in a local place rather than at your house. Why can’t you delete messages? It should automatically delete after a 2 weeks-a month, I do not want my address just out there forever, it was suppose to be a one time thing. ALSO, if you send your address and they just so happen to not message you back, you just gave out your address!! Have an option to delete your address before selling the item and after. So stupid, have the ability to 
1. Delete messages (perhaps only address as some messages may be important)
2. Delete posts (as you can only archive it???)",3
1270,Goodbye Craigslist: I have been on OfferUp since it was first available to download and I have sold every item I have ever posted. The fact is that other sites take too much time to post and make you upload pics and verify emails and more and OfferUp does it all for you. With a brief description on one of my adds I can make a post in literally less than a minute and that includes taking the photos in the post. Amazingly easy and not as many flakes thus far as CL and other sites and you can instantly communicate with buyers on your phone without them ever having your number!,5
1271,"Solid app populated by not so solid people.: I enjoy every aspect of this app, but the amount of people who haven’t sent an item out that we agreed to be shipped out is ridiculous. I’ve purchased about 7 items so far and haven’t received a single one. I have gotten 2 pick up orders completed but not everyone is local, so the amount of reliable posts is slim. Also, I believe they should have a timer on posts. If someone hasn’t updated a post or used the app in over a year, I don’t believe we should see their post yet there are thousands of posts like that. This app has great potential and it’s very easy to work with but the people are the problem.",3
1272,"Worst customer service imaginable: Worst customer service imaginable. The level of incompetence from OfferUp's customer service is so bad it has to be a goal for them. I signed up several times over the years and my iPhone defaulted to the hide my email feature which led to my phone number being associated with several accounts. Since, I no longer have the randomly generated emails that were created with my iPhone the app wont allow me to verify my number so that I can list items. I have literally told this to customer service, in an exchange spanning 10 emails, several times only to be told over and over again to just go ahead and verify my number because it's just a standard security protocol. A bunch of !di0t$. AVOID OfferUp app or use it at your own peril.",1
1273,"Not like it used to be: I used to immediately get views and messages and offers and got moved my things quickly on anything I had for sale
now, all of a sudden you got all these other new vendors and advertisement and now you have to pay just for people to see your stuff above other peoples. Just like google you can’t compete with corporations or companies.  This used to be for used items >..Getting rid of things instead of  the traditional yard sale. Not to mention this temu website popped up and majority of the posts and from what I understand they are multiple lashes, personal information breach so why would anyone let them advertise? I guess It’s all about the money these days!",2
1274,"Poor optimization and data consumption: This app has gotten worse over the past year, it's become so slow that searching anything almost crashes my phone, the app consumes comical amounts of processing power, the amount of data, and battery being used by the app doesn't make any sense. 5 minutes browsing uses 15% battery. There's so many ads on here I can't even scroll for five minutes before the app freezes, having to wait for whatever ad to finish loading before I can continue. This is a great app for used goods in the community but the ads make it frustrating and causes actual wear and tear on my hardware. Please fix the app. I will not be forced to buy premium just to use the app.",2
1275,"Unusable with ads now: I’ve used offerup for quite a while and have sold many items on it. Prior to this latest update, I would rate it 5 stars. However, the developers have dramatically increased the aggressiveness of advertising on the latest update to the point of the app being almost unusable. I get pop up ads every few seconds of browsing that I can’t clear. There’s no close button on the ad, and there never used to be pop up ads. When scrolling through items, there are so many ads I can barely find what I’m looking for without accidentally triggering some stupid window that wants me to download some app. Do not update if you don’t have the current version.",2
1276,"Used to be decent: This app used to be actually good. Today, they are more interested in gathering all information about its users and sell it to advertisers. You can no longer use a VPN for privacy, they are forcing ads down your throat and won’t allow you to switch screen before the ad is over. Furthermore, they are tricking Apple system by keeping the message notifications always on even if you read a message so it makes you think that you always have a message. So misleading and would hope Apple would put them back into their place. As to users privacy, they seems to be on part with apps such as Facebook and the like which is not saying much. I truly hope someone’s comes along, create competition and take them to the cleaner.",1
1277,"Too Many Businesses Allowed to Post Hundreds of Ads: I have stopped using OfferUp as it’s just turned into a platform for BUSINESSES to spam and post literally HUNDREDS of ads every day! It wasn’t like this before. No longer can private sellers buy from other private sellers or post their ads and be seen because businesses post hundreds of their listings every day and yours can’t be seen nor can you see other private sellers listings. I have reached out to OfferUp and nothing is ever done about it. I have reported these listings and they are never take down. These businesses have accounts under several different names, it’s ridiculous! OfferUp doesn’t seem to care! Other platforms are much better about monitoring this!",2
1278,"Discriminatory: I am writing to inform you that I am going to file a claim against OfferUp due to their discriminatory actions towards me. Despite having used the service in accordance with their policies, my account has been closed for no reason. As a valued customer, I find it unacceptable that my account would be closed without warning, and any explanation given as to why. I can only conclude that this action was taken due to discriminatory practices on OfferUp's part. I would like to request that you take immediate action to investigate this matter and prevent any future abuses of your policies. I have been a loyal customer of OfferUp for quite some time and I am deeply disappointed by this situation. If no action is taken to remedy my account closure, I am prepared to take further legal action to protect my rights as a consumer.",1
1279,"Terrible app with daily bugs: Im in seattle, wa. The developers are 15 minutes away from the city i live, and the amount of bugs and deleted posts and lack of information have made this the worst sales app yet. I would rather go back to craigslist but nobody is on there. Facebook marketplace is much better, even tho that platform has its own issues. I email offerup and ask why my posts are being deleted and the developers or whoever responded told me to redownload the app and restart my phone. Are we in 1998? Restart my phone to fix a software bug in an application? Basically the community is there but the developers are way behind and its not looking good for the future of the app. I have 95 five star reviews and im ready to give up and delete the app. It's basically useless",1
1280,Cannot get into my Offer Up at all: This is not really a review but a cry for help!  I can’t even get into the support page!  I’m still getting notifications of things I’m searching for but then the app won’t let me in to read about them.  There is a little bandaged up bear on my screen that says oops!  That something is wrong in your system but it’s being worked on.  Well this has been going on for a month at least and it won’t even let me in to ask for help.  I can’t remove app so I can get app again to start over.  HELP!,5
1281,"Desperately Needs to Change the Algorithm: at first crack this may seem like a decent app, but once you search for something, that’s all you are going to see in your feed the rest of your time on this app is that item - OR - until you search for something else then it will be a mix of just those two items in your feed.
it doesn’t matter if you come back a week later it will still primarily show you just those items. if you searched for headphones one day and a ps4 an hour later, bet every dollar you have that you will see every headphone and ps4 item available in the entire app every time you scroll through your feed for the next month or so.
SO frustrating.
the worst part is there is no “clear search history” or “clear the apps cookies” setting in preferences. 
you can never go back to just looking at hundreds of random items for sale. this is why i rarely ever use this app anymore. 
it came up pretty quick and seems to have faded away just as quickly and here is a big reason why.
…stick to marketplace for local buying and selling.",2
1282,"The worst app to sale online or out of state: Please read this before you sell anything through this app. First of all when you sell out of state with this app, your customer will have to 2 days to revew the item that you’re selling so you can get paid. Basically the customer is enjoying whatever he bought from you while you are waiting to get paid. Once the custome revews the item you are going to have the option of “cash out” I’ve bee wating for a whole week and im still waiting for my money cause it says deposit pending. You have to literally wait for weeks or a month in some cases to get paid. So please dont use this app if you dont want to lose money and time. Because my customer is enjoying his item while im still waiting to get paid.☹️",1
1283,Fix this app: I prefer the LetGo days when you can filter the newest items posted in order of most recently posted. Offerup just shows me the same crap everyday and you can only set the distance. Then you get to see stuff you have been seeing for the past week. I’d rather be able to see what new items are posted daily in real time and have the ability to set that in a filter. Instead Offerup insists on cramming items down your face you may have looked at once and you can’t see new items daily. Add this filter to the default searching because as of now you only get more filter options if you limit yourself to a specific category. I want to see all new items posted no matter what the category is. I’d rather use Craigslist than this app.,1
1284,"Great community: I like the ease of this app.  the part I struggle with is the shipping part.  I don’t like shipping and choose to sell locally because when I ship, it doesn’t seem to register with Offer Up and then they send me disturbing messages saying the sale is cancelled and more…even if I have shipped it out.  Then they list the item again and that’s another set of things to manage unnecessarily…if they asked if I shipped, it would be less abrasive than sending me a message saying the sale was cancelled to both the seller and the buyer…seems unreasonable to make two people go through that unnecessarily.",4
1285,"Listings should have renewal/expiration date: There should be an upgrade to the listings, because too many of them are months or years old and the seller doesn’t respond. I would have bought a bunch of different things on OfferUp if the seller was still engaged, and still find Craigslist as a far more reliable source for buying and selling items. CL postings have a 2 week expiration date, for example. It seems like the vast majority of listings on OfferUp are “dead in the water,” or ads. Although I live in a metro area, I find it difficult to actually buy anything because people post things and forget about it forever, but the post just stays there forever taking up space and wasting my time.",2
1286,"Very bad customer service: I order Place an order for Apple Watch 4 and I paid the requested amount. The seller didn’t ship the item and each time I contact him to ask him why he did not ship the watch he come up with an excuse so he said that he did not receive the shipping label I contacted the customer support more then 4 times and no body answers me at all , I don’t even think anybody read my messages. Be so careful before you add you payment method and pay through their service , a lot of scam and fake account in this application. 
I wish there is  no star to rate this bad service.",5
1287,"Decent place to sell your stuff but BE CAREFUL.: My issue is that I can’t change my review of someone that screwed me over, now they have a great rating based on my first impression when actually I got played big time. 

I bought a car, they said didn’t have any issues. Next day check engine light pops on and I talk to them and they admit they they tried to fix all the issues and turned the check engine light off. I could have been more careful, but thats the risk you take when buying a vehicle on here. So please be ware, and don’t add that review until your sure about your seller, because You can’t change it or worn people after words.

I don’t recommmend buying a vehicle via offer up, the people are shady.",2
1288,"BEWARE Bots are everywhere: After posting a bed for sale I was immediately bombarded with DM’s from 4 bots saying they are interested in my item and to send them my phone number or email address so we could “talk further”. DO NOT send any personal information as this is a lie! These messages are from fake accounts run by bots that want nothing more than your information so they can solicit you with junk mail or phishing attacks.

Only trust people with previous listings/reviews Facebook accounts, and verified IDs as none of the bots that have bees harassing me have this info for their accounts.

Until the devs can protect people from these bot attacks. I suggest not using this app as most if not all the DMs you will receive will be fake. Use Facebook to sell your stuff for now as I have had no problems with bots on their platform.",1
1289,"The problem is...: The real problem with offerup is that very few sellers respond to messages lately.  I have a hunch that it’s probably resulting from the fact that this app sends me useless notifications on a daily basis “recommending stuff for me”, which I cannot disable by itself.  I’d imagine many others like me have had to simply disable notifications from the app altogether, meaning we don’t get notified when we are messaged or when we receive replies.  Get rid of the useless spam notifications (or at least the option to disable them) and there isn’t much else to critique about the app.  I’d like to see more policing of duplicate posts that spam the search results, but what can ya do 🤷🏼‍♂️.  A sales app is no good if 9/10 sellers don’t respond to messages.",2
1290,"New Update is terrible!!!: I normally use this app pretty extensively on a daily basis, the new update is a massive step backwards.
The photographs for most everything especially automobiles are completely screwed up. The new map to locate feature doesn’t work at all. I can’t tap on a map and see where the seller is at all. This was a pretty simple but effective app now it seems completely screwed up. The company would be best to simply scrap 90% of this new update and go back to the way it was. There are also way too many ads all the side that I can’t get rid of. And far too many fake ads that are completely ridiculous. Approximately 25% of all the automobile ads are fake.   Today I gave it a two star, one week ago I would’ve given it a four-star",2
1291,"Worst app ever: Don’t even think about downloading this app. The app is full of scammers. You’ll see all these good offers and when you try to connect with the sellers. They give their personal number and try to use third party apps to transfer money saying it’s for shipping. They don’t even own the products. A lot of listings have exactly the same images with different accounts.
The developers don’t even do anything about it. Honestly don’t waste your time. If you are planning to sell, go to goodwill for donation. Don’t waste time I’m getting something from it using this app. I tried to sell my sofa. I instantly got a message, it was so stupid. They asked for my number and sent one time password on my phone for some voice number scam. I don’t know what these people are up to. But stay away from them and stay safe",1
1292,"Overall, meh 🤷‍♂️: Because there is no way to secure the buy/sell, and no penalty for bad actions of others such as not showing up, changing price, selling to someone else after they agreed to sell to you, etc. this app leaves you open to get screwed. There are also no posted prices until you click on specific items and no picture size guide so the user interface is messy and disorganized. People will sell items out from under you after you’ve already settled on price and leave home to go pick it up all the time. I live in California (problem #1) and people have very little integrity when accepting your offer or providing the correct items. It’s a high risk way to buy.",3
1293,There Is A Lot To Like: I like offer up because of the many items offered. Unfortunately some people who post do not provide adequate information and a poor picture or no picture. I’m starting to post myself and will make sure these typical faults are not duplicated. I am always looking at cars and there are two specific problems that annoy me. One problem are the car scams which provide 1 picture and are significantly under priced. The car price is too good to be true. The contact person is never the owner. The second issue is the same car is pictured multiple times. Overall I like Offer Up with the caveat: buyer beware.,4
1294,"DONT DOWNLOAD: Absolute SCAM. They have “monitors” that will kick you off for making a purchase but mind you there are HUNDREDS of fake accounts and scams that go on throughout their app. 
The “monitor” activity except when it comes to those accounts. People are encouraged to do cash only (even when they say you should go through the app for “safety”?) so if something happens they are not responsible nor liable. The customer service is a JOKE. They send you to one person after another until you’re just fed up and wish you never brought up anything just to tell you days later that “they looked into it” and there’s nothing they can do and REMOVE YOU FROM THE APP. 
Meanwhile, these scam artists stay posing multiple adds of their same original posts and even getting PROMOTED! How do you not look into or moderate an ADD?

Just keep this in mind.",1
1295,"Sellers Beware; Low-Baller Paradise: If you have anything of value don't sell it here if you want to sell it for what it's worth. I've used OfferUp for the past six months to ""give it a shot"" and I've been scammed multiple times. To make matters worse, half the people who message you want you to ship items across the country when you specifically list items as ""No Shipping"". The worst past however is that it seems every pawn shop in the country is using OfferUp to try to buy things dirt cheap (which makes sense because they are getting out out of business by apps). I haven't been able to list anything worth $250+ without 7-8 people messaging me, ""100?"", or, ""120"". Just don't expect to sell anything for it's actually value (it happens once in a blue moon but it's rare), and definitely don't expect to avoid low-ballers.",1
1296,"Messaging doesn’t work neither does offer option: Edit: I was told below to contact customer support at the given email, I did and got no response. Instead I received a survey asking about my experience with customer support?! No one EVER contacted me and no one EVER fixed the issue. 
Original: I once LOVED this app. Then suddenly I noticed I wasn’t get responses to messages I sent out regarding items. At first I thought I was being ignored but realized my messaging wasn’t working at all, my offers weren’t being sent either. I hard restarted my phone, deleted the app and reinstalled and even created a new account no such success. I have NEVER sold anything on offerup. And the few things I purchased were done in cash with no issues. There is no reason there should be a ban on my account. Now the app serves no purpose and I hate it.",1
1297,Needs a Delete For Messages: You would get 5 stars if I was able to delete messages I don't want to save also 3 am to tell me something sold. If I cared I would have purchased it. Also once it sells take it off don't just put a sold banner gets confusing if I'm on the phone app. Also why are people selling firearms if they use a cute name after it's reported. Either let us sell them or stope the name game. Never been a documented case of a Legal private sale causing a problem. Usually stolen & if you allowed posting perhaps stolen could be recovered. Friends Harley was stolen posted & recovered. But you don't ban them. If an Item is placed in the proper category you ban it & remove it place in wrong category it stays. Also you have items that are still for sale after a YEAR searches locally return items from 100’s of miles away.,1
1298,Harassed by company: I would never use this app or any app owned by ownership again. I had a verified account for years with tons of 5 star reviews and suddenly out of no where they removed my account with no reasoning or explanation saying I violated community guidelines from an automated email  and I had done nothing wrong. After writing back and forth with customer support I got absolutely no where as it just kept giving me the same automated response. I feel so disappointed disgusted disrespected violated and harassed as a user for being completely mistreated. I will never recommend and in fact tell everyone I know about this and make sure everyone I know doesn’t use this platform again. Very horrible traumatized by this experience and will be writing the bbb as well,1
1299,They should be sued let’s be honest here: Offer up a year ago was amazing. You didn’t have to pay $2.99 a day just for people to look at your post. Engagement was really organic back then I could post an item without paying them and I would get it sold within a week with so many views. But now….. they shadow ban any listing that isn’t paid for I have proof. My listing has been up for a month with zero views. The second I paid one day the views went up to 100 but not a single person even messages me about the listing? They are just creating revenue off this scam I just mentioned. Completely illegal in the state of California and I will be contacting my lawyers. Stay away from this app AT ALL COSTS so many other really good places that don’t screw you over like offer up,1
1300,"Easy to use: It is a simple app that is easy to use. And a way to earn a few extra dollars. On the other hand there is way too many flakes. They need to come up with a way to block the no shows or flakes Some suggestions to approve the application would be Negative rating for the no shows if someone had too many negative ratings for no show they should be blocked from using OfferUp An option to cancel an item for sale. Examples sold it somewhere else, or gave it away as I did 1 of my items I had listed.",5
1301,"One of the worst apps ever: OfferUp doesn’t take the time to monitor they’re jobs section for scammers. And it’s nothing bust scammers that call over and over and over offering fraudulent services. Don’t even try to click on any job postings. You will receive cold call after cold trying to sell you insurance or it will be a fake job trying to get your info. The free section of people getting rid of things isn’t free. People post crap for sale on the free area and it’s usually always some sort of scam. If you purchase through OfferUp make sure you know your seller, OfferUp quickly takes the money but takes they’re sweet time getting the money back to you. The relevance of the advertising and emails hat claim to show you items that match your pattern of purchases is total crap.",1
1302,"Aug 2023 Update Trashed This App: 1) When Posting a $32 unit on Offerup I learned any Item for Sale priced under $2,000 now defaults to Shipping requirements. 
2) Where is my Local Pickup Only Button? Shipping changes my entire business model. 
3) THEN IT WANTED MY FACIAL SCAN. Nobody should have a Facial Scan associated with a cell phone app selling cheap stuff. Did Offerup become aquired by a CCP Company?
4) Offer Up App would Not Post my $32 item without a Tru U. Tru U was optional but recommended when I signed up.  I am trustworthy enough without it, as is evidenced by my successful sales history. 
5) After uninstalling the app and reinstalling it the App still came up with all the information from my previous $32 failed post. (btw- I raised the price to $3,002 to see if I could get a local shipping option No such luck.)
6) I changed my category sellection. For the $32 item.  Still could not post. 
6) The new error message was approximately “Photos didn’t Load” “Try Again”.
7) If Offerup has ANY HELP chat, email or phone number it is hidden. I was warned about this by a utuber but signed up BECAUSE IT USED TO BE EASY TO WORK.
Can you please fix the app so it is easy as it was before the update?",1
1303,"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING IF IT U DO NOT PAY THREW PAY PAL: So let me start off by saying theres nothing wrong with this app. The problem i had, and cannot believe i was so stupid of doing i got robbed for my money this person said pay threw zelle but if i dont get the package i cant get back the money but i didnt know that. So dont buy stuff if its not threw pay pal because in pay pal if you dont get the package you retrieve the money. In pay pal the money will not be sent until you get the package. Please do not make the same mistake i did and to person that took my money and didnt send the package i hope your proud of yourself.",5
1304,"WORST app to sell on: sellers beware: Offerup is garbage. They have no accessible support team or customer service to reach out to other than by submitting a message via email. Messages are never responded to. I lost an item to a seller because OfferUp makes you package, ship, and label every item separately even to the same buyer, and as mentioned the support team was unreachable and unresponsive. They also do nothing about the harassment female sellers experience from users on the app looking for dates and not items. Every single buyer lowballs and will lose interest if you ask for 40% or more of what an item is worth. Waste of time, I have only sold 5% of my items off this app and everything else sells faster and I have much better and efficient transactions on Ebay, Mercari, and Poshmark.",1
1305,"Love the concept, but watch out for scammers: I’ve reported many obvious scammers that don’t follow the OfferUp terms and conditions and their profiles are still active waiting on someone to prey on. There are also new issues in the app since the new update. I can’t view all of the items on my saved lists because they won’t load. I’ve tried using my data, using my Wifi, using both, turning my phone on and off, and uninstalling the app multiple times. And now the I can’t view any products at all because there’s “weak network connection.” It’s not my Wifi, data, or phone, so… this app is great, but it has some bugs that need fixing.",3
1306,In and Out: The app would be much better if you could advance to the next product without having to exit out of the screen you are on.  Letgo was able to do that and I loved it that capability was the bomb.  Additionally there is absolutely to many scams I think the app should be monitored more closely.  The sellers who want you to email them is a scam. Usually the item is very nice with an extremely low price.  Often times I will identify the item as a scam but it remains on this app.  I think once a product is suspected to be a scam then it should be removed until it is determined whether or not it's legit.  Maybe flagging the email being used would help.  I just don't use the app much because is said reasons.  Thanks,2
1307,"No responses back: I’ve been using OfferUp/Let Go for years, until the last couple months everything worked great, I’ve sold nearly 100 items on there, And bought around the same if not more but now I can’t get a single response from anyone. I’ve messaged on over 30 items, some of them within a minute of them being posted and still I receive no response from them. It’s more than frustrating. Everyone I know has deleted the app because of the same issue. I read on a forum that it’s because it no longer notifies you when you receive a message from someone so the seller is obligated to stay on top of it by constantly checking the app, but with that said I’ve still not gotten anything from anyone in months. It’s unfortunate.",1
1308,"Needs fine tuned: App itself is a great idea and works fine. It is easy to get specific searches for shipping options. No one seems to respond on a listing more than a month old. Many listings are over two years old and definitely no response there. Been looking in a specific category so when I need other things I will give the app a couple more chances. Better prices than Mercari, but if you have an item listed for a certain amount and haven’t sold it in a month, why not accept the listed price? I am tired of searching and looking at items I cannot buy.",4
1309,"Worst buyer / seller app to use: I do not recommend using offer up to other people. I had an issue where I purchased something from a seller on this app, and then the usps decided to mail it to a different state. The ending result was that offer up told me to contact the post service, and then usps told me it wouldn’t be coming to my address. So, basically offer up didn’t even try to issue me back a refund and I was charged on my account already, for something I never received. Do not use this app, as it doesn’t have have customer service willing to help or refund you back.",5
1310,Updated Review: STILL TERRIBLE: This is my update to my previous review: OFFERUP just gets worse and worse each day! I’ve given the app a chance and NOTHING. After many many manyyy months I’ve had 0 SALES. I used to sell tons in LetGo. I’m done with OfferUp and will be deleting. AAAANNNDD OFCOURSE..they DO NOT CARE. There’s a bunch of bad reviews (so many issues!!) and they are not doing anything about it. They just generate similar responses to everyone. The truth is they are just sitting there NOT CARING for anyone but themselves since they are still make money. Sad people don’t care about customers or others struggling during the pandemic. Nothing is forever though...not even money. Sad to say OfferUp turned into just another company who cares only for money and themselves even though the earth will one day pass. Hard to find truly caring people these days.,1
1311,"Great app but lacking one MAJOR feature: The app itself is awesome and so easy to use. However, you will find that this community of buysers/sellers lacks commitment. Just today I was supposed to have two different buyers come by and neither showed. This happens often. Anywhere from 20%-30% of the time. When this happens and a “sale” doesn’t actually take place, you cannot rate the buyer. So when you go to accept an offer or buy an item you have no idea if this person tends to flake or not. With a simple “commit” button you would be able to rate the person based on their follow through. This is a much needed feature.",4
1312,"Generally great: First let me say: I am a fan of OfferUp.
I prefer it over Craigslist and for me it’s to go App for classifieds.

But here’s what could use improvements:

- SEARCH: you cannot search using Boolean operators (like on eBay for example!). The use of “&” and “-“ is very useful.

- OFFERUP IS FULL OF CLUTTER: ads stay on there forever. A vendor who doesn’t reply on a simple ad after 5 months should have their items listed anymore. 
Deactivating ads after 1 month would be awesome.

- DEACTIVATING ADS: you can archive ads, by deactivating would be more useful. If you’re in serious negotiation  with someone, it would be neat to deactivate the ad, so it wouldn’t be listed anymore without removing all your messages.
Also, as mentioned before ads should be automatically deactivated after one month. Send the lister an email, if he clicks on it he can extend the duration for another month otherwise it’s gone.

- “REPONDS IN A FEW MINUTES” is utter nonsense. I’ve messaged so many sellers who never got back to me. I assume they calculate the response time just if there was a reply, not if there wasn’t. So, pls adjust this feature!

I didn’t know where to leave better feedback than here.",1
1313,"Great Service but app is missing key feature: Before I make any large purchases, I always check the Facebook marketplace for any good local deals. I actually often just scroll through the marketplace looking at what people are selling. I would like to use OfferUp just as often, but I find myself getting so easily annoyed at the fact that the app is missing a simple close/back/exit gesture. I should be able to swipe down (or any direction, I don’t care) to exit a listing. I don’t know how many times I have closed the app because I get annoyed at not being able to just easily maneuver through listings. It would be a really easy feature to add, and would make the app more enjoyable.",3
1314,"So close to 5 stars: This app is a good app. Although I only use it locally I like the option it shows for shipping out of state. 
I like how it has so many ways to verify who you are. It makes the app feel safer to use, although You can never be to safe.
The fact that it allows you to quickly rate people with the simple click of a button rather than writing in your own words is all a good. 
The reason this app did not get 5 stars is because it would be GREAT if you could send a picture through the messenger part of it. I’m sure the is a good reason why they have not developed it that way but it would be helpful to allow it.",4
1315,"Shipping Items: It’s completely ridiculous that you aren’t paid until after an item is “inspected” this leaves a lot of room for the buyer to commit fraud! Someone could easily switch their broken item out with a good one that someone has shipped...not a single other website gives you your money after the item is received. I’ll never use this method again...this was the worse idea yet. I don’t know who had that great idea, but it needs to be revamped! That’s insane how that someone thought that was a good idea! Highly disappointed this needs to change.",5
1316,"Watch for scammers/dishonest people they’re everywhere on there.: I love selling and buying from offer up. However after being scammed out of $800 I feel like they need to tighten up on their policies and protecting buyers/sellers. 
The person ghosted on me and there is no way to contact them or anything. In fact they made a new account with a new name and started over. Only buy from verified, true you account members and if buying phones meet at the original carriers place to verify it’s been paid off and unlocked. 
So many scammers and dishonest people on there compared to what it used to be.",5
1317,"Waste of time: The majority of the messages I got were from spammers. I’d say 75%. Waste of time. And on top of that, I tried their “free trial” to promote my item that I was selling to get a boost in views. The trial is for 3 days and for almost 2 days, not once did I even see my item promoted or even visible at all in the main page. The page where everyones listings are. I kept going back every so often in those 2 days, kept refreshing and closing out of the app, and nothing. Also, the majority of the cars they promote are from dealerships. So not only do they mislead you into thinking the free trial is gonna do anything for you, but they pretty much give the advantage to the dealerships. So good luck trying to sell your car on there. I emailed them about this issue and all they replied with was how I can cancel the trial 😒 yeah, thanks for nothing.",1
1318,"The bumps offered don’t go up: You’ll pay for a “bump” to have your item get more views, but OfferUp won’t actually bump your item. You will still get charged, you’ll have a headache, you’ll investigate, question offerup, and they’ll just say that it’s not their fault but whoever dealt the transaction (iTunes, Apple, bank). So now you gotta go to that aforementioned party and deal with them. And you might not even get your money back. They’re a sham, a scam, a wallawallabingbang. Don’t do it. Reconsider. Read some literature on the subject. Are you sure? Hey I got your back like chiropract. If they do you dirty, I’ll wipe them with detergent.",5
1319,"Better than letgo: Update - seriously questioning their rules and regulations. Had my post instantly removed because one photo had too many words, but they’re allowing postings for drugs. REALLY???

NOPE. They need to do MUCH better than that. 

Have been very successful selling items. Previously used letgo but you can’t turn off marketing notifications and suggestions of what you might like (not even close). PLEASE OfferUp don’t start blasting annoying notifications. One minor issue was with one of my first postings, which OfferUp took down, explaining I can’t post anything with words only. This wasn’t the case. There were two photos of the item and the third photo was a screenshot with specs. Thought that was a bit picky. Also, I would love to have a “Wanted” area where people can list something they’re looking for. Great app.",1
1320,"Communicating through the OfferUp app: The part of using this app that is really bad but could be fixed is texting back in forth in the app
You respond to something being sold and you don’t hear back for 3 days
Usually because people are busy
If your initial text was in the app but the app connected to your standard Text App which people always monitor then response time would be so improved
The person would just give permissions for the OfferUp app to relay the text to your ordinary text location on your phone",5
1321,"App is great but full of scammers: This app is build week. Reliable, fast, easy to use. The problem is, there are so many hacked accounts on OfferUp that makes it difficult to do business. I have reported these issues through the report feature, and after an email conversation with the support team about it, they are doing nothing to address the issues. There are many posts on this app where the picture was taken of the item on a computer screen, then the item posted 100’s of times in different cities. I have responded to several of these posts to find that user accounts are being hacked, and OfferUp is doing nothing to correct the issues. 

Kudos to the team that built the app, shame on OfferUp for knowingly letting people hack user accounts to scam people out of their hard earned money.",1
1322,"Trash: App doesn’t perform 85% of what it’s supposed to do. I’ll get an email saying I have a message and I’ll click the link to take me to the message in OfferUp however, it will launch my web browser and ask me to either download the app or continue in the browser but I already have the app downloaded. I have the app download right ok I then click on the app and select messages but there’s no messages yet this is because I got an email with the message in it. I supposed the messages are invisible. This is the case on my galaxy S9 as well as my iPhone X. Then sometimes it just flat out says offer up isn’t available. Absolute unmistakable without a doubt trash. The app performs like it was create by a 2nd year undergrad as a introduction to programming final project. Which I’d give an F since it doesn’t even remotely perform its purpose.",1
1323,"Craigslist x 10: Sooooo many things to love
- you can do this easily from your phone
- it's simple and easy to use
- no one uses Craigslist anymore and I think of all the apps this one is the best

I do sometimes get better results with Facebook Marketplace -

However.... 
these are the things that need to be improved because if they don't someone else will

Rating system - there should be a flake out selection in the rating.  No stars for them just the flake out selections so that if someone had enough of them they could be discontinued. 4 times out of five people ask a question or make an offer and then never respond again.

Offers - there should be a calculation so if someone makes an offer that's 50% lower than the asking price that a pop-up box comes up and says are you really sure you want to offer that amount as it is 50% of what the person is asking for the item.  It's extremely insulting when you offer things at a really fair price and someone offers you five dollars for it.",4
1324,"Good app, but lacking a few features.: Overall it’s a good app, however it would be nice to be able to review service received and allow others a way to see the actual reviews.

For example:

Recently I purchased a mobile mechanic service that stated they had 20 years of pro experience. However when they showed up, they didn’t look professional nor seems like they have the right tool to do the job. 

I had mention there was a stripped bolt and they quoted me $60 to get the job done, upon arriving and trying to remove it, they say this is gonna cost extra and wanted to charge me more. Not to mention they didn’t even came with a special tool to extract the strip bolt. However after 3 hours they manage to complete the job they were paid to do. Although they didn’t do a good job at it, since I had to get my own hands dirty to reinstall the items they left uninstall after taking it apart. 

I wish offer up have an option to leave a review about my experience with this particular person so others will know what they are getting into.",3
1325,"Awesome app- just noticed something: This may be a pretty niche update but I noticed I cant access the app or website outside the US. I’m not looking to buy outside the US but I was trying to look for things while I’m in London and there is no way for me to even shop. It’s pretty silly but I think it would be nice to be able to access the US offer up while I’m away so I can see whats available before I get back

(i’m not looking for this to get fixed immediately, just might be nice for others in the future)",5
1326,"Cancelled order without payment !: Why my transaction got canceled not by me mind you but by offer up after buyer received purchase . Now I’m out $$ who gives you the right to do this ? Sounds like a scam to me. No we’re is there any place on OfferUp site for any kind of human communication to resolve problem . I’m the seller , buyer got item I sold them that they purchased through offer up and package got to buyer on time . Buyer was happy . I’m out my $ because OfferUp cancelled the order after the transaction went through ! why? ........ hey OfferUp I want my $ you took I never cancelled any order",5
1327,"Do not download this app.: Offer up was great, an entire marketplace to buy and sell, I even had subscription for “promote plus” and paid 20$/month for boosted item views. Sad to let it go because of the greed of the developers. They sold their soul and now you can’t even look at item listings with out being interrupted by garbage ads for other random apps, to ad insult to injury in order to get an “ad free experience” they offer another 8$/month subscription. No thanks, I’m not going to pay extra just to not have to deal with the garbage you people added to your own app. I just cancelled it all. Shame on you offer up, you actually had a good network of buyers and sellers and you sold all of them and your selves out for some cheap add revenue. Back to Craigslist I go.",1
1328,"Offer up is the worst app and marketplace ever: I can’t even begin to tell you how offer up is so bad.  Yes  the app is horrible, has a lot of bugs, is filled with scammers and 1 million ads. But the worst part of OfferUp is its clientele. Buyers never show up. Sellers decide at the last minute they want to keep the item themselves. And most people are rude and discourteous.

Honestly I think the entire company is a fraud and we’ll go bankrupt.   I’m guessing they make most of their money by selling ads. Advertisers buy space because people searching on offer up are looking for items. But at some point advertisers will wise up and realize that the site is full of scammers, fake ads, and people not really looking to buy anything. When that happens offerup’s advertising revenue will go to zero",1
1329,"Good for certain things.: So OfferUp has helped me sell many things. Which is great. However their system for detecting unsellable items needs some work. I posted a truck for sale, and it only gives you one vehicle sale post. After that you need to pay on the app to post more cars for sale. 
Well, I posted the car and immediately it was taken down. Some key word in my post caused them to think it was an illegal item or against their rules. 
Now I’ve used up my free car post and my first post was auto-taken down, not even up for one second. 
That needs some work.",4
1330,"Good 👍: This is a good app, was able to sell two items on my first try. I give three stars because I almost got fooled by scammers on here. They were asking too much of my info and also my phone number. Now it’s gonna increase more scammers to call my phone now. I reported one but for some reason more are coming after me. Advise from me don’t talk with people who ask for your phone number, email and birthday. And also people who just joined this month. I notice three of them asked me the same thing. And all of them does not have their pictures or history of buying and selling stuff and also would say they just joined this month.",3

No one is seeing any of my posts. I have reached out three times to ask for support. I added a new account just to see if it was my internet or something on my end. People can see those posts just fine. I don’t want the new account tho-just my original account because I worked hard at my five star rating. OfferUp emailed me saying I have a duplicate account and asking which one I would like to keep. I asked for my original account only, but need help troubleshooting why I’ve been shadow banned. No additional support has been offered. I’m disappointed that no reasoning has been given for the shadow ban.",1
1332,"Generally very good, but...: I’ve been using this app for about 2 or 3 years, with success with selling items. My one issue is since OfferUp merged with LetGo, now when you place an otherwise perfect photo as your cover shot, the app automatically resizes the photo into a square format. This is very annoying as the photo becomes blurry and distorted. This is a disservice to both sellers and buyers. Also, if you would put the ideal photo pixel dimensions into your FAQ section, this would help everyone using this app. Please address this issue and let us know when you included this information. 
Thanks",4
1333,"Editing Posts Can Be A Pain!: I love OfferUp, when it’s legit sales in my area. More often than not though I notice their “ads” are scam websites! That crazy! I know better than to buy from these sites but some don’t & it’s very misleading since OFFERUP is sponsoring the ads! 
My only other complaint is that when you want to edit a post, you have to re-add all of your photos! I don’t save photos of old clothing & furniture that I’m selling on my camera roll so if you wanna lower the price or change description, you have to RETAKE the photos all over again! It really is a pain! 
Other than that, it’s a great site to find cheap used items in & around your area!",3
1334,"Not an app for buying vehicles: After two years, this app is horrible for buying cars or auto parts... when you search for something specific it returns a bunch of random vehicles, I can understand if “keywords” were in the ad but they aren’t. Additionally after numerous contacts sellers never get back to you. The notifications don’t work for buyers so I’m assuming it’s the same for sellers. Also ads are kept on indefinitely unless removed... most people selling on here are too lazy to deactivate their ad once they sell their vehicle or part, so your search results return stuff that is months or years old that the owner will never respond on. 

This app probably works for cheap household items, but is trash for buying or selling cars or car parts....",2
1335,"As a beginner on OfferUp: So my first week has passed on OfferUp. So far everyone I have met or text with have been good people to do business with.  I only have one “issue”, and that’s hopefully many have the same opinion. It’s the Venders selling their stuff. I’m not referring to the talented people that work on furniture and sell . I don’t care for the New furniture folks that push their stuff ad after ad!! There should be a menu for them- under “NEW STUFF”...... people want to shop and get a deal - as well as bidding for a lower price. Just my opinion...... nobody likes to see the same stuff everyday all day!!!!",5
1336,"Good, but not great: I like the option to be able to ship, the ability to rate people you meet with, the security of the app and the amount of users/items listed.

With that said, I miss LetGo. There were no ads confusing you for what products are actually available(this is probably why they couldn’t stay afloat, no funds). Offer up will not work on my cellular data. I turn the switch on in my setting to use data with offer up and it goes off by itself. It makes it very difficult to talk with buyers/sellers when meeting somewhere.

I will definitely still keep using it because it’s core purpose is solid.",4
1337,"Got completely scammed.: I ordered some items for my pc off of offerup and the seller cancelled, which is fine, offer up Is responsible for returning your money back when a seller cancels an item.

As well as any efforts to contact offer up via email and Instagram have failed. They haven’t responded to any of my emails about this issue. I wouldn’t have cared about a small amount of money but I lost 188 dollars because offer up never returned it. I payed 188 dollars for something that I never got. As of right now I am very upset with this app and would even advocate people I know not to ever use it, I’ll change my review on this app if offer up can actually email me back about my issue.",1
1338,I love offer up! BUT....: I literally use offer up everyday! It’s a awesome app but two things I think need work. It’s super hard to contact someone with an issue although I did get my issue resolved so that’s a plus but mostly I really wish you guys would allow pics to be shared in the messages. Sometimes we have questions or need to show something on the product but can only describe it to the person for example I bought a grill and had a question about a wire hanging once I got home and opened it but couldn’t send a pic to seller. Lots of issues would be easier resolved with this I believe. Any way just a suggestion,4
1339,"They should do better: Idk if the staff at headquarters thoroughly checks photos to see if you’re violating the terms but someone can report you for anything and they remove your ad. It can be be your competitors just hitting report to remove your ad and if you keep re posting it, offer up freezes your account. Also got a new phone And  new number . Tried to log into offer up and it won’t let me access my account even though I know my email and password.  offer up doesn’t recognize the new device, the iPhone 11, So it locked me out. I had a following, lots of items for sale , I’ve emailed them and I get no response , i had to make a new account, so honestly offer up is wack and I’m only using it because there’s a pandemic and I need to make money .",1

I instantly let offerbup know about it and they told me to  just sign in well that’s the main problem someone hacked it changed my password. Ofer up says push the I for got my password  option and they will send me my info and how to change it. I go to my email and there is nothing there. Nothing in inbox nothing in spam. Nada. So I can’t get in my account. I try and contact offer up with no response. Was thinking about opening a second account but having second thoughts,5
1341,"Very frustrating customer service: I downloaded OfferUp after my wife had downloaded the app and successfully sold a few items apparently with no hassle.
After selling my first item I registered a method for receiving the funds and chose debit card.
After filing all the necessary info (including SSN, card number, and so on) I received endless requests for more info, proof of ID and etc. provided those and still wasn’t allowed to get my funds. 
After unsuccessfully trying to find a customer service number (guess what, easy to download but if anything goes wrong you won’t be able to talk to anyone) I sent an info request via the app.
After receiving 13 emails from OfferUp I finally got a reply. Typical scripted answer, blamed all the requirements on the US government and did not help clarify why I’m being asked several additional layers of security when other people have dowloaded the app and have been using it without having to provide all this info.
I was given a link that I’m suppose to log into from a PC laptop (?!?) and finalize begging them for my money...seriously.
Extremely disappointed and def not using it anymore and deleting it as soon as I manage to get my funds...bye!",1
1342,"SHIPPING CHANGES!! Devs, please READ: Why are you making these changes that is effecting me and the community of sellers that ship on this app? To squeeze another dollar out of the buyers? Please please please revert the shipping options and keep USPS services for items up to 15lbs... if anything give us the OPTION of what mail carrier we would like to use!! I make you guys hundreds of dollars a month shipping items on your app. Now that you’ve screwed around with delivery fees and changing carriers is going to lose your employees , us the sellers that ship and make you the most money!!! You gave us no heads up or update on what your changing and how these items will be shipped! We need your help and give us some information on what the hell is going on! Please revert back to original shipping options!!! You guys can’t be losing any money can you!?!?",1
1343,"Favorite for local sales - needs one improvement: Would love if they could work in a way to prevent people who make an offer and then never respond again. I get offers all the time that I agree to, only to never hear back from the interested buyer. Maybe ban accounts after they make an offer and fail to respond three times? I'm not sure what the best solution would be but it's my one main annoyance with this app. There needs to be a way to discourage people from making offers to buy when they have no intention to follow through with the purchase.",5
1344,"Scam Artists, OfferUp Ads, Force TruYou: EDIT: OFFERUP ILLEGALLY USED MY CREDIT CARD ON FILE AND CHARGED A BUNCH OF RANDOM CHARGES TO IT THAT I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE. AS SOON AS I REMOVED MY CARD MY ISER GOT BANNED. I WILL BE DEMANDING ALL MONEY BE RETURNED! SCAM APP

Half of the users on this site are unconfirmed users who are offering payment plans, asking for SS#s, being aggressive, making illegal posts that look like they are selling and object but when you click on it they say I’ll buy your stuff and you have to pay shipping etc. and no matter how many times you report them nothing ever happens to them. All scammers/bots get a free ride

The ads are overwhelming, every other item is a promotion that when you click on it takes you to a pop up, you’ll get messages all the time as if someone is interested in your offer, but the notification is blank and you open it to find OfferUp bots telling you to sell stuff, pay to promote, or just annoying you. 

As I mentioned before half the users are unconfirmed user that somehow got by the TruYou requirement. And the TruYou requirement wants your phone number and a picture of your license. Since I have them this I’ve got nonstop telemarketing calls, spam mail, and emails on an otherwise unknown email address.",1
1345,"Missed Sale/Wasted Customer’s Time: I normally love OfferUp but I just missed a sale and worst yet, wasted a customer’s time. They messaged me multiple messages but I was never notified about the messages until it was too late and the customer had to leave. Finally after about 10 minutes from the last message they sent, I received notification of their first message. 

Please keep in mind, my settings on my phone for notifications is set accurately and I normally get my messages immediately from OfferUp, so this seems to be a new issue with the app. 

Anyways, I got the first message they sent and as I’m reading it, I get another notification of the next message, and then the next and the next, etc. I got all the messages in a few minutes yet they showed the times the customer actually sent them. 

I do not like keeping customers waiting or wasting their gas for the drive to pick up the item and me not be there because I never got notified they messaged me. 

I like this app so I don’t have to give out my number but, as of right now, I can’t trust using the messaging system in the app when it comes time for meeting up for a sale. 

I really hope this gets fixed.",1
1346,"Works Wonders!: I got OfferUp app 3 days ago, and posted 2 items to sell, along with ad on FB marketplace. On FB I had 10x conversations about the product but no one actually came to my door, however on OfferUp I only had 4 people interested in buying item 1 and 1 person interested in buying 2nd item. Guess what, they were legit buyers, came to my door and checked out the products. Much better experiences then Zelle scammers on FB marketplace and cold responders. I haven’t written app review in years, today I had to! Love the app and it’s legit buyers and sellers, thank you!",5
1347,"No Customer service help: I worked hard to sell and get good reviews on my account. One day the app was acting funny and wouldn’t let me view my messages. So I logged out for a day thinking it would fix itself. The next day, I try logging in, and it wouldn’t let me. It read “This account is inactive.” I haven’t been able to log into that account since then. I tried contacting customer service for help and support hoping they would fix the issue, or at least contact me. But still haven’t heard a word from them. All my hard work down the drain. I tried making a new account, but have not been able to sell, not one thing!!! It says the account is still there but inactive. I was only logged out for literally one day!!! Before this happened, I thought the app was a 5 star. Very disappointed!!!",1
1348,"When searching it should say how many items found: - I like that the show how many views there has been when selling . - I like that you can be notified when an item has been posted - I like that a buyer can easily ask the seller a question . -If you search for something it should tell you how many items found . -Also I hate that it has stores / retail Buisness selling . -Also when searching it always jumps out of the category that I chose . - it should give the option to list a phone # and there are to many flakes . I would say 2.75 stars Thank you,
I was deleated and my offer up account can not be reopened bc they say i violated the policy. 
I have no idea how i violated it and they won’t say how or what I did and I’m sure I did nothing wrong.",1
1349,"Great unless you get scammed: As a buyer: First time scammed on any sales platform in my life was here on OfferUp by a criminal in GA. I take partial responsibility for it of course-poor decisions bring poor outcomes. BUT-ZERO responses from OfferUp, and I submitted hard evidence of the guy’s theft and filed police report. OfferUp didn’t reply at all to my messages. And there’s no way to call the company? How many more people is this loser scamming on the platform? ZERO help from authorities in GA who told me to talk to Miami where the scam occurred, and of course Miami won’t do anything because the guy is in GA. Failure all around. So, use at your own discretion and be smart. 

As a seller: excellent.",4
1350,Ads: I read some other reviews that date back 6 years and most are the same complaints I have regarding bad coding. So 6 years and the suggestions haven’t been considered or fixed. I doubt anything will come from my new complaint. I used to use this app a lot but recently stopped because of the frequent ads that interrupt my search/scrolling. I was still using the app despite the annoying ads but started to use it significantly less. Lately I realized it’s gotten even worse. I have not been able to exit the add once it’s done. The only option I have it to click the ad link so I have to exit the app and start my search over again. This could be a great app with even more business if these few things could be fixed,1
1351,"Email scammers on Offer Up!: This app is in high use for scammers to get your personal data, identity by asking you to contact someone else through an email. Nothing appears to be done about this obvious problem after reporting many scams! Sold items are not removed for years. Not monitored properly! Especially targeting the sale of vehicles and boats that are to good to be true!!! Boats and cars for $500-$1000 in excellent condition or like new! Do not answer emails outside of the app!! And every time I scroll down, look up an item and scroll, can’t resume where I was. App starts at the very beginning again! Which is a pain when I’ve scrolled through 100 listings! App needs work! I get no answer from sellers. Terrible business! S I stopped using this app! Be aware!",1
1352,"Response rate and annoying notifications make for a bad experience: In the past I’ve used OfferUp to successfully sell things.  People were generally responsive, but lately it’s been bad.  I also noticed lately that there have been more marketing messages from OfferUp.

This is the same dark pattern used by Apple like Uber Eats, where apps that require communication (e.g. between buyer and seller, customer and delivery person) use the same push notification channel to deliver advertisements and “increase platform engagement”

The notifications produced by OfferUp are this loud, annoying cash register noise.  Additionally, there was no way to disable them in the app, so I turned them off completely.  Like many other people, my phone is a mess of notifications and I want to cut through the noise.

In my opinion, OfferUp is one of the many victims of the current software monetization model, and maybe even capitalism as a whole.  In the meantime, I suggest that the company provide more fine-grained notification settings instead of forcing users to see their marketing emails.",2
1353,"Forced advertising ruined a great app: This was my go-to replacement to Craigslist based solely on the phones better/ easier user interface. Then they switched the advertising that appears after scrolling for a bit to a full screen display that forces you to wait a time period before giving you option to close. Like many annoying pop-ups the close box is tiny & will as many times take you to website rather than close.  Worst, it sometimes freezes & wont close. Now the rare times I attempt to use, I simply close at first full screen advertising shortly after opening app. Not worth the trouble.",3
1354,"Full Page Ads??: This app was AMAZING for a few years. Like Craigslist but with buyer and seller ratings for credibility. Then this year it became glitchy. They rolled out full page ads that are annoying, especially because they’re hard (or sometimes impossible) to close. I just had to delete and reinstall the app because I couldn’t close an ad. Recently I tried to post a review for a seller but I can’t scroll down far enough to reach the “submit” button. I tried many times. And notifications have always been kind of unreliable, sometimes leaving a notification on the app icon even after I’ve read a message. Please fix the app and get rid of the trashy full-page ads.",2
1355,Fraud: I tried to create a new account. It asked for a credit card number but said the number would not work and to try a different one. I did a different one and it was rejected also. Then I got a fraud alert from one of my cards. It had two fraudulent charges on it from just now I tried to create a new account. It asked for a credit card number but said the number would not work and to try a different one. I did a different one and it was rejected also. Then I got a fraud alert from one of my cards.

1356,"Terrible: I’ve had my offer up account for almost 10 years and they decided to ban my account, they stated the hand painted!! boxes I made we’re attempting to be sold as counterfeit. These are hand painted items. I never attempted to sell them as a counterfeit. The description literally said hand painted. There are so my people selling the exact same items but my account gets banned, I’m just trying to make a living and most of my clients come from OfferUp. I feel like I was singled out and I’m being treated unfairly since they pick and choose who they want to ban wich is extremely bias. They also kept my money when I created a new account with premium. Shut it down the next day after charging me $8. What a joke. Bias thieves is the best description of this company.",1
1357,"Scammed by offer up: After I posted my first item for sale I was promoted to sign up for a 3 day free trial of promote plus. Given my item was niche I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try it out and possibly pay for it if it brought my item attention. After using my thumb print to sign up, my bank account was immediately charged and even worse my account never received the upgrade(I immediately canceled the subscription). I reach out to offer up via email to dispute the charge and was strung along until finally they sent me an automated message about how to cancel my membership(which I had done already) and said I wouldn’t not receive a refund. I regard this as a literal scam given I was told I wouldn’t be charged and then was. Stay away from the promote plus trial.",1
1358,"Need lot of improvements.: Although I like the idea but the app it self have many glitches and issues. First the web based  desktop interface is batter than using app. When you’re on app,  the thumbnail list doesn’t show the price of each listed items without clicking on it where desktop version does and saved time. Also your purchases doesn’t stay there after sometime to rate the seller as an buyer and you loose that privilege while you’re trying to resolve the issue with seller if any. Also the app it self from the apple store is buggy, often required to kill and restart due to unresponsive action.",3
1359,"Pedos: I downloaded this app to sell some items that I no longer have use for. When selling some items of my daughter’s clothing I was repeatedly getting messages from men wanting to buy her clothing for nefarious purposes. While I don’t fault the app for that I do fault them for the fact that it was nearly impossible to report such issues, and that even after reporting and blocking one of the men that got particularly bad with his messages and began harassing me I still was receiving messages from him. Although I can’t see them in the app the messages were instead sent to my email where I could still see them. This defeats the whole purpose of blocking someone. I’m now deleting this app because of this. I will find other means to sell the items I have.",1
1360,"Great Shopping App: When I first heard about Offer Up from a friend, I didn’t think much of it. I figured it’d be something similar to Letgo and Craigslist, which I’ve used both of those but didn’t love to use them. However, Offer Up has simplified everything and made it a very attractive buying/selling experience. The app is flawless and super easy to use. I also feel like I can trust it and so far I give it an A+. I’m using the app daily even if I’m not purchasing anything, but it’s amazing the quality of stuff that’s posted on here. People trust the app and I highly recommend it!",5
1361,"Buy at your own risk: I used the app regularly for a while and it was mostly positive meeting in person. But i WOULD NOT buy anything to be shipped. I bought a ceramic bobblehead described as new, never opened and pictured with a box. What arrived was not in the box and shattered and after 2 weeks of speaking with customer service, I ended up speaking to Jason the Customer Service Supervisor who refused to take any action to get my money back. I moved recently and missed the window to ship back the shattered pieces of what I ordered so by the time I did they said I would not get a refund yet the seller got their item back AND got to keep my money. So they are cool with theft as long as they don’t have to lift a finger to do anything. Again, only do meetups, they have zero support for issues that arise.",1
1362,"Hard to find: It’s hard to find ones posted ad, and ppl put the same ad for themselves 20-30 times in a row in some instances making it difficult to advance to other ads. Last but not least. The promotion function is way to short and really doesn’t do much but put the works “Promotion” on the top photo. I would think the least OfferUp would at lease run your ad top billingReoccurring at least a few times a day to the top of the list and make ones ads stand out more. Besides that your self posting of a ad is very straight forward and fairly easy to accomplish. Just wish the gave you more for promotion feature.",3
1363,"Deleting for now: I loved this app at first ad made many purchases through it. 

Lately it’s not working with my VPN. Since most of the items are cross listed on other market places it’s just easier to look at those.

I loved the immediate alerts at first because some hot items sell quickly, but I hate getting notifications throughout the day for imprecise search terms that I can’t even see without turning off VPN. For example, other platforms know that a hand plane isn’t the same thing as a toy plane or a corded planer (which I would never consider). 90% of my alerts are irrelevant which might be acceptable except that it takes several seconds to click through to the right place. Now I also have to turn off VPN, then reload the app, then click through to the right place. 

Plus it’s harder to navigate and see how far the offer is from me. I relied on the picture double tap to zoom to quickly see the quality of wood grain for example. 

TLDR: The app has gone from helpful to a distraction.",3
1364,"Pretty good: Overall a very good selling app, I enjoy using it just to browse but I occasionally sell cars. My main problem with the app is the “3 free posts per month”. I don’t mind paying for another post. Though the main problem is that the system is trash for determining if You’ve posted a car related post in the month. I recently posted one on the 10th of may, and it said it was my last free post. Even though it was my first post of the month, let alone I hadn’t posted anything in about 3 months. Just hoping you guys can fix this, but besides that, everything is fine.",4
1365,"Bad selling app! Awful customer service!!!: Tired of trying to contact support to figure why my account was locked without prior notice or notification! They also dared to keep charging my promote plus subscription without me being able to even Access my account or message any possible customers!!!! I honestly don’t understand if it is because of an update or the app definitely gives problems to everyone trying to sell something!
Gave a second chance by opening a new account which ends up being a failure since none of the items I upload are actually uploaded ! Tried seeing my profile from a different account and it literally doesn’t show any items for sale!!! 
How sad they can’t solve anything!!!!!!!",1
1366,Just full of scammer adds and no customer service for questions or concerns: This company is a joke they let a bunch of scam posts regularly I use to post some of my services I offered such as soil delivery and remodeling services instead of just deleting the posts cause they weren’t exactly on there guidelines they first made it so I can’t post anything anymore and now they don’t even let me log into my account I have bought and sold multiple items and now I’m complete banned or something they just give me server problems post what a joke and no way to contact an actual person to get it resolved so I guess I’ll just do what the scammers do and create multiple profiles to sell or buy my goods and now they also bought let go so one less site to sell stuff so F-U offer up nazi Germany run platform,1

I like to get rid of them so I don’t have to look at them and you don’t have to keep scrolling through to find the ones youWant. It would be very nice if we would be able to delete them. It would’ve been very nice if when we merged, my items from Letgo had come over. It would be very nice when we’re trying to search for something if you could delete recent search such as I typed in zucchini and I would like to get rid of it but there’s no way to get rid of it.",4
1368,"Please regulate the marketplace...: I’m really tired of looking at things that seem like a good deal, so I message the user about them, never get a response, and the item stays up even though they’re more likely than not long gone. Craigslist does this right by automatically taking down listings after 30 days, making it so you have to repost them if you haven’t sold the item yet. However, here it seems like sellers can use old items as bait to get people to look at the ones they’re selling right now. This saturates the marketplace pretty heavily, so I don’t understand why this would even be okay with the developers of offerup as it means less business is getting done on their app.",3
1369,"Could be WAY better.: I have been using offer up for a while and I used to like the service when it was only buying things locally. Now that they have added shipping around the United States the service has become horrible. I could send an item out and won’t get my money for one to two weeks after the item has already left my house and I am no longer in possession of it. The other person could already be in possession of the item and I am still awaiting my money. They say it is for buyer protection but I don’t buy it. If I ship out an item, money directly gets taken from my account the same day so why don’t I get paid the same day it ships out when I sell something. This is ridiculous. Will find another app that’s better sense everyone loves keeping other peoples money hostage.",1
1370,"Shipping Costs are poorly calculated: I had to pay an extra $15 bucks at my doorstep for an item I ordered on offerup. I have never dealt with something like this before postage wise, and I was so upset. So I escalated the issue with Offerup only for them to tell me to re-escalate the issue with them through the “buyer protection” program they have. Why? So I can go through the whole system again for you to tell me that you won’t refund me the $15 bucks for shipping that the seller did not pay for and I ended up absorbing the cost? They should have a system in place like ebay does to allocate the correct costs of items and not some standard pricing on shipping. Needless to say I am taking my business of buying and selling elsewhere. This app has horrible customer service and no resolution for issues like mine.",1
1371,"Don’t get Scammed by Manny!: My son was scammed by someone named Manny from NY selling sneakers. He told my son to pay using Venmo because it was more secure then the app. Venmo isn’t a authorized form of payment on Offer Up. That should have been enough warning for my son to realize it wasn’t legit. That a $100 lesson he won’t forget anytime soon. That’s not the reason for my 1 star. The problem I have is that I have spoke to others that have been scammed by this same person. All have reported him to the app and yet he is still on there scamming people. Unlike other apps where you can leave feedback similar to a message board, offer up doesn’t. So unless they diligently remove people that have been reported as scammer...you’ll never know. So if your buying sneakers from a guy named Manny from NY DONT!  This is the only way I know how to stop him.",1

I reposted and it was removed again. I contacted OfferUp and was told the item was prohibited and I should read the policy. If you open the app and search Louis Vuitton products you will see multiple listings, can’t understand why I post the same and it’s removed. Very disappointing and will be removing this app. Someone needs to fully explain this. Wasn’t going to give any stars but was forced to in order to process this post.",5
1375,"Be warned!!: Only way to use this app is if ur buying/selling face to face and in cash transactions. Average time it takes OfferUp to release ur funds is a little over 3 weeks and that’s only if u stay on top of them. Most buyers and sellers will handle each transaction in cash or separately via PayPal. Over 50% of all messages from interested buyers are either bots or will ghost you once they get you to agree on a transaction. The downside on top of that is the pure lack of interest on the part of OfferUp to provide any explanation for any issues or to provide any costumer service. I was literally told “it must be a banking issue on your end and I should have your money within a month” so if u use the app, don’t send or receive find thru them. Face to face in cash or via PayPal.",2
1376,"Unanswered Requests: I recently joined Offer Up and I like this platform , because it is interactive and people can buy and sell as they see fit. My only observation that I find a little unexplainable is that some people post items that they are trying to sell and when we ask them a question or two regarding the item, they do not respond. That is a little frustrating , because one does not know if the item has been sold or not, but yet it is still being displayed . This is my only concern, other than that, everything is fine.
Thanks",5
1377,"Firm price feature not working: A couple of complaints…
1.-Lately with new updates (2024), on my firm price items, buyers are not able to see or know when my price is set to firm. 
2.-Seems like, due to the easy access and easy to hit messaging buttons, I get way too many “hi is this still available” messages, which buyers never reply to my answers, nor ever see my answers. It should be a little harder to send a message to be able to identify a legitimate message from an interested buyer. 
3.-Too many flake prospect buyers that never show up to meetings. 
4.-Too many people asking first question “what’s your address”, and never replying back.

Nowadays there’s too many scams on the app. A few weeks ago I almost had money stolen from me in a transaction (thankfully was smart enough to not be hasty then) and reported the seller to OfferUp, who basically did nothing about them. OfferUp really needs to start taking scammers and reports seriously, it’ll be hard for anyone to use their service if not. The app is littered with scammers too so the small amount of people looking to actually sell get buried underneath and OfferUp does nothing to filter the scammers out.

1380,"Reason for 4 Stars: The only true issues are 

1. If not present at the time of delivery; the time limits doesn’t permit proper timeline in which to review purchase (s).
2. That some adds are misleading; what seems to be deliberate; that they haven’t any real intent to sell the item; or not as advertised i.e., I just recently had a back and forth of an item that had advertised that they would “ship” then said it was unreasonable due to cost to ship; how was that not known at the time of posting.  Then made like one of the matching items would be ship, yet neither were; due to failure to ship.
3. There are many that try to set up outside contact; even in the wording of the message i.e., call me for more info at …” or we deliver share your location. 
4. An offer was for 1-3 packages (to complete a set) & resolve for the entire set never materialized, unfortunately; and yes, I accept & understand potential role/risk involved

1381,A pretty yet frustratingly useless app to sell or buy from.: Used offer up over the past several years now in conjunction with similar platforms. The overall design is great and is very user friendly. The real downside of this app is after 3 years of use I haven’t sold one item off of it. Everything sells elsewhere. I’ve noticed that buyers will ask if something is available and ghost you afterwards. Sellers are no different and typically do not respond at all. I’ve had friends in my area who also used the app have similar problems even with paying for boosts to further promote their items. It seems like the only “people” on are bots. And if you have a problem their help desk will direct you to some preprinted garbage that doesn’t solve anything.,1
1382,Banned for no reason: Offerup allows hundreds of scammers to keep their accounts but for some reason my account was shadow banned. I know it was shadow banned because when I try to have friends search for my listings they never show up in the feed and my messages never go through to other sellers. I was able to fix the issue by creating a new account but after a few hours that account was also shadow banned. I don’t understand why my account was banned because all my sales were legit and I never scammed anyone and when I reached out to customer support they never responded. The app is basically useless for me now as a seller because I can’t make anymore accounts since my phone number is now banned and it won’t let me become verified.,1

When we got to Home Depot, we sat there waiting and they sent us what car we should be on the lookout for and turns out it was the car that was sitting in the back of Home Depot. I went over to see if it was the same guy from the profile picture and he did not look like him. He saw me then he drove away immediately. He was targeting my girlfriend and luckily I told her she can’t go alone and that was a smart choice. This app is a scam, made for girls to be stolen for sexual reasons or others. If anyone has gone though this situation, this app should banned and done. I will be looking into this app and sharing on the dangers of this app!",1
1384,"Good but……: When I open OfferUp I’m looking for something that someone got and doesn’t need anymore. All the ads for new things from stores are annoying ( I do understand that they are necessary for the business but they are still annoying)
Now, why are there things posted for sale from 2 years ago? After a month, if the person hasn’t removed it, make it automatically be removed. It can be reposted if the owner wishes to do so.
I’ve tried to buy something, ask if still available and get no answer probably because the item is long gone.
Fix that and I will ignore the ads and give the remaining 2 stars.",3
1385,"Not as good as LetGo: Now that LetGo is a part of Offer Up, it can learn many of its tricks. LetGo’s layout was so much simpler, easy to use and sorry to say nicer too (I used to have Wallapop before it became part of LG). I want to make this a 5 star review but for right now it’s not there yet. Right now it’s trying to be more like eBay. Being like eBay is fine but it would be good to allow edits in which you don’t have to be forced in to making it shipping. I had things listed on here and LetGo when they were separate and my items sold better on LG. I look forward to this journey with OU. Offer Up has the potential to be great it just needs some tweaks. I hope to see some changes ahead. Happy Shopping and Selling!",3
1386,"Has tons of potential, but run by people who refuse to make it better.: There needs to have a time limit on listed items, because there is so much garbage that it makes it not worth it to even look here.  I don’t care about items that have been listed over 6 years ago, why because it’s most likely long gone or the person forgot his account info, and now it’s just junk cluttering and wasting everyone’s time as they try to find the things they need. 

This is why I spend most of my searches on Ksl classifieds and wish other places had them because they are amazing. You should take a page out of their book Offer up. 

Hope everyone reading this is able to find better places to find what they need.",1
1387,"If you have a VPN, READ THIS!!!: First of all, this app has virtually no support, so don’t bother trying to get some or you will be very frustrated. 

The app stopped working for me several months ago. I emailed them several times, only to get back a “canned” response each time that told me to delete and reload the app, do a hard restart, etc.—-stuff most people know already. None of these worked, which of course I told them in subsequent emails, only to get a response from them with their “canned” suggestions to fix. 

I use a VPN for streaming. Yesterday, it occurred to me that maybe that was the problem, like Netflix, which WARNS YOU that if you use a VPN, you need to disable it to use Netflix. Well guess what, that WAS the problem and now the app works. 

So you would think this would be  pretty common knowledge among the folks at OfferUp, but obviously they don’t have the brainpower to put in their “canned” response that you should disable your VPN or the app won’t work. HOW DUMB IS THIS?  

So with a chip on my shoulder, I will continued to use the app because I have had a lot of success buying and selling. 

I hope this info helps somebody out.",1
1388,"Might be nice if it worked: So I find what I want to buy and try to make an offer. Hit the part where it wants to scan your cc. Fail. Fail again. Adjust fail, fail, fail. Use a different card. Fail, fail fail fail. Contact support. 
“ If you get a “Failed” or “Unable to recognize card information” message while setting up your payment method, you can try again.  After a second attempt, we won’t be able to use that card for your transaction. Please try another card”
Can I respond to the support email with a question? No. Fail fail fail. Do I have an unlimited supply of cards? No. Would I prefer to use a Privacy card? Yes. Don’t make the service rely on a single point of failure.",2
1389,"Loved it until Let Go was added on: Had issues recently with scammers, multiple accounts and exact same posts. I remember it would remove my posts if the two posts matched but now I’m seeing a lot of scam posts 

Now onto Let Go.  Let go has always been one of those apps that people just don’t seem to respond on. Now half of the posts I reach out to never respond.  Maybe more than half. Hope these old accounts can be removed or maybe they can add a “did the item sell yet” to remove old posts that aren’t replied to.  Something.... this is just not the same thing, I end up going to the Facebook market or Craigslist again since half of these don’t reply.",2
1390,Needs much improvement: One of the biggest issues I have is loading new items. It takes forever for me to post anything! And if it’s not taking forever it doesn’t upload at all and always says there is an error. What’s the error and why doesn’t it get fixed. When it does work it can be great and very useful. But unfortunately that’s not the case most of the time. Also there should be a way to filter out those that waste others time with low ball offers. It’s an issue for me because everything I sell is brand new and I sell it usually 50% off or more than what one would pay at the retail stores. Overall app just needs much improvements.,3
1391,"Absorbed and Scrapped Superior Platform :(: Offer up just merged with “Let Go” and aside from using Let go and Facebook Market I would rarely use “Offer Up” mainly because there interface was less appealing and way fewer products in my area.  I’m a little upset that they chose the inferior of the two apps as their platform. “Offer Up’s” app is too convoluted with crap I don’t want to see when I search and I hate that I can’t see the pricing. I’m not old by any means and my nearsightedness if perfect, but squinting and scrolling is lame. The way they present their ads takes away from the aesthetics making feel like I’m in the middle of a spam site. I hope they revamp and or scrap this platform. Until then good luck. I use to check “Let go” daily and “offer up” weekly, now I’m considering deleting the app all together.",1
1392,Waste of time with super dishonest peoples: People are rough and disrespectful.  They send messages and do not respond afterwards.  They give appointments and do not show themselves .. of course without warning even when they confirm 30 min before !!  and moreover they spend their time asking prices even on $ 5 !!  they are wasting time !!  they want quality at $ 1 and when we offer low prices they are not interested because there is nothing to bargain .... welll !!  We fall 90% of the time on dishonest people without counting the countless number of false profiles who try to hack us or make scams !!!!  very disappointed impossible to find a good plan to sell in a good atmosphere !!!  When the application it would be nice to be able to target more precisely areas of sales and purchases !!!,1
1393,"It used to be good: I got some good use out of this app but I’ve been having some issues with it recently. It wasn’t updating or maybe displaying information for listed products which led to incredibly stupid people arguing with me over pricing and such. It’s turning into Craigslist. People think they can low ball your pricing and then tell you you’re wrong for saying no, justify it with “Its offer up I can ask for any price I want.” Not quite. That’s why there is a firm on price button (which doesn’t seem to ever display). 

This app isn’t worth the time or trouble anymore. Garage/Yard sale hunting is more exciting than this. 

Also as of April 2020 and this general time why is Offer Up allowing in person sales to occur? People are supposed to be quarantined.",2
1394,"Businesses Stay AWAY: We have been paying offer up $30/month for being able to “boost” a single one of our posts at a time. 

Let me tell you this, if you are a business, you will be better off at Facebook. If you use OfferUp, stick to the free version. They’re monthly single boost plan is a scam. They post a very small thumbnail of your listing until it “reaches” 10-20% more people than it normally would and then they take your listing down. We have just been paying for over a year now and during the whole year we probably sold 2-3 cars from offer up. They were also the ones that we did not boost. It’s pathetic, might just delete the app and download it again if I feel like I need a laugh. Stay away from this app, save yourself some time and money and go straight to Facebook.",1
1395,"Great App, Horrible Customer Service: The only reason why I’m not doing 1 star is because the app is actually really easy to use, and most of the people on it a really decent. However, the customer service is horrendous. After putting in a request, it took almost 3 FULL WEEKS to get any type of response back. The only reason why customer service even did anything was because I had to send. ANOTHER request for the original request. Honestly, it’s been a real pain with them. The treasure hunt I had to go on to actually find a way to contact support was something else too. If it hadn’t been for that, I probably would’ve given 5 stars. If problems like this are fixed in the near future, I’d be more than happy to readjust the review.",2
1396,Disappointed with support: I have been using OfferUp for about 2 years and it’s a pretty good platform to sell/buy as long as you don’t encounter technical issues.  I agree with the previous reviewer and his challenges and lack of offerup’s support resolution.  I decided to test the shipping feature by posting one time.  I ran into an issue setting up deposit account and and it’s been over 3 days. Answering several support staff and explaining the issue and always get a copy and paste from their help screen.  I follow every suggestion including deleting and reinstalling the app.  No solution yet.   Very frustrating and unless resolved this week I don’t intend to use their shipping option for selling.,3
1397,Shipping feature: The new shipping feature is extremely annoying !! For one their should be an option for us the BUYERS to select wether or not we want to view items that are available to ship. Also half the time a buyer doesn’t fully realize they had the shipping feature on when they post an item so the item actually isn’t available to ship. I open OfferUp and it’s full of deals from all around the world because of this feature. I really just want to see local deals only and I’m now annoyed by this feature that I feel wasn’t launched correctly to make sure it runs smoothly and everyone has options on what they would like to view.,3
1398,"Scammer’s delight: This app doesn’t let you alter reviews you’ve made of a seller if you have issues or find out later that an item is defective. You can “report” the person but it doesn’t do anything, the girl who scammed me’s profile is still going strong. Offerup provides no protection or consequences from fraud. People show up without the money you agreed on, give you fake money, incomplete and defective products, etc. Garbage app and open opportunity for people to take advantage of you. Above all complaints, a person should be able to change their review on a scamming seller to provide a better experience for other users that may come across the person. After this (Offerup showing they don’t care whatsoever if you get scammed by a junkie stealing her family’s furniture) I am switching to Letgo and Craigslist.",1
1399,"What A Joke!!!!: When I first downloaded this app, I found it to be AMAZING!!! I could sell items quicker than I could anywhere else. NOW.... they tell you to pay them a certain amount to expand the buyers market for you. Now, you don’t have to pay this if you don’t want to, which is a crock of _______! 
I tried selling a great conditioned 32” TV for $70 and not once got an offer nor anyone asking me to lower the cost. Now, I have this same tv for sale for $40 and still not a soul asking for it?  Back when this app first came out, you could sell a used tooth brush for $3 and get someone to at least ask you, “will you drop the price a bit?” Nope, not a single person says anything which makes me think that you HAVE to pay them to get anything sold. Seems to me that they’re holding our items for ransom.",1
1400,"Great For the Most Part: Pros:  Easy to use app and enough ppl use it that if you're looking for something odds are you'll find it. 

Cons:  Beware the retail ppl using the app for their business. They will not accept Offers and they may even change the price higher once they bait you in and say it's higher ""because of the response"" to try to get you to pay more..there's no way to report this con system currently. Also in general the report system is kind of meh. You can only report or rate someone once you purchase from them so there are some shady ppl to watch out for.",5
1401,"This app is garbage!: This app is garbage! I am floored at how terrible this app is! Do you have monkeys developing this app? No. Monkeys would probably do a better job. Maybe it was good at one point but the people who handle it now are actually incompetent. The app is incredibly glitchy, there is no way to block despite what the help section says so I just get to enjoy being harassed, I’ve had someone else’s listings suddenly show up in my account, customer service just copy and pasted their “helpful” messages, and various other incredibly ridiculous glitches. Not to mention the about of actual human trash that exists on this sight. Everyone is flaky, uneducated, and rude that can’t even speak English as well as a 3rd grader. Stay away from this app at all costs! It makes Craigslist look like a freaking high class site.",1
1402,"Great app! Some suggestions...: This is a great app/service which is why I am giving a 5 star rating, but I have some suggestions that I believe will improve the overall usability of the app:

1. After I have marked an item as sold, move it into its own section or remove it from the list entirely. I only want to see my sales that are active and the sold items in-line are distracting.
2. Similarly, move my conversations for sold items into their own section, or auto-hide them.
3. The iOS Messages app is the gold standard for messengers on iOS, so your messenger should try to imitate this in every way possible. Specifically, if I am the last person to send a message, the preview should show my message and not my recipient's last message. Also, if I begin composing a message, then back out to the conversations list, my draft should still be visible when I return.

Otherwise, I love the app and will continue to use in the future. Thanks!",5
1403,"Decent app: I like offer up & how easy it makes to sell things, my problem is with how much of your time people waste. I believe if you trying to buy something, you should be willing to travel but people want everything on THEIR time or they throw a fit. If I’m buying something, I will travel to that person because I think that’s only fair. I think there should be some sort of rule maybe? Wondering if anyone else feels this frustration. I have tried meeting up with people who want to buy something & they either make me drive around to multiple cities to cancel or not show up so that is why I believe if you want to buy something, you should be making that effort.",3
1404,"Fast way to sell all your unwanted items !: I have been using offer up for about two years now and it always helps me get rid of my unwanted items in a decent time. I’m not too sure how the algorithm works with how often your items are seen on the feed but if Offer Up could incorporate some type of boost method to bring your items to the top of the list for more views that would be even better! I don’t want to pay for boosts when I’m selling things for money in the first place. Other than that it’s a reliable, safe way to sell of your stuff!",5
1405,"Crashes and network errors: I have an iPhone 6 Plus. I enjoy the app but when you’re communicating a sale via the app and you go back in to reply or check your messages and get a “network error retry”message over and over again, It’s quite frustrating.  And you lose the opportunity to make a sale. I have contacted support,  I have deleted and reinstalled the app. I still more than occasionally will get these errors at the worst possible time. 
I give my phone number to my buyer now because of this issue. Yet I will receive a message from offer up about safety issues, LOL.
At least I have an open line of communication with my buyer and don’t have to rely on the app.",3
1406,"Scary: I had a scary experience with a buyer. I suspected they kept using different screen names to give low ball offers on my item. They got impatient that I didn’t respond in just HALF an hour of their latest name’s offer and said something to the effect of, “you know, [my first name], @&!$ you! And you @&$!ing item.” It’s very unsettling having a stranger blow up for no reason who knows my first name, that I’m female, and my approximate location. I filed a complaint and heard NOTHING from customer service. I ended up deleting my account and selected the option that I felt unsafe. I am annoyed that Offer Up didn’t say how they handled this situation. I’m thankful that I didn’t meet up with this crazy guy. I get that there are weirdos out there and I have a responsibility to keep myself safe, but I’d like to know that Offer Up tries to weed them out.",1
1407,Lots of scams watch out!!: At first I was enjoying this app a nice way to make a little chump change and get rid of the things I no longer wanted intill I started encountering alicea t of fraudulently deal and to make it worst offer up didn’t have my back when I reported it to them I spent about a week trying to access my account and keeled getting denied the most recent thing I notice on the app is they now want u to pay to promote your own items that may be ok for some because t before they would do it with out charging people here come the best part they take away from your sale by advertising the same item your selling by posting adds that show what your selling at say Walmart making you compete with retails stores taking away business from you if you don’t choose to pay the promotion fees,1
1408,"O.F.F.E.R.U.P.: I didn’t 💭 I’d like this app. r trusted it whatsoever when it was 1st recommended 2 me by my cousin. But after several months of using it, I can honestly say I really enjoy it. It has any/everything ur 👀 4 & has some of the gr8’est deals out there. I like that u can shop locally r nationwide. The sellers have been honest & forthright so far & any issues I’ve reported (which have been minimal, if any) have been taken care of in a timely manner. I recommend this app. 4 any1 👀 4 a gr8 deal & sellers 👀 2 get rid of unwanted items or 👀 2 make some quick💰💴💵..!!!! 

Gr8 job..!!!!",5
1409,Very bad!: I’ve had an account since 2019. Since June I have been trying to buy a certain item and the 15-20 people who are selling it only 2 of them have responded. I feel like the app doesn’t actually send your messages to some people? For example one of the people I messaged it said they were active in the last day and posted a new item a few days ago. But no response to my messages or even my offer for their asking price. I tried contacting offer up support but they only sent a generic response. I feel like many of the reviews are fake too. There is no way this app is currently 5 stars when I can’t even get a response to a message let alone buy something.,2
1410,"Why so many old posts?: I wonder why there are so many old post that need to be taken down. People do not respond to you. Some post on here or one year to year three years and longer feet people don’t seem to care. How come offer up can’t take these post down or put a limit on the post? I contacted support about this, but no one answers me about it either. I wonder if there is even an offer up support. It would just be nice to get rid of all the junk you post to clean up the website and make it easier for everyone. Thank you for your time .mytruckPerry.",4
1411,"Charges you to post items now: This was a great place to list items for sale, I’ve used the app for years happily but now I’ll be using this much less. It only allows a small amount of free posts then Starts To Charge you to list each item after you run out of free posts. That is incredibly inconvenient especially considering not all posts are successfully sold on this app. So you have to pay to post on here and that doesn’t necessarily promise you’ll sell your item - so you pay for nothing. This new feature has to be removed because that’s ridiculous. I STRONGLY suggest using the 5miles app as it allows you to list unlimited times for free and there are tons of buyers/sellers active. OfferUp isn’t it anymore with all these charges just to post.",1
1412,Promotion issue: I love this app I pay $20/month for the promotion perk however it doesn’t allow me to put it in some of my items. I would be happy to sell my items faster that’s why I’m paying $20 but the app doesn’t even give me the option to promote my other items I have for sale. And then I noticed that after I sold the item that was promoted the promotion is suppose to automatically go to the next high priced item from your listing and it this time it didn’t and I had to cancel the $20/month subscription because of that it’s so unfortunate about this app,4
1413,"Used just for ad revenue: The way this app slams ads on the user is just horrible. You can’t navigate without seeing endless ads for things that you might want that bait you into clicking them which takes you to a different app or website. For example I clicked on an Xbox console when I first got the app that was for sale and I see nonstop ads for Xbox devices nonstop. And it’s not like one or two ads per page, it’s much more. Its sometimes very hard to tell the difference between an ad and a real seller unless you have eagle vision and can see the little words that say “ad” below the image. No ad blocker or nothing too which is just sad. I really wish these guys never created this app and just left LetGo the way it was, LetGo was sooooooo much better.",1
1414,"Is anyone ACTUALLY selling anything?: I have spent my free time attempting to message sellers on the app SIMPLY TO SEE if they would respond. After a month of doing this, could you believe I yielded ZERO responses.  For some sellers I would message them more than once regarding a different item than an initial message and nothing! There must be some form of punishment for lack of communication. I whole heartedly believe a seller should have the right to or not to sell, but I believe that should be based off of communication. I can’t get far enough to even have disagreements, there’s simply no communication. Why would I not bring my business to EBay, or Goat, or StockX, or the Facebook Market. No one on this application actually responds.",2
1415,BEWARE!! Scammers & horrible customer service.: For the most part this app is amazing and has helped me get rid of things easily and find awesome random treasures. But almost half of the people on here are like hackers or something just trying to get you to provide credit card info and other personal info so they can “send you free stuff.” (It’s nauseating & disturbing) My biggest strife with this app however is that for no apparent reason at all my account was deactivated and I lost a deal on a present I had been searching tirelessly for to get my son for Christmas. Now I’m completely locked out of the app when I did absolutely nothing wrong and did in fact really enjoy connecting with my community and finding sweet bargains. I’m so extremely upset and disappointed!!,1
1416,"Not horrible but not great.: I loved Letgo because it was easy to find deals, you could set preferences and they’d stick, and it was easy to know if something was still available. OfferUp on the other hand is the worst qualities of Letgo. It’s painful to look through the app or list items because even though you can see the chats easily. It get’s annoying to find something you like. Especially when some of the listings are 4+ years old.

In order for the app to be improved here’s my suggestions:

Either stop trying to sell item’s shipped, or allow the user to select whether they’re on the app for shipping, local pick up, or both. I know it’s there already, but I don’t want to have to set the distance and local pick up only each time I use the app. 

Next make it easier to view the thing's I’ve saved. I don’t need multiple, or if they’re there make it automatic to one spot and I can move it later. 

Lastly find a way to keep listings fresh. Make sure that sellers are responsive. It’s the worst thing ever to find something cool and it was posted years ago. Listings should expire not sit until removed.",1
1417,"1 on 1 support is not existent.: I purchased an item that was shipped and the user deactivated their account. My funds are still being held and after trying to file a ‘claim’ multiple times, the link that is emailed to me to submit the claim doesn’t work every time. When I tried finding an email or phone number to contact someone to get actual help, the web page states that ‘this page cannot be found.’ I love the platform but the amount of scammers on here and the hoops legitimate buyers/seller have to jump through to file a claim is getting really bad.

Be aware that if you purchase something that’s being shipped, you’re gambling, never use another method of payment outside of what’s offered from the app. That is a key sign of a scammer.",1
1418,"Thanks for all but rendering the ap useless: First the “peek” function goes away awhile back. That was really handy and make looking at posts quicker when looking for something specific. 
This newest version is just sloppy. If I searched for an item for a friend a year ago, I don’t need to have similar items fed to me. 
Likewise the category header that were just inserted are, at best, a nuisance. There should be an option to turn it on. Most people I have talked to preferred the old way. 
Personally, I like to “cruise” and just look around. I find a lot of what I buy that way. Not looking for anything specific. 
The ads. Oh where to start on the ads. Many of them are just plain inappropriate. Others are vulgar. I personally think it is wierd that I cannot post rifle scope but I see ads for them. Can’t sell vape products, but there are ads for them. 
Also, make it a preset preference to whether or not you want to seach “shipping”, “pickup” or both. There are many users who will not have anything shipped. Just too much risk.",3
1419,"Scammers: This used to be a decent app, and it works well if you are meeting in person for the transaction. However, if you are purchasing an item that needs to be shipped to you it seems every seller is a scammer. I have tried to purchase the same item through 6 different sellers and each time the seller said they want to ship through fedex and wants me to cashapp them the money. They have a number of different excuses for not going through the app, but they all result in the same outcome, trying to get me to send them money through another application which doesn’t have any form of a buyer guarantee. It’s a shame because I used to use OfferUp a lot, but it has gone completely downhill.",2
1420,"Love OfferUp!: I started this app in the year 2014 and I have been a member ever since. I’ve sold so many things from, furniture, brand name purses, shoes, jewelry, phones and the list goes on. I’ve also purchased a few things from other sellers and I was never disappointed. The best thing about OfferUp is not only do you meet nice people but, you also get nice ratings from your customers. So far I’ve earned thirty two stars and still going. I’m a very nice person and I like to negotiate prices and many people love that about me. So, OfferUp here’s to you “CHEERS!”
Keep up the good work with OfferUp! Love you, guys. ;)

1421,"Customer service trash: I have been locked out of my account for going on 3 weeks without aid. The only reason I use offer up is because I have such have reviews on it and had it for years so it’s easier to sell things up there. But at this point “f” offer up and delete my profile. Jade from customer service, trash too. If this how customer service is. Then I won’t do service with it. I paid for my listing to have views too just to end up locked out over an old phone number at which they won’t let me update. I changed the password with my email and still have to deal with the phone lock out. Either OfferUp is going to delete the profile or I will do it by other means. There should be account recovery options that work.",1
1422,"OfferUp Search Engine: Much more difficult to navigating and search than CL. Laptop browsing is frustrating. Can’t search after selecting categories, annoyingly resets to default search ( defaults to include shipping rather than pickup as selected) after search item change on Chrome. Manages to retain other filters. Don’t even try it with Safari. Nightmare
Ads are a mine field. No attempt to improve since my last review except, at least on chrome browser (maybe others) listings are on a grid rather than scattered making it easier the browse. 
There needs to be an expiration date too. Listings that are irrelevant are abundant.",3
1423,"Fake ads: Overall, I’m happy with the app. It is what is, and I’ve only been burned once because I didn’t test the item before I paid. That’s my fault. Could’ve happened at a garage sale or flea market too. 

The only thing that bothers me is the blatantly obvious scams for vehicles. Every single one is the exact same price and every single one has a .Gmail address in the description that they want you to go to. They use symbols or graphics to spell out a gmail address to get past the algorithm. Is it that hard for the system to filter out anything that’s not text or numbers?",4
1424,"Horrible app! horrible buyers! Move on!: TERRIBLE! Forget about it, sell somewhere else! Offerup used to be my to go app for selling stuff, but it has gone downhill to the rock bottom ever since. There are constant bugs that prevent you to list anything. They don’t care if half of the buyers are scammers. People constantly bail last minute even I arrive to the location. When you report them, offerup never does anything to their accounts. Buyer’s rating does not do ANYTHING anymore. 100+ 5 stars verified account? They still bail on you and there is NOTHING you can do. You can’t leave a BAD review unless you sell the item. What a waste of time to sell on here. Also, their paid promotion is useless, it doesn’t boost your exposure rate at all. Save your money and move on.",1
1425,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE: I give up. This app has been more than a hassle now. Time and time again my account continues to get this disabled for no reason. I’ve tried SEVERAL TIMES to get the issues taken care of and they continue to block my account with no reasoning what so ever. There so called “customer support” team is horrible and all I ever get is automated emails. At one point I was able to get an email back from “Brandon Senior Payment Specialist” and he was able to get me back up and then without me even being on for 2 hours my account gets disabled again! Since then I’ve reached back out to him several times and I GET BACK NOTHING! I am beyond frustrated and this is really sad because I’ve been using this app for years but seems that it’s finally time to part ways and move on over to 5 mile app!,1

Please look into my account to fix this problem so I can message and receive messages like I used to on let go!!! How many times do I need to ask you it’s been 3 years all I want is let go back without offer up so I can purchase things again!!! How long do I need to wait so offer up can fix this issue it’s been tooo long!!!,5
1427,"Bring back LetGo. Offer up ruined it: Worst App Ever! I used to use LetGo all the time, multiple times a day buying and selling things LOCALLY. Now every time I go on I get stuff coming up all over the country even if I select the Pick Up tab, never had that issue on LetGo. Secondly there’s items posted “Over 1 year ago”. I send a message and of course no response. There should be some way to maybe put a limit on things being sold, maybe they expire after so long with an option to repost if you still have it. Oh Wait LetGo had that.  Iv had ZERO luck posting or finding anything on this app since being forced to download it when they merged. Even trying to communicate with people is a hassle.  Defiantly a shame to loose a good platform like LetGo. Guess it’s back to Craigslist because this is unbearable.",1
1428,"Didn’t want letgo to merge.: Offer up needs a lot of work. First off if you want to find what’s closest you have to pick closest or newest. It can’t be close and new so when I want to see things in my city I’m seeing stuff from years ago first. But if I pick newest it’s showing me stuff 2 hours away. Second. There is no easy to way to refresh your ads to move them to the top again like let go offered. You have to delete all the sales and redo them to get them at top of any chart to be seen. Third, when I was forced to merge my items on letgo not one was transferred with my account . I had to start all over and take the pics, description, the whole lot. If I don’t make any sales this next month it’s getting deleted.",2
1429,"Tons of ads and inactive listings.: I am reading the latest reviews. It looks like I am not alone. As a former letgo user I just can’t stand OfferUp.  I really tried. First of all, search function is not very useful. For example searching by a MacBook model number gave me nothing. If I sort by distance I got three years old listings. If I sort by date I got out-of-state listings. This just doesn’t work. Secondly, too many ads and this really affects user experiences. Thirdly, why there are so many “dead” listings and inactive users in there. What’s going on!!! Letgo was so much better. I remember letgo will automatically close your account if you are inactive for a year. I give up. Now I am going back to Craigslist even though I hate doing these things on computers.   Sorry. Bye bye OfferUp.",1
1430,"Home Front for Criminals: 1/5 stars doesn’t justify enough how FRAUDULENT this app is! The worst online purchasing app I’ve ever used. 

Most sellers never respond to your messages. Worst of all, the sellers who do respond want to scam you! I paid a seller for a price that seemed too good to pass up. The seller lied about shipping my product, and still has not given me a refund! They have resorted to ghosting my messages before & after reporting their account for scamming me. Then, they changed their profile name - most likely to scam someone else. I got played and wished buyers had warning signs beforehand. 

I encourage everyone to STAY AWAY FROM OFFERUP! The CEO should be imprisoned for allowing this fraudulent behavior to transpire. There are other safe, reliable and credible apps to choose. Please choose safely! 🙏",1
1431,"Rating system is rigged: I had 5 stars rated for 2 years and then some sellers just decided to give me bad review. I contacted OfferUp for help and they said:
""After a rating has gone through, it cannot be changed.  

I have checked the interaction with the last seller who left you a rating. I understand that the item was not sold to you but it is possible that the seller has given the rating to you by mistake since you were one of the last individuals to have asked the item's availability.

We are always working on improving our product and the interface and should we have a feature to reverse user ratings in the future, all of our users will be notified.""

So anyone can give rate you even though you didn't buy the item. This is an unfair system to some serious people that want to do business through OfferUp. 
I wouldn't recommend this app if you want to sell something and expect to get good feedback.",5
1432,"No help with simple mistake: I listed about 5 basic (not illegal) pocket knives for sale all within minutes of each other. I didn’t realize it was against offerup policy until I got the notification. My mistake, I figured I’ll just delete all the listings. Then I got another notification and another then was banned. All with minutes. I guess the algorithm figured I was ignoring the warnings and it banned me. I didn’t get a chance to fix anything. I emailed support and they said there’s nothing I can do. Can’t create a new account because my phones IP or MAC (not sure) is banned. All this silliness over some little pocket knives.

*EDIT* they finally got backed to me and fixed it. They let me have my account back.

*EDIT* didn’t last long I got banned again before I got a chance to use the app. Frustrating",1
1433,"Great but BECAREFUL: I have over 100 plus sales and around 60 purchases and let me tell you before you start selling on here please do not meet up at night but if you must meet at the nearest police station because there are people on the app who will rob you or drive off with your items , thankfully its never happened to me ( ive had a few close calls ) and know people who have been robbed . Please do not ever meet at your home or someone else’s especially apartments , in the day meet at a very public area such as a mall or a walmart and in the night if you must the only place i would recommend would be the police station ,",4
1434,Used to be good: I used to love offer up. I loved the fact that you can go onto app in your local area and find what you wanted. Now since all the updates I do not use it anymore. Now you have all these companies advertising on there and sending you to other sites when you click on it. If I wanted to deal with a business I would. And the shipping thing is a joke as well. If you choose the option for pickup only all I get is shipping areas. There’s a reason why I used to use it and that’s because I could get anything in my area. Now I can’t even block out the shipping areas and when I try and make an offer on something they want my card. WTH is that all about. Used to not be like that. I will never use the app again.,2
1435,I’m Getting Nowhere: I have had nothing but problems on this app. I downloaded it 2 days ago trying to find a Nintendo Switch and in that time I have messages at least a dozen people but only a few have responded. There seems to be a lot of scamming with sellers promising a whole lot for very little cost. The first seller that answered me back didn’t acknowledge my offer through the Apple and kept asking if I had Apple or google pay. I don’t understand why sellers won’t respond back because if they did I would buy their product right away. And some sellers I make an offer without even waiting for their response to my message but the offer sits there for hours. I’m getting frustrated with the lack of communication. Every other app that I have tried like this has been much better.,1
1436,"Good but could be even better...: If only there were a way to save your photos from each listing (if you took them while uploading photos for the item). After a designated period of time, say a week or so, it’d be nice to have the option of reposting (so that your listing is refreshed and comes up at the top of most recent items).

Otherwise, I love this app! Sure, people are flakes and there’s a ton of window shoppers and extra-low lowballers, but this app is set up so well. Major props to the devs. I’ve been recommending it to all my friends and family. This one is a keeper.",5
1437,"Great but needs some enhancements: I use this app the most; however some things that need tweaking for ease of use for the buyer. 
1) can you you preview the prices so that you don’t have to open the picture to see the cost ?  Let it go does this very well! 
2) can you make deleting for the main quick save folder easier? By adding a function to delete all items saved or by being able to select multiple listings to delete ? Instead of having to go one by one and open each listing to un-heart the listing !! Please  this is very frustrating to those of us that use it a lot! 

Thank you:)",4
1438,"Do NOT TRUST the ratings: The use of app is good. However, the service of the application leaves little to be desired. They cancel transactions on behalf of the seller and make it appear that the seller cancelled when in fact OfferUp cancelled due to the delay in shipping by the seller. That causes a war or words between seller and buyer.

 In turn the clients are not held to a high set of standards because we cannot rate each other unless the transaction is finalized.  So, there is no accountability on either side for pre and post sell or purchase of an item. The seller can do whatever they want and no negative rating is reported unless the transaction is complete. The star ratings are BOGUS because they do not reflect the negative transactions.",3
1439,What’s up with all the spam accounts: I recently had offer up but I had to delete the app because of the spam accounts that are on the app were getting too much. Every message I got about someone wanting to buy my products was someone saying “please send a picture to such and such email at gmail to “someone’s” name for purchase.” I would then click on the account and found it was not verified and no picture. I would report it as a spam account and that’s all the use I got from the app. I did have this app and used it a few years ago and had great success so I thought it would be a great way to sell some of my furniture and decor items again. Deleted and will not download again unless spam accounts are gone.,2
1440,"Love the app/technical help could improve: I absolutely love using this app! It is so convenient. I’ve had great success buying and selling on it. 
My only complaint is that when there are technical difficulties, there isn’t much follow up (other than the auto message that says they have received your request). It would be nice to have a 1-800# or something when the email for technical support doesn’t seem to be working. 
Other than this, I love the app. 
Hopefully I will get a response from the OfferUp team to help with my technical issue so I can continue using the app.",5
1441,"Great app for buying locally but…: I’ve been with OfferUp for a long time now and I love it. It’s easy to use and I like being able to buy or sell within a certain area. Recently, the developers are adding many ads based on what you’re looking for or selling. If I want to buy department store items I would check out the department stores not offer up which is supposed to be buying and selling from homeowners locally. I don’t know how many times I accidentally hit an ad instead of an item I’m looking for. It’s frustrating because that it takes me to my web browser. My advice is to leave what’s working alone and not to change it into something it shouldn’t be.",3
1442,"Total Waste of Time!!!: This app is absolutely horrible for a person who wants to sell their belongings!
It is bombarded with internet trolls, scammers and fakes. Great concept to sell stuff over an app, but terrible execution on OfferUp's staff end!
My whole experience with using this app was a total huge waste of time. The trolls come on, dime you down significantly, you come to an agreement on a price, but then they either completely stop texting back and end communication or you agree on meeting and they leave you hanging and hanging. This happened about 10 times to me in 1 week! 
I emailed the lazy and incompetent staff at OfferUp numerous times to see how they can eliminate trolls like this from messing with a seller, but they never reply or fix anything. So they are as useless as this app.
So, if you enjoy taking numerous pics of your stuff, typing in a description of it and having endless internet scammers and trolls contact you just to dime you down and then never execute on buying your stuff, this is the app for you. Otherwise, avoid this app like the plague. You will only be frustrated and waste hours upon hours of your time.
Zero stars for this waste of an app if it was possible to give.",1
1443,"I enjoy this app but....: I enjoy using this app however the one thing that makes me not rate this app a 5 star is that they don't allow you to delete or remove an item that you might of realized you don't want to sell anymore.!! You should be able to delete an item you don't want to sell. Also drives me crazy that I can't get rid of any of the old messages!! So unnecessary, if anything they should have a backup of all that goes down in the app in case of theft or fraudulent cases. Other than that, I find this app very useful and helps save money on things that can be very expensive when bought new in store. Will update my rating if they change those things on app.",3
1444,Review: The App is great. People selling items don’t respond to emails or messages sometimes. Sometimes they don’t respond at all. It leaves a potential buyer wondering if the item has been sold or is a in the process of a possible transaction??  Maybe to improve the App add a service showing the seller is in the process of selling the item?  I don’t know how shipping works on this App. I don’t trust buying items out of driving distance. I’m not sure about scamming on this App?  Maybe need more protective measures to protect both sellers n buyers.,5
1445,"Forced to write a review: I don’t used offer up very much. And every time I do I am reminded of why I don’t use you app as much as others. 
   Yesterday I posted an ad. The first responder set up appointment to purchase today. I believe he will meet me at 11 and purchase. He is to leave a message after he leaves his High School teaching job at 10:20 to let me know he is on the way.
But your app keeps wanting me to write a review before I can actually get on the app. Of course there where no messages at 10:15 when I went to look",5
1446,"No respect for user privacy: I love this app and use it regularly, however I have had to turn off all notifications cause of one dumb feature. They purposely lump messages and recommendations into the same tab/category. So you can’t leave your notifications on for messages without them sending you alerts and notifications about new stuff for sale that usually is not even relevant to my buying preferences. Once they fix that, and give us the ability to turn off recommendations or at least notifications for suggestions, all notifications are off Update: they have added more ads and more ways to annoy you with recommendations. Update 2: came back to make sure my review was still here, app is still terrible.",1
1447,"Great Marketplace, Horrible Ads: I used to like this app a lot more. You have great pictures you can see for items that you're searching for in the marketplace, but they started advertising aggressively to the point where they completely take over the screen of your app and you have no control and have to look at the ad for a certain amount of seconds before you can have control of the app again. Absolutely disgusting and not a creative way to monetize. I have used OfferUp much less lately because of the hostile ad takeover, and may just forgo using them at all in place of something like Facebook marketplace.",3
1448,"Over the top monetizing attempts: Don’t begrudge anyone monetizing a site but sadly Offer Up has just taken it too far. Every little thing, every approximately third listing  you click on you have to wait for an ad to finish. Rarely use it anymore- it’s almost childishly done at this point.
Another huge miss is not being able to maintain preferences- I will NEVER pay shipping on something. If I set a 30 mile radius- let me keep that every time I do log in. Nope. “30 miles + shipping” defaults. Don’t tell, let me guess: OfferUp makes $ on shipping? More eyeballs on their ads if it includes the shipping listings?

Frustrating. Used to be the best app of its kind. Now sadly it’s been ruined. Greedy. Short-sighted.",2
1449,Amazing App. Beware of Scammers!!!: This app is already super great but a huge drawback is not being able to identify people who are fraudulently selling items or scamming people entirely! I tried to purchase a Calculator and a lot of people prefer a payment method outside of OfferUp‘s payment system because of offer ups fees and it makes sense but this is how I got scammed so many times. Offer up team please verify and add that verified badge or something. Or at least be able to contact people by email or phone because this app is also a crime central.,5
1450,Old Ads: Like the app for what it is. Easy way to sell and buy things. The most upsetting thing about it is a) the people that used it that lack the pics and description of the things they’re selling and b) old ads. What I mean by that is that I’ve bought a few vehicles from here but it pretty annoying that ads from years ago are still up on the site. Makes no sense. There should be some kind of monitoring of that. Send those people an email asking if the ad is still good if not take it down for them. It’s a bit frustrating when you’re looking for something and think you’ve found it only to find out the ad is 4yo. Please fix this. Thank you.,2
1451,"Don’t waste your time downloading this, you only wind up deleting t: UPDATE: decided to give it one last try so I deleted the app, restarted my phone, and downloaded the app again. I wasn’t even logged in and it gave me phantom notifications. This app is trash.

This app always has glitches and problems. And Don’t bother contacting customer service, they’ll either ignore you or they’ll send you a copy-and-paste reply that has nothing to do with your issue! It’s the slowest app you’ll find on any phone and people rarely purchase anything on it. I think they just make money off of the corporate ads. Now you get phantom notifications (the app shows that you have messages but you don’t). I just deleted it off my phone, it’s a waste of space.",1
1452,"Love OfferUp But, Intrusive Ads Are Ruining The Experience: I absolutely love OfferUp and shop on it very frequently. However, after the most recent updates introducing ads, it feels more like a cheap foreign app from overseas made to overdose you in intrusive ads than anything else. 

I’m all for apps having ads, especially free ones since developers need to eat and survive - but I do think ads could have been done much more tastefully. 

The ads are literally everywhere in the app and just like those annoying games that never match their social media commercials, you’re force an ad after almost every action in the app now. 

Instagram had ads, so does Facebook and etc - yet we barely even notice them because they are not forced down our throats in a highly intrusive manner or unnecessary quantity. 

It feels like these ads were forced in by investors or individuals without a sense of user experience and I highly think the team should let the professionals in UX brainstorm a better way in which OfferUp can have ads, make great revenue, and not totally obliterate the user experience we have all come to know and love.",1
1453,"Unbelievably aggressive advertisements!: I’m not sure if this is a new update or something, but whenever you scroll more then a few frames a giant ad that takes over the whole screen unless you close it! And that’s not including the ad they already place in between listings every few scrolls. I get that an app needs ad revenue to make money but it always baffles me when companies make decisions that drive users away from their own app. Honestly, do any OfferUp employees actually enjoy using the app this way? I no longer use offer up as a result of the incredibly intrusive ads, and I assume I’m not the only one. If you get more money from ads but drive people away from your app as a result, are you actually making more money in the long term?",1
1454,"Customer support is weak: I paid $20 for the premium subscription to this app, because I was in need of selling my e-bike to help pay for Christmas this year. I was charged but never got access to the premium ad promotion feature. Contacted customer support and they said I had two accounts, which was news to me. So they disabled one. The one that had high reviews and the most history. And apparently the account they disabled also had the premium subscription. 

So even though my support ticket was pleading for help because I really needed to sell this ebike, and I need access to the premium features I was charged for or a refund. Their response left me with this account that has no activity and no promotion features, and no refund.  Thanks. Merry Christmas.",1
1455,"Obnoxious. Update: also garbage: The sheer quantity of lowball offers on this app is insane. Even if you lock price and say you won't go any lower you still get offers of like $20 on a $300 listing. People trying to scam by gaslighting what a new price is isn't reportable apparently so even if you report someone to block them, it just lets them continue bothering other people. This doesn't happen to this degree on other apps. Additionally, there are too many ads that completely bring you out of the app if you even breathe on them, wasting time. Also, there are a lot of scambots

Update: I wanted to update approximately 15 items on my profile. In updating these 15 items, the app froze, crashed or refused to swap screens 49 TIMES. FOURTY NINE TIMES. Honestly ridiculously garbage app",1
1456,"Improvement needed: I’ve been using this app for several weeks now and I can’t get notifications.  I have my phone set to receive them, and the only notifications I can toggle to “on” in the app are for search alerts, highlights and deals, item recommendations, and news from sellers.  I do not get a notification if I have a message in my inbox.  This is especially important when it’s about something I’m trying to sell.  Very frustrating.

The app also takes a long time to load.

Otherwise, it seems like a great app; although I haven’t used it yet for shipping anything.  I’m hoping it’s better than eBay.",3
1457,"Dont count on it, they block your posts for no reason.: I used it for a year, had good reviews on purchases and sells and they blocked my posts for no reason and no notification. Just one day, i posted a couple item and they show as posted but when you try to look for them, they won’t be there. Looking in your account settings for item currently posted with show zero. Email them about this and you get an automated email back saying they are looking into it but nothing ever happens and they don’t respond anymore. I had to look online to see other people having the same problem assuming they are shadow banned from a complain from a competitor seller. If this is their business practice then it’s not worth your time.",1
1458,"New update is no good: I’ve been using Offer up for years and it’s been great for the most part, but the new update has really messed up the app. Nothing works anymore, takes forever to load, text is so grayed out that the watermark behind it is darker. (In the search bar) 
Other functions no longer working
I’ve edited my review to 4 stars because in all fairness offerup has been a very great blessing. 
would be 5 stars except that since the update I have not been getting any views on my items and keep getting an error message when I open the app. I really hope they are able to resolve the issues.",4
1459,"Great for buying, terrible for selling: I actually do not like OfferUp - I used LetGo and LOVED it but they combined with OfferUp so now it’s the only local option. The ads are ridiculous, and made to look like listings so that you get tricked into clicking them.
If you want to search for something to buy, there is a lot to find and I love that. However, there is no time limit on listings and so many people just don’t end up selling, or donate instead, and the listing is still up a year later.
If you’re selling this app is very hit or miss. Basically people only see your item for the first 24 hours unless they actively search for it. I think OfferUp purposely hides listings or puts them lower so that you will pay to “promote” your listing. I guess taking advantage of people is the only way to make more money!",1
1460,"Five stars!!: OfferUp helped me get my dream car. I love sports cars and the one I’ve been wanting since I was 10 years old, I finally have thanks to OfferUp. OfferUp is an easy way to look for a new car, furniture, clothing brands and many other things. The reason I gave OfferUp five stars is because, this app is underrated and is never shown the love it truly deserves.. a lot of people think this app is sketchy when really it’s so safe. It a boujeer version of Craigslist. I just love it so much and I can’t wait to get more AFFORDABLE things when the retail price is way more expensive. GET THIS APP!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!",5
1461,"Someone come up with a new app please: Offer up is my least favorite buying and selling platform. Anytime I try and search anything for PICK UP ONLY there might be one or two items (half of the time not even the item I want) then the rest are 3months up to years old and I try and reach out for those and never get a response. Let go was at least reliable in getting responses I don’t understand how let go and offer up can be the same app when offer up hasn’t adopted anything of reliability from let go... let go was my go to app, since the merge I’ve been resorting to Craigslist and FB market place. OfferUp please make this platform better I’m getting really close to uninstall as this app just sits in my phone. I haven’t bought one thing through this app and only have sold one.  Outdated.",1
1462,"Messaging problems: When buying, I was getting no response from a seller, then found another item he had listed that I wanted and messaged him about both thru that listing. He said he never got any message about the first item, but I was thankfully able to buy both from him since messaging worked for the other listing. 
Now as I’m selling, I’ve had notifications and seen messages from buyers that later disappeared without a trace. The item still shows icons of multiple buyers in my selling list but only one message, the other conversations have disappeared. I looked but can’t find anywhere to contact any customer support about it.",3
1463,"Functional& fun  app!: Love this app to get rid of things and fairly easy to use. Sometimes the edit part is not as intuitive as it could be because the changes don’t save if you “close” that part rather than hit the button at the bottom. I think a “save button” added prominently to the middle of the page would be way less frustrating. Also on the main page, the icons at the bottom are not as intuitive as they could be as it takes me some time to figure out where to go to sell things. Maybe they could be rearranged and icons changed to be more intuitive.",4
1464,"My daybed!: I had been looking for a single bed, because my place is not that big, and I found a perfect sleigh bed, all wood, that I just love. And the price was right. So if you don’t mind driving, and exploring the different parts of LA, there are some great deals to be had on this site! 

And all the people that I’ve had dealings with are very nice people. I know I’m happy when I sell something and people come by with their trucks and pick the stuff up and it’s out of my house, well they feel the same way! This is really a great shopping site, especially for people who enjoy “‘THRIFTING”!",5
1465,"Customer service is non existent: I had really a nice experience with offerup until I had an issue and I had to get help from the customer service.

So, my case was this:
I offered 5x GOT books.
I got an offer for my price which I took.
The buyer paid and I sent the books 10 days later as I was not in the country.
I messaged the buyer and she said it was ok that I sent the books after 10 days.
I sent the books after 10 days.
Buyer received the books.
Then I could not get paid because the app automatically cancels the offer after 5 days of the offer if it is not sent, you cannot do anything about it.
I asked the customer service what to do and they just said, in two different times I asked “ooops so sorry, just go ahead and do the offer again, let the buyer give the offer again and everything is ok.
The problem is that they did not refund the buyer and she does not want to pay two times for the same item.

Today I wrote them again after 3 weeks and still I receive the same answer.

If you are going to use offerup for transactions that are going to be face to face then go ahead, otherwise, forget it.

Useless customer service.",1
1466,"Can’t do it anymore!: I started using offer up because the concept enticed me and I had bad experiences with mercari and let go. Very rarely do I get a real offer. 98% of the people that dm me are scammers. Just to make some of you aware if you’re not already, if someone asks to make a payment through western union or PayPal and they ask for your first and last name as well as your email address.. just stop responding. Their going to send you a fake confirmation email and try to get you to log into your account via the email and steal your account information/money. Almost everyone that has messaged me has tried to pull this scam on me. It is overwhelmingly annoying try to tell items when so many fake offers are being made. Their needs to be a better verification/payment system in order.",1
1467,"Conceptual Masterpiece: Software needs developing. App has unfortunately turned into a sad un-policed, mis-regulated, spammer haven full of trolls and wannabe capitalists. If we’re regulated like FB buy/sell groups it would be milestones better because it would police itself. Straight up a few simple markers put into place would have the vast majority of its users satisfied and in good spirts. First, No item should be allowed to be listed at a price higher than the lowest advertised on line or brick & mortar price. Second, Low ball offers less than half the asking price shouldn’t even be allowed. Third and lastly sanctions need to be placed on those who enter into a sale (buyers&sellers alike) and then flake or otherwise back out of the deal for whatever reason. You implement these three rules, and your number of users will grow exponentially.",1
1468,"Okay for meetups. Terrible for shipping high fees: I’ve been using Offer up for over a year now. The app is alright for local pickup sales, but it certainly falls short of the Facebook marketplace. First because you can’t bump your items for free and second because you get contacted by more junk profiles. 

My biggest complaint is with their shipping/ online payment system. The fees are DOUBLE PayPal and your funds are held for several business days after the item is delivered. Then it takes them forever to deposit after they “release” your funds. Offer up also charges the buyer really high shipping costs compared to eBay/USPS so it’s harder to get a good price for your item. 

I will continue to use in addition to the FB marketplace for local sales, but I will never accept payment over Offer up again.",1
1469,Need To Have Separate Men and Women Categories: I would like the app a lot more if there were separate clothing categories. I posted a prom dress for sale under the generalized category “clothing and shoes” with a picture of me wearing it so people can see what it looks like on. The majority of people who have messaged me about it have been grown old men commenting about my looks and how they were only interested in buying it because they wanted to “see my pretty face in person”. This is kind of disgusting and it makes me feel uncomfortable. It should be regulated more as I use other selling apps as well and this is the only one I have had that problem on. It would definitely be way less of a problem if there were separate categories for clothes.,2
1470,"It’s like a garage sale at your fingertips: Outstanding deals that you will find great bargains that you can not find anywhere els. It’s a safe & secure environment to sell and buy things. It’s like a garage sale at your fingertips! I love the fact that they keep the site exciting! There’s a notifications setting, if your looking for a specific item you get notified the moment someone post your item of interest! I can be the first one to bid on that item. It has all sorts of really neat features that are beyond totally tubular!",5
1471,"Started out great but now it’s saturated: Used to be very clean, not too technical, so somethings didn’t make sense but it wasn’t annoying.  Now it’s so saturated, you can tell they have no idea how to properly regulate.  It’s like a Craigslist.  The little guys trying to ACTUALLY sell are getting posts deleted for dupes or key words, but you have store fronts and wholesale warehouses with so many posts boasting “come to our store or call” all from separate/multiple accounts.  Sometimes I’m lucky if I can see a genuine one or two ads at a time.  Plus posting is a pain.  Again, you can have a few inclusive key words and get deleted immediately but  posts by other groups/stores/wholesalers aren’t regulated whatsoever.  I’m better off creating two accounts to post things from to try and get competing visibility.",1
1472,"Review: I have been on Offer Up for over a year. The service that the App offers is just great. I originally wanted to give them 5 stars. They really do deserve it. 

But from time to time. Not often though. There are glitches that appear and disrupt normal functioning of the App. And sometimes scammers come on here. Not regularly though. Never send anyone any monies for anything. 

I normally keep any business mostly local. Tri-State area only. I pick up 100% of the items. You might meet a bad character here in a blue moon; but over 98% of Offer Up clients are all decent to very decent people.

The ability to become a through member and the Offer Up Job Market here, the ability to rate the people you do business with. It makes it a great and a must have App. 

If I were to lose my device. Offer Up is one of the first Apps I’m downloading again; on that very first day of getting my new device. It’s that important of an App to have. 😁👍🏻👍🏻",4
1473,So far so good!: I haven’t had much problems with selling. Only sold one item. Will keep using the app. I encountered one problem with shipping the item. The first sale I had the prepaid packing slip and when I went to the post office they tried charging me almost the cost of selling the item. It was eventually sold. The second time went through smoothly. Doesn’t have any barring on me or my experience. I’m just happy to have a way to get rid of items I’m not using. Thank you for being available to me.,5
1474,"New update ruined it: Update 3/4/24 - got a new phone and it forced me to update, surprise surprise, it’s even worse now. Mark my words they’re desperately trying to make money and the app will be gone sooner or later when they realize they’ve developed an unsustainable platform.

With the new update and the app randomly turns off any background audio apps I have playing. I typically will be listening to a podcast or music while using the app and it keeps stopping the audio. This makes the app pretty much unusable by me, and is really sad to see. It’s possible that it’s related to the giant new video ads that came in with the update but I never hear any ad audio and the stopping doesn’t necessarily correlate with when those ads appear in my feed.",1
1475,"I’m back: I had done this a few years ago as an alternative to questionable Craigslist.  It was okay but instead I ramped up with eBay, which accelerated through the pandemic and beyond, but now it’s a joke.  The sales are fine there due to the traffic, but 75% of sales have issues because eBay lets buyers get away with anything.  Too risky.  Here, like there, I fully describe, test and show operation, but while eBay only goes by ‘buyer’ (read scammer), OfferUp allows personal trust, everything works out, for everyone.  And good folks to meet.  No swindlers, hustlers or scammers, let’s keep it that way…",4
1476,"unless you pay you can't sell: 50% of the people on this website are scammers which is already a given but in order to even reach the rest of the population of people to sell you have to either a constantly re-post your item at least every five hours in order for people to even see your listing. Or are you have to constantly pay the app money and hopes that somebody might actually look at your items no matter how you size it up or look at it it's a total scam. Siri on this app first came out I was able to sell things all the time, but ever since they merged I haven't been able to sell anything. Only thing I manage to do is waste money, trying to advertise my items just for nobody even look at it.",1
1477,"Scammers run amok: Got scammed by this dude who asked I Venmo him and said he would send me the tracking later. Also, lots of clearly too-good-to-be true posts of consoles and other electronics. OfferUp does little to nothing to prevent scammers from joining, there’s way more of a burden on buyers to look at everything about an account before buying, unlike eBay and Facebook. This is really bad for efficiency. Not having that security gets in the way of transactions and making everyone better off.

Another one: lady selling knock off samsung sd cards. Practically set my Nintendo switch on fire! Toxic plastic fumes, awful stuff. She couldn’t even be made to give a refund. The 2 day policy is too short considering often packages arrive in the middle of the day or evening. eBay has 30 days.",1
1478,"Stop Saying I have Notifications! when Nonexistent: It’s Absolutely frustrating as a seller to get notifications, me thinking it could be a potential customer only for me to open the app and it say “ITEMS YOU MAY LIKE” I have that turned off and its still spamming me!
 I’m very busy and only want notifications from people messaging me w/ questions. Also they need auto remove listing  older than 90 days. Its frustrating as a buyer to see most of listings from 2 years ago just ask the seller to renew their listing so that people know that “Hey YES its still selling” then Sellers don’t have go through the headache Removing and relisting old items so you stop getting hundreds of offers: IS IT STILL AVAILABLE?",2
1479,"Waste of time…: I downloaded this app a few years ago and actually completed a transaction so I thought the app was legit. Redownloaded it recently to try and sell a few things I no longer needed (some new even!) and well the only messages or “offers” I received were from scammers who kept trying to get me to communicate off app or worse kept asking for my phone number or email address. If only scammers were actually removed from the app or perhaps if the app had features to prevent unverified users from contacting you. Would be nice to be able to write a profile so I can explicitly say that I wont be engaging in those shenanigans. Either way, including all the posting and photographing, this was a massive time waste. Try another app.",1
1480,"Recent updates completely disregarded ipad users: Before recent update, OfferUp on iPad is usable. With recent updates, you can only use OfferUp in portrait mode. It’s like holding a giant iPhone. You can no longer use OfferUp in landscape mode.

It’s used to be easy to distinguish between Pickup items and Shipped items. Now you have to go filter to sort them out.

I’m guessing with the recent merge with Letgo, somebody on the UI team decided to take the worst features of Letgo and married them to OfferUp. Do you folks use OfferUp on iPad at all?",5
1481,"Great App! However, No one is biting even with Promo boost: I use to utilize this app a lot. However, the flake out rate is extremely high. People say they want an item, say they want to meet up then change there mind right before meeting up. Moreover, they like an item and want you to bring it to them!? No ma’am, no sir if you want an item bad enough and it’s a good deal please….use the shipping route or come get it yourself respectfully. People are extremely lazy these days. I put the promo on and people still do the same thing…Those situations make the app not appealing to me anymore. That’s why I no longer use the app due to the flake out rate and lazy individuals.",3
1482,Access outside the US: So I’m currently visiting another country and was told about the app from a family member. I downloaded it and it won’t even allow you to enter the app unless you’re in the US. I think this is a bit ridiculous because I’m going to look for sellers IN the US. The app should allow you to put in your address at least before it assumes it can’t help you. Now I have to wait until the end of my trip to find what I’m looking for which is extremely inconvenient. I could have bought something and had it shipping to my home while I’m away and been able to have it once I got back.,3
1483,Too much time wasted on this: The radius is set to 30 miles automatically.  Can’t seem to adjust.  Filtering by local pickup does nothing. You will see items from hundreds of miles away and items that are shipping only. Sorting by most recent also does nothing. There are tons of ads that are months and even years old. There is no way to filter by age. This may make it look like OfferUp has a following with lots of listings when in fact I have not ever been able to find anything decent for sale in my area. Just lots of scrolling through junk only to find the listing that caught my eye was posted 7 months ago and never expired. Good idea but poor implementation.,2
1484,"good app needs improvements: Overall an easy to use but lacking some features, but glad it remains free. 
- needs to be a way to block lowball offers when you marked price as firm
- need to be able to see price before clicking on item
- needs to be able to rate a person even if they didn’t buy. for example, this person stood me up for 20 minutes. and of course people who ghost you. i would like to see this implemented that you get to both select each other of the planned meet up. 
- stop sending me notification badges on things i looked up previously. there is no way to turn these off",3
1485,"Old Posts: I like OfferUp but posts that are months, even *years* old should be removed. It’s frustrating to find something of interest, contact the seller ~ then receive absolutely no response because they’ve either moved, sold the item privately, failed to remove the post because they changed their mind ~ or died. That’s a problem with this website. Posts over 60 days old should just automatically drop off. Other than that, this website has helped me find a few things I actually needed. I rate it *4* ~ good ~ but not excellent.",4
1486,"It has a lot of room for growth: The app is good for its purpose, it even has alerts to tell you if someone posted something you’re looking for. The main reason I rated OfferUp 2 stars is because there are situations that spelt started to annoy me. For example, I have alerts to get notified if someone posted a bbq grill. There’s maybe 5 or 6 profiles that post the same exact grills at least twice a day, every single day. Granted, some posts are legit from other real people, but the 5-6 people that keep reposting is annoying. I thought one day to file a report and block them, but that doesn’t stop the notifications. Continuously reposting the same thing should be something to look into.",2
1487,"Too many business posts.: I wish there was a way to block posts or mute certain sellers/businesses that post in bulk and attempt to monopolize a certain item like phones and cars for example. If I don’t want to purchase from a business or dealership, and would prefer private parties, It makes it nearly impossible to find a private party and a good deal if 99% of the posts I see are from a business or dealership that posts endlessly. Having a feature to block posts from a seller you just simply will never buy from would be a great addition and would drastically increase the likability of this app as it would make it much more easier to navigate through and see the best posts for what you could potentially be looking for.",1
1488,"Personal Info Problems: I made an OfferUp account last week, I was able to sell an item and everything was great. I liked that OfferUp does not require your real name among other things. However, as of today, I am FORCED to make a TruYou account if I want to sell or send messages to anyone. OfferUp does not want you to share any personal information with other people BUT REQUIRE ME TO SEND THEM (strangers) THE FRONT AND BACK OF MY ID. With my picture, first and last name, birthday, DL Number, address, etc… So why would I send you (OfferUp and employees who I do not know) all my personal information??? By the way, companies much bigger and more secure have been hacked before. I sent an email to support and they just responded “just send your info and issue will be resolved” ???? Very concerning.",1
1489,"Deactivated without reason: If you like being ghosted by businesses then this app is for you. I’ve used this app for about a year. I always follow the rules of posting, have great reviews from others, even set everything up for identity verification to help others feel more comfortable making sales with me. I recently realized my account was deactivated without reason. I only found out by googling the error message. There isn’t anyway around it as everything is attached to my log in info and Apple ID. I sent a request about a week ago and no response. Their business model doesn’t seem interested in expansion or communicating with customers. There isn’t an email or phone number to call for support, only an online form.",1
1490,"Good app but a few suggestions: 1. Please add an option to flag important conversations so that they stay afloat in the mass messages that are all grouped together; it seems when you get more and more messages, older ones tend to disappear and it becomes easy to lose conversations for other items you may be working on buying or meeting up with. 

2. Please correct the error when scrolling and opening ads it sometimes forgets where you are and you have to start all over again. Pretty annoying and disorienting. 

3. It would be nice if the pictures included the price on the search results page instead of having to open each and every one or having to create a filter to get rid of everything out of your price range. Sometimes I still want to see everything that’s available.

4. Please make it easier to select and delete bulk items from the  watch list, it’s impossible to manage when you have hundreds of items built up and the app asks for a confirmation with a pop up after every single one.",2
1491,"Why did you do this to me?: Offer up actually used to be really awesome for the first few months of use, until suddenly i couldn’t get into my profile anymore. I attempted to reset my password but when i did it told me the “Confirmation token is not valid” i tried like 20 times but they wouldn’t let me in. So i created a new account with a new email and they had me verify my number. I wouldn’t get any views at all, and when i text people they can’t see it. (I tested it on my sister) Offer up shadowbanned me for literally NO reason. And they never sent me an email to explain why, and there is ZERO customer service, they say there is a team standing by to help but there is nobody, they just banned me and didn’t say anything. Undo this Offer up, Undo it",1
1492,"Easy to use, little results: The app is easy to use for listing items locally, although I have had a couple technical issues like unable to change my location. Unfortunately, I haven’t had much luck actually selling anything with this app. I have listed a variety of items from housewares to clothing. I include plenty of quality photos and provide a good, yet concise, description. I base my asking price on thrift store or garage sale prices, not what I think they’re worth or would like to get. Still, items only get a mediocre amount of views and few inquiries compared to other resale sites. Perhaps it is the area I live in, but I do better with other local media.",3
1493,"Zero customer support: Recently, I shipped two packages within the allotted time line. However, the US post office was overwhelmed for the holidays and delayed scanning the packages for five days. Offer up canceled the orders so I did not get paid even though the customers finally received their packages a week later. There is no phone number or email address for customer support and after reaching out to them on Twitter, I finally got an email address. Their response? I had to handle it myself with the buyer. What a nightmare. Don’t use the shipping option because they don’t help if something goes wrong. I’ll be using Poshmark and Facebook marketplace. Offer up takes a percentage on shipped transactions but they don’t use any of that money to help you once something goes wrong. Big fail.",1
1494,"This App “use to be” great: I have been using this app for 5+ years and it was great. The enhancements they’ve made over the years have been to better the use for both the buyer and seller. 

It had been a while since I had been back in this app this year 2020. As I logged in you can see the updates on the app, looks good. 
However first thing I noticed is that my old posts shows the number of views on my items and the new posts showed 0 even though they had been posted for several days.  I’m thinking it’s an easy fix probably just a glitch. 
Secondly when posting pictures of the items it lets you select the folder your pics are in on your phone. Every time I selected a pic it would go back to a different folder of pics. 
Lastly I made new posts of some items that I had posted some time ago and removed the old posts. Now I can’t see the new or old posts. Pretty strange. 

Anyhow if they can make the necessary adjustments/tweaks to the post I think we can update the rating as an awesome app that it has been.",3
1495,"The dumbest merge of 2020: Since offer up has become a hub for scammers and they are the actual company crumbling out of the two letgo has decided to merge with one of the cheapest eBay rip offs of the 21st century... I’ve used these apps for 2 years now and have made a success off selling more stuff on let go than I did ever offer up, you might as well call this Tinder 2 because all you meet is worthless people who want your money in all the wrong ways.... letgo if you are in there please unmerge with offer up and save your company",5
1496,"What is happening......: Ever since Letgo and Offer up recently combined, I’m getting messages constantly from people asking for my phone number. It makes no sense and I’m convinced they’re all bots because they say they are interested and then ask for my phone number and then they go silent when I don’t give it to them.  I’ve sold plenty of things through the app with the messenger already installed in the app. Anyone asking for a cell phone number is creepy, especially with no context.  All these accounts also have no profile picture and no history on the app.    Offer up really needs to be on top of this better and create more security to prevent bots from harassing real users who are trying to sell and buy things.",2
1497,"LetGo was better by itself: OfferUp is a joke compared to LetGo, and now they bought them and combined them.  LetGo was a great app and set up well, while OfferUp is a cluster and is FULL of scams.  I downloaded both at the same time last year, and bought/sold several things on LetGo.  OfferUp was crap from the beginning compared to LG and I never used it successfully for even one item.  Then they combined, the new app is still harder to use/has less features than LG had, and is still FULL OF SCAMS.  Apparently LG scanned better for scams or something, or OU just doesn’t care; I don’t know.  Either way, of course the good one is gone now with no simple rollover and the junk remains.  I guess somebody created LG as a “startup” just to sell and make money on later or something.  Wonderful.",1
1498,"The Merge: The Merge refers to the Merging between Letgo and OfferUp as a whole. Personally, I feel it’s terrible. For those who used Letgo to advertise a service and only contacted people through the app, all of that is gone. They say that you’re supposed to “keep your ratings” but none of that transferred over. And now that it runs through OfferUps system, I’ve gotten less interactions than if I were to just post anything on Letgo. I feel that Letgo was the better app for local selling and buying while OfferUp is a better version of Ebay. I feel that the 2 apps should have stayed 2 separate apps, especially if they weren’t planning on transferring our accounts over for ease of use. The Merge just doesn’t seem well thought out or planned at all and feels more like a buyout to try and force people over to OfferUp.",1
1499,Horrible customer service: I had this app and I was just looking to get a second hand Xbox and some games and I couldn’t send messages to people and it started acting up right after I had bought something I reached out to costumer service for help and all I got from them was something along the lines of “your Account has been permanently suspended and we are unable to overrule this decision” I tried to reach out to them several more times and ask why but I couldn’t even get them to give me a reason. I reread all the codes of conduct and I couldn’t find anything I did that was wrong and I am so upset that they would not tell me what I did that was so bad I just wanted to use the app like a normal person. I’m not looking to scam people or even sell I just wanted to buy some old electronics.,1
1500,Suggestion: Not making many sales have more than 3000 items on app which I like too many idiots on it messaging about items they would like to buy but are not really interested in . The trading with my items for cash needs to be stopped kills the app. Commission charges on sales thru the app by mail too high need to reduce them. App needs more people interested in buying & selling items either in person or by mail. Sorry to say this but it’s true app will not work unless more buying & selling goes on needs serious people on it not idiots,5
1501,"Love using this app but...: Offer Up is a great way to get rid of all of your unwanted items and most will sell in a matter of minutes after posting, but when it comes to others trying to purchase outside of the area and they send their offers Offer Up automatically cancels their order regardless of what amount their offer was. I’m not sure if this is system error or not and how many others go through the same issue but I’ve been going through this same issue for a few weeks now. Maybe it’s time for an update? Otherwise this app is great highly recommended!!!",4
1502,"Great App: I love OfferUp and have sold/purchased many items using this App. It’s so convenient being able to reach many people through one source. I also love the option to pay using the app. That makes it even more convenient not having to exchange cash. One thing I wish the site would do a better job of is having sellers confirm if items are still available after a certain period of time to keep the listing active. I’ve come across several items I’ve been interested in that are still listed, but not available.",5
1503,"Almost perfect: I’ve been on offer up for 2 years now And I’ve seen them make lots of improvements. I love the new shipping option, because I don’t have to waste time meeting people for low value items. I have noticed that there is still something missing though. Sometimes If I’ve listed something and then go out of town or I’m not available for some reason and there isn’t a way to let potential buyers know.

So often I’m busy and can’t meet for a day or two and that’s when offers come in. We need a sign that is visible when people are searching that says “away until (insert date)”.",4
1504,"OfferUp is truly listening to it’s customer base!!: If you had asked me six months ago if I would be willing to recommend this app to others I would have said absolutely not BUT the thing is I might have been too quick to judge 🥴 
Over the past six months I have watched OfferUp seriously listen to its Sellers’s and Buyer’s and things are slowly getting so much better 🙏🏻
If you are someone who has been thinking about getting into the Resale business or you just have a ton of stuff you need/want to get rid of, OfferUp is definitely a perfect place to start!",5
1505,Love the app many concerns and ideas: I love Offer yo been using it for years now... Just a few things I think you change make a everyone verify themselves if they want to use the app it’s a lot of scams and it’s a lot of bull going on... If someone is not a True You member I don’t even respond to them that’s how bad the scamming has gotten.. or either make a separate tab for true you members only. Making a True you section you’ll know who your dealing with and that the item is legit if the item is not legit at least you know the persons real name and what they look like.,5
1506,"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE—EXCELLENT SECURITY: I’ve used offer up for more than a year and have never had a problem til today. I encountered many errors and tried all the fixes to no avail. I deleted the app and reinstalled it—same error prompts. I couldn’t log in or create a new account. 

Tried on line, too. Searched for “OfferUp help” which took me to additional help and told them their suggestions didn’t help and that my topic was not even mentioned. 

OfferUp responded right away,  asking me one last time, to verify another email address and then they sent me a link to reactivate my account. 

MY ADVICE:  go online for help first!  One of the choices there (I don’t know if there’s an option for this problem within the app), I discovered I could have used the on line choices to delete the app, deactivate it, or to reactivate it. 

DO NOT JUST DELETE THIS APP BY YOURSELF—USE THEIR ONLINE HELP FIRST!!!

1509,Frustrated with selling board load speed: The selling board is so slow that it often doesn’t upload - it doesn’t upload 99% of the time. Offer ups suggestion of reducing image size is great except you can’t access it to reduce your image sizes. They should limit those on their end. They also suggest turning WiFi off which is what makes the page actually load 1% of the time. Unreliable! They should consider allowing desktop editing like poshmark. It’s frustrating to deal with this during the busiest time for buying and selling.,5
1510,"Crashes; Uses Bots / Fake Profiles to Keep You Coming Back: Though the UI is decent, the app itself is terrible. The app crashes if I try to upload more than 3-4 pictures at a time. So every time I list something, I have to come back 2-3 more times and edit it to get the full 12 pictures loaded because it can only handle so many at a time.

But by far the worst part is the bots and fake profiles they employ. I was starting to wonder why I get SO many messages from people who make offers and then stop messaging when I accept. I finally noticed that many of these profiles have no ratings, joined the site that month, have generic profile photos and use almost verbatim the same language. OfferUp relies on ads, so the more you use the app, scroll, etc., the more they make, so this is how they attempt to keep you hooked. They make you feel like you’re getting a lot of interest in an item, but it’s complete BS.

The reality is I’ve had very little success selling stuff. If an actual person does respond, 9 out of 10 times they lowball you.

Don’t bother wasting your time and energy with this shady company and their crapplication. It will only frustrate you.",1

I can’t even login to my profile on Browser so I am forced to use this app and it is literally just the worst let go is so much better but since half of the people are on here I have no choice but to attempt to maneuver through this so called app ran by foreigners ?

Other than that I strongly recommend this app, much better than Ebay or outdated Craigslist.",3

I mean like 17-32 views after 2 hours of being on the market. Buyers are very considerate timely & respectful with their responses. It’s gotta be my all time #1 favorite app to sell on!!!!!",5

1517,"Terrible app: I hate this app. Why can’t they put the price of the item on the picture instead of having to click on it to see the price only to find out it’s ridiculously overpriced. Most items for sale are way overpriced, people sell things for more than what they paid when new & it’s used🙄.
 Also, Stop suggesting I turn on notifications. I don’t want notifications turned on when all I get is junk that offer up thinks I want to see🙄, never any from a potential buyer. Right now it says I have 3 notifications & not one is for anything I’m selling. Stop changing the distance I set. I’m not driving 30 miles to find out something is junk in person or it’s a scam. I very rarely look on offer up anymore. I miss Let Go",1

They should do more to verify their sellers, I recently attempted purchasing a used Nintendo switch from 2 different sellers in completely different parts of the US and it was the exact same scam, they rejected (I hope, still watching my credit card now, when I check the OfferUp app I get an error when trying to review details of the “order”) my full price shipping paid offer in which I had to enter my credit card, then started trying to contact me via email/text with all this shady nonsense.",2
1519,"Sensitive ads: I love offer up and its ease of use in most regards, but recent programming for their ads that banner across the screen while scrolling are EXTREMELY sensitive to touch, moreso than it takes to click on an offerup item. The result? Every time I try to scroll I’m being taken to separate browser windows to view the ads that I didnt intend to click. This was not an issue for the first several years I was using this app and I find the feature so annoying that I exit the app, use it less or switch to search on craigslist. There are also now forced ads with exit buttons so small and far in the top corner that, again, they are designed to get pressed. It’s definitely the reason I use this app less. Very bummed.",1
1520,"Overall Great App: Love this app - only suggestion for improvement would be to have items that are “liked” or saved to somehow show the “heart” on the main search page so you know that you have already “flagged” it when you are searching for your items of interest (without having to click on the item to see that it already has your “heart”).   This improvement would streamline searches so that favorites are visibly marked on the main search screen. Thank you, SM - Susan M",5
1521,"Full of flakes - there are simple fixes for this: As a frequent buyer and seller, I find it frustrating that when selling an item, you may get hundreds of messages, give out an address and more, but the person still does not show up and stops responding. There needs to be a way for people to leave feedback about a person not showing up so that it is visible to other people on OfferUp. This platform is the flakiest by far out of eBay, FB, and Craigslist. 90% of buyers on here have no money and are rough around the edges . Sorry but it’s the truth. Find a way to make this platform a little more higher quality. Pathetic to see people with dumb profile pictures on this app too.",2
1522,"Weirdest system, Horrible respond: My posting ghosted without a reason ! not even over posting item.I contacted customer service and told them my specific computer sale posting doesn’t show up what is the reason ? my account status is okay . Their respond we have right delete or not show posting without reason, you are right. and I have right not click your ads on app and delete your app with a reason , good bye offerup. No waste time contact their customer service!",5
1523,"Do not use this app if your planning on switching bank accounts: From what I know about my own personal experience. Great app to flip your merch. Until , You have to switch out your bank account for whatever reason. This site does not allow you do this. Not possible I was told by an agent. My orders are backed up now. So Do not Use This Site If you plan on switching bank accounts. It will be a disaster. Not to mention the 4 unanswered emails I sent with no return and now am UNABLE to utilize the way payments and how they are sent. Too bad because this site is a nice option for those not into eBay or marketplace. If there was a fix I’d be golden. But I am told that there isn’t. Ultimately I had to shut down my offer up. Because of this problem.",1
1524,"Account deleted for no reason: I recently received an email stating my account was deleted and was not provided a reason why. I have only listed two items on the site over the past 4 years!! One was kids furniture (sold on OfferUp) and the other was a kids ride on, which was sold on another site. I only marked it sold on OfferUp to let those who may be interested in it that it was no longer available. I was surprised to learn that my account was deleted. I asked for additional information and was only told it was removed for “violations of our Community Guidelines and Posting Rules”, which does not help me understand why since I rarely used the site and have not posted anything other than a description of the items.",1
1525,"Not very user friendly. Awkward app. Customer service leaves much to be desired as well.: AND the posts include a lot of non-local postings. There are also way too many adds mixed in (and often the SAME add, in case you did not see the first two dozen)!

App was NOT intuitive - at all. 
And “contact us for help” was not a whole lot better. 
Phone app can be awkward so I went to post on my desktop but couldn’t.  Just “download the app” was the only option.  
Posted with phone app. Then went back and tried to just simply edit my posting on my desktop but couldn’t!
Had to ask twice, “Can I use my desktop or is it only a mobile platform?”  First response, we noticed a problem with your account contact us before we can help. Didn’t get a response the second time. 

I have now asked for a third time. I still don’t know, “CAN I USE A DESKTOP OR NOT?  *OR* DO I NEED A MOBILE PHONE TO POST???”
...still waiting for a simple answer.  Not hold my breath. 

My friend can’t see my posts so I don’t know if I am just wasting my time either. So far, Craig’s list is way better and I just might stick with Facebook marketplace...",1
1526,"Fake ads.: I’ve been looking for a car for the longest and it’s hard finding one on this app because 1) Underground dealerships put up fake prices just so you can reach out to them. 2) Every time I search for a car, I end up finding car parts of that specific car I searched up and if I do find the car, the post would be from 6 months ago or even older. For some odd reason I searched up a nissan sentra and on the search list I saw a Camry that was titled as a nissan but when I clicked on it, the title was changed to Toyota Camry and of course, the price was $1. Don’t get me wrong i’ve seen a few good cars but it is mostly these things every time I come to the app to look for cars.",2
1527,"Needs to make a change to how it was: Offer up recently made an update in which every time you post something it barely gets any views or conversations. When I previously post the item I used to get about 5 conversions within the day but now I haven’t gotten any in a week for the exact same product, it acts the same way even after I repost. I can also tell that the views have dramatically decreased. I feel like this is being done so that when sellers don’t get buyers they would buy the paid promotional offer. I’ve loved offer up and been using it for years but this is a really sad change.",3
1528,Needs a few MAJOR fixes: Fix 1) STOP emailing every time someone messages. I finally got it to stop after “unsubscribing” several times. I have notifications on the app in real time I don’t need emails to tell me someone messgees me Fix2) the notifications don’t disappear even after I’ve looked at a message. Fix that. Fix 3) allow a rating for the stupid “is this Available ghosts to weed them out Fix 4) it keeps removing items I list saying “it’s not a tangible item…” LOL I’m pretty sure a suitcase is a tangible item. Fix 5) a “notes” area where I can copy / paste premade messages would be very convenient & a nice feature. I do this in my phones notes but having it in app would be ideal. Don’t need to type the same meet location in full every time.,1
1529,"Don’t know how to follow sellers now.: Since the last update I am not able to follow sellers or see who is following me. I do all of my shopping and posting with my iPhone so I don’t know if that’s why it no longer works.
I used the help center and it only shows how to do it before the app upgrade. There is no way to contact anyone l, at least that I can find for support at Offer Up.
I love the app otherwise, I buy and sell a lot of stuff so hopefully this gets fixed or someone contacts me on what I might be doing wrong.",5
1530,"Don’t waste your time: I would have given Zero stars. I signed up to sell a few things and I follow all the instructions and post a couple things the next day I get an email that I broke the community rules, I email customer service and they said to just log back in ……. I do just that and my posts are gone so start all over repost and get a few views and no offers. Some time passes and I get another email that again I broke the community rules 😡 I have bone nothing wrong so I look at the site again and yet again my items are gone so I email customer service again and tell them to delete my account, as of today they have not done so. Sell your things on another site or have a garage sale better chance to sell.",1
1531,"Updates: would be nice when you are deleting that it would not go back to the beginning of where you were.
Would be nice if you could just move to the next one without having to go back out 
Would be nice if you could communicate just a little better 
Would be nice if the person asking would take off their things if they have not sold the item or have some the item vs having it there for year's and never replying so like if you the app could remove them off 
Other than that I just love the app it's very Addictive",4
1532,"Terrible customer service insensitive jerks: As to be expected with any corporate customer service “faculty”, the “help” team over at offer up are uncouth dummies. 
In they’re apathetic responses, they demonstrate a lack of responsibility in they're company. They are ingenue about the seriousness of consumer & sellers legitimate concerns.   

They wont & dont bother actually listening & providing an authentic response. They only look for selected words of what the individual had to say & go to their booklets to cite some textbook canned response. Insensitive pricks. 

They allow other sellers to sell covid testing kit products but they discriminate me when I post the exact same product. I even made the exact listing ad another seller has up; same product, word for word, price, image, you name it. It was taken down, I contact someone, they copy n paste the same response like an automated machine. Thanks offer up the past was good but you guys need to reconsider how you treat your app users, as well as that incompetent foolish rule that you selective for on other’s & not some. Some would call this discrimination: selectively targeting an individual or group of people.",1
1533,"Large surge of fake scam accounts: The app does its job for selling locally no doubt but there has been a major spike in fake scam accounts lately i like to check around for good deals and for every 3 posts i click 1 is a scam post with some slightly hilarious bio and unreasonably low price. the bio is always something like"" Got a promotion today and i want to spread the help with giving it away for free"" But alot more illiterate.    its been growing more and more taking over the app which has drawn me more towards merc ari but as a heads up for new people if their selling and the account was made very recently with no reviews its a scam and their going to try to get you to purchase outside of the offer up app 👎🏽",2
1534,Scammer central: Recently installed this app as redirected from letgo app. Searched for cars for sale and quickly became bored scrolling past the vast postings of newer vehicles for only $1000 posted over 20 times each making it hard to find “Real” cars for sale. All of those scam posts said to contact their gmail contact instead of messaging in the app. This is so pervasive and obvious that this app obviously doesn’t care about the legitimacy of posts and protection from fraud. App works fine performance however provides low confidence in protection. Understanding private transactions require due diligence of buyers the app still can control the spam posting and gmail off site communication suggestions of the postings. Fix that and improve the confidence in your app.,1
1535,"Dealerships taking over: Bought stuff using the app for a while now and perfect. Now that I’m looking to get another vehicle I decided to use the plate form to find a private seller. The downside is that it’s filled with dealerships that are placing the price as down payments. At the end it’s just click bait with a down payment , company name and phone number for more questions. Let’s be honest if I was in the market for a vehicle and wanted it from a dealership I would be shopping for one in a dealership. Looking for a private seller because they know their cars and know what to the real value is. Got tired and searching thru and really do not plan on using this app for stuff like that anymore.",3
1536,"Disappointed: I really wanted to love this app, especially after hearing so many good things about it and reading the reviews. However, my first and only listing was removed within less than 24 hours after I posted it - and not a word was said to me. No email, no notification within the app, nothing. Just... gone? To my knowledge I didn’t violate any policies or standards (and if I had, I’d like to think I would be notified and given a chance to edit and re-post my listing accordingly), and I put a lot of thought into my listing, as I do on all platforms... so the lack of communication after a prompt removal of the same items I’ve seen hundreds of people selling on OfferUp was enough of a first impression for me to abandon it. Hopefully other users continue to have a better experience.",1
1537,"Disappointed: I’m not mad, just disappointed. Customer service doesn’t exist. I used the 3 day “promote your item” trial and cancelled it a day late on accident. Was hoping to get a refund but it’s impossible to get any answers in the help forum. It’s also unclear about how to collect money securely during a transaction. Also, the people in my area (Orlando) are flakey and cheap. This app did not provide the reassurance necessary for a female to meet up with strangers, to sell an item, for less than 75% of the asking price. This app does allow you to track how many views your items received and does allow messaging for free. It technically does the job of allowing people to post items and purchase. Has a lot of room for improvement.",2
1538,"Not as good as letgo: I had Letgo before I had to transition to Offerup. I was saddened when it happened because the user interface is just not as nice as Letgo’s was. They should have adapted it! Also, recently every time I post an item to sell I immediately (like less than a second) get multiple spam message from what must be “bots” who ask if it is available and then ask for my phone number. It happens multiple times every time I post. If this was fixed I would be way more satisfied with the app, but I feel that it has just become so big that they can’t even be contacted unless you tweet them. Customer/User support is ultimately non-existent. I would love to give feedback in order to improve the app to what it could be.",2
1539,"Offer Up is Let Go, but worse.: Recently Offer Up and Let Go merged, taking Let Go off the App Store. They both had their place. Let Go would be good for local stuff, and Offer Up would be good for stuff I would need delivered to me, because Offer Up is NOT good for meeting people for local delivery. They over sell shipping which is exactly what I don’t want from an app like this. The problem is that when you search “Monitor,” you expect to get listings within 10 miles from you, right? Well you are served with 20% Ads, 50% Delivery, and 10% promoted listing. It’s bad. Compared to Let Go, a far superior platform, this app is rugged, blocky, dark, and a far less experience. Now that I can’t go there, here I am voicing my opinion about what I am forced to stick with. 
Hope you can use this get better!",1
1540,"Payment from shipping is horrible.: Love the app. But since they implemented shipping it’s been horrible. OfferUp takes WAY too long to send you your money. My item has been shipped and delivered and I still have not received payment, it just says “processing”. I feel like this is a scam to get more money from you, because you have the option to “speed up” the payment if you give OfferUp more money from your sale (after they already take 9%). Bottom line they should be receiving our money the day our items are shipped or at least delivered.",5
1541,"Unreliable users: I don’t know what it is about this app, but for some reason it attracts both low ballers and unreliable sellers. I use various buy/sell apps, including the FB marketplace and Craigslist, but for some reason I have had mostly bad experiences with offerup. When I have tired to sell, people are constantly trying to give me offensively low ball offers, and when I am trying to buy, 9 times out of 10 I can’t even get the seller to reply to my inquiry. I have never had this problem with other apps. It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly within the app itself would cause this, but since it is the only one that tends to be this way, there must be something within its structure that creates a negative and unreliable atmosphere.",2
1542,"No reply from customer service: I use to love this app and the customers Ive sold to have always given me a 5 star rating. A few months the app stopped working. I tried to get a hold offer up several times but, the app doesn’t make it easy for you to get in contact with them. Finally I was able to find contact point and I haven’t heard anything back to let them know the app is not allowing others to see my items. The items I’m posting after popular items for a fair and reasonable price yet I’m not even seeing one view.",5
1543,"Avoid putting personal/financial info into this app!: This app itself works well enough and I’ve used it for years for local sales BUT I’d warn people not to put their personal or credit card information into this app until they implement 2fa. My account is constantly getting hacked and is being logged into from different places. I’ve had to change my password more times than I can remember. The support also seems non existent. I’ve contacted support tons over the years and have never had a response. The developer even responded to my previous comment here and gave me an email to contact and again, never got a response and that was months ago.",3
1544,"Scammers using this to get money: So Ive been with offer up for almost a year now, and since the beginning of the shipment and payment process I have not been disappointed until 3 weeks ago. My credit card was charged to the amount I offered for a laptop, when contacting the seller, i was told he had already shipped it. When I went on his profile, the same laptop that I had been charged for buying was being resold again on the same persons profile. I tried to contact him through the app, and I was blocked by that very same user. So I would highly appreciate my refund or Im going to have to handle this matter the legal way. Im now going to delete this app for it does not stand by their payment and shipping policy.",2
1545,"What happened offer up??????: Was once a decent selling platform. Now is over run with ads. And to boot, you set up your search parameters with the 30 mile radius, and you get search results from the opposite coast. Like I really wanna drive from Oregon to South Carolina for an item. It also doesn’t save your zip or anything you put in. And like hell do I trust the customer service enough to have it sent out. They seem to not care about the good users. So what’s up with your search parameters working from the start to a few months ago, and now this ridiculous bs. I’ve had to move on to other selling apps, and use this one to do a quick scroll through, usually to find the item I want is 2000 miles away. Wonder how long this app will last when they mistreat the good base and ignore the masses.",1
1546,Easy to browse & buy!: I just moved and have been looking for some pre-loved furniture items to save money. I got targeted for this app on instagram and immediately downloaded. I found a few pieces of interest in my area within minutes and had easily contacted two sellers all through the app! Was able to negotiate price and schedule pickup of the item (a dresser). It was SO easy to handle through this app! Much better than Craigslist. I just wish the images when browsing were a bit bigger so I didn’t have to click through as much.,5
1547,"Over It: Update:
I’ve tried to use it a couple times over the past few months and frankly it is terrible. Most of the listings it shows me are over a year old!!  There really needs to be a way to filter out that old stuff. Kind of worthless since all the items are no doubt long gone. 

There needs to be a way to filter search results to eliminate all the stuff being sold by storefronts. I am only interested in private sales from my peers but 80% of my search results are professional sellers getting rid of stuff from their stores at ridiculously inflated storefront prices. Craigslist offers the option to filter these out but Offer Up does not. It is too difficult to find the items I'm looking for. Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are far superior than this app.",1
1548,"No way to call out or rate No-shows (50-75% of transactions): This app is great except rating system is not accurate. Biggest part of buyer/seller rating is if they SHOW UP for the confirmed and agreed-up transaction. Which in more that half the time they don’t. And you are out of both valuable time (usually about an hour per transaction) and gas $. And the no-shows could care less, totally indifferent about wasting someone’s time and money for distance traveled, or them sitting in a hot car waiting with their kids (WFH moms usually have kids with them). 

Offereup needs to fix this. Once location and time are confirmed/agreed upon and they don’t show up the count of no-shows without prior notification should be noted on their profile.",2
1549,"Good app but could be better: So far I’ve used this app for the last few weeks and I’ve enjoyed it very much! There’s a lot of upside to this app as they are competing with other apps like LetGo. I would have to say that I like the potential this app has because of the features that it utilizes in the app.

Some of the not so great things I have found is they need to implement a ranking system within the search tool so then whenever someone searches for a specific item they find that item at the best deal and they find the best seller to sell that item. It shouldn’t just go off of the last post to be posted!",4
1550,"App is alright but…: This app is actually pretty cool and convenient! I’m not hating on it, I just think it would be more user friendly if this is addressed.
 

When typing in the item description, after a certain amount of words, you can no longer read what you are typing inside the text box. It’s really quite annoying as it makes it difficult to make sure you aren’t spelling anything incorrectly. I can’t scroll down in the text box, every time i attempt to, it takes the keyboard off my screen. I know for sure that this isn’t an issue with my phone (new iphone 13) 
Please fix this!!!",3
1551,"It does it job at a cost: It is a nice looking and simple local marketplace to buy/sell/trade. 
However, it has intrusive ads that hijack the entire screen for a few seconds to show you an ad, the marketplace is completely littered with ads from stores like Temu that are bigger than the local listings, and there are even more large ads to scroll past while viewing items and profiles. If you click on any item and scroll down you’ll see a large random ad between the description and the map location.

So the app fulfills its purpose for you but you have the strong feeling that its main purpose is to be an ad farm and you are the product.",2
1552,"Seems to work alright if you can get people to respond: I’ve listed several designer items and a couch as well as a bike on here and no one messaged me (i even made the couch free at one point and most of the items were on there for like $50). No big deal, maybe no one wants this stuff. I’ve successfully bought one thing from a guy who knows one of my friends (I have a profile picture with my face), but other than that no one will respond to my messages asking to buy stuff. I’m not sure if they think I’m a bot or not but no one responds no matter how much I offer on anything(full price or more).

After three days, my listing stayed at zero views and not a single offer came my way which makes no sense because it should at least be getting views if I pay to promote it. Then, out of nowhere today it said my account had been banned for violating guidelines, which is impossible because I’ve literally only made one list thing and not done a single other thing on the app. It is apparent that this app is in the past and they are just quickly trying to money grab people and get them out of the way without any explanation. Stay as far as you can away from this app or anything that these developers make.",1
1554,"Issues since updates: 1) Ads - they take up the whole screen… this isn’t a game I’m playing - just a post or view. Not really something that someone else can’t replace you guys with. And not worth the money to get rid of them since the most of the buyers are flakes and most of the sellers are businesses. Charge people who list more then 40 times a week or something to weed out the business people instead of adds. 
2) Notifications no longer show up. How am I supposed to look at the notification if it doesn’t show? 
3) you can’t X out of the screen and have to swipe back or exit the app… then there is no need to return to it. 

If the glitches aren’t fixed, I’ll find another app to sell & buy on.",1
1555,"Too many Ads!!: I’ve had OfferUp since it started. You guys have progressively gotten worse with the amount of Ads you are displaying. I’m having a hard time distinguishing between a local item for sale and an Ad for a new product. I’m finding that I’m staying away and have stopped using your App because it’s frustrating. I don’t want to see Ads from businesses that already make millions from consumers. I want to see used/new items from people like me. 

The whole concept of OfferUp was for your customers to purchase local used items or for them to sell their items. 

The amount of Ads is insane. Now you have them in our messages….really?!?
I get it that the businesses are paying you so that they can sell their items. 
So you need to come up with an option for customers like me that don’t want to see the Ads to purchase a Ad free version like many other Apps offer. I would pay a reasonable fee to get rid of the Ads. Please make this a consideration. Trying to navigate through the Ads is getting old. Thanks!",2

I do not like that when I search for something on a search bar or view a listing, on my homepage all of a sudden only listings of that item show up, rather than all listings showing on the homepage I may have only needed that item one time and all my homepage will show is for example “dog crates” and I also do not like that I have to constantly every time I open the app move the radius of my search it should stay fixed to the mile radius I have selected unless I choose to search further. I haven’t noticed any useful improvements related to what I don’t like.",3
1557,"Meh: The app itself is pretty fine, lots of stuff and well payed out. I just have an issue with the amount of scammers or false advertisers out there. Their report feature has nothing for false advertising and their profile design makes it hard for them to be found. I feel as though requiring peoples first legal name to be their profile name and have picture verification for people who want to sell would make this app safer. More accessible scam articles would be nice as well. I’m sad to say that I will be going through with police because of this app and false advertising but it’s not necessarily this apps fault, but I feel as though they could take more action to prevent or protect.",2

Facebook market place over 3k clicks 200 saved and 98 shares, an it's Free ! I live in the city there's no way I will be getting 1 view a week. Anyways needless to say I sold the motorcycle on Facebook market place where selling and marketing is much better.

It’s also SO ANNOYING when the sellers have items to sell and just refuse to respond. I’m not talking about a few days or even a week bcz sometimes ppl are out of town or just busy. I’m talking about those sellers tht don’t respond for 15-30 days. Thts inexcusable ‼️close those accounts.",3

I found one truck listed to 6 different names and accounts all requesting to contact them through another email. Evidently there is no oversight because I have reported this NUMEROUS times and all I receive is the same, old, generated reply. Then the same truck, same picture and price listed 4 or 5 more times the next day. It’s not only vehicles, it’s several items. With a little investigation and oversight this could be an amazing site to post, sell and buy but, the way it is now, it’s not worth the effort to visit. I will be deleting the app.",2

A couple of things are annoying, and I’d like to see them changed.

1. Leave my search settings alone. I nearly always want within 20 miles, no shipping. It works for me, and I can expand it easily if I’m willing to travel to pick something up.

2. Let us delete more than one ❤️saved item at once, currently it is a time-waste to delete unwanted saves.

3. Explicitly ban keyword stuffing, when I look for a Chevrolet bumper, I don’t want to see an RX-7 with 30 keywords at the bottom. Give us a spam report button to go along with it.

4. It would be nice to be able to put people on “ignore” for whatever reason, when you just don’t want to see their posts, but have no desire or reason to report them.

Local police contacts (Someone who actually investigates or takes reports of crimes committed on the app) Currently its a mess to report something in a hurry.

Otherwise, thank you for a handy app!",2
1566,Beware of scammers and Don’t come alone: There are a lot of scammers on here and I mean a lot. Shoes and electronics. I met dudes on here trying to sell me fake shoes claiming they were Brand new. Some of the items will have issues not showed in pictures or mention.  I even had guys trying to sell me fake iPads and iPhones. Even when selling someone will say one price and low ball you in person. I had two meetups for some shoes and a tablet in one day. I check the shoes and they were fake went to the next guy for the tablet and it was fake too. iPad had a plastic screen and wouldn’t connect to the hotspot. BRING A FRIEND! To be safe and have them double check the item as well. Offer up needs a phone number verification to limit the accounts and keep track of people who have been reported as scammers.,1
1567,"Almost 5 months & still no response: Wow, almost 5 months & still no solution to fix my account so once again I will explain my situation on what happened exactly. On the night of September 18th I reposted all my stuff which was (tools) nothing prohibited since I've been posting tools since forever. I woke up and my account wasn't working anymore, I then email you guys every day from that day on and I still haven't heard back from you guys. It's quite upsetting since I've been a member since 2016, I'm verified and I have outstanding ratings! It's going to be January in like a few days and I have yet to hear back from you guys. You guys tell me on Twitter to email you and I do but it's useless because still NOTHING. It'll be nice to hear back and find a way we can fix this ongoing issue.",1
1568,"Shadowban: The app developers are so stupid. 

First off, sometimes i try to make a new post but the info for my previous post is still there. I’ll restart the app but it doesnt help. So i delete the info thinking it will start a new post anyway but instead it ends up just editing my old post into the new one and i lose my old post but it keeps all the views and messages. So, i would go back and re-edit the post back to the old info and try again. 

It took me a couple times to realize what happened and offerups dumb algorithim must be thinking i am making duplicate posts or something because they shadowbanned me. Almost all of my posts are no longer searchable. Messaged them 3 times for help but each time they gave me a different generic response with no real help. First they said my “items are still searchable and im wrong”, then they said “this is an issue affecting several users and we’re working on it”. 

i get that this app has an issue with a lot of scammers, but If their solution is to just be so ready as to block any sellers, even the reputable fully verified good ones, then they wont last long and the community wont grow.",1

What should I do?",5
1570,"Server Crashes: App works just as intended most of the time but there are two glaring problems. One is the number of server crashes that occur on the app. IDK if it’s for maintenance or other but the app is frequently not functional. Secondly is the scammers, and boy there’s a lot. Many bot account set up to try and get cell information from the seller as soon as an item is posted. They target new listings so anything that you just posted and get a message on is most likely a scammer. I have seen very little from the company to combat this as well. Reporting the account does little I’ve had the same account ask me for my information multiple times even after reporting.",3
1571,"Shouldn’t have combined OfferUp and letgo: I keep getting shadow banned for no reason,which means  no one can see my posts even though I had yet to post anything , messages, or anything. It’s like my profile wasn’t even there. When I contacted them to ask why people couldn’t see my messages, they said I was going against the community guidelines and removed my account from the site. It makes no sense because I had never even posted anything and my messages for people where just to purchase stuff, innocent messages. I didn’t do anything against their community guidelines. Not to mention that the app glitches a lot on top of the fact that they’re shadow banning people! What a shame that they combined OfferUp and letgo because letgo wouldn’t shadow ban me for no reason and now I have neither.",1

I had to wait for my payment, until I shopped the item and the buyer had 3 up to like 3 days to inspect and give feedback on the item. Before money was released to me. 

So for example my Nintendo 3DS, I packaged and shipped it. Offer up took there payment and held it before I shipped my item. After they got the item and said it was perfect my money was released and deposited.",5
1573,No longer my favorite app: I had this app for a couple of years now. It was one of my favorites until all the changes happened... for some reason I can’t no longer buy nor sale. Idk if maybe someone reported me but I really don’t see why. Never had a problem! I made 2 different accounts and I still can’t use any of it. I know the same thing happened to my sister. I tried many ways to see if It’s fixable. Nope nothing has worked so I guess now the next thing to do is to delete the app😢. Time to give a try to a different one.,5
1574,Good app just inefficient for buying: This is a absolutely wonderful app to buy and sell however its hard to buy and sell if nobody get notifications or notified people want the stuff they have. If I was in development of this app I would at least force a phone number to be linked to the account and force notifications. I’m sure everyone has been around the bush with a couple of people offering just what you need you ask about it then the conversation never kicks off because the seller doesn’t reply.....ever. Please look into this issue people want to buy thing from people faster,4
1575,"STAY AWAY!!: OfferUp used to be a great marketplace to buy/sell used goods. Now, they’ve implemented a feature that requires a credit card authorization to submit offers— Once the seller accepts, a hold is placed on your CC until you pickup the item. Only problem is that when a seller refuses to sell the item (even admitting several days after I made the offer that the item is no longer for sale) OfferUp won’t release the hold for a week and then you have to wait 3-4 days on top of that for your bank to release the hold. When contacting customer service, their response is:
“We understand the frustration that comes with a transaction like this, and we hope your future purchases go smoothly.”

And yes, my future transactions will go smoothly because I just deleted this app",1
1576,"Stay away it’s a scam: This company will have you ship your item and then cancel it in the middle of shipping and then the people who ordered your item get your product for free. OfferUp does not have proper customer service. You can not talk to anyone and usually you don’t get paid. I am still waiting on my funds for a little Portable TV I sold. When you print the label it shows that offer up is the sender in the system but you’re the sender so if anything happens to your package during shipping it goes to offer up even though it doesn’t belong to them. I don’t know how this App is still in business. I will no longer be stolen from, you guys have been warned.",3
1577,"B.S.: Let me start by saying that I had 24, 5 star reviews from sales and purchases I’ve made on the app. But yesterday my account got banned because apparently I kept posting items that weren’t allowed on the app and they said they sent me notifications about them which I never received (if I did I would’ve removed the items like any rational being would). Anyways I contacted customer support and nothing was resolved they just removed my account. >:(. So all the time building that trust and interacting with strangers was for nothing because I’m not getting my account back. So users of this app be careful with what you post or you might get your account banned. I’d give 0 stars if I could. This is ridiculous. Also I can’t create another account because it will just get deleted.",1
1578,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE BAD SET UP: I downloaded this app thinking it would be a great way to recycle old things / get new things. Bought something to test it out and boy was that the worst mistake. The guy I was in contact with never actually sent my item out and ended up canceling after a few days. I contacted support because it “states” that “get the item protection or money back” since it was to be shipped and even stated i would be refunded after he cancelled. Anyway I tried contacting them 3x and no answer at all from anyone! I’m so disappointed. I’m guessing I’m scammed out my money. I never write reviews and I’m writing this to warn others of the shady stuff going on here. They even have a section stating about how to handle scams and get police and other red flag stuff once you read through their stuff. Beware!,1
1579,"Offer up’s new “hold for pickup” change has ruined the app: I have been using offer up as a primary means of my retail business for 4 years. Ever since Offer Up has implemented the “hold for pickup” only tab I have seen business decrease 80-90%. I am absolutely certain that the reason is people want to make a cash offer without needing to put in all their banking information and definitely don’t want to make a digital commitment to an item they aren’t sure about. This was a community that ran on trust and the relationship built by buyer and seller where cash is easy and intimate. 
If offer up doesn’t change this feature or at the least make cash offers an option I think it’s time we all moved to let go or an alternate app that makes it easier for sellers and buyers alike.",1
1580,"NOTIFICATIONS / DM, needs a fixing: Hands down one of the best app for trades and quick sells. I haven’t dealt w a bad business yet w another person but if that does happen I hope OfferUp will help in every way they can to resolve the issue. The only con I have so have is that the notification needs to be more “aggressive” about people messaging back. I’m having issues when I don’t see no new notification but when I check my inbox they replied. 
Thanks in advance and I hope we get an update to fix that. Or just change the whole messaging system. It blows.",5
1581,"Bad Business Practices: The app seems decent at first. I sold a few things, but received a lot of bad offers. Also, most people don’t even give you a rating after a sale. Now The Important Part. It’s true that after a short period of time, the app blocks your ability to edit or archive posts and also blocks you from replying to messages. Everything is held for ransom by trying to Force you to sign up for TruYou. The scheme is, they ask for ID, to sell your personal information to advertisers, but tell you it’s for safety reasons. So other users can know who you are. It’s a fraudulent practice and the app should be removed from the App Store. I will provide the information I gathered to report it to Apple. I’d suggest you do the same. By the way, most of these 5 star reviews are fake accounts.",1
1582,"No reply: Edit* costumer service is horrible. I had an item shipped to me and the person who sold it scammed me with a rigged item. It was a cheap knock of version of the original item she claimed it to be. I paid $100 for a $20 item. I emailed the company (offer up) and they told me to send photos of the product I received. I did that a month ago. I have not gotten a follow up email. If it was a small lose I wouldn’t care too much, but $100 just thrown out the window. This was a gift and Im just trying to get this resolved but have had no help whatsoever with this. I made a previous review and was told to email their different contact email, which I did, twice. No reply since then. Been past a month now. Great app but I recommend not trusting this company if something goes wrong. Don’t expect help.",1

Must be aware though of people you buy from. Some people on here are just trolls and will harass you. There’s also a shipping option so you have a higher chance to sell your item! I have used their shipping service and it’s great. Offer up does charge you a small fee that is charged when you make a sale(they remove it off your order when someone buys it). Super fun and easy just be safe everyone (:,5

After using the app and paying to promote my item I went back on the app and they were trying to force me to give a picture of my personal information and would not allow me to use the app. I emailed a few people at offerup and was told that the TrUYou was not mandatory, yet the app won’t let you continue to use it unless you send them your I.D. I don’t trust sending my I.D. To people in a app! They scammed me by having me pay them to promote my item then after they get the money they try to force me to send them I.D. I’m looking in to legal actions because I paid for a service and they didn’t come through on their part!

Use LetGo or other apps these people are scamming people!",1

But just like some applications, as time passes and updates are made they sometimes go the wrong way. For the past 2 months I haven't been able to send or receive offers. Messages to sellers are not received even though on my end it says it has been sent..it has just become a problem more constant, but most important a waste of time when you are trying to buy or sell and the platform that you use doesn't work. Even costumer service has become worst as to not reply to emails. I think it might be time for me to look for something else..Hope they can go back to the way it was or at least fix the glitches.",1

My biggest complaint about the app is the users.  even when you make it clear that your requested price is firm and you have no interest in haggling, they pay no attention and DM with lowball offers. Then they get all pissy when you say no to them.  Anything I’ve posted, I’ve ended up selling through other means at the asking price, or donating to charity rather than give it to some loser to turn around and resell.",4

Tried multiple times and still no email to reset password. No problem getting emails from other companies. Tried reaching out to OfferUp customer service several times.

After the first few days of listing the console, it proceeded to get zero additional views. The only two real humans I communicated ultimately weren’t interested in the console. Though it’s easy to create a listing and utilize this app to attempt to sell things, they need a better system to keep bots and scammers at bay, perhaps some form of verification. 

To finish off, I want to clarify that I was selling the console for $75, about $15-25 less than what most people have theirs listed for. My account was fully filled out and verified.",3
1591,"No way to relist unless you buy the “promote” option: For TWENTY bucks a month you can promote ONE item as often as you like. Honestly, OFFERUP would be better if your listing could be brought back to the top of searches by decreasing the price, like most other selling site’s. It would be so much better on both end’s. And, please offer better shipping price’s for your item’s up to 2lbs instead of 8oz! The fee’s are a bit HIGH for no advertisement outside of the app like Mercari, Poshmak & EBay. Get up to speed and you could get a lot more clientele in both aspect’s of selling & buying.",4

I now can’t ask for a refund because the seller is banned, but I can’t even login to file a claim for purchase protection. I’ve emailed multiple times about my case only to receive an automated message saying that I am banned! Im being scammed for over $1000 dollars and OfferUp support is not helping at all!

There’s no option to repost with the content, they act like you have unlimited time to dedicate to keep reposting things when you’re not violating any standards. I’ve had this happen twice and it comes down if you’re going to keep having people haggle the price down to zero profit and you’re constantly fighting OfferUp to keep listings up - it’s a sunken cost to list on the platform. There should be a manual review process option and the original listing should be able to be reposted if it passes said process to keep sellers from having to dump massive amounts of time into listings that aren’t turning much of a profit (if any) anyways.",1

You can put in faithful work and build an account with 100s of reviews and followers but they can permanently shut it down in a snap. Some users ,including myself, resulted to buying second phones just to start over. But I eventually decided to no longer bow to this monopolistic company so Ive stopped using entitely.

I would recommend using another app as this one is full of shops and scammers and very difficult for people to find certain items from individuals.

Turns out the seller weighed the packs and scammed us. 

I tried leaving a negative review but offer up is smart. It knows most people are scammers and they don’t want all these sellers to have negative reviews. You can’t leave a review unless the seller leaves you a review first. My account was also shadow banned for no reason.

I call them and they say they found it cheaper, or their car broke down (got that excuse 3 times in one week!)

I have shopped on Letgo from Dallas region to the California regions and I have purchased beautiful high end pieces. 

Since, I join offer up and Letgo I have encountered people do not reply to my offer/ asking questions.  It has happened so often, now, I believe that these items must be produced by a bogus account(s).  In other words, be responsive or say that the offer is to low, or/and the price is non negotiable . 
I should not have to seemingly beg to buy any merchandises. 

Some people don’t clean or dust their items before they sell them to you.

It was much better than other selling apps, in my opinion, and even better now that it has merged with another one. So, for the intended purposes of the app, I’d give it 5 stars. I’ve deducted one star bc I’m noticing that the app is automatically reading one’s clipboard (according to the message I receive from iOS 14), which is unnecessary. OfferUp, if your users are knowledgeable enough to post photos and write ads for their items, they can be left to actually paste copied info themselves.

1610,"NOT HAPPY WITH MERGE: Letgo was in my opinion the prime location to go for selling items locally, it was extremely user friendly and had such a great flow of users to keep it active and worthwhile. They also had things in place such as month long listings so that nothing on letgo is an “old listing,” meaning it could possibly be not available or in some cases (such as on offerup) the listing has been active for several years and the seller no longer even uses the app.
In my opinion offerup should do everything in their power to restructure the app to follow letgo’s model. It was so much better as a user/seller/buyer. Would happily raise my rating of this app if they do some fine tuning to their app, taking in the good things of letgo’s previous app rather than just absorbing it and deleting it off the appstore :/",1
1611,Good but needs work: Do to the fact that people can have things posted for years is stupid. There needs to be a limit of how long you can have something posted before it expires and you either have to re post it or forget about it. This would make searching for things easier knowing that the person is still selling the item. I feel a lot of items have been sold and people forget to mark the item as sold. Offer Up it’s time to up your game....,5
1612,"Love the app but has issues.: Every so often the app will change my location to Seattle. It will change my cover photo to another photo automatically. I have uninstalled the app , and reinstalled. I have changed the location in my account setting. I have changed it also on the ad itself. And as soon as I refresh the ad its back to Seattle. The most frustrating thing ever. To have to keep taking my ad down just to put it up again. The app would for me be a solid 5 stars if not for this off again on again problem.",4
1613,Reliable and impressive: I have been using the app now for over a year and it's been really very helpful. Last month I finally tried buying something that was far way and the process was actually very easy. Obviously not being able to see the product in person is a risk but the app actually followed up after I received the item to see if it was satisfactory. Fortunately the seller was also very helpful which made the whole process very successful. Even tracking was provided which is always a big plus.,5
1614,"New feature: Would love to see the ability to have a Pending status, so when an item is potentially being sold keep that in status so other interested parties do not continue to ask about item or to give them the warning it may not be available still.  From a seller point of view though, you may not want to remove the item until it has completely left your possession and as we have had instances where the first buyer may fall through and so don’t want to set the item sold prematurely.",5
1615,"Flakes: Can’t tell whether ppl are flakier here or on L***o.  Eventually you may be able to sell your item/s, but until then you will deal with a bunch of ppl who will waste your time by inquiring about an item and never seeing your response or saying they can meet at a date in the future and you’ll never hear from them.  Or they’ll be extremely interested, sending a lot of messages and question marks when you don’t respond quickly enough only to come back later to say they can’t buy it anymore.  I’m venting my frustration here because I don’t want to be one of those sellers who has to put a bunch of admonishments and disclaimers about no lowball offers and serious bidders only.  

From the buyer’s side, at least half if not more of the ppl selling iPhones on here are scammers",1
1616,"Great experience but no support: I’ve been using OfferUp for three years and I’ve had a pretty good experience. 

Although sometimes buyers flake and I wish I could rate the people who ghost me when we are supposed to meet - but you can only rate people when you sell to them. 

Also - there is no way to submit a support ticket. The Community Forum is down, no contact information is provided, and no way to get help with a technical issue. Only support articles. There is a potential bug and I can’t find anywhere to report it other than right here. I’m a loyal user and wish I could get actual support.",4
1617,"Good....but beware: The app works well, functionality wise. I would recommend you keep your sales local. I listed a imac and place and selected i would ship it. So then the listing gets posted to other locations. Thats when the scammers started messaging me. Each potential buyer said they would pay over $100 over my asking price. Asking for my phone number, paypal information etc... I sent one potential buyer a paypal link to pay, but the buyer insisted on getting my email address, name and phone number. Each buyer i had all asked for the same same information. I let OfferUp know of the issues. Like i said i would just keep your sales local.",3
1618,"Very concerned customer!!: I would enjoy it a lot if I was able to use it. My account keeps getting banned and I’ve never been sure why. So right now I just look at the stuff but I can’t sell or buy. It would be nice if someone reached out letting you what happen and why and they gave you the opportunity to plead you case. Also, it would be nice is your support team had put an urgency on responding to customers. Sometimes I wait almost two weeks for a response when I message them about something. When I get a response back it such a canned email as if they could care less that you messaged them. I’ve been using other apps to buy and sell my stuff and I’ve been recommending them to my friends and family. 

Please fix my account ASAP so that I can use it. 

Thx!!",1
1619,"Seller great buyer not so much: I think the UI is intuitive and easy to use. No extra steps or complicated process. 
To sell, it’s easy and if you want to pay to bump up your item. Fair. 
As a buyer, it’s easy to search and filter/sort is nice. What I don’t like is there is so much scam (mostly via PayPal). Yes, you can report. But the item stays on your page after you report it. Why? It can stay on other people’s page but it should not show up on my page anymore.
Secondly, there are just too many fake ones. OfferUp probably doesn’t have the algorithm to detect scam or has a poor one. It’s basically not fun to search after two weeks of use. I may use the app to sell stuff but will not waste time to search here to buy anymore.",2
1620,"Moving pains: Having to move to a new place is always a tedious ordeal, on top of that when you’re all settled in and unpacked you realize that your furniture does not match your new lifestyle or your new space, you need to let go of some things and acquire things that reflect the new you....thanks to OfferUp I was able to do exactly that #Outwiththeoldinwiththeslightlyused. I was able to furnish my new place at a fraction of the price, and since the items were from locals with the same objectives, I was able to make new friends along the way.",5
1621,"Too many scams !!!: I’ve used this app for so long and every single time I try to purchase something either the person doesn’t come out there house asks for money right away the items are damaged and they don’t respond , their customer service is the worst doesn’t help at all don’t waste your money especially buying phones people will take your money I don’t trust this app I’ve driven 45 mins for someone and they lied about the item offer up doesn’t really do anything about . I’ve done a police report on a seller before . This app is just all over the place and untrustworthy I’ve had too many bad experiences with it and it’s not safe either sometimes people will send you somewhere unsafe so make sure to stay safe to me I’d rather just use Facebook buy/sell section",1
1622,"Good App-Can be Better!: This is a good app. It's easy to use and it does facilitate the sale. This app and other apps need to improve the activity and participation of both the sellers and potential buyers. Sellers and buyers must remain engaged and responsive. Also these types of apps must vet users to ensure bogus accounts are NOT being created. I've experienced potential buyers go through the sale process, getting questions answered, agreeing on the sale and then the buyer completely disengages from communication without cause or notice. There has to be courtesy and respect by all users.",5
1623,"Shipping is awful: I decided to use the shipping feature and it is taking forever to receive $69! It’s been almost 2 weeks since we started the process and the money still isn’t in my account. No other platform takes this long. I’m not selling stuff for fun, I’m selling because I’m in a bind. I really shot myself in the foot by using this feature. OfferUp is taking so long it makes me feel like this is on purpose. Are you guys making money off of interest by holding our money?! You take a cut already. It does not take an additional 8 days to get that money to me after the client receives their item in satisfactory condition. What a joke. I liked OfferUp before this experience... I should’ve sold my item to a low baller locally. At least I’d have gas money for the week to get to work..",1
1624,"Glitches: This app is in some need of a fix. I’m still able to post things and sell them but every time I go to try to mark something as sold it says I have a connection error and won’t load my items. I’ve gotten on WiFi, took WiFi off, deleted the app and restarted it. I was able to mark 2 things sold and then it goes back to a connection error. Theirs definitely no connection error as I’m able to post and get messages. The items just won’t load period. So I’m getting flooded with emails and have to tell people the item is not available anymore. It’s getting annoying.",4
1625,"Knowledgeable: He's the most educational succulent green thumb teacher ever. I just started learning about these beautiful plants and Mikey was such a great teacher and patient with me. His backyard was so mesmerizing it was so hard for me to stay focused on one type of succulent plant. I wanted to know about all of them. I wanted to load up the entire car and go home hahaha. Love his positive vibe and his energy, and I appreciated the time that he gave to me to educate. 

Thank you again, Mikey, you are such a great person and have become a positive friend to me.",5
1626,"No Push Notifications: I’m experiencing an ongoing issue with the app where push notifications are not being delivered. Despite having all my notification settings correctly configured both within the app and on my iPhone, and even after uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I still do not receive notifications. This issue has persisted for years, and it’s particularly frustrating as I miss timely offers on items. Consequently, I often discover outdated messages days or weeks later, by which time potential buyers have lost interest. 
I enjoy the platform, but this has been very frustrating experience missing out on offers.",2
1627,"This App gets less useful over time.: I’ve been a long time buyer/seller, I used OfferUp the moment it came out, LetGo aswell.

This app has become infested with ads, and “shipping” listings are unavoidable regardless of what search parameters I set.

Regardless of what distance I set, I see ads from hundreds of miles away. If I accidentally click on one single listing (say, a care bear for example), I will get bombarded with stuffed animal listings for a week, losing on the listings that are actually relevant to me, all due to one singular misclick.

The same goes for the ads, which seems suspiciously sensitive to clicking, and have a tendency to open even when scrolling (when real listings do not).

I’m very disappointing, as this app used to be a great place to buy/sell, and consistent at that. Now, at least in my area, it seems most people have moved to other marketplaces and the ads have filled the gaps.

Unless you live in a 10M+ population city, this app isn’t worth the trouble in my opinion. I hope it improves, as I loved it when it wasn’t this way.",2
1628,"USED TO BE GOOD: Rewind 3 years ago and this was my favorite second-hand marketplace. You used to be able to literally search for anything and at least 2 or 3 would be listed in your area. Surrounding Seattle was such a hub for offerup-ers that when I moved to Tampa I didn’t realize it wouldn’t be that way everywhere. I had stopped using it while living in Florida, but now I am back and in the last 3 years this app has absolutely gone down hill. It is so junky, and ad-y and garbage-y it’s infuriating to even try to use. I imagine most people are on FB marketplace now which is probably why OfferUp has also tried to become a job search engine in the last 3 years?? If you can’t beat them, at least when to fold em, that’s all I’m saying.",1
1629,"UPDATE.: Customer service is now much better than before. App does bug but not as much as before, which is great to see the company continuously working on it. I have yet to use their shipping since I am afraid of a chargeback to someone that I am not meeting in person (not sure if there is buyer protection but if there is promote that more so we see it) Now I just wish they had a renew after 7 days or something so I dont have to repost over and over. Also, be able to make edits on PC as well as in app.",5
1630,"Ghost buyers: I used to love selling and buying on OfferUp. Unfortunately, with the recent updates there’s been an influx of advertisements and ghost buyers. I’ve had more ghost buyers pretend to be interested in my items and no show to our meetings. Sincerely, it is disappointing and frustrating when you take the time to post and item and respond to messages, answer questions, and try to be helpful with negotiations for the buyer to not even show up or they get an address and end up deciding they’re no longer interested. I wish the app could navigate in filtering out ghost buyers and advertisements. Also, it’s annoying to want yo buy an item and they allow furniture or car companies to also sell on the app too. Please fix this.",1
1631,"Was good, now it won’t load on PC.  Something about location services.: No proxy.  No VPN.  I even turned off Ublock Origin completely.  Nothing.  Still says I’m on a VPN when I’m not.  Flipped over to Edge, no add ons there.  Still says I’m using a VPN and won’t load.  Utterly ridiculous.  Even if I was, who cares?  That’s normal operating procedure these days given all the account data scrapes happening.  It’s basic safety 101.

It’s bizarre and annoying.  So now, I’m supposed to squint at a 5” screen on my phone instead of being able to see the images, stress free, on a 40” monitor.  I hate FB, but the user friendly wins, sadly, by simply loading the site.

I’m not 20.  I want a bigger screen than a phone screen.",2
1632,"Answer your ads please: The concept is good, but why can’t people respond to offers that you make on the items they have for sale. If the items are already sold, mark them as such or take them down. I have on numerous occasions made offers or agreed to the asking price of items and have gotten no response back from the seller. One seller in particular I have requested to buy an item over 10 times and have never gotten a response. I have even asked if the item was still for sale and got nothing as a response. There should be a way to report sellers who do not respond to inquiries.",3
1633,"My post was deleted with no specific explanation: First of all the experience using offer up is annoying due to advertisements. Secondly my post was deleted with no specific explanation to why. The post was my sprinter van seats for sale, simple description and clear pictures of the seats. There was no breaking any rules in my post. For some reason offer up would delete my post because of their “guidelines”. I contacted offer up asking what rules did I break? Offer up never responded with explanation. I tried reposting couple more times but my post would get deleted again and again. 

So I deleted my account and removed the app of my phone. Wouldn’t recommend this app. 

To add I had 5 stars rating from sellers/buyers on this app.",1
1634,"You can do better..!!: I used for the last 2 year this App and yes.. they improved… but still are some problems you never fixed. Like in a Nation wide sales, once my customers get the product they check if everything it’s ok , you sent me a reminder to rate my customer 5 start or 3 or 2 starts .. Once I submitted… I got the message “ Something went Wrong “ try later, so I try again.. and I got..” Error, You‘ve already rated” .
Because the App doesn’t allow me to rate my customer… I don’t get any rate from my customer on Nation wide sales in the last 5 months.!! 
I am tired to sent you emails..!! Your people told me .. login and log out, uninstall the app, down again the App… but this issue still is going on .!! 
You improved a loots thighs for yourself..!! But not for users like me ..!! 
I hope some of yours experts can fix this problem soon..!! 
Thank you",5
1635,Needs better customer support: Wish you people at OfferUp would get a phone line setup for support. It’s basically useless through email and takes days of back and forth bologna. I’ve had the issue where things I post don’t actually post and never get any Views no mattwe how long they are up. When sending messages they say it went through but they don’t actually. I never get a response it’s like the whole app is dead. It’s as if I’m shadow banned idk why. Can someone fix this issue for good. I’ve been trying to sell stuff for months. Going back and forth with support has been useless. I tried using a separate account and now that account has the same issues when it was working just fine before. Wth.,1
1636,"Slow Results: I always had more success with Letgo than offerup while the apps were separate, although I listed on both. Now with the merger I continue to list but have no inquiries from this app. I did just have my first sale since the merger this week, 2 months into it. Any other items marked sold have come from another platform. It’s just not as friendly an app in my opinion. 
The home page is cluttered with ads and not pleasant to browse. Shipping seems to be pushed, so that takes away from it being a local exchange platform. But that’s just my opinion. I’m sure my community and items for sale are part of the issue as well.",3
1637,"Biased against second amendment.: This app makes it a real bear to try to sell old reloading brass. Same for BB/pellet rifles. You have to call them “poppers” or something to not trigger their software as it hunts for hot-words that will get your post taken down in a matter of minutes. 
  Buried in their policies/disclaimers they say you cannot sell items that are hazardous or can cause harm. Well, the developers are clearly biased towards firearms, ammunition, and related. Their image search will pull your post if it shows whole ammunition or firearms. 
  Oddly enough though, I’ve seen knives, axes, brass knuckles (illegal in my state), chemically pure mercury metal (toxic in its own right, but also used in detonators), and OfferUp doesn’t take those posts down. It’s almost like they have a political stance in favor of gun control or something.",1
1638,"New Offer Up/Letgo is trash: Was never a big fan of offer ups format and used Letgo a lot. Offer Up took letgo over and merged it into their own format. They literally took away everything good about letgo and now I’m stuck with one less good platform to shop and sell on. Majority of ads are big box retailers, dealers or fake. Just horrible. What a shame to kill a perfectly good selling/buying platform and a whole happy customer base. I own two competing businesses on the same street yet no one knows, because ultimately no matter how good I think I am, many people will go to my competition for their own reasons. The diff is when I bought him, I left the business completely intact with the same name. Why?  Because the people who don’t go to me and go to him are still putting money in MY pocket",1
1639,"Update ruined app, don’t use this for local finds: Used to love this app, been using for years. App barley works (get error message on many pages), and there is so many scams/ads!! Very few local postings. Most is ads and online links to items. update was done and now the app lags, often doesn’t work entirely, and I HATE the format of this app now. Not user friendly, takes more work than before to navigate. 

Not sure who in offer up approved this horrible update but please change it back! Previous version actually worked.

Also reporting of postings should be taken more seriously- for example, I reported a post for “retarded dog, need to get rid of ASAP” and it included photos of a old dog. Looked like animal abuse situations I reported and Offer up won’t take the post down. Wow.",1

Use this app get what you want so what you don’t I have use this app to sell vehicles without any problem. Definitely a good app if you’re moving and you need to get rid of your furniture or if you’re just starting out and you need furniture. Also a good app for people who are sometime short on cash for basic needs there’s usually a lot of people posting things like laundry soap body wash unused of course, For less than you would pay at the store.",5
1641,FAKE ACCOUNTS: This app used to be good but now it’s garbage they’ve even gone as far as now not allowing you to get your items for sale out there they try to charge you so much money now and make you lower it so low to the point you’re giving it away also they have fake accounts as soon as you post they contact you and throughout you having items for sale they have these fake accounts ask you is this item still available as soon as you post these fake accounts make you feel like people are interested and I trying to contact you but really they’re fake accounts offer up should be ashamed of their selves they’ve completely went left field with this you’re better off using other apps and craigslist to sell your items!!!,1
1642,"Waaaaay better than Craigslist: Great app.  Search is much better than Craigslist.  It actually returns what I am looking for.  People can game Craigslist search too much and I will get a hundred car dealer hits if I am searching for, say, a table.

One thing this app really needs though, a way to easily search different regions.  For certain items I am willing to drive further.  Let me set the miles away From my set location that I want to search.  The preset distances are too restrictive.   I know the miles to the towns I am willing to consider, offer up does not.",5
1643,"Sold items deleted faster: I think would be better if there was a way that items already sold would be removed faster, when people sale and don’t remove them. It’s frustrating to look through stuff that’s been on a while and try figure out if it’s still for sale or did they just not remove it. Like a time line to sale or it drops and u have tore load so nothing on there is old and just out there but had already been sold and not removed.",5
1644,"Great app with one big downside...: Great app, it’s maybe the most popular place to get used or even some new items. The layout and formatting is great with no bugs I’ve seen.  But they implemented a TruYou verification system horribly.  To get verified you have to give your number and drivers license... not everyone is comfortable doing that.  And the worst part is the app doesn’t let you message people who are verified unless you get verified too.  At the very least it should let you buy and sell from who you want and let the individual make the decision of whether or not to interact with the unverified person.  Unless you want to give away all the information on your drivers license to the company you lose out on half the offers and buyers on the site.  Horrible feature!",1

Not only does the site fails to promote the item , I recieve messages in my inbox that goes as far as 6 weeks back of replies of those who want to purchase it... which makes my profile replies unreasonably late so therefore I’m unable to sell my item as fast as I would like to.

1647,"Abuse of push notifications: To users: OfferUp is repeatedly abusing push notifications that spam users with messages to open the app. 

The Developer Response to user feedback on this is to address individual complaints by asking for account info, presumably to hide this spam from specific accounts, rather than to shut off unwanted marketing push notifications altogether.

Users want push notifications for communicating with their buyers and sellers without being held hostage to spammy advertisements about sweet deals, great deals, finding deals, saving big, or the like. At this time, users have to choose between receiving spam along with essential communications vs shutting them off at the iOS setting level and not receiving anything at all from their buyers and sellers. Using their in-app push notification settings evidently doesn’t resolve this issue, as mine are all turned off, and I’m still receiving marketing notifications- most recently prompting me to see what my “neighbors are selling on OfferUp!”.

To the developer: please review your iOS developer guidelines to ensure you are not violating terms. At this time, please know that you are.",1

I no longer receive notifications regarding messages and items I was interested being sold etc. I believe other people are experiencing the same thing because sellers are telling me they never received notifications in regards to my messages or offers etc. My other complaint is the option to no longer search for vehicles under a 30 mile radius. I don’t have time to travel far for a vehicle specially considering terrible traffic here in Southern California.  Please fix the bugs and bring back the option to shop under a 30 mile radius.

And as soon as you even think of glancing at an item (maybe even to just see what the heck it is or you’re not interested but curious what they’re asking for something... etc...) you’re suddenly bombarded with tons of those things - commercial promotions and all. Has totally ruined the experience. Also, why can’t someone establish their own default distance for search? Or at least keep it where they last put it, rather than have to change it every time they get on the app?  Ridiculous!  Why can’t we see asking price before we click on item?",3

Sometimes my messages won’t go through like a normal text would. I received a message 30 minutes after a buyer sent it saying, “I am here.” And I lost a sale. 

This app encourages us not to give out any personal information which I strongly agree with but I have considered giving buyers/sellers my number because of this issue and I found that I am not the only one having this problem. Please look into this, OfferUp!! I really like this app.",4
1652,Way better than yard selling: I'm very happy with this app I've been able to sell several household items. Have had trouble a few times with buyers not following thru and learned quickly not to post an item sold until money is in hand as warned. I've negotiated most of my prices but have been happy with the ability to sell things for what they are worth instead of going thru the trouble of yard sales where no one wants to pay more than a few dollars for anything. And all interactions with buyers who followed thru have been great!,5

Recently I noticed my posts would get 0 views, followed by me not being able to message people to buy items. My posts would not show up on the main viewing board either just on my page and showed no views or messages. I made a new account even thinking that would solve the issue and it did not? Crazy because I did not break any rules on their terms and conditions. I'm seeing other people are having this issue as well? Very strange.. I've emailed and no response either? That is terrible customer service. I use this app almost daily to buy and sell. This problem needs to be resolved!",1
1654,"Love OU but few suggestions: I love Offer Up. I have been using it since it was just building up. Its like craigslist only much simpler, easier and safer. 

But I have a few suggestions that would definitely improve the app. 
First of all, please let us delete the sold items. I mean why would I archive the items that are already sold to someone. Those items would clearly belong to someone else now. And keeping an archive of those will only remind me of items that are no longer mine. 

Second, I understand you want to charge for “Bump”. But could you atleast give us 2 - 3 bumps for a month until the item gets enough views. After that you can charge for them as you like. Every item deserves at least 3 bumps. Facebook Marketplace lets you renew post 5 times (once every week). This is really a request.

Other than these, the app is amazing and I hope to buy and sell more stuff from Offer Up.",5

I Contacted them 2 weeks ago through email several times and did not receive any support or emails back, what kind of service is that???  I did nothing wrong for them to block me again, I Use to like offer up as it will sometimes give me potential buyers and i would make one or two sells off the app each month , But now  i have been blocked again So im Done with offer up! screw it!

Not sure if support even looks at the reviews and how many followers one has but I had all 5 star reviews. If I posted anything that went against community standards then it was something minor because I always followed their rules. 

Anyways, employees there really need to review accounts and delete actual spammers and sellers with bad intent, I was not one of them. 

I sell online for a living and having them permanently delete my account with not actual reason is absurd, either way it’s their loss, removing honest sellers. 

Don’t bother with this app, you’ll be bombarded with spam ads. I’ve used the app for a long time and they recently deleted my account without reason.

It keeps saying that my email is already registered. I made another email from scratch, and when I tried to sign up with it, it said, ""Created an account recently?"" No, I did not. . I even tried social media logins and signing in with Apple. This entire app is garbage. Don't waste your time downloading it, because you'll regret wasting your time. The app is a total waste of time. Shame on the OfferUp developers and management team. I remember when this app came out; it was decent, but now it's total garbage. I wish you could rate this piece of garbage a negative zero.",1
1659,"Lost: So I bought some items from offer up, and the first item I was notified that they let the guy know to ship. Well he never did so the let me know from offer up people. I bought 2 other items and I haven’t heard anything but the money has been taken out and is pending. There is no way to get ahold of offer up that I found. They said to go to X and I did and left a note for someone yesterday. Mabye it takes a couple days for them to reply. So for this reason I am making offer up a bad place for a buyer to buy products that have to be shipped. Any issues then I can’t get any help I’d say very bad way to do this.  Atleast make it so buyers can find out about the product they buy. Or thought they bought!!",1
1660,"Love offer up but theres safety concern: I Don’t like how someone searching for a certain specific item can simply click my profile pic and see everything I have for sale thats NOT RIGHT, not safe, no privacy!!!

 Its very intrusive. 
 If someone searches for a bicycle, they are welcome can see the bicycle I have for sale. No problem.

 But I really Don’t like that they can so easily see /by clicking my profile, everything else too. That feature of clicking the profile to see all items for sale should be able to be turned off, Or on…by the user /seller .

If i have a 3,000 dollar diamond ring for sale, and someone wants a bicycle, or something free, im giving away-
why should they get to know that I have a 3,000 dollar diamond ring in my home.

Please let me select whether or not people can click my profile and see everything I have for sale.",5
1661,"Borderline obsolete: the lack of motivation, care, and the desire of innovation is apparent in every crevice of this app. listings being up after 6 years of no activity and scam posts have plagued the offer up ecosystem and the developers have done nothing to improve or at least stop the corrosion of their system. on top of that, the interface has been the EXACT SAME since i started using this app in 2017. it is true that all business models are temporary but the demise of offer up is self inflicted. i recently paid to boost my listing but it did absolutely nothing because all of the users migrated to the superior platform, fb marketplace. it’s only a matter of time that this app becomes completely obsolete, many could argue that it’s too late.",1
1662,"Promoting: Offer up seems to be getting worse preventing me to shop on the offer up app when it’s the same promoted items being shown , for example when I click on an item and when I’m finished looking I then back out and  go back to where I was scrolling ,instead of being where I was at on the home list of items ,I have  to start at beginning of the home list as if I just opened the app to start shopping .
So basically it can take me an hour to find something and then I have to start all over from the beginning and keep scrolling and wasting my time .I don’t have time to be looking at the same items I already scrolled past being lead back to the beginning of the home list",1
1663,"People actually buy my stuff: I used to use Craigslist but never had much luck actually selling anything. Could only get rid of stuff if it was free. Wish I had know about this app sooner. So far I’m four for four with the items I’ve listed, each selling at or close to my asking price. Two items sold same day, one took a couple days and one took about a week. The app itself is easy to use - I’m not super tech savvy and was able to figure it out fine. Couldn’t be happier.",5
1664,"Implement Anti-Scam Scans for Accounts: I got scammed and the person seemed legit, while I understand I made the transaction, why isn’t there better management of scam/fake accounts on this app. I think you guys should make it a requirement to have everyone verify themselves with the blue check mark for better credibility. I made one transaction with someone and that left a good impression at first and then I proceeded to do another one because I thought it would be a good idea since the first time was good but boy was I wrong. ONLY BUY FROM VERIFIED PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WITH RECORDED SALES & FEEDBACK!!! Everyone else is not to be trusted, do in person meetups or do it through Offerup services only! I hope this doesn’t happen to someone else.",2
1665,"Terrible Seller Protection: I recently accepted an offer for an item I was selling. I shipped the item and the buyer received it a few days ago. I have proof that they received the item. However, it seems they did not report it to OfferUp as when I check the status of the transaction it stills says I have to ship it. I have not received any form of payment and I have contacted the buyer. They have not responded. This is a terrible app as it has multiple forms of buyer protection and yet they have no protections for people selling items on the app. They have terrible customer support as I have contacted them about the issue and they have not replied at all. I will not be using this app anymore and I will contact authorities if OfferUp refuses to resolve this issue.",1
1666,"Worst ad experience: Now because offer up has unlimited of 5 star reviews they will junk up the app with ads everywhere in the Home Screen, inside the listing and even in the messages. Not only that when you accidentally touch a banner it will automatically send you to the banners web page.. Automatically.. and that’s 80% of the banners that are randomly placed inside the app. && Now they’re starting to add 2 ads instead of one. So when you swipe on a game ad or even if you’re just using the app it will randomly take you to the ad and make you wait 20 seconds.. exit out then will display another game ad you will have to wait and exit out of that 2nd ad on as well. All at one time…",1
1667,"Worst app ever and crappy support: This app doesn’t work well with a VPN firewall. The worst part was, I’ve used this app at least 3 times in the past two years.. recently I posted an ad to sell my scooter and the system removed it.  I tried again thinking I should pay the fee to promote.. and again removed my ad.  When I contacted Support I was told they removed it because I used a feature that should now includes a fee.. so I replied and asked for a refund of the ad promotion fee I paid and they’ve ignored my request.  

I don’t disagree that they have a right to remove my ad if they feel I didn’t follow the rules.  However they have no right to keep the ad promotion fee I paid since they never posted my ad.  This is borderline illegal.",1
1668,Very happy with the people at offer up!: I have used Offer up for years. Hundreds of sales. With a ton of good reviews! Offer up has been a great place to sell anything! Also purchasing. There’s always great deals and local! I had a curiosity as to how cars were posted by a dealer ship. Next thing I know account executive Adam reached out to me and we are putting together a profile for the dealership I work at. Small curiosity turned into something hopefully big. The guys at offer up are great! Thank you!,5
1669,"Horrible: I’ve had OfferUp since 2018 and I’ve sold And bought over 100 items. I’ve had 5 stars the whole time and all of a sudden OfferUp disabled my account for no reason what so ever. So I called them and asked what happens they replied and told me that I was selling something illegal… like what I didn’t! They didn’t even give me a warning or anything they just disabled my account. Then I was like okay stuff happens so I tried to open a new account because I still have stuff to sell and they won’t allow me to because my email is associated with my previous account. 
Completely unbelievable I’ve used this app for years and they just disable my account all of a sudden claiming something that isn’t true.",1
1670,"3 Star Service: The app is very easy to post and user friendly . There is a lot of scam going on with people who fish for information , also a lot of low ballers and a lot of car dealers messing it up for people who are private sellers . People who are not serious buyers and just waste your time by asking for low offer then not even following up. I have to say the community of offer up consists of people who make low offers , people who want to shop on line at 1am at night and forget it in morning and fake ads that try to get your information . Only 30% of sellers and buyers are real and rest cheap “a” people !",3
1671,"Beware Of Scammers & Customer Buying Protection: I got scammed out of $1450 in cash recently using this app while it provides easy access to products people are selling, the customer service is nonexistent and not helpful beyond the basic FAQ. I have proof and everything but because the transaction isn’t shown as paid on the app and the seller didn’t mark the product as sold now I’m out of money I had invested and it’s nothing that can be done about it. Also, there is no number to call for support from doing a lot of research and an email isn’t readily available listed to contact them either on their site. I even wrote them on Instagram, FB reported the user’s profile on the app no response so I’m never using this app again.",1
1672,"This is what’s so: I’m sure I’ll get a response from the app developer but I’m going to share some continuous problems with the app
First my listings do not show up in searches even when I specifically search for them
I’m paying for the sell faster which only works half the time, not like increased views, but that offer up is charging me and I can’t turn it on or off or even have an option

I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app, signed in and signed out, deleted all my listings and relisted, nothing works.  I’m running the most recent version.
(And yes I have another OfferUp account under a different address and the problems are consistent under the account and multiple devices)

While I’m not here to convince you weather to download the app or not,  this is my experience and it continues to get worse over the last 30 days

If this isn’t resolved soon, first off, I’m going to talk with Apple today about getting charged monthly for something that doesn’t work(the function simply isn’t there), but I’ll be taking the app off my phone and look for something better.",1
1673,"Selling item is annoyingly time consuming: Selling items is annoying, posted couch’s , TVs, tables gaming stuff and seems like only people message are ones that waste your time when your trying to make money. Most people always asking for pictures and you can’t send pictures through app. Low ballers and scams come constantly. Especially in a pandemic and trying to make extra income and buyers waste your energy even though there’s no way to weave that out of the app. There’s a description people don’t ever read seems like. If your looking to sell items, personally it’s a waste of time, if your looking to buy can be a waste of time too because you never get response due to the bad notifications on this app.",1
1674,"No Transparency and Understaffed: None of my messages can be read for buying or selling and I cannot purchase anything online either. I read online that I might have been silently banned, but I do not understand why. It is either a horrible app or they ban and not inform the user. To top it off, they have bad customer service, it takes days to get a response. (I did not receive a message or email about being banned and I no idea what I could have done for a ban. Or the app does not work for messages and buying online.) It is really sad, considering it seemed to have the potential to be great. Overall, just poor execution, either bad app or silent banning, but worse is the frustrating service, no way to correct either.",1
1675,"Just getting worse: This used to be a cool app with a great community. However, there seems to be no real vetting process. Every time I list an item for sale, a clearly fake profile contacts me, and they always want to communicate offline. If OfferUp would insist on more thoroughly filled out profiles, this would greatly reduce the problem. The fees are expensive compared to other sites, like EBay and FB marketplace. Ultimately, I’m finding I get more spam and less buyers. Also, expiring items might be nice. Often, my searches return items that were listed well over 12 months prior and the sellers don’t respond and don’t take down the old ads. Not worth my time unless they can spend some time developing real solutions. Thumbs down.",1
1676,"Used to be great- now it’s one giant bug: This app used to be fantastic. I don’t know what happened but in the past month it’s turned into one giant bug. For weeks it’s been telling me that “something went wrong” and every single user has been deactivated when trying to send messages. After 3 weeks of this, I thought I’d delete and then reinstall the app. I couldn’t get it to take my credentials. I tried resetting my password and only received an error message multiple times. You can’t contact customer service without an account, so i tried to make a new account via Facebook but only got more error messages. I give up. The entire platform is useless now. Such a bummer. If anyone at OfferUp reads this: you need a new coder to fix all your bugs!",1
1677,"Good thing became a scam: For a long time I have used this app along with Letgo. Selling and buying but times have changed and many of the sellers on have been more samers. And the fees are ridiculous for items they don’t own or wearhouse. I’m not sure how letgo is but I’m sure support is non existent. In the early days man’ it’s was awesome but today it’s just a bunch of predators. Also most sellers have not responded in months. And the post is still up. Dude and the ads!!! Are you an eBay subsidiary? Just makes it difficult to do business with a honest Human. I guess I live in a dream land to expect something better! I don’t write many reviews but with all the scams on this platform along with the Ads, it seems that better consumer protections and merchant validation are low priority, prompting to write this.",1
1678,"Update made worse: I have used and loved this app. On the new update it doesn’t seem to let you expand the map or move around to see exactly where an item is located anymore. So unless you happen to know the few roads that show in the little window you’re out of luck determining where the item actually is.  Terrible! If there’s something I’m missing, please let me know. But I couldn’t find anywhere else to ask a question or provide feedback. I also was hoping they’d finally let you save search filters or let you view only the item categories you want but apparently those options were not considered in the update. Maybe I’m the only one that gets tired of constantly having to reset all my filters every time I open the app??",1
1679,"Year old posts and Annoying Ad links: Ever since Letgo became offer up, it’s been horrible.  I’ve bought and sold multiple items on Letgo.  Offer Up however, keeps showing me items that are stated as being posted a year ago!!!!  It even shows me items marked as “shipped”.  Not the little truck on the bottom corner which indicates that it has to be shipped to you, an actual label across the top that says shipped.  Why in the world would I, looking to buy an item, want to see items posted a year ago or already sold?!?!?  I tried searching for a setting to change ... nothing.  The FAQ actually said that posts do not expire.  Maybe they should.   I also limit my search radius and get multiple ads that send me to websites.  Very annoying!!!!",1
1680,"Very user friendly!: Offer up is a really nice tool for buying and selling things locally. I have used craigslist for a great number of years and offer up gives you a simpler way of selling things. Just go to the app snap a picture write a few lines of description set a price and you are done.

On the buying side, it is easy to browse for things that are in your area. I like how you can search based on how new the listing is or how close in location the listing is.

Of course any buying/selling tool requires the use of common sense!",5
1681,Offer up review: Offer up has worked well for me at times when I am trying to sell used or unwanted items. The only issue that have with it is buyers asking to hold something and then not following thru with the deal they made. I do realize unforeseen things happen which may create the issue of not following thru. Other than that offer up has been an awesome way to sell as well as buy things at good prices. The used items I have purchased have been in good condition and were in the shape described in the ad,5
1682,"Not bad..But Subscription is POINTLESS: Ok to move items but just know they move at a snails pace. Views are slow to accumulate even in my location of suburban Chicago.  That being said it absolutely flattens LetGo which I believe needs to be put to rest. Also, as my title suggested don't pad the pockets of the company that operates this app by subscribing to add the ability to ""Promote"" a listing or five listings for an ABSURD monthly fee because the view increase is negledgeable at best but I firmly believe there is absolutely no boost in views whatsoever. Let them make money on the irritating amount of Advertisements which drown out your listings boosted or just listed for free.",4
1683,"Pretty good, in general.: I love Offer Up in general, it’s just the people are looking for deals that rival garage sale prices. People have a tendency to offer half of what you’ve listed an item for. I also notice, lots of flakey people, like they say they want to buy something & then don’t respond past that, rather than letting you know they changed their mind, they just leave you hanging. This isn’t the apps fault, but it does attract less than desirable clientele at times. I’ve sold quite a few things, but it’s been labor intensive to deal with flaky people.",5
1684,"DO NOT USE TO SELL NATIONWIDE: Selling and buying locally, this app is great. 5/5, there are pictures, verification, and ratings of the buyer and/or seller. It’s pretty cool. 

Buying and selling nationwide? Forget about it 

IF the person you’ve made the offer to even responds (most of the time your offer will expire). Once you get through that frustration and actually are able to buy or sell something:

Zero customer support. If you ever have an issue, you are absolutely on your own. Annoying when you’ve sent money to someone you don’t know in cyberspace.

OfferUp sure has a lot of people in the “forwarding email” position. I don’t know another company that even has that as a job yet 99.9% of OfferUp’s customer support is in forwarding emails.

I’ve bought and sold enough items on OfferUp to know that it’s not ready for the bigtime. The long wait times for payment, the money it costs to sell something “nationwide,” and poor customer service need improved on immensely before this app is used for anything but a little better Craigslist. You’re ok as long as you don’t need customer service. 

Nationally selling on OfferUp: STAY AWAY STAY AWAY STAY AWAY",1
1685,"From 5 to 3 stars: Well I everyone. Well idk if you noticed but we now have ads where our incoming messages are. I get a new ad after every new message. That’s sad and ridiculous. I understand servers cost money to run but why don’t you just charge a one time fee for an annual pass., 1 time a year fee for use instead of ads that don’t make you money on every customer. Plus ads make me mad and not want to use the site, which now I don’t use as often as I would before because I don’t want to see ads. But it’s your business so what you like. Don’t think I will pay to use this app along with get ads in my inbox because I won’t do it. Thank you.",3
1686,"Meeting and reviewing the buyer/seller: There’s no one way know why one received 1 Star 2, 3 or 4 star rating. It would be helpful if a buyer/seller that rates less than 5 stars would require a comment therefore the buyer/seller would know what went wrong? And how to fix it and also eliminate petty buyers/sellers.

 I received a 4 star rating on my first sell because I did not bring another item I was selling when the buyer never mentioned they were interested in the other item. At least this is why I think I got a 4 star review but there’s no way to know for sure.",5
1687,"Trash.  That’s what you can sell here: If you have a legit business or quality item, take it to Ebay or Craigslist.  There just isn’t the foot traffic here.  Also, most of the traffic is children, or fresh off the boat.  Selling something new and half price and new here, isn’t enough.  If your item is $500, get ready to field $100 offers, that they don’t even have.  Get ready to block most users who want to pay you $15 for a $70 dress. And 90% of the ‘interest’ leaves you hanging the day of the transaction.  One person asked ME if I could come to them because they didn’t have a car, over 40 minutes away.  This ‘trash’ doesn’t get banned or even warned and they clutter the app.  If it weren’t for them, this app wouldn’t have any foot traffic.  This app is a waste of time",1
1688,Love offer up but not the spam scammers: Love love this app been a member for years. My only issue is a lot of the scam on this app. I feel like this can be controlled. Since we have to be verified I feel like other accounts should follow procedures and make this an option for any user to avoid scam. I run into the scams all the time on my ads. I’m not sure what you can do but it would make this app much even better to avoid scams. I stopped using Craigslists and other selling apps because of scam. Love the app keep up what you guys are doing just work on this scam situation.,4
1689,"Horrible.: It automatically defaults to shipping and defaults that Offer Up deems they want rather than prompting to ask user what their preferences are. Because you can’t put your number on the site it’s too regulated that it makes it non-functional because the person sees that buyer or seller wants an item months later when they see it under their offer up mail. Rounding up around town is not worth $20 just for the HA of meeting up, it’s only worth it for large item sales.  I think the site needs to make it more seller friendly and don’t default to settings without asking the user permissions.  You can’t mark words on your page to let buyers know information, it’s not very customizable friendly. 
Meh",1
1690,"The new pop up ads make it glitch: Super annoying that offerup has pop up ads now. I get they need to make some money, but the ads pop up and sometimes they won’t close when you tap the X or whatever option you’re given to close the ad. And sometimes the options are written in Spanish so I had to google the words to know which was which. When the ad doesn’t close I have to completely close down the app for in the middle of my search and start over. It’s enough to make me wanna stop using offerup. If you’re going to have ads, make sure they work properly.",3
1691,Where are the people?: Really one of the worst apps.. biggest issue is where are the people? Tons of people using this..  but literally nobody contacts. Have the same junk on fb and Craigslist and those get messages.. I tried this app like 4x over the last 6yrs on/off.. and I think in the 6yrs I only ever sold 1 thing and purchased one thing off here… I’m in a decent sized community.. also found out.. that you cannot sell adult magazines on here but it’s a double standard.. penthouse magazines are strictly a no no.. very forbidden… even taboo maybe.. but Hustler.. 👍🙄. Seriously.. they will not allow penthouse due to adult content but Hustlers are fine.. done with this platform.. it has potential but in the 6yrs I’ve tried it.. nothen is working..,1
1692,deleted my account after having 300 positive followers!: My account was deleted a few days ago after i noticed i wasn’t getting any messages/ wasn’t getting my messages sent to others. After I reached out to the customer service they promoted to just delete my account. I’ve been trying to constantly reach out to get my account back but customer service has not helped a single bit. I also have been a paying member of their premium service but it seems like i get treated the same/ worse than normal users. I use this app to provide for my family and to put food on the table. I used to recommend everyone to this app but now i don’t think I can without my account being reinstated.,1
1693,"Needs Better Controls: If you are home in the US and want to buy or sell something, the Offer Up system works well. If you have to go abroad for work, however, it’s maddening that you can’t open the app outside the country- especially when the app keeps telling you that you have notifications. I can find no way to get to said notifications, and more importantly on this work trip I can’t make the alerts go away (many notifications coming to my phone are very important to my job right now, so I need to be able to mark all notifications as read after they’ve come in).
The only soli can figure out - delete the app. Bye bye, OfferUp.",2
1694,Ignores notification settings: I have disabled ALL marketing emails and notifications and this app continues to ignore that and sends me push notifications and emails about “new listings matching your previous searches!” which I never asked for. App also sends a ton of emails at signup. 2 confirmation emails. One email per new posting follows by another “you made your first post!” email. Literally got 9 emails after making an account and 2 listings. App also has tones of integrated ads for spam apps distributed throughout the market place. App also continues to throw marketing notifications for “start job search with us!” or “here are recommendations for junk for you to buy based on zero information!”   Deleted this trash.,1
1695,"Mixed feelings: I have mixed feelings about Offer Up. The good part is that you can see how others have been rated, and whether their identity has been verified. Items are easy to post, and you can get alerts if someone is interested.   The part I don’t like Is that I get Alerts on items I have no interest in, simply because I searched them for pricing ideas to get rid of my own items.  I have found no way to turn this off. Another disadvantage is the shipping prices are high so I rarely ever offer shipping.  Also there is no way to rate a seller for giving you the runaround unless you buy from him.",3
1696,"Faulty delivery: I ve been buying some items and had trouble with the delivery. They give you two days to inspect the item, and either it’s okay or ask a refund. What happen when the item is not delivered when it was supposed to. It’s neither the buyer or seller fault. How this will be resolved? I don’t know what’s the problem. I recently bought an item and OfferUp informed me it was delivered. Which it was not. I asked the seller and she mailed the item on Monday June 6 and supposedly delivered June 7 at 2:44. Less than 24 hours? Magic!!
not even local! I didn’t received and there is no way in the app to address this issue.",3
1697,"Offer Up Should He Held Accountable: No matter where you search from, you are going to encounter ads where people are trying to take advantage of unsuspecting people (scammers). While the app does have a “Report” feature, I’m not sure it does anything other than send you and automated email. Reported ads are rarely removed (if at all). Either Offer Up’s review team is atrocious or Offer Up is just allowing the scam ads (maybe more ads means the app looks like there are more active users), essentially putting their users at risk. While I imagine they have something in the ToS regarding use at your own risk, they still should be ashamed of allowing the amount of obvious scam accounts and posts. So much for looking out for your users.",1
1698,"Scam accounts make app non-trustworthy: The amount of scams and fake accounts on this app made me delete it within 30 minutes. No one should be disclosing their phone number in the description of a product so they can send you it for free.. How in the world have developers not caught on that someone does not want to give away a free PlayStation because, “I want it to go to a good home. Just call me at this #”. It’s plain as day that is a scam. The point of apps like this is to have products delivered to you with no personal information shared, so these listings should be a breach of your policy anyway. 

Either stupid or lazy developers have made this app full of scams and frauds, allowing it to serve absolutely no purpose. Don’t waste your time with it.",1
1699,IT’S A TRAP!: Cannot for the life of me find a legitimate post all these cars are scams all the electronics are scams even some things that look legitimate are a scam from a quick google image search and quickly checking the sellers post which span the country in a infinitesimal time frame. It is impossible to sell anything on this site now unless you ship. Which is also a trap because offer up seller protection is well known to be below even that of the monopolized laziness of ebay. I used to sell apple products like candy now I don’t even get messages from scammers. The selling market as a whole online has fallen very hard. Just hold onto your items until they break it’s not worth the hassle to make a few extra bucks.,1
1700,"Needs improvement: Yes one of my favorite sites and works- but a number of issues: revamp of format about a year ago left the site less user-friendly. Lack of direct customer support leaves users on their own. And the biggest issue: site is loaded with OLD posts that are no longer valid due to oversight of posting party, or moved away and just left ad, or any other numerous reasons. There should be a time limit to posts (6 months?) then notice sent to poster and ad removed.  Too many bogus returns on searches otherwise.",5
1701,"Congratulations!: Best app ever!!    However, on the ‘Saved Items’ feature, could you please have scroll feature return to the place where I just viewed an item.  It goes back to the top each time and I have to scroll all the way back down to the next item that I want to view in my list.  It’s extremely frustrating to spend my time scrolling back down especially when I have many saved items to revisit over time.  Thanks!!",5
1702,"Lots of scams watch out: Why are there so many fake accounts on here? They really need to do a better job of filtering out these accounts. I got contacted by 4 fake accounts in a row with fake or no profile pictures, no information or ratings, asking for my personal information. Makes me not even want to use this app. I need a job so if you guys want to hire me for security IT then I’ll do it. Some people are technologically illiterate so it’s easy to fall for these scams and they’re everywhere on here. Other than that it’s easy to use and post things for sale. Smooth UI. Efficient and effective.",4
1703,Scammers: I have been very disappointed since I signed up on February 7 of 2021. There are multiple listings that are scams with the same first name different last name and they’re all Gmail accounts. You will notice this when the person‘s profile is that a State for example Patricia Parker is an alias. She sells supposedly a black Ford ranger and a red Toyota Tacoma in the Seattle area. The thing I do not understand is how can offer up not notice something like this when they are posting multiple different pictures with different people. They need to take a bigger stand on how they can weed out people like this. She also supposedly we go through eBay and says her 26-year-old has died and she really needs to get rid of the vehicle.,2
1704,"Was better before the merge: Letgo perfected the verification process so there was very frauds and very few people scamming.  They also were very good with showing local ads when I asked for them.  
Since the merge every listing I make has several scammers the contact me in the middle of the night. Also I see ads from across the country and I have no interest in having something shipped. Finally they bombard you with pressure to pay extra to have your ad shown first. Unfortunately that means somebody who paid for an ad in Arizona comes before your local ads.  So if you have extra time give it I try.  Maybe you won’t get scammed.",3
1705,"App not opening: I just tried opening the app this morning several times, I thought maybe it was my phone, so I restarted my phone. Tried it again, app opens, then immediately closes, so I uninstalled the app and re installed it on my phone, tried opening it again, same thing, opens, then immediately closes. What is going on?, this only started happening this morning... it was working fine all day yesterday and days before. Please check to see what’s going on with your app, I have items posted for sale.",5
1706,"Extremely worst app ever, don’t use it: I was selling 5 products and people were coming over to pickup stuff from my home but suddenly all items from my app got removed with all the messages I’ve received and sent. I tried to uninstall and reinstall the app, nothing happened. Then I logged out from my account and now I’m not even able to login(it gives me error: something went wrong when communicating with server) and there is no way to contact with people who are coming over to pick up stuff from my home. Also, customer service is terrible. If they respond they don’t fix the issue, after 5 minutes they lock me again. Extremely bugfull app and no one to fix it.  It’s terrible and really frustrating. 

Please never use this app.",1
1707,"Good and Bad: The good...a lot of people read it and I have had quite a bit of success in selling some items.  And there are a lot of great people on here.

The bad...if you click on an item, the app assumes you are interested in that type of item and it displays them constantly.  I also don’t like the “items selected for you” messages, again, assuming you are interested in that particular type of item.  Sometimes I click on something because 1), I have no idea what it is and 2), because I can’t believe someone is attempting to sell that, let alone someone would be interested in buying such an item.  Use your imagination here!",3
1708,"No more LetGo? LetDown.: Used to be a big fan of letgo, lots of local transactions and a clean interface. Then came along OfferUp and I couldn’t be more disappointed. With LetGo I was actually able to sell items no problem and see other local listings easy. That is no longer the case, several of my items after being up for weeks only have 1-3 views each and i do not see local listings as much as I should or want. This is a major disappointment and I’ve now had to move to facebook marketplace. I’d also like to add that the interface is very buggy and cluttered compared to LetGo. Please just bring the old app back it’s terrible and I among others are very upset. I’m deleting this app and hoping one day another comes along to replace LetGo that is not as terrible as this.",1
1709,"Confusing and Out of Date: The app has no real explanation of how it works or how to use it. I’ve learned a lot by trial and error. The search tool is helpful but the items for sale are mixed with personal, online merchants and major retailers. I’ve looked at many items that have taken me to eBay, Overstock and even Home Depot. There are even many items noted as promoted, what does that mean. The reason that I’m deleting the app is that there are items that were listed as long as two years ago. I responded to one somewhat hard to find auto part that was listed 9 months ago, made an offer and never received a response. I don’t know if it was sold and not removed or the seller is no longer on Offer Up but in any case I find this to be poorly organized and run.",1
1710,"Absolutely Awful: If I could give 0 stars for OfferUp, I would.  When it was just Letgo by itself I was able to post pet sitting ads freely without having them taken down. Pet sitting is really my main source of income right now due to COVID-19, and now that Letgo and OfferUp aren’t separate anymore, apparently I’m not allowed to post ads about a service I am providing? That’s ridiculous. Letgo is so much better in every way and I prefer it 10x more than OfferUp. I also got scammed on OfferUp for $30 and when I tried to contact them about the situation that happened on THEIR app, they did NOTHING. I got an automated email asking to specify what happened and they’ll get back to me blah blah blah. HORRRIBLE APP. I honestly wish the two companies never collaborated and I could just have Letgo by itself. Absolutely ridiculous.",1
1711,"Offer Up Ease Of Use: I Have used offer up to buy office, home, sports, car and bicycle items all with very good success.  The app makes it easy for users to enter items for sale and even easier to find, make an offer and get excellent follow-up on sellers response to the offer.  It’s easier than EBAY and of course its focused on local sellers which for big metro areas still offers an excellent selection of a full range of items.  If your in the market for a good used item or you want to sell one Offer-Up is the place to go!  5 Stars.",5
1712,"Incompetent staff: I bought a watch on there from someone that stopped working five minutes after I bought it, while it’s not their fault that it stopped working, when I reported the user who sold it to me who made me wait an hour knowing that I drove 45 minutes to go pick it up (as well as made inappropriate sexual jokes when I went to pick up the watch) and instead of closing his account, they closed mine when I was the victim in the situation. They’re so stupid they took no action against the criminal, but they chose to shut me down instead, and I pay the for the PREMIUM service. The guy who sold me the broken watch, did not specify he sold it to me, he purposely lied and said he sold it somewhere else so that I wouldn’t be able to rate him and warn others that he is a THIEF.",1
1713,"Great app if you don’t click anything: I understand the need for ads but can they be spaced apart more than two items.  On my reg sized iPhone, there could be 9-12 items on the page. I can’t always tell what an item is. If I click on one to actually see what it is, and then return to scrolling, the new feed of items will bombard me with that item....that I have zero interest in buying. So, by trying to “personalize” my items, they are actually just removing potential items from the list.  I don’t need to see 4 out of the 9 items as copper fittings just because I couldn’t tell what a picture of a box of fittings was.  Sorry for the rant.",3
1714,"Notifications: Giving 3 stars because of how many notifications I constantly get for stupid stuff. You search one thing and suddenly they don't stop sending you notifications for newly posted items in that category. Yes I understand it'd be great for some people but I don't really care about it and it doesn't give you the option to turn it off unless you want to turn them off completely. But that would mean no notifications for messages/inquiries from people wanting to buy your stuff. I also get notifications about a facebook friend joining the app constantly but again, you can't turn it off. Really ticks me off.",3
1715,"Poor customer support: Good luck trying to get assistance with technical support.  I’ve been having issues with posting items for over a month and sadly to say their “customer care team” as one agent mentioned has done absolutely nothing to reach out to me or help remedy the issue. I’ve sent several emails regarding the issue and they’ve only replied twice with the same generic reply of it being “escalated to a customer care team member.” The platform itself is great but if an issue arises, good luck trying to get ahold of someone willing to help. :(",5
1716,"Customer service is almost nonexistent: I’ve never written a review in my entire life before, as I don’t normally find it worth my time. However, this apps customer service has left so profoundly furious, annoyed, and hopeless that I feel I MUST warn people that if you do happen to purchase something and have it delivers from another buyer, YOU WILL HAVE NO BUYER PROTECTION!!! The customer service is robotic and each response is the same copy and paste, but with your name attached. They do no have a phone number you can call, and they do not care whether or not you lose your money. I have been scammed and each each email response is the exact same response. So in short, DONT EVEN USE THIS APP, I recommend Mercari instead. I absolutely am furious with this company. P.S. I still don’t have my money back.",1
1717,"So much to love about OfferUp!: Its easy to use, helping me search for whatever I need, within the distance I choose at the price range I choose.
I can save a list of items I’m considering, and will even get updates when new, similar items are posted-it’s like having a personal shopper doing the legwork 24/7.
Before I contact a seller, I can look into their track record as far as how many other sales they’ve made and customer experience. Once chatting prompts appear, like “pick a place to meet”. And negotiations are simple.
So far, so good.",5
1718,"Shipping feature no longer available: All through the high season, the ability to ship was no longer available. Customer service was very limited and ticket would be passed from one person to the other. We made all efforts, sent the team screenshots but only received generic responses. It seems updates switched off some sellers to ship, possibly on older phones like iPhone 6 or iPad 3; at least that’s my assumption because the offerup team never gave a satisfactory response to the issue.
I was enjoying offerup and loved the shipping feature till it got turned off on my app.",4
1719,"Horrible platform, large user base: Only reason I use this is because the user base is so large. Otherwise the app is horrible to use and not user friendly. Too many unnecessary notifications that you can't turn off. Why does it automatically follow anyone you message on the app? Why do I need to know when my facebook friends join offerup? Why do I need to Check out other ipad posts in my area? Not a single way to challenge bad reviews or redeem yourself because a buyer made a mistake when rating (this doesn't effect me, but it might later).
The customer service is a joke, good luck getting any help. If you're on twitter, you'll get some effort there, but it's still half assed and condescending. If there werent so many people using it, I wouldn't have ever downloaded it.",1
1720,"Letgo is way better: Removed me because I wanted to sell knives like other people were...They kept removing items...I wrote emails as to find out why...I read through their policy...it was very vague...especially considering others were selling the same items and some very similar to what was being removed...
So I wasn't getting any responses...instead I decided to report the other items just like mine...and kept asking 
""Why are these here for sale if you keep removing mine?""
Next thing ya know I'm deleted...
In their policy it say we are trying to keep this site safe? And that they will remove anything the community wouldn't want basically...but people were trying to buy what they were removing before they did...so obviously it has nothing to do with anything other than someone's self interests...
Because this is America you nazi fux...and at bare minimum I'm a part of the community now too...",5
1721,"Review: This can be a good app to for selling items, but please be ware who you are talking to before you meet them. I’ve been trying to sell a Xbox One S and I have had a ton of people offer me trades such as weed that I don’t want even though I clearly stated in the add that I am firm on the price and I don’t want to trade. There are also lots of rude people, and the people that will continuously lowball you on the price of the item or items your trying to sell.

I would really like to see an update come to the app where you could block and/or mute people, and where you can send pictures of the item or items your selling to someone who is interested through the OfferUp chat so you don’t have to give out phone number.",2
1722,"Tracking Repeat buyers: It would be awesome if you had a repeat buyer.  The information was stored on your profile so you could know what they had previously purchased,  was it quick responses,  did they ask 10 question then disappear for a week then reappear for purchase.

It appears that Facebook market place appeals to a wider audience,  but it also has tons of flakes.  The search feature on OfferUp for some reason does not stay within the parameters that you input I.e. (search a 5 mile radius for coffee maker;  and you find it,  then discover it is 30 miles away.). That should be fixed",4
1723,"What's going on?!: I'm a frequent user of offer up. But I uninstall and install it when I don't need the extra space. I have a busy life so often I delete the app to download groupon . When just recently I Reyes to install the app and now I can't. I thought it was space so I deleted countless photos emails ,recent calls messages and voicemails , notes ,wallet stuff etc.  I still am unable to install. Today my phone restarts so my internet is faster than ever so that's not an issue either. I have a 5 star rating and have made over 60 sales and 40 reviewed sales. I'm in disbelief ,tried to make a little more money for my daughters birthday next week after having to use all my money to pay bills and things I owed the past few months. I'm frustrated . And disappointed.",1
1724,"Look for it on Offer Up first: I love this app you can find almost anything you would buy paying retail prices.  I have purchased many many items such as a car, hp ink for my printer, toys for a baby, new shoes and clothing, Christmas lights, household cleaning items, 2 sets of tires for my cars, a vintage bike and Star Wars collectibles.  I have sold items too.  It is very easy to post items for sale.  I recently found Mac make up brand new for sale at a great price!  Just do a search for whatever you need and you just might get a better deal by doing so!!",5

1726,"App has declined over the years: I have had Offer Up a long time. Even longer than my profile shows because I worked at a church and we used it slot there buying things but the app has gotten so much worse with direct messages from businesses like Temu and more filling up my inbox. 

I used to be able to post an item then go look at my HomePage and I would see my post as the latest post . I still can't find my post I posted yesterday and have received no questions or offers which is unusual for when I post. I haven't used it in about a year because of the difficulty of deleting all the adds in my direct messages.",2
1727,"Lots of items sold but not updated, messages never answered.: In comparison with another more popular app, this one needs management checking with the seller if something has sold and prompt you to update it. Also the messaging system is not great. Others make you use a different messaging system which clearly helps you see that you received messages. As a buyer you’ll have a better experience. OfferUp leaves me frustrated as all the nice stuff I’m shopping for is already sold but I won’t know it since the seller never sees my message to him. It is a waste of time. F*aceb00k M*rketPlace is the way to go.",3
1728,Great resell app: I've been using the platform about five years now and have never had any issues. I like how the shipping options are predetermined so there's no guessing on what to charge. It also conveniently provides a shipping label which cuts down on the amount of time I need to spend on packing. Returns are easy to do and their selling fees are reasonable. Better than Ebay's I can tell you that right now. The customer service has always responded in a timely manner and I like the direction it's going.,5
1729,"I have this app on my phone and was about to install on iPad: I’m just DONE with any site that has no phone # for customer service. Offer up seems to tell you info(you have to go in search of) when you’re in the middle of a transaction for hundreds of $, and you need an exact answer immediately, there’s nothing, general answers to extremely hypothetical scenarios. I’m glad I was able to cancel the transaction, it was getting shady and I had no one to get advise from. FYI….GET A PHONE #",5
1730,Ok but could be better: There are a lot of ads on this app which would be fine if it wasn’t super difficult to tell them apart from the posts. They’re ads for similar items on other sights so if you click on them without seeing the tiny word “ad” on the bottom it takes you out of the app and opens a web page. In the past 5 minutes of browsing I’ve accidentally clicked on like 10 ads. Super annoying. Also the amount of emails they send is ridiculous. Every single message has an accompanying email and I couldn’t find how to turn that off.,3
1731,Shipping: If you decide to sell something via the shipping method be prepared to wait for your money. first they will tell you that you will get your money as soon as the post office scans your shipping label. then ha ha just kidding you don’t get your money until up to two days after the buyer inspects the merchandise. not to mention the fee that they take from you …So if you’re selling something because you’re in a pinch definitely do not sell it to anyone that’s not local. I used to love this app but after this experience I wish I could give you zero stars. my recommendation you something like eBay to ensure that you get your money right away because no one ever hands something over without getting paid first. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
1732,"Fantastic App: I love using this app and I always find things I need also my family does as well. Have always met friendly people and  great prices. I’ve had great luck selling items and love the capability of adjusting the distance,price in the search button but it doesn’t always narrow down the Search exactly which I think could use some improvement. But overall if I could give it more than five stars I Would!!! Thank you very much and keep up the good work 👍🏻👍🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻.",5
1733,"Four star review for offer up and a six star review for the seller I found on OfferUp: I give the app a 4star rating as this was my first experience buying an item online. My seller was friendly and patient and deserves a 6star review ,for saving our sale. 
Although my seller notified offer up, that he wouldn’t be able to mail my purchased item until a winter weather storm alert had lifted, , 
They canceled our order anyway and never sent the proper notifications to prevent this from happening or or apologize for ending the cell when my seller clearly had notified them that there was a winter storm alert. They also didn’t  send the proper notifications on time.
My seller gets the maximum star review and offer up received a four-star review, but only because they do business with guys like him. Thanks Mike. (Seller: Texas), 
You made me a satisfied first time buyer on offer up. 
Sincerely, 
Elementary Watson.
(Buyer: California)",4
1734,"Suggestions: Very much like the App. However, there are a couple of improvements I would like to suggest. 
First, nowadays there are different forms of payments (Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, etc) OfferUp should should strive to incorporate some (if not all) of these payment forms. 
Also, all messages exchanged between Sellers and/or Buyers should be saved regardless of the outcome. There have been cases where I wanted to go back and check some information provided by a Seller, and if by the time I do that the Seller has sold the item of interest, the messages exchanged are deleted. The option to delete should only be for the User",4
1735,"No prices: The app is ok I guess. It would be better if it was set up more like the website on Safari. My biggest gripe is no prices on the for sale items unless you click on the item. That takes more time and it’s a little irritating. The second thing is that there is or was a bunch of sold items listed. I don’t want to see sold items and the deals that I might have missed. Most days I am just looking around and not wanting to buy anything. 
I am not fond of Mercari’s site either but the one thing they do is offer 10% off on some items if it is in your favorites.
Thanks.",3
1736,"Issue keeps reoccurring: My account went into a lock state and I was unable to access it for like an entire week. Offerup finally replied and fixed my account. Once I accessed it all of my listed items deleted along with messages account. Within a couple of hours of use my account went into lock state again and logged me out, giving me the error “Authentication Failed”. I was no longer able to log in. I emailed the customer service email and it got fixed. Now for the 3rd time, the same thing has happened. I don’t know if they fix it again, the same issue will reoccur. I really would like a permanent resolution for this. My apple id used for this review is not the same email used on my offerup.",1
1737,"Need much better security to protect sellers: This is not a review of the functionality of the app. It’s easy to use. My issue is how sketchy the responses were when I put my item up for sale. Two ppl kept asking for my cell number and one wanted my full name and email address. Probably they were phishing and intending on getting my personal data from the app. I removed my item then tried to add it back again. Then I was asked to update the app. Once I did that, it wanted my Drivers License info.....Oh H*LL no!! Then I tried to delete my profile. I had to send a request to ask how to remove it bc there was no way to do it within the app. It was a really bad experience and a complete waste of my time.",2
1738,"Much worse & spammier platform experience than LetGo: OfferUp just has a much less vetted buyer market- lots of fakes and people with low intent. LetGo was the opposite - if you posted something, you’d definitely sell it in a week or two. Instead with offer up, they intentionally bury your listing in a pile unless you pay to play— they make that pretty clear - pay them $8 and up if you want you listing seen. 

Wish they’d never bought LetGo and just let that platform still exist. LetGo had AMAZING customer service and community management and also gave back to local communities with free classes and workshops. 

OfferUp in contrast has been around longer but there was a reason I left it before- cuz it didn’t work- and now we’re all forced back onto a subpar solution again.",1
1739,"Bring back quick view!: This app is great... till the update. I really liked this app and used it for buying or selling locally. When looking to buy, you could touch and hold on a item and get a quick “preview” of item with price and brief description, so handy when browsing thru items for sale. Now it’s gone with the update and makes browsing for items kind of a pain with opening each window and back buttoning all the time. This makes the app way more clumsy to use. The update describes selling is easy, but if the app makes it annoying to use with so many “taps”, then buyers wont use it. Please bring back the preview option and make this app easy to use again! 🙏🏼🙂",2
1740,"Great app, crappy users!: Let’s just say the app is great in theory, but I have never had to deal with so much flakiness in my life! I never knew that SO many people are NOT people of their word. I have many times where we thought a deal had been reached, heading out to go sell the item, only to find out that the person is not coming or they didn’t realize how far away you are, (even though the listing says where we are.) There needs to be a way to stop people from behaving like this, is so annoying and a waste of my time.",5
1741,"Frustrating: The app is a great way to buy and sell things. However, after about two weeks, it suddenly stops working. I’ve closed three different accounts and all do the same thing! When I send a message to someone the app shows on my end that it has been sent - but I cannot get a reply. I’ve even been in constant communication with people and then suddenly nothing. I keep sending messages and even used my wife’s account to verify and she sends a message back but I cannot receive it! WHY??",5
1742,Waste of time: Complete and utter waste of time. 50 listings and not even close to a sale I have had to delete sales off OfferUp because I sold it in another site. Sites that actually want you to sell what you’re selling. Offer up is only for filling their own pockets by wanting sellers to pay extra for views. I continue to see my listings that says conversations but not one single message in my messages so what the hell does it mean to have conversations. I also noticed that when I linked my phone number to this site I’m getting 5 spam text messages a day through my phone messages which I have reported to the BBB OfferUp is selling our personal information or they’re not securing the information we give them. Proceed with caution if you use this site.,1
1743,"Can sell anything: I made my account on my laptop and everything was fine, I could communicate with people and buy thing but then I download the app on my phone to sell and next thing you know my account is irrelevant. My post isn’t showing up on other people’s phones and now I can’t even buy anything bc the seller isnt receiving my messages. Then it gets worse, I made another account on my sisters phone so I can buy and sell again but once I posted what I’m selling it literally instantly deletes, it doesn’t go into archive it just disappears instantly! This is so frustrating especially bc I already contacted offer up about this and gone through their help page and nothing is working, haven’t heard from them yet either!!! Fix this offer up!",1
1744,"Listing expire and duplicates: I know with craigslist you have to repost your items, and I thought that’s how it went with OfferUp but I am trying to buy a car and I see listings that are like 3 years old and the people just don’t respond, I wish these would expire after like 3 months and they have to repost it. All other thing, when searching for cars/trucks there are sooo many fake ads, if you look up Silverado you see like 100 of the exact same truck in different positions for $1,200 and you can’t get past them to see the real listings because of how many there are. I wish you guys would fix these things and I would give this a 5 star, but this just makes me really annoyed and not want to use this app to find a car.",1
1745,"NEEDS WORK ASAP !!: The app is alright, don’t know why Offerup wanted to connect with Letgo should’ve kept companies separate. OfferUp could've been better due to the fact that when sellers post things to sell you mostly get lots of views on your items instead of people wanting to buy.
In order to get your post up you have to buy to promote like why have fees to promote if the app itself is FREE why you have to pay to get your stuff to sell ??? 

When buyers are interested to buy they waste your time acting like they want to buy. 
Some buyers be wanting personal info like if we going to talk after THATS A NO it’s a you buy/sell app not known as to be friends with anyone I’m here trying to sell my items and get money like everyone else. 

This app needs work ASAP to keep scams out it needs to be more professional in my opinion. Needs a UPGRADE, be different as well so others can be like okay they step up with no scams, legitimate, securities and etc.
Overall the app is good but the buyers ain’t up there especially when your selling good stuff and they waste your time.",2
1746,Terrible merger with letgo: I joined offer up since let go merged. I had an item (a kiln) that I was potentially interested in but didn’t message yet because I was getting information about the item when the merge happened. So I went to look. One they didn’t transfer listings but two I tried to look up local items and it would only give me items that could be shipped. I am in no way interested in shipping a large piece if equipment. I selected local only and it still only gave me items that had shipping. I also don’t like that the furthest distance I can search is 30 miles. I would drive more that 30 miles for a kiln if it was in good shape but the only option above 30 miles was no limit. This merger is terrible and I will go back to Facebook market.,1
1747,"Boards are clunky: I love OfferUp but when I need to remove items on my boards this is clunky.  I hate that you have to go through so many steps to remove an item from finding it by scrolling down clicking on it; clicking on the heart and then removing from the board.  But when you click back to view your board again you are taken to the top and have to again scroll down to repeat the process.  

I am constantly watching many many items- I just wish there was an easier way to select and remove multiple items at a time to update my board.

Can this be considered in a newer version? I hope so!",3
1748,"Sad: This app is just not how it used to be. Apparently there are a lot of old posts. So many scams, and fake posts. Last purchase I had the guy didn’t tell me what was wrong with the motorcycle. It seems fine at the time but then later on i go get an estimate of how much to get the problems fixed and it’ll cost me $3000 that’s almost as much as I bought the motorcycle for. Y’all need an employee to fish out all the trash so people can actually see what is really out there and not get scammed. Also need to remove post or have it renewed every month. I’m tired of seeing post that’s 1-3 years old. They won’t respond, because you know why? They either deleted the app or sold it somewhere else and forgot to take the post down. Y’all need to improve I’m sick of this nonsense.",1
1749,"Deletes your posts: This app continuously deletes my for sale posts despite them aligning with app rules and guidelines. For example, guidelines say use quality photos and my photos were taken from my Canon Mark III camera which are high resolution and the items I was selling were completely in frame. Moreover, guidelines say use accurate text to describe the item, and my text used the exact manufacturer description word for word down to the dimensions. I have disputed this with the app, but their process for doing so is not turnkey which is a HUGE inconvenience for those of you like me who are in a time crunch to sell items. Do yourself a favor and use Letgo or Craigslist instead OfferUp will just take your data and delete your posts right when youre in the middle of a sale. Trash!",1
1750,"Sold so fast!!!: This was the first time I used OfferUp, as I just found it a couple weeks ago, and I was AMAZED! I had three responses within two minutes of posting. Sold everything within 12 hours! Would have been sooner but I posted later in the evening before going to bed. Everything was gone by 1 pm the next day. I also posted on a another well known website, which didn't get any replies until the next day,  just as I was deleting the post. LOL!!  I will use OfferUp exclusively from now on!! Absolutely love this website!!",5

If you try to appeal anything their is absolutely no one that will respond to your request. You can’t speak to anyone cause everything is automated. They’re also not for free! They charge 8% for everything thing you sell and then sit and wait for your money... may as well go to eBay for that price. The worst company ever! Things are gonna catch up with then.",5

Yet NOTHING in response from OfferUp other than to blame the WiFi of the user- even when they’ve tried different WiFi’s etc. obviously it’s a bug that is beyond your capabilities!?!? I really would just erase the app and not give a **** but I’ve been duped into trying you again and had several buyers ready to go and then BAM the freakin purple bear with a connection “something went wrong” pops up. Thank god I didn’t pay for this app, but I’ve read hundreds of people that have spent money on your adds and gotten ripped off. Sad. Fix it or at least tell people what’s going on",1

And I will never know because they give you know sort of explanation or warning that you’ve done something wrong and to not do it again. I’ve read the terms of service multiple times and have found that I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong. But once again I have no idea because they won’t tell me anything. It’s quite unbelievable. I have 94 5 star ratings, which means every experience I’ve had has been fantastic. So, why has my account been banned? I’ve emailed support@offerup and socialcare@offerup and I get no response, no explanation, no help. I can’t think of even one reason why my account would be banned. The app doesn’t deserve good Americans time. You will frustrate yourself beyond belief.",1
1755,"NETWORK ERROR: When I need to respond to a message regarding selling an item, I get nothing but network error. This isn’t the first time. Not sure why I get so many network errors while trying to use this app. Very disappointed.  Also, I seem to get a lot of bull crap messages about random people who what to buy my item with no response back after I reply. Seems like they are computer generated for some items I list as I get them non stop. Not one or two, many messages. No response back. I eventually just un-list the item.",5
1756,"Quick and easy: I’ve been using OfferUp for years. I like that it’s easy to post and there is no fees charged by the app, unless you use their shipping service. You can see if the potential buyers are legit by looking at the ratings and the verification system. So far, all my buyers are legit and came through pretty fine. You can negotiate the deal with the buyers directly via message which is very convenient. However I feel the app is starting to become less active lately.",5
1757,Need changes: I like your site a lot when I do not appreciate our two-year-old posts or even a year old even craigslist gives you two weeks or something like that and you have to repost your item this is really frustrating when you find something you really like and nobody gets back to you because they’re either walked out of their account or ignoring it you need to look into this because I think your website is awesome besides those problems thanks so much feel free to get back to me if you have any thoughts on the length of your posts. Nicole Monte,4
1758,Worst Company Ever: Worst experience ever when I went to buy AirPods Max sealed and when I got home to open them they were fake sold as authentic. I emailed and chatted with people from offer up and even made a police report and all they had to say was “so sorry for the experience you had.” I wasn’t even asking for them to refund my money at all or anything like that I just wanted the person’s profile to be flagged and taken down but instead they locked my account and let the other account selling fake stuff be online. This is so wrong of them to not only treat their members like trash but also support others selling fake stuff as authentic when they are not. Very disappointing and disgusted by the company!,1
1759,Long wait time to receive money: I sold an 800 dollar item via offer up.  The buyer asked that I accept payments so he can make payments through klarna.  I allowed him to do it that way. Long story short offer up not only took out a 100 processing fee but they also still have not yet released my funds.  Who knows when it will be released.  The chat agent kept trying to rush me off chat instead of answering my questions.  I just want my money the customer has stated he’s received his item and is fully satisfied.  My account shows my money and a cash out button that doesn’t work.  Def won’t be doing this again. Very unsatisfied I should have been received my money like the buyer received their item.,1
1760,"Legit: Signed up definitely no charge yeah!
Posted pictures and description. Would be nice to have Zelle,Apple Pay
Or a form of something to have the person pay. I did not but no problem my husband had a Zelle acc. We used his. One of My item sold in less than a week. Which was cool because it was the most expensive one. You can also be informed when someone gives you a offer.  Oh this was my first time doing something like this.  Fun and exciting. Hope this help someone.",5
1761,"Still buggy: App will hang significantly when loading the adds, which are placed a little too frequently in search results, and the whole thing will fail and quit randomly if you scroll too far down. Once you find something, it works great. Chatting with sellers is smooth, and posting things for sale is pretty seamless too. Overall it’s a good app, but the ads really break it up.

Editing to add that the ads are even worse now since they added pop-up ads. They take over the screen and the X is so far at the upper corner that you cannot close it. I have to restart the app when an ad like that comes up. Removing a star",2
1762,"Inquiries , offers erased! No help from support!: Unbelievable! I would give a zero if I could. Several offers did not show up under App. I happen to see them in email but would not allow me to respond. I had an offer under the app but then all the exchanges were wiped away and my listing was deactivated. I had to repost but lost the exchange. Customer support has not helped after several email exchanges. No live person. Unbelievable, I even reduced the price thinking there were no responses but I actually had 4 offers but all lost, because of tech glitches and extremely substandard service. I won’t list here ever again and will tell all the same unless the company rectifies and makes up for it.",1
1763,"Outdated and stressful: The app is great for reaching out to local buyers, however the system is laggy + feels outdated and the people on this platform are pretty inconsiderate of your time. 

It’s a bit frustrating having to tap a conversation or an item several times to select it. I wish they could upgrade the software so that commands are instantaneous. I also don’t appreciate how the system pre-selects the type of item you’re selling and restricts changes in that regard; it’s my item, I feel like I would know how to list it better than an algorithm.

OfferUp support is next to useless. I’ve had people try to scam me and dozens of people not show up to pick up an item. OfferUp support doesn’t really do anything about it; they simply tell you to take precautions when meeting people and whatnot instead of addressing the actual issue.

I will slowly begin phasing OfferUp out of the portfolio of apps I sell my products on. It’s been a frustrating experience and it’s really not worth my time or stress dealing with this app.",2
1764,"Needs a desperate change: Offer up is pretty good compared to craigslist, but it really needs to do something about the flake factor on all the users. I’ve never encountered any type of selling application where there’s so many people that inquiry at odd hours of the time and then they just consistently flake when you thought you reached an agreement. Given that there is so much of this flake on this platform. I would think that they would make adjustments for partial payment or flag people who flake out all the time or kick them off the platform. Maybe add a negative rating for someone’s profile.",3
1765,"Too many scammers: The app is great & has an incredibly useful purpose but unfortunately too many scammers join to scam honest users. Immediately after posting, they make contact to pressure into getting full name, phone number, exact location, which violates the app’s guidelines. Not satisfied with the limited information provided, they offer to pay via Zelle. They now have your phone number but is not enough. They follow with a screenshot that their bank requires them to confirm seller’s account with an email address. So they demand an email address to process payment.  Read up! If an email address is provided, you just have set yourself up to be scammed.",2
1766,"This app contains sex traffickers, perverts, and scammers.: Out of all apps I have downloaded to sell clothing, offer up has been the only app I have gotten messages from. Normally that would be a good thing, however every single message I have gotten has been about them hitting on me, asking me for used panties 🤢, some asked me to send them pictures of myself wearing the items, and then others pretending to like my items, and pretending to have an interest in my items too get me to meet up with them. After I told one person I only offer shipping, their whole account disappeared from my comments/messages section, and I didn’t hear from the person since. This app needs to get some serious help. BE CAREFUL OUT THERE LADIES!",1
1767,"This site is broken, needs refinement in the worst way!: There needs to be a better way to weed out all the scammers! I get tired of being asked where I live, my address and phone number. It makes the buying experience a total nightmare. I wish your system had the ability to pick up on folks selling several items from different states. That’s a good give away their scammers. Also, it very frustrating to bid what their asking price is, you think you bought it, then come to find out their just wasting your time and efforts. These type of sellers are just taking up space, and making the buying experience just horrible!!!!",2
1768,"Better than market place: Great app as I don’t do Facebook- so no marketplace anymore it’s nice to have another option. I like to see the views of the item, the ca-ching sound it makes when someone is interested, the in app communication, one thing is when someone doesn’t respond and another buyer turns up to buy one item and leaves with 2, I cannot change buyers, other than that,  great app! Thank you for another option to use and getting away from Facebook garbage!!!!",5
1769,"I didn’t have the best experience: It might be just me, but I didn’t have the best experience.
I was looking for a stroller, I found a few I was interested and sent a message to the seller saying I was interested in purchasing- waited a least a week with no response.  I then sent one more message asking if the item was still available and still received no response from any seller.
Then a weeks later (today) I receive an email from offerup saying I’ve violated the community guidelines and my account has been deactivated?? I looked through the guidelines- not sure what I did - I’ve asked sellers twice max if their item was available- and both times never received a response.
I think I’ll stick with eBay.",1
1770,"Will not be using again: I made a sale and shipped it the last day in the shipment window, but OfferUp cancelled it anyways the next day. When I reached out to the support team, it took a while to hear back and there is no customer service number. When they finally got back to me (after the person had received what they purchased) they told me to work it out with them instead of actually solving the issue who I can’t get ahold of anymore. I still haven’t received payment for my sale and I’m still trying to get the issue resolved. I am beyond frustrated and just hoping this person eventually checks their messages as OfferUp themselves cannot seem to solve the problem they created.",1
1771,"Could be amazing, ruined by 3 small combing factors: 1) This app DOES NOT let you use a VPN. Even if you change the location of VPN to a city close enough to you to look at listing there it doesn’t work

2) ADS will take you to random websites and you will click on ads while scrolling by accident. This wouldn’t be an issue if not for number one. I doubt they’re taking the time to audit ads so have fun going to some fishy sketchy random website on the same device all your life is on. 

3) Bots and fake listings, they plague about 50% of what you’re looking at, would be fine within itself but they’re forcing me to take a VPN with Adblock off so I can be taken to horrible random websites so therefore use your funding to audit the app!",1
1772,"Ads/scammers: So many ads now it’s horrible, but what makes it worse is when you happen to put your finger on the ad to scroll up or down the list, it will automatically open a new tab in your browser on that specific ad you had no intention of opening. That’s just horrible. 
 Now the scammers on this app have become very annoying. You can report them and “offer up” will do nothing. Fake post, fake people, and then some will message you to try to get into your account, or to send money/accept money when selling or buying. They always ask for emails too. 
 Fix these issues especially the scammers. 
 Ever since the transition from that other app it all went down hill. Sad.",1
1773,"Remove old items: OfferUp could be great if there wasn’t items listed from a year ago. If your looking for something and you see a photo of it, you get all excited, you open the photo and find it was posted six months or a year ago. You think ok maybe it’s still available. You check. It’s not. Total disappointment. Total waste of time. Turns out only three of the posts are from The last few months.
There has to be a way to have expirations on these posts.
If there is something I’m doing wrong and there is a way to get rid of the old posts please let me know.",3
1774,"Lots of wasted time: Oof do I miss Letgo. At least on that app I can block people who are wasting my time with ludicrously low offers.

This app encourages prospective buyers into ridiculous bad negotiation habits. I’ve had a dozen people on multiple items ask me a bazillion questions on the product and quality, report to them it’s in perfect condition, and then give me ridiculously low ball offers that are lower than any other listing online.

Then I have folks who say they want to buy and then flake at the last minute after agreeing to a neutral site and driving there.

The amount of wasted time I have used on this platform is ridiculous...because there’s no way to rate people on their interactions.

So you have the lowest common denominator types looking for people selling stolen crap or trying to get something for nothing and have the AUDACITY in asking you to drive to their place with no payment up front.

You should give ratings on people’s communication as well. Otherwise the app encourages this kind of behavior as there’s no recourse for the buyer and as a seller it’s a waste of time.",1
1775,"Good app. Here is a suggestion: It’s a great app, makes transactions easy. The most annoying this now is scammers posting 100s of the same picture and flooding out all the good ads. 

Programmer please allow us to be able to not view their post once we report and block the users. I believe by doing this will help reduce the amount of fake ads, users will see. I hate having to scroll through pages of the same picture of the same black or white car just to find real ads. 

If I could simply report, block, and not view any of their posts this would be awesome.",4
1776,"Search results can be buggy and needs to display local offers: This app got me my tiny house but that’s about it. I live in El Paso, TX, and usually when I go on here to search for buying locally with pickup options it shows a bunch of randomly located offers that are not even ordered by distance, despite selecting the option to display within 30 miles of my home, ordered by distance, and pickup only. This app is unreliable for buying locally, and might as well just Google it and order online if it’s only going to show me stuff for sale in Miami, Indianapolis and Los Angeles not even in order of distance... :/",3

I have a small suggestion... on the “favorites” page where you save all your items that you plan to buy in the near future, when they get sold or you’ve already bought another version, I like to “unfavorite it”. But if I have 20-25 items, you can only do it one at a time. It would be nice to unfavorite all the items you don’t want anymore at once l.",4
1778,"Bots, bots, bots.: The amount of bots and scammers on this app is insane. I recently started using it and as soon as I post a new listing I get several messages at the same time (within 10 seconds of posting) from fake accounts asking if it’s still available or trying to get my phone number. And after telling them all communication will be handled through the app and personal information will not be released, there is no response. I imagine because the message is too complex for the bot to respond to and it still make sense. But there needs to be some way that the app blocks or manages them. It’s so hard to sell anything legitimately when those are the vast majority of the messages coming in.",2
1779,Orders are usually cancelled: Now I never give reviews on any app but after experiencing a disastrous moment with this app I need to speak my mind. Two of my products that I sold for $40 and $100 respectively were delivered to UPS on Sunday and shipped out on Monday but after 2 days OfferUp decides that the best thing to do is to cancel the whole exchange. To makes matters worse the two purchasers received the products while I received no income at all. I want to give a HUGE warning to people. This app is good to make a purchase and sell a product but don’t sell it online I would recommend to make the purchase in person. I know this pandemic isn’t going to make it easy but I’d rather have a fair and reasonable exchange. Thanks OfferUp 😒,2
1780,"Saved!: Behold!  My new bestie app.  I was a c hair away from selling some valuables to the “best” local pawn shop due to a time crunch.  Ridiculous loss of investment.  I wince and pucker just thinking about it.  

Frankly, it really was a good pawn shop.  The guy I spoke with suggested Offerup. Thankfully I did.  Still took quite the loss, though it was my fault plus the aforementioned time crunch and not that of Offerup.  Given time the loss might even have become a profit. 

Quick turnaround, user friendly, and practical are but a few reasons I will continue to use and refer others to my new BFF app.",5
1781,"Disappointed: Disappointed that letgo joined OfferUp. Offerup is difficult to search on as their results are unorganized and riddled with ads. The location based search is never effective for me, results from more than 20+ miles away pop up even when I restrict the search to 20 miles. Some results include things that were posted 3+ years ago. Also every time someone messages me, I get an email that makes it appear the first ever person who ever messaged me is the one contacting me. Sometimes I don’t even know I have messages because of this, and intermittently when I have messages waiting there is no icon on the app to let me know I have a notification. I find out way later and end up answering the person late because of this.",1
1782,"3 days to ship your item 😡: So I have no issue with offer up other than the fact that it gives you 3 days to ship your item or you don’t get paid. This seems like a good idea but in the long run it’s terrible. I shipped an item on the last day of the three days because I couldn’t ship it the first or second day because of it being a Sunday and then Monday being a holiday. So I shipped it Tuesday and normally it takes a day to go through as shipped, so while it was shipping, it was the end of the last day I could ship it and OfferUp cancels the item and Im not getting paid for selling the item and the item has already been shipped. So if you are going to sell of this app, don’t and find another app.",1
1783,"Full of scammers. Don’t trust offerup!!: Offerup is full of scammers these days. Any purchase you cannot make in person do not trust!!! People will charge you for the item and then never ship it. Offerup has no support available to a buyer and when you click help at the bottom of the screen it sends you to a broken link. 

An example:

I purchased a drill from and individual who was offering shipping, this person had a five star rating. He accepted my offer and payment, made a fake shipping label and never shipped the item. He had a couple of excuses and then when confronted after a week as to why the item wasn’t showing up in the tracking information he canceled the item. Yet low and behold his item is still up for sale. I reported not only him but the fake item  to offerup but they haven’t taken it down or his account. Currently it looks like I may be possibly dealing with the same situation again with someone who has five star ratings even! Yet I cannot cancel the transaction it is up to the seller.

Use other apps to do mail purchases and only trust offerup with people who will do face to face transactions.",1
1784,"Meh... I’ll list my vehicle elsewhere: I have to say, good concept, terrible implementation. If your core competency is helping people sell stuff, at least get that part right. I have my vehicle listed and OfferUp gives choices for which model vehicle you have. Unfortunately when you select a model, it populates the vehicle specs automatically AND THEY'RE WRONG!! And I can’t get them to change or at least delete them! What the heck? I’ve seen other people’s vehicle listings showing incorrectly and looked fishy so I glossed over them, but now I see what’s going on. And people are probably glossing over mine too. And OfferUp wants me to pay to “promote” my incorrect listing???...Yah right! I’ll stick with Craigslist and the other competent vehicle listing sites.",2
1785,"How can an app be so good yet so trash: For 1 . I never had a complaint on offerup, until I started shipping . When I first shipped out I received payment on the same day . But on my second shipment . I didn’t receive the money for a whole week . I waited and waited . Nothing . After the customer received his items , I waited .... still nothing . Even after 2 days NOTHING . & to make things worse I’ve been trying to get ahold of the people at offerup and they don’t even have a phone # to talk to customer service . And when I email them , no one responds . What’s the point of having 180 people
Working In a building if their gonna just ignore everything I have to say . I even DMd them on IG & Twitter and nothing . What is that!!!?? I had to direct message the CEO OF OFFERUP ... and guess what ... oh yeah NOTHING",1
1786,"Sellers: I love this app! It’s nice to find things I don’t use anymore and know that people are actually buying them. The only thing that annoys me is the people using the app. I can never find an actual good deal. If someone buys a pair of shoes for $100 and wears them a handful of times and they are discolored, they try to resell them for $90 because they’re “name brand”.. they’re also very stuck on the price. I would much rather buy brand new shoes WITHOUT stains for the extra $10. I never purchase anything on here, because the sellers list too high. Because I list my items very cheap, I constantly have buyers and things aren’t sitting on my selling list for months!",3

After using it for 2 or 3 days I purchased like 6 items that would’ve costed me 1500$ alone for about 500$ and sold one of my own items in about a day.

I wish I knew how long this was going on for because you CANNOT do it through the app , you have to find it under “subscriptions” in iTunes or wherever your phone puts it.

1789,"Inactive users: Offer up should start putting expiration on posts and notify users of accounts being deactivated for lack of use or for not keeping up with their sales. A reminder for those who forget to mark items that are already sold would be helpful so we don’t spend time going through no replies because apparently that is the way to let someone know that their item is sold or not interested in dealing. Majority of sellers don’t reply, or items turn out to be sold already. Lets not forget this an Offering page not a business page and should consider or at least reply instead of ignoring offers.",3

Normally my account stays signed in and I can open it up and do whatever, but now I have to sign in EVERYTIME and it won’t even stay signed in. I’ll click one of the different tabs on the bottom to search for items or something and it tells me to sign in again, I do and I click the same button and it tells me to sign in again!

I continue to receive notifications asking me to post items, asking me to buy stuff and of items that i searched once and am no longer interested on. This has become really frustrating as I wish to only receive message notifications. I have all other options disabled and somewhow, offer up has no respect for the user’s right to not want their notifications. Its got to the point that I had to block the app from sending notifications and now I can’t see when people message; thanks offerup!",2

Our whole area here in California is mostly Ag and construction that section would explode!!! Please please",5
1793,"Waste of time: Now that I had the app for about a year it was a complete waste of my time. People would contact me who had no intention of buying anything I was trying to sell. Or the few who made offers made completely unrealistic offers. I ended up donating my equine supplies worth several thousand dollars rather than sell to people who wanted to buy perfectly good saddles, tack, etc for ridiculous prices. The app only allows one price. I think they would be better served if there was a range allowed. So if you put in too high of a price closer to actual value no one wants it; if you put in too low of a price people want to buy everything for that price. I have since deleted this app as well as a couple of other of the “sell to your neighbor” type apps.",1

It’s frustrating and annoying so I decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and I’m also doing a review in the section. I don’t think I’ll ever wanna use OfferUp again I’m gonna delete it from my phone and use Facebook marketplace,1

Aside from lousy/nonexistent customer support and an increasing number of unchecked scammers making it difficult to use this service safely and successfully, OfferUp used to be a good way to trade, especially locally. 

OfferUp: please improve your customer support and management of real scammers instead of letting algorithms ban loyal and rightful users.",1
1796,"not sure what happened: app is comically slow now, my phone is brand new there’s no reason it should take minutes for stuff to fully load, app crashes a lot. I like offer up but whatever update you guys rolled out has ruined the app, basically unusable now. 

Update: app somehow got even more annoying to use. The amount of ads is ridiculous and you can’t scroll without accidentally tapping one and being sent to a sketchy website or forced to watch a pop up for multiple minutes before it allows you to close it. You can’t remove saved items in bulk you have to do it individually. The app is slightly less slow but even worse to use. I just stick to Craigslist now.",1

I should not receive a request for“ ""OfferUp"" would like to find and connect to devices on your local network”. It doesn’t need it, and they should be ashamed for asking as a SHOPPING app. Good grief.

I was reached by someone from OfferUp and did not do anything to help . I also tried to open on old account and they wouldn’t let me open it again because they said I was selling prohibited items and that’s not true.

1803,"Banned for absolutely no reason: I got kicked off the app for no reason. Contacted their support team which took them forever to respond and they told me I violated their policy with no explanation! Never did I post anything against their guidelines. Super unprofessional, I am in the right and they are treating me unjustifiable. not listening to what I have to say. Now they are telling me they won’t overturn my account. Offer please fix my issue or you’re going to loose a lot of members if you haven’t already.",5
1804,"Very Disappointed: I wish we could something with people who are dishonest after selling you an item who don’t respond after excepting offer it would make things so much easier and faster to buy and sell instead of letting you think you have bought something and now you need to make pick up arrangements while the whole time the seller is still offering it to someone else and then sells to highest buyer 
Very dishonest fellow seller’s",5
1805,"Short and Sweet !: It’s easy and straightforward! Looking to buy a cute chair to finish off your room or daughters room? Then just type in ‘chair’! My favorite part is “Pick Up” , literally can buy the perfect chair from someone so close by for a grate price!
**OR! 
If you want to get raid of something you no longer need or have use for , don’t throw it out! Offer it Up ! Picture , Price and short description is all you need! It’s like Recycling ! 👍🏼💪🏼♻️🌎 you know what they say one mans trash can be another mans treasure 🤷🏻‍♀️😅",5
1806,Blocking accounts for no reason: This is ridiculous I have reached out to OfferUp support on multiple occasions regarding my account being blocked. They replied saying I violated posting rules which they never specified what posting rules. I literally only lost furniture and clothes or shoes so what violation could I have made repeatedly. My husband also created an account and haven’t done anything to violate and have been blocked as well. This app used to be my favorite but OfferUp has become horrible and their customer support isn’t helpful. I keep emailing with no return email or support to clear this error. It’s crazy how a real person can get blocked but all these scams that are on OfferUp are still very much up and running.,1
1807,Horrible: I have been trying to communicate with offer up for almost one whole month email after email and they provide only a very vague response with no explanation just saying I committed a violation but they cannot explain or give me an example of what violation I had committed. I will block on offer up I know I did not commit any violation I was a five star seller 2017 never had any issues yeah offer up has the courage to block me for a violation I supposedly committed but cannot explain what was committed and why I am being blocked exactly prior before I got blocked I was not getting any views or was able to get my messages through to other buyers I will communicated to them about that reason and got horrible feedback,1
1808,"BUYER BEWARE: the amount of scammers on this app is sickening. it seems offerup relies on other users to report sellers instead of finding a solution for the problem themselves. i was scammed for $550 by a VERIFIED seller who had 63 5 STAR reviews. how this guy got his account to look so legit, i don’t know, but there’s thousands more just like him on the app right now. on top of scammers with legit looking accounts, there are so many listings that are blatantly obvious scams on offerup that you just have to ask yourself if they’re trying to do anything about it. i would use this app for local pickup only. buying anything shipped is just too much of a risk.",3
1809,"Could use improvements: I use this app has a another venue for selling my things. Though you can see ratings for people you can’t rate them if they flake on you. Only if you actually sell to them then you can rate them. Also if you do sell to someone and you rate them that doesn’t mean they will rate you which is also frustrating. 
I also get a lot of scammers that first seem interested in my items and then ask me for my number. When I look at their profile I can see they haven’t verified everything then they shouldn’t be allowed on the platform.",3
1810,"Businesses Overwhelm This App: The app allows businesses to list items & they overwhelm the search results when looking for something. Also, the businesses they allow are very shady businesses that will not give you any prices until after you apply for financing which is a very shady business practice. Typically if you’re financing something the business would tell you what amount you’d be financing before you decide to apply for financing. To solve this offer up should offer the ability to allow or disallow search results from businesses.
Update:  OfferUp has given no feedback, no response, nothing.  Unless you want to be ripped off by a store offering financing for terribly overpriced items DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!",1
1811,"Great App, Mobile-Only: Convenient format and platform. Easy to search items and to use. I love the ease of interacting with buyers & sellers that doesn’t involve email! I wish, though, that I could post items for sale from my computer. Sometimes I take photos from a digital camera instead of my phone or iPad, and to post them I have to upload them to the computer from my camera, email them to myself, open the email on my phone, and post to OfferUp. It’s nonsense. But speaking only of the app itself I really do like it.",5
1812,"Beyond terrible: This app is horrible. I downloaded it to try and sell some items I was getting rid of, that were new, or barely used. As soon as I started posting, I started receiving messages from “people” who seem to be interested at first, by starting out asking, “Hi, is this available?” And then they turn out to be bots or something else of that nature, demanding that I send my phone number. Absolutely not. I also had an account send a message asking if I had things to sell. Are you f#%*ing serious?! Also, tried to contact customer support, which is nearly impossible. What type of website is being run here? I have had this for less than 12 hours and am about to delete me account, but wanted to leave a review first. Absolutely terrible.",1
1813,"A lot of scammer: Be ware of all the scammers on this app, I would suggest people do some research prior to making any purchases on this platform. Some of the scammers would have 5 starts reviews due to the system loophole. I was scammed by a seller. I was unable to leave a feedback due to that seller never checked the item as sold. Seller continues to sell the same item over and over again until this day. 

I reported seller to customer service. Don’t expect to hear from them at all. All you will get is an automatic reply and all communication stops there. This platform is really a perfect place for scammers. Innocent buyer that put their trust in scammers who appeared to be highly rated sellers. Customer won’t do a thing. I highly doubt they will reply to any other customer request.",1
1814,Horrible Place to Sell anything: My first time selling something they allowed a customer to lie about the purchase even when it was clear she was trying to scam people. I don’t trust it at all and would never recommend it to anyone. Their service fees are ridiculous and they allow people to be unverifiable on there. Their customer support is clearly clueless and doesn’t have a single smart person with common sense on there. If I could give them negative starts I would. All they do is hide behind the screen and not actually respond by calling or investigating. I am angry that now I get my product back all broken and don’t get money for it even though I provided them with product photos before I shipped.,1
1815,"Lot of bad sellers: Waste of time, a lot of people who: 
agree to meet & stop responding when you’re there.. 
Send “Still available” msgs even tho it’s only been posted a day & then never send real offers..
Expect items to be delivered for free
Scammers who recreate profiles to steal..
Sell stuff that’s worth more than in store prices.. 

Stuff thats been there for years n profiles are no longer in use (should delete listings after 6 months at least) 

Too many ads! Selected adds just Bc you click on something.. you can accidentally click on a pair of shoes & you’ll see those shoes being advertised over & over again 

Needs better review system instead of stupid stars. Needs written reviews for future buyers to know whether person selling is good or bad.. even if they haven’t bought anything from them.

Agreed to meet a lady with no reviews but a bunch of sold items, gave me fake address then stopped replying a minute after she told me to go 

There’s nothing I can do about it but waste my time & gas 

Need to delete & ban people who misuse the app & trust of buyers! Waste of time! Better apps 
Save your money too",1
1816,"I never gotten my money back from transactions: I never gotten my money back from the cancellation transactions. It doesn’t show any history in my PayPal or my Bank history. BUT i have the ENTIRE conversation in OFFER UP. He accepts my offer and never ships it and I never gotten my money back. I never check the history until I realize I never got the money back. It happened 4 times and he has the same lying excuses over, over and over again. I already sent 2 reports on Offer up about this.

I do like Offer up mobile friendly interface but this whole time I thought my money was getting returned to me through all of this cancellations through this buyer that kept canceling after he accepts and makes the excuses, to tell to buy again 😡😡😡",1
1817,"Counter offers: I think it would be great that if all counter offers had to be given in their own section/ field rather than in written in a message. It would be nice for buyers and sellers as well as OfferUp to track the counter offers that are being made. You offer an item at a good price say $100 for a $300 item and someone offers $20, my idea would suggest to the person making that ridiculously low offer that “Opps you’ve made a mistake, did you mean $20 for an item offered for $100” or something like sorry the seller is “firm on the price” as mentioned on the item!",4
1818,"Indispensable!: This is just one of those apps that you just can’t not have on your phone! I discovered it quite by accident but have used it every day to hunt down what I’m looking for. Love this app. 

SUGGESTION FOR DEVELOPER

I’d give it five stars if the developer could provide one essential feature: a way to save search parameters so when I open the app I don’t have to re-input search options such as price range, item type etc. this would save time and frustration, particularly when the app has to reload due to the phone not keeping it open in the RAM after switching to another app.",4
1819,"Notifications: This app deserves 5 stars if it weren't for the notifications. I would like to be able to enable notifications for certain events only, such as a message from a user. I hate constantly getting notifications for new items in my area. If I were interested in buying anything, I'd search it myself. For now, I have notifications off but will only enable them when buying or selling an item, while still having to clear my screen of redundant ""new items"" notifications. Extremely frustrating and hope to see manually selected notification events in the near future in an update.",3
1820,"Great App Watch for Scammers: I’ve use this app to buy and sell for years. It’s awesome. There are a lot of scammers on this app as well as marketplace. 

The SCAMMERS always want your phone number. DO NOT give them your phone number. Communicate on the app only. They are using your phone number to create google accounts to scam other people and get access to your information. 

We all know you never send anyone money until you are face-to-face looking at the product. Right?! Be smart. Be safe",5
1821,"Good app, stupid users: Update: users are smarter, but still annoying. OfferUp really needs to work on cutting down on the spammers who ask if something is still available and then stop responding. 

It would be nice if, in addition to verifying user identities, they included their IQs. I have had nothing but stupid questions from people who apparently can't read the item description. ""Where is the item located?"" There is literally a Google Map insert in the item description as well as a statement of the item location. ""How much?"" THE PRICE IS LISTED. 

As such, this app has been a complete waste of my time.",4
1822,"Great, but addicting: This is a really cool app. With this app, I found amazing deals on my phone, a new mattress, and an office chair. However, it does consume a lot of time, and you usually want to ask a good number of questions before deciding to meet to see the item.
There are also some people who aren’t legit. Most people are, but like any selling site or app, there are scams. 
The only problem I have with the app itself is that it doesn’t always notify you when people have messaged you. You have to go back into the app periodically to check if you are buying/selling something.
All-in-all, great.",4
1823,"I really like it: It's just annoying when you see things on there that have been up for a year. You should have a system in place that gets rid of post that are older than a month. If people are still trying to sell their item, have a message pop up asking them if they are still selling it, if they fail to answer it within a 3 day period then it gets erased off the app. I just feel like it gets cluttered and there's no reason an item should stay up there if it's been there for 6+ months. I've even seen posts that are 2 years old",4
1824,"Ads are I intrusive even with “PROMOTE” upgrade: The ads are becoming more and more intrusive even despite my purchase of the PROMOTE upgrade. Ads are everywhere and it’s a regular occurrence to click on them on accident as they pop up or are in places your fingers naturally move to especially when the full screen ads pop up. 

Plan to go back to Craigslist once my subscription runs out because what was once an easy app to use, is becoming clunky and less functional.

Also, STOP SENDING ME NOTIFICATIONS OF ITEMS IVE SEARCHED FOR BUT NEVER ASKED FOR NOTIFICATIONS. It just creates noise for items I’m actually trying to sell. If I need a notification for something I’m looking for , I will create an alert. Such an awful user experience.",1
1825,"Trash app full of scammers and laughable "" customer support"".: Used app to buy a phone and was robbed by seller. Right after that incident my account got suspended for "" violating terms and conditions"" sent numerous emails to customer support to ask why my account was suspended and to report the seller who robbed me and always got the "" your account is suspended"" message back. It used to be free to post items for sale but lately they are charging a fee to do so. If you want to charge users you must offer a better service than your competitors. Facebook marketplace is a thousand times better, safer AND IS FREE! Offer up is full of fake scammer profiles, buggy, useless customer support and on top of that they want you to pay for it. What a joke!",1
1826,"Used to love it: I used to love offer up. Would sit there for hours and just look at stuff for fun. Also for finding stuff you need, but, now they added ads and the app is soooo laggy it’s almost unusable. Now I only get on when I neeeeeed something. And am still hesitant. Two weeks ago or so, would have given it 5 stars. Sad the devs got greedy after so many years.  

Also I wouldn’t be opposed to premium, but not knowing if the lag is still there, it is not worth my money.",5
1827,"Crappy App: Mediocre App at best. They updated their terms and services but they should have updated their app. They don’t monitor their adds at all, unlike Twitter (old), and Facebook where they do their supposed fact checking. 
If there is an ad more than 3 months old most likely it’s a dead ad and no one is tending to their ad. These should be removed. Also non-responsive ad placers should be monitored and removed. 
The “Purchase and Sales “ section should do what it’s labeled as, not list only your sales. I tried to go to a purchase to give a rating but Offer Up doesn’t list your purchase history. 
On a positive note, Craig’s List still works well.",2
1828,"Banned without reasoning: I was a member with Offerup since 2015. I’ve had no problems with the app until recently when I got banned for “violating the terms of the app”. I’ve been in contact with Offerup support and all I get is the same response. Keep in mind I was verified Tru You member with over 100+ 5 star reviews and out of nowhere I was banned. They even ban your device, and all your other devices that have been associated with that user. This app needs to stop banning people without reason. This ban also started once Offerup started to introduced a ton of ads and paid promotions. I’m they are banning out the people out of greed to promote more of there paid ads from the people who built up their popularity.",1
1829,"No way to contact after they screw up: I have tried to contact these folks for over a week now. I mail the package and after that they canceled the order. No problem, I asked the buyer to purchase again. They kindly did but because offer up goes off the label, they issued a new one and canceled again, even tho the product was long gone. Not bad if I could have gotten some tech support to fix it, but the only message that got thru was answered by an idiot that clearly had not even read the problem…Kind of like telling me to turn it off and on again. Never been more frustrated in my life. I’ll not be using this “service” any more. Offer up, you owe me the cost of the sale.",1
1830,"False Notifications: I have a saved search and frequently get notifications that there are “X new items matching” my saved search.  When I click into it, it only displays “Results you’ve already seen” with nothing new at all.

It’s just a false notification to get you back into the app.  Because of this I no longer check these notifications. On top of that, you can’t apply your saved search filters on a new search, making the saved search feature utterly useless.  

It’s otherwise a pretty good app, but a classic case of the boy who cried wolf",3
1831,Took my listing down w/o even researching: I posted an item for sale.  Submitted 5 pictures and one picture just happened to be a screenshot from the manufacturer showing what the item sells for brand new.  My listing never got posted because OfferUp stated I violated rules that my listing is an advertisement.  If they would have even remotely looked at my listing and my pictures u can clearly see it’s not an advertisement. What a crock.  I have always done this with all my listings never had a problem. I haven’t listed anything in months so do know what has changed since. They deleted my listing entirely.  I made another new listing and still can’t find it anywhere as the new one still not posted either.,1
1832,"Random banning: I was banned without notice with an outstanding record and no issues. In fact, i was inactive for about a month until randomly i could not access my account. No one seems to understand how OfferUp is banning their users, Reddit is full of users having the same issues. They don’t give any details on how terms and conditions were violated and support is impossible to reach. This has been such a bad experience every since they released this new backend IP blanket banning update which is essentially flawed. I don’t even want to get into the horrible UX designs and lackadaisical product planning. Seems like the app has no roadmap and developers probably have no guidance from product and design.",1
1833,Too many scammers!: Offer up could be really good if they figure out how you can pay without getting scam because they don’t accept PayPal which I’m protected with and also they have too many people that are listing things really cheap and when you click on how long they’ve been they’ve been on offer up for a day or so. They need to stop that from happening. The other thing is when you were discussing something it should be up to me if I can give them my phone number to get an address so I can meet with him and offer up doesn’t allow you do that they kick you off if you do that it doesn’t make any sense to me.,2
1834,"Got my account closed out of nowhere: Customer service is a bad. Seems like no real person replies to your emails when you are literally explaining yourself very good. I got my account closed because they said I had 2 accounts which is not true. I provided the only email I use for my account and they still couldn’t help me. They said I violated the community guidelines and that they reserve the right of telling me why. The money I had on there $56 is lost. They said if the money it’s pending to my bank will automatically disappear. They are literally robbing me! And it’s not fair I get my money and account taken away! I make a living from there , that’s how I feed my baby! I will give 5 stars once I get my account back",1
1835,Has really gone downhill buggy: Been using for about 2 years. App started out fairly good but now has so many bugs and scammers that it’s not worth the hassle. And customer support is non existent. Search alerts are a mess and a joke. Had one set for “specialized” and one day it all of a sudden started showing variations of that spelling including “specials” which every other post uses. Got 400+ alerts every few hours for items not at all related to my search!! Same for other search alerts. Waste of time!!  I think they started doing this to artificially inflate views to drive more as revenue. I’ve stopped using it and went back to other options. Fix it or you’ll continue to lose business.,1
1836,technical issues: I have been using offerup for the past year and it was working great for me as a platform to sell my used shoes. until last week when i got “banned” out of no where. i’ve tried to figure out why and have contacted offerup but they have not responded once. i have spoke with others on being banned as well and they have the same problem. offerups help team is terrible at responding and does not help when needed. they continue to ignore my emails and have not let me post on my account since saying “0 views” and sometimes it’ll post an item and it will disappear right away. they need to fix this asap as they are one of the biggest marketplaces on the app store right now.,1
1837,"Notifications are completely dysfunctional: It boggles my mind that an app this popular produces notifications so randomly. Right now as I type this the app icon shows me a red notification alert but inside the app there are no notifications to be found, not even in the annoying “you searched for this item one time six months ago so here every single day are more items like it!”  Combine that with actual messages from buyers that somehow do not produce a notification and I only happen to see them if I open the app. I wish I didn’t have to use OfferUp at all because of this but it’s still better than Craigslist.",2
1838,"Horrible Support/Customer Service: The customer support is absolutely awful.  The most unhelpful and rude workers ever.  Don’t expect them to fix any issues, or actually do anything.  I was locked out of my account for 3 weeks while being charged for their service without being able to access my account via app or website.  Customer service would respond to an email every few days and did absolutely nothing to help.  

The app was a good idea, but is run terribly.  What a waste of an app/network.   

Also take note at how many scams OfferUp allows/promotes.  Ironic that they don’t care about users getting scammed as long as they get their cut.  Truly the worst management I have ever seen from an app/company.",1
1839,"So many scams: This app has really gone down in reliability in the past few months. I buy and sell Nintendo Switches on here. At this point about 4 of every 5 switches are scammers asking you to contact them outside the app or saying they ran out of gas 10 miles before meetup and need you to venmo them some cash to get them the rest of the way there. My favorite is the guy that continually posts a switch saying it’s his birthday and he wants to give away the switch and just needs you to cover the $50 shipping cost stated all in very broken English. Offerup has a problem with scammers, and it has gotten waaay worse over the past year. Definitely be very careful when purchasing something on this app.",1
1840,"My Review: I've been using Offer Up for 2.5 years now and the app had been wonderful to me ever since. I've made lots of money selling used items of mine I don't need anymore from shoes, to electronics, to accessories, and much more. Another really great thing about the app is that people have really great deals when selling their stuff. Especially cars and electronics. Overall It's a great app to have if you have possessions laying around collecting dust. You can make so much money and find so many great deals on what you need. Just be careful.",5
1841,"Remove Old Listings!: I am a buyer looking for used video game systems. This is the only buyer/seller website I’ve used where 90% of what I see is just a graveyard of old listings (items which have already been sold months or years ago). It’s so hard to find items that are actually newly listed and available, and there’s no way to tell unless you message the seller directly. And good luck getting a response! Of the 20+ people I’ve contacted, literally ONE of them got back to me. Honestly just use Mercari instead, I got a great buy within a week of downloading. Offer Up, you need to do SOMETHING about old listings unless you want to become obsolete. I never touch this app anymore, it’s so much easier to shop elsewhere.",1
1842,"Editing item tool doesn’t work for the item’s name: This app is pretty good and from what I read a lot of the other bugs have been fixed, which is great. However, I’ve tried a few times to change the names (or add words) to the item’s name using the editing tool but when I go to save my progress..it hasn’t. I don’t see a way to change or edit the name without having to post a completely new post with the same item (which is inconvenient) especially if you pay for the premium version like I do.",4
1843,"people do not take time to buyer-seller reviews: i have always gave a review to my buyers & they do not take time to review in return. i bought something today & i waited for a review so i can review them also, but on the app it said that the seller sold it to someone else, which is not correct ( i bought the item ) - leaving a rate for someone is very important. because it helps build credibility. 

also, i can be interested in an item & send a text to the seller. i can see they read the message but they never respond back. IF THE ITEM IS SOLD PLEASE MARK IT SOLD. i notice a lot of people don’t do either (mark it sold or respond back) it’s a waste of time",3
1844,"Just a few improvements: I like the app, but they keep updating it, but never fix the saved items area of the app. If you saved something and it sells, it stays on your saved items list forever!!! And you have to literally go threw each item and open it to remove it. There isn’t even a button were you can select multiple to erase at a time. Ive had offer up since it came out, and now have 3000 saved items that is a slow hassle to remove. They need to fix this problem with app soon, than it will definitely be a good app",4
1845,"Don’t sell here!: Letgo merging with Offerup was a huge mistake! Letgo worked much better! Offer up app doesn’t work. I sold an item about 3 weeks ago, I have money in my account from and item I sold and shipped and it doesn’t allow me to cash out. When I select cash out it takes me to a screen that tells me that I need the latest version of Offerup. I click on update now, it takes me to the AppStore which my app is current and up to date so the AppStore screen says open. Again I click cash out and the same thing happens. What a mess. If you do sell here don’t ship anything! You won’t get your money! List your items then exchange #s or emails to make arrangements to meet and sell/purchase. The app really is no help. I am completely disappointed.",1
1846,"Scammer haven: So offerup doesn’t monitor the scammer making false accounts, false free items, asking to pay for shipping outside of offerup, canceling payments after items have been shipped. It’s gotten out of hand. Even if you report it offerup does absolutely nothing. I’ve been watching this happen for a couple of years now and it’s only gotten worse. If you do meet with people then your better off making the sales/purchases. But doing any of that through this system with payments and shipping will cost you your items or payment. They need to change it quickly. This place is a scammer haven most of the time.",3
1847,"Needs to have a standby option for items!!: Great platform, everything is great except when you already have a meeting with someone to meet and check an item you have posted. It is extremely annoying that there is no built in option to place your item on standby so other buyers can see you have something in the works so you dont get endless new offers and then have to tell them all the same thing about how you have a meeting and will then continue to the next person if it falls through with the first one... please add this!",4
1848,"No control of criminal activity/phishing: In one week of having the app I got three different phishing attempts. People want you to communicate off the app via text or email and then ask for your bank info so they can “pay” you. 

The app assumes very little responsibility for the criminal activity that makes use of the platform. After reporting theses users this is the email offer-up sent me: 
“If you’re reporting a crime, please file a police report with your local authorities. Once we have the case number, our Trust & Safety team can help your local law enforcement in their investigation.

Please provide the following information:

1. Your full legal name. 
2. The case number and the name of the police agency who made the report.
3. The investigating officer's name.
4. A phone number where we can reach the officer.
5. The officer's email address.”

This is lazy on offfer-ups part. They should do the work and report these users to the authorities and keep whatever records they need to keep to keep the app safe. They’re supposed to be proactive and stop crimes before they occur instead of waiting for users to be victimized.",1
1849,Can’t write anyone on there app: For the past month or more it gives me a error screen every time I try and offer somebody money for there item. So I cant contact anyone on the app it’s useless to me. I also have a few things for sale and I can’t see them at all I get another error screen. I try and look at messages and the error screen pops up and says try again later. I logged into both of my accounts and it’s like that. Re downloaded the app and it’s the same thing everything time.,5
1850,"OfferUp is EASILY hacked by scammers!!!: Thanks to mediocre security and clearly bad backend system implementation, OfferUp is trivially hacked by even the most amateur hackers. My account was hacked and some scammer started posting many scam ads for a free PS4, inundating my phone with a jillion responses for an item I did NOT post. Then the hacker plain stole my account by changing all the contact info. What an absolute joke of an app! I tried to delete the items, but thanks to even more brainless app design choices, you can’t delete items or messages from users. Uninstalled and will be marking any and all correspondence from OfferUp as scam email as clearly that’s all this app is good for. Reporting this to Apple App Store as well since this is clearly just a haven for scammers and hackers.",1
1851,"Just one feature I would like to have..: Offer Up is great! More transparency with sellers and buyers as long as you’re smart about how you do business (that goes for anything sold/purchased second hand). Anyway, the ONE feature as a SELLER I would like to have is for anyone to see how many people favored an item
That’s being sold- I think this would create a sense of emergency and more frequent purchases would be made. So if I’m selling sunglasses, an interested buyer  should be able to see that my listing was saved 5 times so far... 
That’s all though! Everything else is great!",4
1852,The worst support ever: The support behaves like robot without any minds and they wouldn’t get back to you with any meaningful explanation for actions they take. They would remove listing while it is authentic claiming it is counterfeit. When questioned on how they arrived at the conclusion they start bombarding you with link to guidance  with an intention to trigger you or something... after reading what they send me I still can’t figure how it applies to my item that is being listed everywhere else without trouble. No stock pictures were used. Item was explain why the item was removed; item preowned with signs of use. All details and pictures of serial numbers posted. What is wrong with them? I definitely don’t desire to be treated like that! Horror stories all over especially BBB,1
1853,"So easy and feels safer than other websites: I'm moving and wanted to get rid of a lot of things, from a coffee maker to my bed. I started using OfferUp and no joke (and I rarely review apps), I had almost everything sold with 2 days! And I like knowing that there is a profile with each buyer, so I feel safer when meeting up to give the item. The buyers have all been very nice and easy to work with. When I move and need to then buy stuff, I'm excited to use this again. Now I have to go meet 3 people today to sell items to!",5
1854,"Don’t trust this website shipping your items: After having over 150 sales and many followers , I’m very disappointed in this app website . I never received MY DEPOSITS for items I shipped ,   I have been waiting over 14 days for 3 transactions I trusted OfferUp and shipped my items to buyers that YES received my merchandise and after many many support requests I to this day still HAVEN'T received my funds deposits DUE,  I ONLY get automated responses stating I will receive my funds next business day and then nothing , I have over 150 successful transactions , I TRUSTED OfferUp with my items and that I would indeed be paid after buyers received items and ALL buyers are very happy , therefore I feel  I’ve been scammed , worst customer service with only automated responses that lead to nothing . Beware",1
1855,Terrible update: I’ve been a member of the offer up community since 2015. I’ve sold many items and have bought many items but apparently I can no longer do that unless I scan my drivers license into this app. I have verified my number and my email but that is no longer sufficient for them. I can no longer inquire about an item or make an offer. This is a big fail as sellers lose customers like myself who don’t feel comfortable scanning their drivers license to the offer up app system. With all the cyber ID theft and hacking of systems I don’t believe posting or buying on offer up is worth my identity  security. It seems as if this is the end of my journey with this buy and sell community. With FB market becoming more popular I doubt I’ll miss this.,1
1856,"Not Impressed: OfferUp began as an incredibly easy-to-use platform to sell unwanted items at a relatively fast rate. Over the last 6-8 months, that has diminished greatly. The company needs to offer a more selective screening process for BOTH buyers and sellers. I cannot begin to count the number of planned meetings to sell items to people who either don’t show or just stop responding to messages. It’s one thing if they are picking up at a nearby location, but some people insist on meeting towns away only to disappear without word after agreeing to a place and time. It’s becoming an app that sends me offers on items only to have me respond to static on the other side of the screen. It’s a waste of time at this point.",2
1857,"Banned due false accusations from scammer: I was a long time user of Offerup.
I had a recent encounter where someone was trying to scam me and when I realized, they became upset that I didn’t want to move forward with the transaction and reported my account for “selling drugs” which was completely false. I emailed Offerup countless times to try to get my account back and asking for proof of these accusations. Nothing was posted on my account nor did I have any conversations of these accusation. They did not respond and banned me from using the app at all. Not to mention, I got assaulted and beat during a meet up with a “buyer” using this platform so be careful. They need to require more identification and security to use these accounts.",1
1858,"Nothing but a big waste of time: The worst selling App out there. Most of the time guys are just wasting my time, and in no way interested in what I’m selling. They just see women’s clothes and assume I’m a woman and treat it as a dating App! The platform is full of flaws, I went through the verification process all over again and because my account name is my legal middle name, they said it didn’t match my legal name on my DL, which is incorrect on their part. It has been impossible to be able to list anything and support is the absolute worst! OfferUp is a total waste of time, better off with Poshmark or Mercari, even Depop and EBay is much better. After all of that, I somehow still get notifications from other sellers. What a joke! L",1
1859,"Petty dishonest business.: The delusional reprobates running this app delete your account if you give the app a bad review. Literally. I posted an authentic Louis Vuitton belt I personally purchased with legit images and a video I made and that ‘violated’ the communist community guidelines. Good luck running your mentally unstable company further into the ground, I think you can do it. Communist delusion tactics like this only destroy things but don’t pay attention to reality or history like a rational person. For the rest of the app review I would say there is far less traffic on here than any other app I’ve used for this purpose. But I can see why. They also take a fairly large percentage of commission. I strongly do not recommend this app.",1
1860,"Loving Offer Up: When I’m looking for a certain item my first thought is Offer Up. I love that it’s so user friendly. I have purchased several items on Offer Up and have always been satisfied with both the prices and availability. There is only one draw back for me, items seem to remain on offer up even when sold. I would suggest finding a way to have sellers remove or renew items items that are sold or are still available.",5
1861,"Horrible Customer Service: I was really enjoying the app at first. When you place an offer and the the product is actually delivered, the concept is great!! This week I was scammed on two different offers and went to place a report for both of them after not hearing anything from the sellers, but the report system is down. So then I have to report that the report system is down by placing another report. They do not have live or responsive customer service, they just send you generic follow-up emails. Really disappointed and frustrated by this experience. You should not promise user protection if users have to go through this many loops to get their money back on fraudulant sales.",1
1862,"Novice Offer Up user: Just moved to Avondale, AZ from Yakima, WA. I have found the Offer Up APP very useful to find things or replace things from a big move. I don’t think I would be able to find these items thru any other means without spending on new items.  I am familiar with Craigslist and have used it at times. Being able to utilize both APPs is very beneficial and convenient. I’ve made very good purchases for Building Materials, Furniture and Animals. Sellers are very reasonable and responsive.",5
1863,"Can’t even list items: I just redownloaded this app after not using it for around 3 years. I was able to log back into my previous account without issue; however I have immediately run into a roadblock when attempting to list items for sale. When creating a listing I am told to select a cover photo, however none of the photos show up after I take them with my camera OR select them from my camera roll. When I hit the “next” button I am told to add photos. 🤦‍♀️ which I am doing but the photos are not showing up!!! I tried restarting the app but it doesn’t fix anything, and I am currently unable to go forward with the listing process. Very frustrating.",1
1864,"READ: Terrible app…I can’t believe I spent so much time and effort building an account with 100+ reviews just for it to get banned. I’ve done nothing wrong and even contacted support for help. All they did was give me an automated message saying I got banned without even giving a reason. I’ve waited days for a response but still nothing, but I check twitter and the support team is reaching out to other people when I’ve been waiting for a response. I even have pending payments and stuff needed to be shipped. I highly don’t recommend this app for anyone, they care more about the ads they post rather then the sellers who’s been using the apps for years. I’m definitely switching to Mecari and Facebook Marketplace.",1
1865,"Total gatekeepers: Unless you spend a ton of money boosting the promotion your products won’t be seen, the have very strict rules about what can and can’t be sold and the reasons are absolute bogus. if you can attach it to a gun it can’t be posted, i understand firearms but i can’t post a dang flashlight or a red dot. my items keep getting removed even tho there are plenty of duplicate items still up 10 months after it sold, and that brings me to my last complaint, you can leave items up for years after being sold taking up half the room on the whole app with already sold adds. i’d rather use craigslist still, or even newspaper adds. offer up is complete trash.",1
1866,"Easy of use is nice, nobody uses this app: The ease of use for this app is pretty good. Nobody uses this app. I had very limited views, no messages from any potential buyer. I posted same contents on FB and half the products sold within days.
Regarding the app: the one part that’s odd is when you post too many items for sale (I had 18 for sale), the app losses some of your items. I tried to scroll through all of my items for sale but it’s limited to roughly 15, the other items for sale you simply can’t see them or go back to edit them. Once you mark one as sold or delete one, now I can see the other items which weee missing.
Maybe it’s just central Ohio but everyone is selling, nobody is buying.",1
1867,"problem buyers??: I love being able to post items to sell on offer up but I wonder why people would communicate with you back-and-forth and then just never show up to pick up something or never get back to you after you've sent them detailed information. It would be nice if people wouldn't just hit the automatic ""is this item still available"" button. it would also be nice if someone wasn't interested that they would just say thanks for getting back to me, but I've changed my mind… That way you are not waiting around for people.",3
1868,"Ads: I lasted less than 5 minutes on the app before deleting it. The ads are so intrusive. I would accidentally tap them which is fine, no big deal, but then I was thrown to safari, then the App Store. Now I’m wasting time closing the pages on safari that automatically throw me to the App Store. It didn’t take long to realize that the app is not about buying and selling. It’s about ads on ads on ads.  And “promoted” items are also a complete time waster. When sorting from least to most expensive, I don’t care if the item is “promoted” I’m not touching it because it’s not in my price range. It just makes it harder to find what you’re actually looking for. This app is shameless debacle.",1
1869,"Notifications: I hate this app and it will fail for many reasons unless they make changes. The fact that you cannot simply turn of their annoying alerts and notifications pisses me off. I do not want to be pressured into using the app by notifications. “ new items from sellers you follow” even if you think you turn them off you don’t. I’m trying to use your app to Sell not buy. If I want to buy something I will look. If I wanted notifications about a certain item that I was looking for then I should be able to select that option. 

Not being able to just delete a posting is sooooo annoying. I hate this app so much.  

I usually selll on Facebook market place anyways.",1
1870,"Great app but not perfect: The app is perfect for me because I can engage with users and feel somewhat alleviated knowing that the users I choose to interact with are active participants in the community and have user ratings for their own transactions by others who have rated them. It’s like Yelp ratings for users. But when I go to rate someone after a transaction, I don’t always see the user as an option to rate, and instead I get other random users show up as options. This is not helpful, please fix this issue. I need to be able to rate the person I just had a transaction with.",3
1871,"Customer Service Is The Worst: I loved this app! Used it all the time. My account got hacked a while back and I was able to change my password, but something happened to the account so i still can’t log in. I have been trying to get customer service to look at my account for over 3 months. I keep getting the same robot responses back:

“Log out of your device, turn your device off and on again, and then log back in. If that doesn’t work, wait an update from offer up.”

When I finally got a person to talk to me (via email) I
Told him the issue and then he never responded. There is also no number to call or real person to actually talk to. They don’t listen or care about your problems. You just get the same responses back over and over.

I don’t ever write reviews but I had to write this because I’m so fed up with their customer service. I would just make a new account but i think I'm done using this app for good. Which is a shame because I really did enjoy it a lot!",2
1872,Ice maker: Very friendly and made sure I wasSatisfied first icemaker I brought from him was broken he made sure to get me out a new one the next day or whatever I wanted my money back or another ice maker thank you again for making sure I was a satisfied customer I would refer to others  this is my second day with my ice maker this one seems to be working great  and he even tried this one out before bring it to me. Now we just have to met again for the instruction manual lol,5
1873,Offer up lacks: Offer up sellers and buyers lack good communication skills in a timely manner. Most sellers forget to put sold and sometimes the post is from 6 months to 3 years out so your not sure item sold or not. Buyers make an offer and you either re-offer a little higher or except offer and then never hear from the person. Offer up needs to be more current to like 6 months and require buyers and sellers a 12 hour window to communicate. Items can be reposted if not sold if 6 months runs out and a Sold sign should be posted after sale is complete writhing 3 hrs of sale. All marked sold items should remain on no longer that 2 months then removed. Offer up needs a major overhaul.,1
1874,"It’s awesome just needs a little work.: So in my first day posting 6 items. 4 of those sold for asking price on day 1 and were picked up locally. I’m sure had i been able to sell those items nationwide i might have been able to get a little extra cash from my rarer items. That being said. I did not offer shipping because of how confusing it seemed. 
You choose a box size that determines how much the buyer pays in shipping but it doesn’t tell you how much it’s going to cost you to get the box or to pay for postage.",4
1875,"terrible app: i got this app hoping it would be comparable to ebay. it could never come close. it’s very unorganized and all instructions are unclear and sent at the wrong times. i shipped two items to different buyers and later i got a notification that i needed to use the offer up custom shipping label in order to get paid. this was never brought up before. the company refused to pay me even though my buyers received/were about to receive their items. i then had to arrange for both buyers to pay me through a different app. another problem is that they are deceiving when attempting to trick you into purchasing premiums/promotions. i payed 7.99 to have my item promoted for 3 days (so that i would attract more views and have a higher chance of selling my item). almost none of the views came from the promo, so i payed $8 for pretty much nothing. plus, the app claimed that you get 14x more views if you pay for their promo- they were brutally wrong. i would never recommend this unorganized and confusing app if you want an easy selling/buying experience.",1
1876,"Good, but: Overall offer up is a good app when it works - but if you get blocked - almost impossible to get to the developers to get the problem fixed. They just send you a generic email saying you violated community guidelines.... I responded and asked which ones and what can be done to restore my account - received another generic response about violating community guidelines...(I had someone log into their offer up account from my phone and because they were blocked - it blocked me as well; all this considering I have had many good reviews selling and buying); so they app is good, but the developers response and customer support is pretty bad... hope to hear back from them eventually and get unblocked....",1
1877,Prices not shown on search results: I would love to use this app more but the fact that I can’t see the prices of things before clicking on them is very inconvenient and a huge design flaw. Please look at another selling app such as Mercari and see how they show prices of items when you search them so that you can click on a particular product listing or not by seeing a picture and a price for the item. I want to sell or buy things from Offerup but ever time I go on the app and notice the prices not shown I immediately click out because it’s not a pleasant user experience. At least make it an option to include that feature for people that want that.,2
1878,"Newest update ruined it.: They got rid of the ability to “follow” users, and the category for “From People I Follow” as well as “Free”. They also changed the default sort option to “most relevant” instead of “newest”.   They’ve changed the visual layout of saved items, and it is now almost too hard to see them to access. They’ve begun to over-categorize items.  This app was beautiful because of its simplicity.  They’ve over complicated everything, and as a result - ruined it. It’s clear that they’ve hired “over-qualified” engineers to improve the platform.  It is also clear that those engineers didn’t bother to learn anything about the the app users, nor did they bother to really use the app themselves before rolling out these changes.",1
1879,"Customer Support Slow and Scammers: Especially around this time of year with the new gaming consoles releasing, there has been a bunch of scammers on the app trying to sell the new systems. They either ask for you to pay on cash app or some other not secure way. For me, I purchased a item and the transaction was accepted by the seller. Everything was fine but the seller then deleted their account which made the app glitchy. I now have a transaction pending for a “Item Not Available” and it is still pending the money from my account and acting as if the transaction is still going through like normal. I have emailed and messaged Offerup support on Social Media but have not gotten any reply that is not a generic message.",1
1880,Great for acquiring things cheap: I’ve been using this app since 2015 it has been wonderful I don’t have very many complaints the only thing that is kind of annoying is they don’t force you to take down old ads so sometimes you can be interested in an item that’s been posted for three years I think this system needs to be updated like craigslist and force taken down after a year or so besides that great app no complaints bought thousands of dollars worth of merchandise and sold,5
1881,"Platform has a ways to go: Recent update only allows portrait view.   I guess the rest of us who use other devices other than a phone aren't considered when they design software.  User should be given the choice portrait or landscape view.
Any post that is more than a year old should not show up in searches,  most likely the seller has abondoned post or they can repost it.
Ads for other places like ebay are growing in number on the site.   Some might like these ads,  I prefer direct sellers.    should be able to filter these out or option to not see them.",3
1882,"Terrible. I miss Let go.: Womp womp is the best way to summarize this app. I sold a couple of things on letgo in the past and it was easy and user friendly. I attempted to do the same recently and found that it had been purchased by offer up. I said okkkkkk .... format looked similar.... posted my item for sale and that when the madness began. Error codes, not being able to respond to any potential buyers, customers service took days to respond to the issue and instead of helping they deleted my account and banned me because I gave my phone number to a potential buyer. The horror. I just used Facebook marketplace instead and sold my item within 2 days. This app is a colossal waste of time and not nearly as good as let go used to be. Such a shame.",1
1883,"Not my 1st rodeo...: I was on letgo, now its all on Offerup. I have always had 1 major beef with this venue;  Why aren't the items in their assigned CATEGORIES?  
    That would be Quite lovely. {I know.....what a concept. Am I rite!}
    Then folks could browse for things they are actually Interested in and not have to go through all of the flotsam and jetsam to find what they want!
   Keep each item in the correct category and then allow each item to be posted 1 time instead of over and over. It's exhausting! {I know I get tired of seeing things multiple times, I'm confident I am not alone in this} More folks would stay with the app if it were easier to navigate.
    Folks are only going to buy what they are interested in. Why make it so difficult?",1
1884,"Terrible: I first logged in using my Facebook account. I was looking for Nintendo switch at a reasonable price. I found one and made an offer to the seller. But for some asinine reason the app and the web browser wouldn’t let me log back into my account and check if the seller accepted or refused my offer. I tried several times to see what I did wrong. If it wasn’t bad enough I couldn’t deactivate my account and I’m stuck with a load screen that will never load in the next page. To be fair, it’s an ok service and nearly tolerable at best. Don’t bother asking people questions cause no I asked bothered to answered back. Just offer the money at the price they want or higher to reel the seller in. DONT LOG INTO USING YOUR FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE ACCOUNT. Just sign up and work from there.",1
1885,Needs better board editing functionality: I love the app but it’s come to a point where I’ve saved so many things on my quicksave and multiple other boards that when I try to Edit all the items it prompts me back to the very top of the board after each removed item and I have to go down 100+ items in order to find the next one to remove. If a feature like how you can choose multiple photos at a time and remove them from your camera roll could be adapted to our boards it would make for a much more seamless experience,4
1886,"OfferUp Scams: OfferUp is actual trash. I have been scammed, ripped off, and harassed on this site. people have used it to not buy my items but tried to “hook up” with me. i’m trying to sell my stuff and people are very disgusting. i sold my iphone 7s plus on here and i was scammed. i was never paid or reimbursed. multiple people have been scammed. i can’t get my phone back either so i’m out that money plus the shipping money. i’ve reported everything and yet NOTHING has happened. this app needs to be taken down. do not trust this app. do not get this app. don’t even think about selling things off this app. the chances of you throwing a stick at a bear and not being chased or attacked is higher than you downloading this app and not being scammed or ripped off. don’t get it.",1
1887,"Review System is broken...: The review system only allows you to rate someone who ""sold"" you an item, so of course every seller will have a relatively high rating with positive feedback. You unfortunately can't rate someone who blew off selling you something which has quite frequently happened on this platform. It's frustrating when someone says they'd sell you an item, you set up a time and place, then they just ghost you...especially when that seller has 5 stars. This app wouldn't be so hot if seller ratings were more reflective of every buyers experience. Not a fan of this service. Nor this app. And I'm rating it 1 stars because I complained to OfferUp and they basically told me ""it is what it is"" when they could easily fix their review system.",1
1888,"Bittersweet: On the fence for leaving or not. Seems like all of the other platforms are merging and getting bought out. While i think its a great idea of an app and well executed in most respects, i think things took a turn for the worse once they moved to the subscription model. Sometimes i post items and they get alot of hits the first few days then silience after that. Something tells me there’s an alogortihm that forces your item out of viewing after a certain time forcing you to pay for promoted items. There’s no relist item which would bring it to the top only archive. On the other hand the verification and review process does make it somewhat “safer” which is an added plus.",2
1889,"Hold feature inoperable: iPhone 10sMax.  Received a hold request. I have tried to accept it numerous times right after I received it. Keep get an error message and was unable to accept it.   If the originator pulled their request which may have caused this problem, the error message should indicate such instead of simply saying there was an error in the program. Otherwise it is really a good app. I had to knock it down two stars for either the failure of the program or a misleading and incorrect error message.",5
1890,"Best way to have a YARD SALE without the Heat of Florida sun!: Quality stuff!  I have sold to quality people and good prices.

One of the best features is the rating system.  I like to see who my buyers are, and what kind of history they have.  As a single female, I felt MUCH safer using Offer Up than Craigslist.  THANK YOU for everything, OFFER UP!!",5
1892,"Serious drawbacks: OfferUp comes with some serious drawbacks.  If you decide that you do not want to sell an item that you have listed, there is no way to remove the item.  You can only “archive” the item or “mark it sold”.  Neither of which completely removes it from their site.  Also their computer system has an algorithm that can remove your item if it thinks you have posted an item that has an authenticity issue.  If you can prove your item is authentic, they do not have a way to override the computer algorithm and will not restore your post.  They suggest that you repost the item with different wording.  Additionally, they cannot retrieve the wording in your original post or tell you what wording caused your post to be incorrectly pulled down.",1

One time I bought a tv and the picture they had of it, the tv was on. Post said it worked and blah blah blah. Of course the person selling had good previous reviews or I wouldn’t have messages him about it. Anyway I get home with it and sure enough it’s not turning on. I try to message the guy I bought it off of and I get the prompt that the “item is no longer available” with a blurry picture. I can’t see any previous messages from the user since he deactivated his account. TOTAL SCAM. Offer up needs to require the true identity in order to secure the buyers aspect of this app. Just my opinion.",1

1897,"Laughable: Long time user here. This app is still god. awful. For as long as Offerup has been around you’d think this app would have been better optimized by now. How Offerup has become one of the top reselling platforms is beyond me with their overall lack of standards. **If you’re gonna let an app look at and sell your personal info you may as well find a better one, with actual standards that gives a better experience.**

Update: omg. it’s even worse than before. The unrelenting ads make this app impressively unusable. Like top 5. Good job guys!  I’ve never known an app to feel sleazy or ghetto til offerup and then they double down on their game. What a joke",2
1898,"Infested with ads that block the whole screen: It’s so unfortunate what they’ve done to this app. It used to be great and I used to get lots of messages on a listing but they’ve destroyed it with how they’ve implemented ads. Every few minutes if you click on a post it will give you a full screen add that you can’t close for 5 seconds or more. Once you’re able to finally close it, a lot of the ads make it difficult to find the close buttons. It’s such a terrible experience to use the app now. I hate using it and I feel like buyers probably hate using it too. I’ve noticed a significant decrease in the amount of messages I get on a listing. Please get rid of these full screen ads!!!!",1
1899,"It’s done: OfferUp used to be a light in the online marketplace world. They are done. The app is now full of bugs, it takes forever to type in the inbox because the cookies are trying to load in background, search bar doesn’t auto correct and again freezes when typing in search bar so you have to delete and retype. (updated app versions) They want to push shipping products but horrible idea, no one is doing it or going too, they added a job link, another horrible idea no one is going to do, if this all isn’t bad enough they want to add items way outside your search area (even with 30 mile limit). Fire everyone there and start over or rehire old team.",1
1900,Great app.: This app lets me find plenty of items matching what I’m looking for at plenty of different price ranges a couple of things I wish were different would be a scrolling option meaning once I search for an item I can scroll instead of clicking on pictures and then back to the main search window another would be for more services being allowed to advertise meaning bakers chefs caterers rather than just contractors and mechanics and party planners.,5
1901,"Sellers and Buyers are not always responsive: I've found that both sellers and buyers on Offerup are not always responsive to messages. I think because it is so easy to create new ads and to respond to ads, people don't put in the effort needed to actually communicate with others. I've found that Craigslist sellers to be more responsive.

Also, searching for specific items requires looking through a gallery view of pictures without seeing captions describing the items being sold. It's often not easy to identify what item is being shown in a picture.",3
1902,"Ads are just ridiculous lately: Yes, this is a long rant for a good reason. Performance of the app is good but it’s rather full of the dreaded “SPONSORED ADS”. 
They used to be really good about this and there was a time where they didn’t cover the whole screen but this… this really made me delete it, when I started getting advertisements targeted to show up right after I look at a listing (about every 3 listings I look at), it makes the user of the app not want to continue to look at any more listings. 

Furthermore, there is no way to tell how long the advertisement is going to last, there is no timer and a little tiny tiny x in the top left (not right) hand corner will eventually appear, because they know that more users on average that are right handed will look at the advertisement longer in time because it takes them longer to tap on the other side of their screen and to find an escape.

These tactics are just ridiculous just to get some more cents, I’m sad that OfferUp chose to use advertisers knowing that they support the use of these tactics.",1
1903,"Thoughts..: As an active seller this has to be one of the worst selling apps on the market. Facebook Marketplace isnt even that great but it blows Offer Up by a mile. In the past 2 years there hasnt been any relevant updates to the app to make it more attractive to sell or purchase. Something needs to be done about all the “old” listings on the app, there has to be some sort of clean up to unlist items that have been there so long that the user never took the time to take it down. Overall its a pretty lackluster experience and its become worse now as “ADS” come up as you get out of a listing, I guess they have to make their money some way",2
1904,"Stop advertising in push notifications: This is a decent app for selling items. The app requests permission to show push notifications, which is necessary for messaging with buyers and sellers. Problem is, OfferUp doesn’t just use it for that. They also use it to advertise to you based on your previous searches. It’s possible to turn it off, but these should be on by explicit opt-in only. That will absolutely never happen because it’s less profitable, but asking for notifications for messaging and then using it for something else is what I would call a “dark pattern.”",3
1905,"Deserves 0 stars - Scam App Loaded with scammers: Trying to sell things and I immediately got contacted by flakes such as scammers who wanted my phone number and address so that they could send me (fake) cashier checks, people asking for half off when my ad says “firm” on price, or people that never respond back after asking me if my item is still available. Then there is the COST of advertising which Offerup keeps dinging my account while nothing gets sold! And did I mention the spam emails and texts and the privacy invasion (sending me ads based on personal info from my photos and shopping/buying history). All in all I came out negative in the red $40+  from this app. Thanks for scamming me Offerup!

DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP",1
1906,"Advertisements are not new items: When you save a search for a particular item you get notifications when someone posts an item matching the description…this is a great feature.

What isn't great is when you get notifications that a new item has popped up from your search only to find that it is a pad advertisement for something unrelated or outside of the saved search parameters. 

This has been happening over the last few months and needs to be fixed. I am happy to update my review when I notice this behavior is corrected. It’s bad enough that ads are injected into the search results but this new mechanism (probably to increase ad views in app) needs to stop",1
1907,Last update: I’ve been using offer up for years and years to sell small wood working items I make. After the last update I am not able to access my favorites folder in my photos. I sell a lot of the same things over and over again so its very easy to access my items and repost. With the new update I have to scroll through 10k pictures to try and find my items from the last 4plus years. Super annoying. Let me know if anything can be done for that. Thx,5
1908,"Great app. Has UX issues: I have had good success with this app, and I would give it a 5 star if not for some bad UX / dark patterns. For example, when a pop up to donate to Ukraine comes up there is no option to exit only two buttons both of which leave the app to go to the browser. Funky. The dark pattern was no option to exit the pop up for the free trial (which charges you $20 3 days later). You had to actually go to the trial page then back out. Just bad USER experience there. Besides that good app and experiences with buyers.",4
1909,"Older listings: Older listings should not be shown on the same search results as newer listings. It’s quite annoying to search for something and only to see it was posted over 12 months ago. Search results should be grouped together based on when they were posted. Meaning 0-3 months grouped together, 4-7 months grouped together, 9-12 months and over 12 months grouped together. Yes it would be great if people updated their ads, but that’s not happening. So OfferUp needs to do regular house cleaning or group ads together.",4
1910,"A seller’s perspective: My frustration is when people know it’s a good item and try to get the price lowered, which I have considered but then they don’t buy it and often times we miss out on a purchase by someone else.  Many clients ask a lot of questions and then don’t buy the item.  Time is wasted on the back and forth with a potential buyer.  I try to be as descriptive as I can when I post an item and potential buyer seems not  to read  the description with the posting.   I have placed some good quality items but people want to buy it  on a “garage sale price.”",3
1911,"Too many scammers: I like the app, the only problem is that there are too many scammers who message you & asking for phone numbers. 

I have sold quite a few things on here, the only thing is there are too many low ballers trying to buy for way less then what you ask for. 

The other thing is that we have to pay to promote an item after a few days. They should have at least 1-2 free promotions every month & then charge for more after that. I guess that’s how they make their money.",4
1912,"Not a good app to sell things: I no longer like the Offer Up app ever since they merged with Let Go app. Offer Up wasn’t my preferred app to sell on either way but now it’s even worse. I use to get at least 50+ views on my items I sell, but even after 3 weeks, some of my items still have 0 views or only 5 views. I don’t know what is up with the Offer Up app, but they should get rid of this app. I miss Let Go! You’d think the app should be better since it’s now combined but no, it’s not the same at all. Plus, it’s not as convenient posting an item for sell. Sometimes I try posting and it never saves and then I have to start over. So annoying! I just dislike the app. I’m deleting the app for good now.",1
1913,"Isn't working at all: Since the last update I've tried to get on the Offer up app on 2 seperate devices and all I receive is an error message saying ""Opp,something went wrong!"" With a little bear image. 

Nothing loads at all and the same thing happens if I try to create a new account.

My mother actually has the app too so she tried on her phone (both IPhone 11 pros) and she gets the same message.

She wrote to OfferUp customer service and the response was ""try restarting your phone, if that doesn't work try reinstalling the app""

We did, on both phones...same message.

This has been going on for probably almost a month so I can't beleive Offer Up hasn't figured out what's going on yet, it's obviously an app issue.

Yesterday I tried loading Offer Up from a browser on my phone and while images did load, clicking on anything refused to show the post, so it seems Offer Up is either really bad at maintaining their system..or they're not a company anymore?

I can't believe any active company would have issues like this for this long...",1
1914,"Way too many ads! Everywhere: Even in your inbox! And unlike a normal message, you cannot delete them. Since they are so frequent inserted between your messages, you could nit help but accidentally clicking on them unintended. Very annoying. 
Also unlike Craigslist which allows you to filter out merchants, Offer Up does not give you the option to only see true second hand sellers. Again often click in unintended merchant links with expensive items. Frustrating! Guess that’s how Offer Up makes its money- every unintended click counts! Bad!",3
1915,"What did I do wrong?: I tried to make my first purchase on this app and they intercepted it saying that their purchasing team occasionally reviews some orders and, of course, they chose my purchase to review for whatever reason and it would take up to 36 hours to review and for the purchase to go through. That was annoying, but whatever, fine. But then the next day, I go to get on the app to see if my purchase had been accepted and it said something like “my credentials had expired” and it automatically logged me out, and now I can’t log back in. Every time I try to log back in it says there is an error. What’s going on? Have I been blacklisted from OfferUp for no reason? Did my purchase go through or not? I gotta say, this is pretty lame.",1
1916,"Great app until recently: I have always enjoyed selling and purchasing on this app until recently. I would say within the last few months I have had several potential buyers messaging me indicating they would like to purchase an item/ items I am selling and than they don’t ask any questions regarding the item, except they request I give them my number. When I respond to their request with, “all questions will be answered on this app.” they stop responding. This has become a regular occurrence. I have reported each incident and to date I have not received any resolution. I have never encountered anything like this. I had hoped that after reporting each incident that something would be implemented to prevent/ stop these scammers.",1
1917,"Not a single sale: The platform isn’t that bad, it’s easy to list and choose shipping options. However, the shipping rates are very high compared to other services, and the people shopping on here are so much more flaky than on other platforms. For example, I got 5 conversations for one item, and all of them ghosted after saying that they were interested in buying. There’s simply no regulation around following up to an offer, which is not great. On other platforms, submitting an offer is final if accepted, which creates transparency and trust. I’m not sure I’d trust people on here to even follow up and meet me if they say they’re interested. I think I’ll stick to other selling platforms instead.",2
1918,"About the same as Craigslist: This app seems like a great idea. Verified buyers and sellers, working together to get things into the hands of people that will use them. 

Sadly, the “verified buyers” are really verified sellers. There may be contact info, but as a seller I can’t get to it. About 80% of my buyers have flaked on pickup, the only feedback in the app is for a completed purchase so there isn’t any incentive to only commit to actual pickup. When using OfferUp, the best solution is to have multiple people in line to pick up an item because at least then one might show. I’ve had better luck with actual pickup through Craigslist and Facebook.",3
1919,"Great app needs some key improvements: The app is great as far as user friendly, smooth, very very few bugs, user to user communication, but there are a few improvements that would do the over experience a lot better. One thing that needs to be addressed is the scam vehicle for sale posts, there are countless vehicles for sale at unreasonably low prices that always have a google email in the description and clearly they are scams. And the other improvement I would suggest is that older adds and non responsive adds be taken down after a certain time period or after being flagged as unresponsive.",3
1920,"They now add sale taxes on purchase.: This is such a let down.  It does not matter if the item is used or new when purchasing item online, they add sale tax to your check out.   I disapproved this new feature.  I ran a search throughout the forum, nothing was mention about adding sale tax to your purchase. Frustrating....  I think I am done selling on Offerup.  I’ve  been selling for years and this just took the cake for me.

Not to mention fees gone up from 7.9% 9.9% and now sale tax is added.

Good game Offerup.  You had a good run.",5
1921,"OfferUp declining: As Time goes by, I lose more and more reason to use this app. I sold an item on oct 29, they received it on the 2nd and it’s the 10th, and I’ve YET to receive my payment. As if 12.9 tax aint greedy enough, purchases made outside of offer ups, shipping system aren’t protected. Meaning even if you sell it using offer up, your item isn’t protected if you didn’t use THEIR shipping. Trash can policies. I was told 2 days to verify and it could take up to 5 days for the transaction to poll... well that was 4 days ago and it SHOULD NEVER Take that long when the package went from GEORGIA TO FLORIDA. Utter dissatisfaction.",3
1922,"2 Year user review: The app is great and the platform is user friendly. However it needs improvement. It is easy to save an item to your favorites, but to delete those items it’s very time consuming and you have to do it individually. That is a huge draw back for me and I suggest that when an item is sold it automatically drops from someone’s favorites. At minimum, upgrade app so you can delete more than one item from your favorites. If that gets fixed I will increase your rating. Thanks!",5
1923,"Offer up should not be used for business purposes: I love offer up I really do I’ve been using it for now about two years I just have a problem with people using OfferUp as a free advertisement and business venture it’s called OfferUp for a reason you offer a price not get upset. A lot of people don’t come to realize that and that’s a problem I think offer up should push that this is for people just trying to get rid of things they don’t need,to make a little bit of extra cash not a business where they need exact money and change and charge taxes.",4
1924,"All the fake accounts are ruining it: OfferUp used to be a very nice, easy to use app. I like the way you don’t have to give out personal information such as email address or phone number. All communication is done through the app. But all the recent fake and spam accounts are ruining what used to be a 5 Star app.  OfferUp is not doing enough to block fake people from posting fake ads, even when they’re asking potential buyers to contact them through gmail accounts on their headline. Also, this app would be a lot better if they had an option to post as a Dealer or as Owner. Too many dealers are posting junk on here.",3
1925,"The worst customer service. Literally.: So I was someone with around 30 transactions, all 5 stars. The reason I’m rating this app poorly is because randomly, one day, my account stopped working. I would get no responses to my offers, I was curious because I offered full price some times. So out of curiosity, I sent 30-40 messages and again, got no response. 

Then I tried posting some items, all of them got 0 views. This was particularly weird because all my posts got around 200 views in 12 hours.

I then decided to message their support line and received a copy and pasted message saying that my account had been banned. I got no reason or clarification as to why. I asked why in the email and got no response. I sent in another support ticket and again, got no response.

The app itself is great for selling, but seeing as you can get randomly banned and then not receive a notification as to why or even get proper help from their support line, I have to rate it 1-star. 

Literally no other service in the world is this terrible with their customer support. Not even Apple. And that’s saying something.",1
1926,App is broken even with newest update.: The app does not work. You are unable to look at your own products that you are selling. They keep saying re-try to load but never actually loads. So basically you can’t mark your own products as sold & once you post your item you can’t change the price. Because it’s broken. I used to love this app now it’s just frustrating. Now I just use Letgo because their app actually works & functions how it’s supposed to. Don’t waste your time downloading this app.,5
1927,"Great app but some loop holes for scammers: One thing I would change is the ability for the seller to forgo getting a rating if they suspect the buyer is going to give less than 5 stars. For example: product was bought and once taken home to test out, is proven to be faulty or broken. Seller asks you to let them know how it works for you or to tell you if anything is wrong with it. You report back that its in less than great condition, only to have them mark the product as sold but no specified buyer.
This allows sellers to pick and choose their ratings.
Great app otherwise.",4
1928,"Best app to make some quick bucks: This app is actually very useful.
Sometime I sale some items that I would otherwise throw away. 
Some things you need to understand though is that you’re not using this app to sale things at current market value, if that was the case then people would just go to store and buy a brand new item with warranty  included. 
Ive also used this app to buy item to flip for a quick buck! It’s fun actually!",5
1929,"Buggy laggy and no vpn access is getting old!!: This new version is really buggy it lags it hangs up all the time I’m having to constantly reset it and then these advertisements are a joke. I know they want you to pay, but I cannot afford it.

And why is it that you can’t use a VPN when you’re looking to buy stuff I mean, I could understand if you’re trying to sell stuff because it could be potentially ripping people off but if if if you’re just trying to buy something, what harm could it do maybe if you’re using your credit card or something but I just don’t understand why I can’t search without turning my VPN off because I always forget to turn it back on",1
1930,"Developer and worker at OfferUp: Hopefully all of you seen the client running to others app, the location settings is obsolete client in New York get  product from California even if our location is set for 5 miles, also to many ads information, if a buyers want search a product why they have to see all the nonsense adds or information of your app, ALSO IF A CLIENT WANTS BUY ONE OF ANY OF THE PRODUCTS IN OFFERUP WHY THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR PREMIUM SERVICE IF THIS APP IS NOT THE OWNER OF THAT PRODUCT, I see OfferUp going out of business pretty soon, find other ways to make revenue and fix the integrity of this app if you that read this review don’t pay attention to it, your business or job is at stake ..",2
1931,"Used to be Great: This app was my go-to but with the addition of heavy advertisements and an algorithm it’s pretty hard to use. Half of the search results are ads, after so many navigations of the app there’s an ad; the algorithm shows you what it thinks you want to see. If I looked for bicycles in the morning but then used the app later in the day to browse everything - all I’m going to see is bikes - even with an empty search bar.

1932,"OfferUp Review: I have participated on OfferUp’s platform for a no. of years ; and have seldom had any issues. 
However, in the past 6 weeks
, virtually every listing I have attempted has been rejected immediately. I basically list just Golf Clubs. 
I have requested comments re: Why the Rejections ; and even though , all but “1” item has been eventually re-instated ; or I have listed again and the listing was accepted; I have yet to receive a Satisfactory answer / comment re: Why the Rejections. 
Simply stated ; I have nothing but “5 Star” ratings. 
I continue attempting to list , but I do not have a great deal of confidence in your process . .  . and I make that comment with Respect. 
I , especially do not list Anything in the Evenings (after 8:00 pm). They are almost certainly going to be rejected.

1933,"Waste of time: Literally impossible to find anyone willing to ship an item. Most of them claim that “yes they do shipping” and they’ll accept your purchase, and 5 days later you’ll get a refund because they either took too long or just changed their mind. I’ve made 6 or 7 purchases and every single one was refunded because the seller refused to ship or just left me on read when I asked if it shipped yet. There needs to be a fee for cancellations or something, like a 2$ deposit per listing. If they cancel or don’t ship in time, or if they’re inactive, lose the deposit. Seriously needs to be a penalty because I’m tired of my money basically being held ransom while people waste my time.",1
1934,"The Good and the Bad: I’ve had a mixed experience selling on here. Mostly good, the customer-to-customer experience isn’t on OfferUp, some people just really try to haggle or expect you to deliver things you’re selling when it really should be more of a straightforward transaction. 

I rarely review apps, but I recently tried their PromotePlus, which was supposed to be a 3-day trial, then an automatic $7.99 after that. I cancelled the trial on the 3-day mark so I wouldn’t be charged, however, they charged me with $21 for a monthly subscription, and then customer support didn’t even offer to talk to me or partially refund. Really not a fan of that attitude towards your customers.",2
1935,"Too much spam, just looking for second hand items.: The app, in terms of concept and design, is great. However, it allows for an excessive number of duplicate postings. Most of these posts originate from furniture warehouses and other stores in the area. They simply display pictures of their most expensive items at prices that do not correspond to the images. Their intention is to direct you to their website or make you believe you're getting a good deal on an item, only to reveal later that the actual price is much higher. In this day and age, it should be easy to remove duplicate postings from the same users and filter out these spam posts. Unfortunately, the app chooses not to do so.",1
1936,Information Rarely Updated: It's hard to contact the sellers. I'll see things I wanna buy or I'm interested in and II'll send a message and 9 times out of ten nobody responds. I figure it's because they've already sold it and they haven't taken it down or they just don't check their messages. Idk? But itt makes it almost pointless to even look on the app. I look anyway because you could find that great deal and they could respond. You never know. I have made purchases before that went over very well and easily. It's just not as reliable as say... FB marketplace or Ebay.,3
1937,"App stopped working: I updated to the latest version 4.53.0 and ever since then the app no longer functions. I’ll search something and a white screen will populate the entire app and I can’t go back or click on anything. I’ll have to force close the app and then reopen it, but the same thing will happen when I use the search function. Even when I reply to people after I hit send a white screen will populate the app. It’s almost as if an ad is supposed to populate and there is a missing X somewhere to close the page. I have an iPhone 12 on iOS 15.7.1. I hope the developers can work on this because I do enjoy using OfferUp when it actually works. Please fix app ASAP, thank you!",1
1938,Do NoT download: My account was disabled. I had plenty of followers and always 5 stars. Never had a problem and they went and disabled my account. I sold plenty of items on here and they made plenty with the percentage that they took. Pointless in belong able to follow someone if you can’t message them if they don’t have a post up for sell. Thank goodness I was always sending my business cards in every transaction I made or if I meet up face to face I always handed out my cards. This app is for those looking to buy knockoff merchandise which they allow. I’m not worried there’s plenty of other apps to sell from. I hope the name band company’s sue you for allowing replicas to be sold from your site.,1

I don’t know why I was blocked by Offer up, maybe because I shared my phone number maybe not. But offer up at least let people know that they are blocked! I was trying even buy things and was wondering why nobody is answering me. Tried to solve the issue by uninstalling the app, logging out etc. nothing helped. I even created other accounts with different names and emails. Nothing worked. I am so upset and would not recommend use this app. Just waste of my time!

I contacted offer up about this and their customer service can’t even reply to emails. If this gets developer response all its going to say is “oh contact us so we can further review this issue” or something like this. Safe yourself some time, I’m done.

2. Add a $1 or $5 listing fee for cars and trucks listings. There are lots of expired listings older than 2 years, fake listings, and fraud listings. This is absolutely unreliable and wastes everyone's time. You should block these unless you want them to be there.

Basically lost all my feedback and that goes along with it. They just stopped responding to my emails all together. Totally ignored. Basically being ghosted by offerup!

Fake merchants, fake users, and fake reviews. Personally I was robbed of 50$ because I clicked a link and bought something off one of their sponsored merchants only to find out it was all fraudulent. Almost every listing I see on here is fraudulent. Stay as far away as you can from this app. Use FB marketplace. BRING BACK LETGO!",1

1948,"Not what it once was...: When OfferUp was first introduced it was geared toward individuals and “by owner” sales. That’s what made the fun to use as both a buyer and seller. Now the app is completely inundated with businesses and corporate entities listing their products. This is especially evident with vehicles. Whenever I open the App up now my feed is littered with cars, the majority of them being from dealers big and small. While I don’t necessarily feel that is a bad thing I do think OfferUp needs to make a separate category for such merchandise. This way offerUp can still get their cash for the listings while still allowing for the individual experience.",3

Offerup didn't recognize that I mailed the ring so they said I have a deadline then Offerup proceeded to say I need to mail ring which I had shipped 3 days prior to the dead line they had given me... long story short Offerup refunded and gave the money back to the person who purchased the ring from me and they got the ring for FREE because Offerup glitched and did not recognize I shipped it.. terrible service on my side BE CAREFUL with shipping dont trust Offerup especially if it’s something expensive you could end up loosing the item your shipping and selling and not get paid for it due to Offerup not being accurate!,1
1950,"Overall very good: I would have given a 5th star but sometimes notifications pop up and it is difficult to figure out why, or the app sends a notification just because they did a new search and have new items they want you to look at.

I've been selling on this platform for years and my account gets removed for 1 listing! I was not informed that it wasn't allowed, considering the fact that the team obviously picks and chooses who they remove without proper communication. And the platform is full of similar listings from verified sellers. 

Now it's a Monopoly game as OfferUp has merged with Let go. The story of Instagram and Facebook all over again.",1
1952,"Read this honest review: I personally believe OfferUp bought letgo to have less competition, but this app is... not good. First of all, the app doesn’t show any signs of “merging” with letgo, as they call it. It’s the same OfferUp app.

Now, you can put your location and request to see the closest items to you... supposedly. And I say that because it will really show you items that are far from you, and really OLD posts. Letgo NEVER had this problem. It was way better.

As the other reviews are saying, the scammers on OfferUp are just crazy. I know it happens everywhere but it seems like these guys just don’t care to better take care of this problem.

When OfferUp and letgo merged, my reviews and sells from letgo disappeared completely. I had it so good! Now it’s gone. Just like that. Shame.

Lastly, the customer service. Oh man. Does not help. I contacted them through email and didn’t respond. They did respond through Twitter, and they responded to my email. I replied back asking for something else and that was it, no response from OfferUp and my issue was not resolved.

I wish letgo could make a comeback.",1
1953,"Suspect app, wish I could give 0 stars: Former LetGo user abruptly dropped for the merger with OfferUp. Aside from that rude & sudden drop, LetGo was superior to OfferUp in every way: great community, great app design, great results. OfferUp is a mess. Their notifications are totally unreliable. After reading other user experiences going back a year, it makes you wonder if OfferUp is not in the business of a community marketplace but actually in the business of data harvesting user information, & scamming them into signing up for $20 monthly as a cherry on the sundae. After soooo many complaints about their user interface over such a long period of time, in which time they've made no effort to improve, instead acquiring other apps' user base data... Extremely suspect app.",1
1954,"Letgo was better...: I used OfferUp in the past but switched to letgo because it was more user friendly imho. Little things matter; listings expiring every 30 days was great. Weeds out the sold items that sellers are too busy to take down. I’ve found fantastic deals on here, posted 6 months ago that are no longer for sale because they were sold 6 months ago.. that and the local search should be more local. I personally have no interest in having things shipped to me and not driving to Indiana for a good deal. I’ve sold and bought plenty on letgo, fb marketplace, even Craigslist. I enjoy all of these. Hopefully offer up will make some changes or back to fb marketplace for me...",2
1955,"Suggestion: My suggestion is to allow search parameters, in particular the search distance, to be set and saved. Instead, with each new search the distance defaults to 30 miles. Another parameter I would set and save is if the item is for pick up or shipped. Being able to save these search parameters would be very helpful. Also, the ability to search for particular users would be nice. I cannot find a way to search for specific people or users and what they are selling.",4
1956,"Better than craigslist: I’ve been selling more items faster on this app then anything else, Facebook Marketplace is a close second.
I love that buyers can send their money to Offer Up and not be charged until they actually get the item, this is beneficial for both parties, the minimal fee is a small price to pay for that security. 
It’s easy to use. The only fault I can find with it is there’s no way to send photos via the message center. Sometimes I like to send the buyer a photo as a response to a question They have and there’s no way to do that Currently.",4
1957,"Good but could be better: Seriously I love this app, it’s easy to sell and buy items. There’s just one problem, sometimes I’ll be messaging a seller for an item. After we almost closed a deal the messages just disappeared! I tried contacting him through OfferUp again but I couldn’t. And we don’t get access to emails so I wasn’t ever able to text him again!! This is something others have also dealt with and the developers of OfferUp really need to get on this. 

Or at least allow us to put bios where we can put places where they can contact us.",4
1958,"People are deleting Facebook: Not sure why it’s a requirement for full verification still. *There needs to be an option to make only TruYou members able to message, offer or buy certain items because despite stating that I will only sell an item that is valued at around 2k to a TruYou member, I was still harassed by the same person using multiple non TruYou fake accounts that most likely were used to make fake transactions and give 5 stars for each transaction between each other, for days for because I said no. Maybe there needs to be more incentive to use TruYou so that way people know that their True identity can be reported to the police of they try anything. It’s thee absolute best deterrent. Looking forward to a response reply. Thanks.",1
1959,"Half and half: Im so frustrated with this app right now. I’ve sold so many items and purchased many items. But the past couple of weeks is It is not allowing me to log in at all, I log in and it takes me to my profile but when I try to sell something or search something it takes me back to the login page every time. I even created a new profile and tried to search ANY of my listings and couldn’t find them. 
I’ve contacted “Cx service” and they still haven’t gotten back to me so I’m losing sales as well as I will have to start all over on posting all the sales I had. Wish they would fix it.",3
1960,"BBB  F rating: Copy pasted from Better Business Bureau  website

Pattern of Complaint
On August 10, 2018, BBB recognized a pattern of complaints from consumers regarding customer service issues, billing or collection issues, and advertising issues.  Consumers allege that the company does not release funds from the transactions it facilitates in a timely manner.  Consumers also claim that their accounts have been terminated without notice or substantiation and that the company is not responsive to customer service inquiries.  To date, the company has not responded to complaints filed with BBB.",5
1961,"It depends what features yiu plan to use: The good:
This app is good for local sales, decent traffic and the app runs reliably. 

The bad: 
I shipped a few items and have $42 in my account. I tried to get my money but they ask for to much information in my opinion. I mean they even ask for the last 4 digits of you're social. I'll just leave that money there, there is enough identity theft out there already to be giving this app all my information. It's much easier to get your money on other apps. 

I wouldn't buy any of their promotional packages for your listings. I bought a 3 day package, after a day the listing was no longer being promoted. I contacted the support buts it's terrible. I did four reports and got the same response, never really addressing my specific issue. So there is more money down the drain. From my experience they basically have no support.",5
1962,"Best selling app out there.  Hands down!: I’ve been using OfferUp for almost a year and a half. I’ve posted hundreds of items, accords 4 apps. I’ve had VERY little success on the others, this seems to be the easiest and simplest selling app out there. The only downside right now is I’ve been having error messages pop up every time I go to post. Then I have to close the app, refresh the app and do other things several times before it allows me to post. Any advice or current bug fixes in the works?",5
1963,"Many bugs, would ban you without a reason: I used Offerup for months. The software has bugs all the time. First there was a period when I could not review my posted items, thus mark them as sold. Then there were times when I could not post anything at all. I received emails regarding posting rules all of a sudden, then received another email stating the previous email was wrong, then my account was blocked. So was my wife’s, because same account was installed on 2 devices. I tried to communicate and wrote many emails, but they don’t really bother to answer or tell you why you are blocked out. I had a considerable amount of followers and my customer ratings were very high, but lost them all. This could happen to you too.",1
1964,"Best App to sell or buy: This is by far better then Facebook market place. Not a lot of scammers on this one so it looks like this is monitored better. Facebook is usually a full scam the first 10 responses when you initially post an item, making it difficult to sell due to the volume of messages that are not legitimate. I don’t experience this with offer up. My only suggestion would be to eliminate consignment or furniture stores/ commercial/ online  businesses.",5
1965,Some ideas: I think one good option to have would be to integrate the option to send pictures on the chat option. That way if there is someone requesting or asking for picture we can send them without having to provide out number. I do understand that you guys need to make money and all but the adds are getting out of control. Not only with add after leaving the chat or leaving one post but also on the main page some of the add look like items being sold and if accidentally clicked it kicks you out the app. Not cool,3
1966,No way to contact customer service: The #’s given to contact customer service is not correct we get people that don’t understand what you are say and we can’t understand what they are saying… they say that their not even connected to OfferUp! And I have questions as to why I was charged a service fee of 12.9% when I sold something… if I knew that was going to happen I would have asked for cash this took away from what I was supposed to be paid… this was not mentioned when signing up that I would be charged a service fee taken out of MY money I sold the item for… I will not be using this site again and I will make sure I let others know it’s a rip off…,1
1967,"Subscription model, timed ads: App fees for shipping sales continually increase, as does the obnoxiousness of ad placement. Ads borderline dominate your search results and are displayed in such a way that it isn’t always very obvious that they are ads. There are also now timed ads which you are forced to watch after you take an action, like send an offer out a message. There were also ads that you were forced to interact with to exit from. But on the bright side of you pay their monthly subscription, you get the privilege of not having any ads while you as seller or buyer support their marketplace directly through sales. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 if there was an alternative besides fb marketplace I’d take it.",1
1968,"Dates need changed: When I am interested on item it’s 2 years old ad  and is a waste of time something needs to be done. When it’s sold it needs to come off . If it’s still available it’s okay . But most of the time is no response, to items that are no longer available and people some people don’t bother to put sold . And clicking on item is annoying if no longer there . Items must be removed if no longer available by customer. I first really liked offer up and still do at times , but it can improve, Thank you",3
1969,"Ads are out of control: At first the app was decent and useable. Easy access to buy and sell. Now that there’s pop-up ads that show up at random times it makes the app unusable. Especially since these ads can’t close due to the fact that the X to close is located at the very top corner of the phone. Where the iPhone doesn’t recognize touch unless it’s to open the quick settings. This forces me to either go through the ad (opening a web browser or install an app) or close Offer Up entirely.

I will come back to Offer Up when they remove these pop-up ads. We didn’t accept them in browsers during the 90s and early 2000’s so we shouldn’t accept them in apps.",1
1970,"Useful app: This app helps a lot of us get rid items plus you get back some value. It also save you money for items you will spend more on other platforms,
My only problem is I can’t turn off the notifications for an item I already purchased 3 months ago. The notification for that item is still coming back. I tried all the options, turned it off, but it comes back again.",5
1971,"The Best Buying/Selling App!: This app is by far the best local buying and selling platform out there. The interface is simple, it’s easy to make offers, and the messenger works well. Some things id like to see:

1. Please allow us to include a message with an offer. It’s weird to have to choose between making an offer and asking a question.

2. Please allow us to see the offer title and price as well as the cover pic. Id rather not have to click a listing to see the price.

3. Please make listings expire after say 6 months. There are way too many ghost listings from a year ago that the seller is not checking up on that clutter results. 

Overall I have loved using this app and hope more people sign up. Please don’t pull a Facebook and ruin the interface in future updates. It’s almost perfect as is!",5
1972,"Some guidelines ?: When you list , a must should be measurements . What a waste of time when the listed item has nothing except a shaded photo .

I had to ask 12 people to send measurements. Sorta ridiculous, and a waste of time and so are all the folks on here who never respond or say they want something then never respond , it is making good people want to leave . 
 I am a responsible, reliable seller and buyer , I wish more would follow same guidelines.   
Maybe you could have a bit of a template or better guidelines to actually sell stuff . Some people don't know how to sell , but pictures , good details and measurements are a start .",2
1973,"There are more bad than a good review: I used offer up for some time and a lot of people were friendly and offer up made it easy for people to sell or to buy things through there app. One down side that I think it’s super important is that I had a bad experience with one user who threaten myself and was saying a lot of racial slurs towards Asians. What made it worst was he targeted my wife and started to say sexist things and the things he wanted to do to her. And yet he is still on there app and it’s super disappointing that a company who promotes easy and safe transaction can’t even ban someone who has such a bad behavior towards women, and asian community",2
1974,"App full of bots making fake offers: Tried to sell an item on here and about 70% of messages had the same message, “Hi, is it still available?” Even if answered right away no response. I checked their profiles and they are all one named profiles such as Ashley, Bruce, Danny, Sophie and all have generic pictures probably stolen online or from discontinued accounts.  Real accounts have usernames that are aliases or full names and will usually respond within a few min.  My picture will probably be in their catalog now making fake offers, who knows, that’s my guess.  Stay away from this place and go somewhere better.  Im not wasting my time on some fake and inflated app and you shouldn’t either.",1
1975,"Comparison: Love the simplicity of listing items to sell, especially when there is a decent volume of stuff to list.  However, I do wish there was a feature similar to Facebook that lets your refresh your listings from the bottom of the list.  Also, there are a lot of listings that have been sold but are still listed.  Another Facebook feature is you are automatically contacted if your item is still for sale.  Helps keep the frustrating clutter from the listings.",4
1976,"Should keep people out from selling: I bought a freezer from someone asked him all the questions if it was working any problems said works great when got home plugged it in nothing he told me to wait 24hrs for it to get cold nothing asked him did he paint the inside to make look better cause it smelled like paint fumes didn’t answer me 
Then said I bought food with the money so sorry can’t give you money back then said final sale then said I broke it so obviously he is a fraud 
I reported him but people like this should be banned from selling on this site they take peoples money and screw them 
Until offer up takes this more seriously and kicks these people out then I am not a fan of this site",1
1977,"Some systemic exploits occurring: There needs to be a way to block sellers taking advantage of the system. For example there is one store in my area that lists a ton of Max Minis, so many that I can’t search for any organic posts.

What’s worse is this sellers prices are deceptive (“pay $60 to take it home today”) and then the total price is often equal to or greater than it is to buy the same unit new.

Until these issues get addressed Offer Up is allowing predatory business to spoil an entire corner of a market (a market with a population of over 4 million within a twenty mile radius). It’s absurd.",3
1978,Too much old ads leftover: Every time I’m trying to buy some thing I’ve noticed that the ad is longer than six months sometimes they will answer you and sometimes they won’t I wish that offer up will clean it up so if you have an ad longer than 90 days delete it that way people are active most of the time I see ads that have been here for years and when I try to contact them I get no response clean up the system please it would be more enjoyable that way. And God bless everyone and I pray Jesus Christ brings you lots of love peace and prosperity✝️✝️✝️,3
1979,"This app has a lot of sketchy people: This app has a very high looser user rate third shift minimum wage workers who think it’s appropriate to massage your after 10 PM and then play you for several days only to find they want to make a fraction offer on your item ,I recommend if the items is considered pawnable and will be acceptable to a pawn shop your do exactly that let the pawn shop determine the value and just sell it to the shop, no problem with someone showing back up wanting a refund because they are now broke a few days later, very few contacts in the past years have not been from complete broke scrub losers who just waste your time and now can try and pester your or stalk you.",1
1980,"Love it, except...: I have purchased a bed set and desk, which I love! Easy to connect for fast transaction. However, I DONT LIKE how many multiples there are of the same item. promotions are constantly repeated. Also, there are still posts on here from two years ago. I wish they would clean it up so only recent posts show. If sellers aren’t marking the items as sold, maybe they could penalize sellers bc it takes buyers too much time to find what they’re looking for. Other than that, it’s the perfect sales site.",5
1981,"Ads...all I really want...is no ads: Since combining with LetGo, the platform has been overtaken by ads. One screen of 9 listings in total includes 3 ads. That’s 1/3 of the visible options...all taking buyers to other platforms like eBay and Walmart. Are they trying to help their users sell items or are they really just out to drive sales for other retailers? OfferUp used to be time well spent in regards to fielding all the silly questions from people with little intention of actually purchasing something. I now find it to be more of a waste of time. It’s time to let go of your LetGo merger and bring back a much more solid platform that works for the individual and not big business.",2
1982,"Scammers are all that contacted me!: Not sure how this app is getting good reviews and has such a good rating. The app keeps sending safety messages to me but not stopping scammers that are asking to communicate outside app when they are trying to get your email and/or phone number. I reported each and every one and then took my items off site. The users continue to move on to scam someone else. 
All 10 buyers that contacted me all tried to get my cell number or email by scamming me into contacting and messaging them outside this app!! I have not had one buyer who will message in app after first message. The app is a breeding ground for scammers!!!!!! I m removing all my items from the site and felt I needed to write an appropriate review on this app page.",1
1983,"Awesome app but...: I love OfferUp but lately this app it’s been getting a lot of scammers and they be trying to scam too much, would be nice to see an improvement on that part, like maybe a way to verify people or something, the one scam I been seeing lately is people giving stuff for free but you have to give them a reason why you deserve that stuff, then they don’t want to meet in person, they want you to send them the shipping cost tru cashapp and then you literally just paid them, you will never see the stuff you paid shipping for.. iPhones, laptops, electronics in general",4
1984,"Scams: Offer up let’s people post scams wanting email info on buying cars and I continuously contact them about the scams and it changes nothing, the scammers can ask for email info and it’s still posted but when my wife gets on my account messaging someone then speaks of a email it blocks me from using my account. This app is a joke, I wasn’t trying to scam no one but the real scammers steal info and money and constantly do it over and over again with no issue but I get blocked from using my account.",5
1985,"Miserable UX: OfferUp purchased Letgo and now we are stuck with this miserable user experience. Why wouldn’t you keep the better experience vs buying and killing a great app?
The paid advertisements hidden within the app are annoying. The visual layout is busy and difficult to navigate. I don’t actually want to see things that ship, more local and that doesn’t seem to actually go away when you select the “pickup” tab. Also annoying was losing status from the previous app during the integration. that being said, my biggest complaints are around the miserable user experience, visual clutter, and difficulty to navigate. I’d rather shop on Facebook marketplace. Disappointed to lose a good app and have it replaced with this garbage.",1
1986,"Scammers: I opened an account to broaden my selling market from eBay and Mercari. I placed a wedding dress on this site the day I opened the account and within 2 days I received multiple inquiries from 6 fake accounts trying to scam my information. Luckily I did a little digging before giving these people any information so I wasn’t compromised but it was still a stressful situation. I’ve used eBay and Mercari and have never had any issues with this. Selling is stressfree on these sites but not on here. I’m sure if your only speaking to local individuals this situation would be better but be very careful, especially as a new user, because some people will pray on you to scam you on this site.",2
1987,"Scammers: I was looking for a used car to buy. There were multiple cheap cars for sell , well cared for and good years but they were all too good to be true. On all of the car’s description box’s there were so many “email me at this email for more details” which isn’t necessarily a red flag but rather it was the type of text they were using that were the red flags. So I did some research and looked up the emails left on the descriptions and multiple websites had the emails on scammers lists. It’s just upsetting to see how frequently and easily it is for these scammers to make a profile and get thousands of dollars out of people and how offer up has done nothing to improve this on their app. Overall the whole experience was a 1 star.",1
1988,"Cookies: One thing that is really annoying is when you click on an item just to view it because of curiosity, it then clouds your page with similar items. They should fix this so that if you stay on that item page for 10 sec or more then show similar interest for that item. Sometimes it’s nice to click on an item just to see what it actually is without “spamming” your page. I now avoid clicking items that I’m curious about with the fear of it overtaking my views.",5
1989,Disappointed: I have been using offerup for about a year now. All was great. I have sold to people that pick up the items up but shipping is another story. Recently I sold some of my items in two separate orders. One went locally and one went to Florida both were cancelled by Offerup within the time frame. Both of my customers were confused why it happened and thought I did it. Apparently the label went through as UPS rather than the post office USPS. Offer up did not recognize the scan and cancelled both transactions. Now I’m left scrambling and wondering if I will get paid or scammed. The one locally received the package already and the other one will get it tomorrow. Checking on Twitter other people are having the same problem.,1
1990,"Fix: Offer up says u have buy protection through shipping and they didn’t send me anything and scammed me and obviously deleted their account right after they received my payment, 3 days of the seller not giving info for shipping information I got my money back , week later somehow the guy in the messages got it to say he sent the item (obviously he didn’t) I got recharged again a week or more later without me knowing, I found out looking at my statements that it came back as a charge. And then after all the info I had told them they were telling me he sent the item, and I am not getting my refund. Which is complete bs. The system to this is trash and they don’t punish scammers or do anything about it and just take your money",1
1991,App isn’t working?: I love this app but when I went to download it on my new phone it’s no longer working for me. Anywhere in the app I just have the bear with the  “Please refresh the search” error. When refreshing search nothing happens. When I try to log in through my original account or attempt to make a new one I’m getting the “something went wrong” error. Nothing is wrong with my phone or network connection as all other apps are working fine. I don’t see anywhere to report a bug so I’m writing here in hope someone can help me out please :),4
1992,"Why does such a big company who offers shipping not have a phone number?: Two major major issues with this app. First off, with no warning, no e-mail explaining, still to this day I do not understand. A person with a perfect 5 star, verified everything, over 60 transactions just suddenly can not use their profile. Sure I can log in and view my profile so I know it was kicked. Yet, all my items for sale are gone, can not message a single person and support has ignored my questioning of why?

Second major issue is, how the heck can you run such a successful online selling platform, EVEN INCLUDING SHIPPING, without even a phone number to call and dispute issues? Very shady and unprofessional. I’m so sad my time with OfferUp ended this way. So silly.",1
1993,"Policies need to be changed: I’ve been using OfferUp for over year selling wall mounts HDMI cables and also doing installation if the person needs help with it. There are about 15 other companies that are posting services on their website but they don’t do anything about it they comment attack just random people but leave the corporations on there with their businesses and services, posting their advertisements all day long nonstop with no repercussion. It’s a joke that you cannot Postal Service/selling an item also and get removed, I would go somewhere else to sell your product maybe craigslist or let go where they don’t have the most ridiculous policies.

I’ll never use OfferUp again and make sure to tell everybody not to use OfferUp.",1
1994,"Lots of Scammers: There’s a lot of scammers primarily listing a car for an insanely low price in multiple cities across the entire country. I’ve also seen various prescription meds and products for sale. I reported those I saw up until recently but stopped because the listings where never removed. In one case someone listed a Mirena IUD for sale. That’s not a DYI kinda project and only a physician is legally allowed to sell it or insert it. I reported it and to this day it’s still listed waiting for that special idiot to buy it. 

Please stop allowing people to post in different cities all across the country and look into listings others have reported.",3
1995,Go To Market strategy - very Elementary: I very seldom write reviews and working for a Fortune 10 company I have seen it all. We downloaded the app to list our Garage Sale for a few hours today and in less than 20 minutes we were told we needed to read the guidelines and they removed the add. The irony is the most recent review was July 28th with the same complaint about not being able to “advertise” with out having a single item. So no Garage Sales listings even though I had pictures of the items. Also the previous post was changed to 4 stars by someone at Offerup even though the review was negative. Plus if you go to the App Store on your phone and search for Garage Sale the first app to come up is Offerup. Hypocrisy at its most blatant form.,1
1996,"I GOT SCAMMED MULTIPLE TIMES: First of all, i try to sell my xbox, scuf controller, games, etc. Nothing broken at all. The only ppl who would answer me were scammers. 99% of everyone who doesnt have any rating is a scammer. Found that out the hard way when i tried tk buy something 2 times from 2 different people for my brother. I paid them and they never responded ever again. To this day they havent read any message after i send the money. ONLY USE THIS APP IF U WANT TO GET SCAMMED MANY MANY TIMES.

I did finally sell my scuf controller to a real person but offerup asked for my ssn. Also it takes like 8% of the money for itself so instead of $180 i made $150 or something. I canceled it because i wanted the full price on paypal and the guy changed his mind by then. This app is horrible.",1
1997,"Great app, but.......: It's a great app, and easy to use. The latest update prevents that. Even when my internet is working just fine, including right now, the app is just spinning saying it needs internet access! So frustrating since there's nothing you can do. Can't blame the app for all the flakey people on it asking if an item is available with no interest in buying though. Or those that make an offer, then ghost you. Like I said, a lot of flakes, but there are a few good people that make the effort worth it.",5
1998,"Great but needs improvement: So I’ve been getting an error saying o can’t send messages to other people and that I need to be a TruYou Member in order to send messages and it’s asks for drivers license which I don’t have since I’m 15. This app says 4+ of age can use this app, i wanted to get a contact info but it was complicated. I went on a browser, the app contact settings, and the App Store to find a way to contact them. Once I did I got a quick reply but they didn’t help me with my problem, so basically my account is useless until OfferUp actually “looks into it”",4
1999,"Why bother: Don’t waste your time downloading this app. They will eventually block your account and you will not be able to buy, sell or message anyone on the app. I had my account for maybe 6 months and out of the blue they blocked my account . I loved offer up but after reading many reviews on other users having the same issues I realized they block users for no reason and they do not have customer service ! I have contacted them many times asking why they did this and they DO NOT RESPOND . Just a heads up there’s a high chance they’ll block your account for no reason . Offer up would be a great app if they didn’t block you . I understand there are scammers out there but if you are not a scammer then why be blocked ?",1

2001,"Possible Feature: I enjoy the app and it has helped me over the years to sell a lot if merchandise. One improvement that I would like to see is that when you update a previously listed item (for price, features or make a correction), it would be nice to see that item move again to the top of the list of items for sale. This was a feature on Letgo and it allowed a refreshed item to gain a new position on the list.",5
2002,"Okay: It’s an okay app-when people actually respond to you. I have offered full asking price multiple times to sellers with no response at all. Then when and if someone does respond, they mark Sold. The sellers need to learn to use the app before listing. It’s very frustrating that no one cares to respond. 
Also, I see the same postings over and over again when scrolling like there’s a glitch in the app. So it shows the same 10 things over and over. 
Whenever I try to post and sell something I can’t find what I posted. It just disappears and does not show up in the feed. And then they make you pay to bump it up when it never even showed up to begin with!",2

My only issue with this type of app or any other type of selling eBay style app is that you can sign up and use any type of name and get scam. Which happen to me when. I sold my Xbox One Sent and got fake money out of it.

I wish you can use a verification system like an ID with photo, real phone number and a facebook account with similar photo of the user face so that less people would get scam because there is a safety system in place where it would be really hard to get away with people scamming them.",3
2004,"The little things: You can only delete things one at a time from your saved list. But half the time when you try to do that, you accidentally click to view instead of the delete button. So you have to exit out and try to delete the item. The app also doesn’t automatically remove sold / unlisted items from your saved list. This should be automatically removed. Last thing, even tho you have none of the push notifications on in the app, they still send you notifications from sellers your follow or new related items. The ads are ridiculous. You can’t close out of them. Sometimes you have to exit the app Ads do not close.",1
2005,"No Response: Bid on several items in the App. Several responses however never could get timely response. 2 full price offers felt like a negotiation with setting up time no response. One offer I told him I could pick up Friday and he said great. Got the cash and sent notes on where to go. Goto a response at 10PM that night “you still interested”. This si contestant. This coupled with all the stolen stuff on the app is risky. No rating system unless you busy something is seriously controlled. Need to add the ability to rate after 5-19 emails. App is smooth and works well, the market is broken.

Set time limit on posting .  14 days then it drops off.",2
2006,"Annoying pop ups: I do really like this app because I can’t find good deals, but I hate that the price isn’t visible without clicking on the listing. More importantly the pop ups are absolutely maddening, they show up randomly and you’re forced to watch some of the crappiest ads for things you’d never be interested in (and then make a point to never buy or look into because you’re so annoyed by the ad!) and the close button takes forever to show up and it’s obnoxiously tiny, then if you don’t have pinpoint precision you’ll click ad and be taken away from the site. I’ve gotten to the point where I’ll just close the app instead of having to watch them.",1
2007,"Way worse after recent updates: I understand offerup needing to make money as a company but the ads on this app really degrade the user experience. You can’t exit out or skip, they are completely irrelevant, and when scrolling postings, you accidentally click on an ad and it takes you out to safari. In addition to that, when it asks you to “Enable notifications” after making an offer, you have to completely exit the all and reopen it to get the message to go away. Again, no way to exit our close out. I use this app daily but have been super let down by the recent upgrades.",2
2008,Offer Up Decorum: I live using the OfferUp app as it makes selling something easy within your local area and has a LOT less scammers using it and a better moderator process for reporting problems- but honestly! People will just send messages in the middle of the night 12 am-4 am and are often drunk or under the influence of something because some people just use the site to intentionally harass and play games or send offensive messages-wish the site had a “business hours” feature model and messages could not be sent or received certain hours!,3
2009,"Unable to Choose Pic Album for Uploading: App won’t allow me to “Tap to see Albums” in order to access & is stuck on Recent Photos. Picture selection won’t allow me access Offer Up photo album in order to post pics. Contacted OU & followed ALL of their instructions…rebooted phone, logged out/logged in, deleted app/re-installed app, changed wi-fi…I did everything suggested & nothing has worked. Contacted them several times regarding this issue & it seems there is no fix in sight. So extremely disappointed & hope OU works quickly to rectify this issue.",3
2010,"iPhone 12 Pro & crashes when searching: I’ve made so many attempts to install and uninstall the app to try to get the search function to work. When I search for something the screen where the listings would be is white. I’ve even powered off and on the phone, while installing fresh and uninstalling the app many times disabled WiFi, etc still didn’t fix the issue. This started about 6 or more weeks ago and today I had high hopes of this being fixed and yet it has not been resolved.

This is happening to many users there are posts made on Reddit about this as well what’s going on when will this be fixed and why is this happening?",1
2011,"Where are the new features?: Unbelievable OfferUp bought LetGo but didn’t add any of its better features. I have used OfferUp pretty much everyday as a buyer and seller and I haven’t seen a new feature release since I downloaded the app 3+ years ago.

It feels like they’re letting the second hand community down. I think it’s clear the leadership and product owners don’t use the app. The review section is FILLED with quality features that would make the product easier to use, safer, and encourage more sales. 

Why do I have to click into every item to see how much it is? That should display on the icon. LetGo had that feature and it’s tragic that hasn’t been added. 

Saved list is completely broken. Items don’t appear in order of save and you can’t filter by things already sold so it’s filled with stuff that’s sold or 6+ months old. You can’t bulk edit your saves. It’s faster to find what I’m looking for by sending the links to myself.

This app has an amazing foundation. Please invest in your app with 4+ million users!",1
2012,So so app: In general the app is pretty good however if you ever travel out of the country it’s horrible. You can’t login. I even tried using a VPN indicating that my location was in the states but it won’t let you even access anything. I think that’s a big flaw because people who sell things might be traveling and because you’re in another country should not exclude you from using the app. Especially if you’re already set up and established in the United States. Otherwise it’s pretty good. Five stars if it would allow you to access from other countries.,3
2013,"Used to be better, too many scammers: This used to be a really good app, but it has fallen prey to greed I guess. I don’t mind the ads for commercial products and stores it’s the obvious scams that they let on and even after reporting they stay on. I used to have similar items for sale and they would delete one saying it was the same and I could only post it once, but obviously that has gone out the window when you see one seller with the same item posted 30 plus times. Most of my repeat clients have just started texting me as they say they don’t even get on the app anymore due to the amount of scam sellers.",2
2014,"Lowballers and time wasters: Been using this app for a couple years now. Can’t say I recommend it for the fact that 95% of people who contact you about a listed item never reply back after you confirm it’s availability and the 5% who do reply will try to shave a ridiculous amount of money off of your price, which already may be discounted or reduced. I’ve had people offer me less money than what some PARTS on an item are worth. They do have a feature that allows a seller to report a lowball offer, but I think it’s just sent to one of those trash can files that they never read and just have the feature to make sellers feel better. Very disappointing and unfortunate.",1
2015,"Deceptive: This app features many products but I don’t believe that the sellers are legitimate.  I’ve contacted dozens of sellers of products time and time again and have not ever received a single response.  I can understand a few missed responses but not 95% failed response rate.   

Furthermore a huge percentage of the ads are significantly old, ie a year or older, making it very improbable that these are legitimate active ads. OfferUp has done very little to remove these ads as I suspect it helps their bottom line and makes it appear that they have a broad selection of items.  It’s deceptive and dishonest. 

In addition, their ad box links have sent me to advertisers in China and North Korea.  I was led to believe that these were reputable advisers, but when I purchased the product, it was never delivered.  It turns out that PayPal and other agencies labeled these advertising sites as fraudulent.  I did receive my money back from paypal , but OfferUp actively stills promotes these ads and are currently sending their customers into harms way. 

I sincerely question the ethics of OfferUp.",1
2016,"What’s the Point of Only Rating Completed Transactions: Only being able to rate a buyer/seller for completed transactions does not provide an accurate or reliable overall experience as someone cannot rate for a buyer not showing up after being provided an address, a seller not replying to an inquiry or selling an item after agreeing to hold it, or even just general rudeness.  And why should a seller’s reply rate be negatively impacted for not replying to ridiculous lowball offers when the “buyer” is the one wasting a seller’s time?  And Offerup definitely needs to work on screening out the scan spam and train some of their CS reps better (hit or miss).",2
2017,Do not install this app: This app is a BIG joke!! So many scammers on here selling thing. I resently payed for a iPhone 12 by cash app and the seller never showed up at the meeting place and never answer anymore of my messages. I made it lest 10 reports on the seller and customer support never got back to me about the problem. I highly recommend you do not install this app they DO NOTHING about the scammers on there app selling things. Here’s how you can tell it’s a cam they are selling it really cheap or give it away for free if you text them wishing them happy birthday anniversary or the birth of a child with a screenshot of the posting. I’m removing this app from my phone. Wish there was a way to rate it with -10 stars !,1
2018,Going to the scammer and car dealers: The reason people like CL and Offer Up is BECAUSE we don’t like to buy things from dealerships or deal with crappy salesman while still getting a good product. We have a passion to give things a second life while saving money and lowering waste. We hate Box stores and hope to find what we need from someone down the street.  Another one like us. Please OfferUp get rid of the dealerships and scammers. At least give us the option to filter dealerships and stores out of our searches. And if anyone tries to sell off platform erase them. Period.,3
2019,"Contact/Call Feature: It’s okay to message somebody from OfferUp but their isn’t indicators that allow us buyers to see if the owner of the product is still around active on their account or the item isn’t even available anymore, by going over a activity review account that haven’t been active over 10 years should immediately be removed unless the account is still active with it users. Last adding on a feature to call them in call to see if it chance of you actually receiving your item and it fill up a big safety gap with no knowing who your actually meeting up with to exchange.",2
2020,Shipping options: Love the simple system that allows you to connect with people all over the nation! Buy and sellers protection I’ve bought something defective and offerup followed up with email asking to provide proof pictures and video request keeping in mind of the description of the product only stated for example “missing button” taking the assumption it’s a working device other than what was posted!! Forcing sellers to be very clear about the device or product for sale,5
2021,"Someone tried to scam me and the apps makes it difficult to get help and report it: Someone tried to scam me and the apps makes it difficult to get help and report it.

Typical scam 
Contacted through the app with interest
Buyer asks for my phone to contact and make arrangements
Says they want to buy items
Asks questions about quality and age of item
Even asks if anything else is being sold
Uses my cell number that I provided for arrangement in the pick up
When I told them I wanted cash or pay through app they want to pay by certified check which was the biggest red flag
When I said no that it had to be cash or through the app they stopped texting
When I attempted to report it the messages had been deleted from my inbox in the tool
I even clicked on the email I have where I have the contacts. And I get an error so how is it the app allows scammers to delete or pull back a message that was in my inbox on the tool.
I then searched and tried the app and it is painful if not impossible to report the issue to a human being.",1
2022,"App is buggy and service terrible: Have posted many ads without problem, I’ve made many in app purchases, now it won’t let me post. Ad keeps getting knocked down for being a service or intangible item. It’s a car, it’s not a service or intangible item. Emailing for support is useless because you don’t get actual replies, just standard responses . Unacceptable to treat your paying customers this way.
Update 9/21.
App is terrible, tells me I get three free auto posts per month, yet every month it says I’ve used them already, or I only have one left..when I’ve yet to even post.  I was a frequent paying customer, probably spent a good few hundred dollars, I will no longer support this nonsense",1
2023,"Great app but they need to work on a lot: First off let me start by saying offerup is very intuitive and has good popularity, and in buy and sell apps , especially locally, that is essential so that you have the largest market. With that being said , on of my main go tos on offerup is musical instruments, and it quirks me so much that instruments are under the toys and hobby section, when they really deserve their own category subtype. Second, they shipping fees on items can be very expensive but they do offer reliable shipping (most of the time).",4
2024,"Letgo should let go of OfferUp.: Letgo was great for the local sale. The ability to buy or sell an item locally without having to ship or wait for it to be shipped was really attractive with Letgo. Also, since there would actually be a person to person connection the seller was more apt to represent the item clearly and honestly. If you were picking the item up, it also was feasible to decide that you DON’T want it if it wasn’t what the picture or description represented. Much better than waiting a week on delivery only to open it and find it’s not even close to what you anticipated. Certainly- Covid makes the shipping to other areas attractive, but the loss of Letgo for local commerce is sad .😞🥺",1
2025,"Ridiculous policies and customer service: I wanted to sell a pet costume my dog wore last year. It was the lion head dress for my golden retriever. I posted pictures of just the item, but I also showed a picture of my dog wearing it. I asked $5, entitled the listing “lion pet costume”, and described the materials and sizing. I also offer postage for the less than 1 pound item. Within a few minutes of posting I get a warning and my post was removed. Apparently they thought I was trying to sell my golden retriever via an app for $5 and that she (an 80 pound dog) could somehow be shipped for the price of an item less than 1 pound... they removed the item immediately. It has been a full day since I requested an appeal and I have not heard anything. Absolutely ridiculous.",1
2026,"Great,few quirks: Great app to get rid of junk or buy someone else's junk lol.
Few quirks that would make the app perfect if they were fixed . 
1. when going to send offer message, it lags and takes a while(fast wifi,iPhone 11 pro) 
2. on the saved or bookmarked page when you un-favorite or un-heart something that's already been sold, it takes you back all the way to the top of your list. It would be great to un-heart multiple ads that have been sold or if it would take you back to where you left off.
hopefully yall devs can work on it ; )",4
2027,"So many stolen items on here: I know it’s hard to monitor but we have been so disappointed with how easy it is to sell stolen goods on this app. My husband’s bike got stolen a week ago, we found it on here, reported the account, and they didn’t do anything about it. When looking for other bikes, we also noticed that people were making other listings for the same bike and just reposting the same photos. When you ask questions about it, the sellers are always vague and just stop responding if you press too much. 

There is a database with stolen bikes and those should be cross referenced when someone is listing a bike. It should be a requirement to put the serial number on there. Deleting this app and will not use unless they change things.",1
2028,"For Adults: If you are interested in really looking for something, you’ll find them here if you look good enough. The Arts and Crafts section is where you should be looking if you are looking for something special. There are also good things that you can find. Fair warning, buying from here is not for kids. I understand the safety issue, but there are certain people you can follow. Some of them don’t even know the value of what they have. Please be careful about what you buy from here.",5
2029,"New Users Shouldn’t Download: I just recently downloaded the app and I cannot receive messages or send them without being verified with TruYou. You have to take a front and back picture of your license and also take a selfie. Thing is...IT DOESN’T WORK. Immediately after sending my information I get a message saying my license is either expired( I have like 50 years before that even happens) or the picture was unclear. No matter how many times I do it I get the same email, therefore, I cannot use the app without being TruYou verified. Customer service is also no help. They stated if the problem resolves itself and it starts working then to let them know....HA. Don’t waste your time with this app.",1
2030,"Great but needs some work on saved items: I love this app, it is easy to navigate and find what you want the only thing i dont like about it is that when you go through your saved items there will be ones unlisted or sold and its a struggle to delete those, you have to delete them one by one and after deleting one it brings you to the top of your saved list then you have to scroll down and repeat the process, it would be nice if you could have a select and “delete all of selected” feature it would help greatly",4
2031,"Decent, but I don't like the layout: When browsing for items near me, it only shows pictures - as far as I can tell there's no way to view items as a list with their title AND picture. The only way to see an item's name and price is to touch the picture and load that info. When I'm shopping online I like to scan by title and price, then look at pictures second, so this isn't a good UX for me.

Also, ads are interspersed throughout the results, which makes it even more annoying to scan through and find real offers that actually interest me. I understand that selling ads is how they make money but it degrades the UX to the point that I'd rather not bother.",2
2032,"Best: It is the strangest thing, but even most of the oldest posts I message offers on here are still active and the sellers respond almost same day. I tried other apps, like let go, but they seemed to have a lot of “dead”, no-response sellers. The search optimization is much better on this app than Let Go. Let Go searches per word you type while offer up searches for posts with all words you type in the search bar. It really helps filter out the stuff I am not interested in at the moment.",5
2033,"I like it so far.: I’ve been using offer up for a relatively short time, but have had good success with it as a seller and buyer. As it stands now, I’ve had better fortune on OfferUp than on the mighty CL. 
Depending on what you’re in the market for, some postings or questions to the seller never seem to get answered. It would be nice to have a requirement for a “posting renewal” after like 60 days.
But minor inconveniences exist when trying to sell anything on a public site. I recommend it to friends frequently when they have “stuff” of a value they don’t know what to do with.",4
2034,"Gwen: I really like the app, however I have a problem with not being able to separate businesses from private owners. For example look up twin bed or mattress and see how many mattresses from businesses come up over and over, without giving much chance to the private owner showing their products.

Also I would rather the correspondence between the buyer and the seller to be only on offer up and not go to my mail. It just makes more mail to delete.

Sometimes I send messages and the recipient never received my message.",4
2035,"Irritating features: This would be a great app and Offer up would be a great concept if it wasn’t set up so that when you turn your notifications on, they are sending you a RIDICULOUS amount of marketing notifications and notifications that have NOTHING to do with the items you’re buying or selling. I don’t need my phone pinging six times per day because you think you know something I may be interested in. Because of this extremely annoying feature, it forces users to turn their notifications off so they won’t be annoyed to death which results in sellers that take FOREVER to respond about an item you are interested in. A lot of transactions are being lost because of the way offer up is set up!",1
2036,"Tried to sell something on this app: I tried to sell something on this app and it was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I do not recommend this app. I think they got it set up to where they judge people on this app, And you can’t remove anything from this app if you try to remove what you’re selling because you don’t like the app they won’t let you you have to mark it as sold, so I had something on there and I marked it as sold just to take it down. And they do that to get the ratings up so whenever you see higher ratings on this app it’s because people try to take things down and they couldn’t. Again I don’t recommend it I think it’s a joke I deleted the app from my phone as soon as I got done messing with it.",1
2037,"This app is awesome: OfferUp is literally the first place I look when I need to get an expensive item. It’s where I’ve purchased cars, appliances, TVs, furniture, cords of wood, and free stuff…..you name it and I’ve probably searched for it.  It’s way way better than Craigslist and I’ve heard too many horror stories and scams about Facebook marketplace.  Anyway thanks is for having such an awesome app where the community can get together and sell things to each other- I LOVE IT- it’s my favorite app!",5
2038,"Great App but...: I’ve used this app for awhile, and I’ve noticed they tend to run the same items randomly in your search. This is great for the seller, but is confusing to the buyer because you don’t know if you have responded to the seller already. 

I know this is out of their control, but I’m getting tired of the “tire kickers” instead of ready, willing and able buyers. They message you they are interested and you can never get another response from them. 

Can you put in a category for businesses to use?  I’m tired of seeing all the business ads (that are not marked ad), if I wanted to buy from a business I wouldn’t need this app I could just go to the business’s store. 

Sorry, don’t mean to sound like I’m beating them up the app is really a great way to sell items you would like to get rid of (and make room for other things)  I have bought and sold several items on here and do enjoy the app.",4
2039,"It was good then it just stopped working for me: I’ve been using the app since 2015 and I’ve got 18 5star reviews and was working fine. All of a sudden, my items are not being viewed and asked my buddy to see if he sees anything on my profile and he says “no offer” but yet I just placed an item up. I researched and seems as though many people are experiencing the same thing. Not sure what has happened but if it’s a system glitch, they need to fix this or many sellers/buyers like me will all look to use another app. I’ve tried everything from logging out and logging back in. Deleted the app and downloaded it again. Nothing helped and I’m stuck with a non-working offerup. I’m missing out on some extra cash and also deals.",1
2040,Uploads: I have nothing bad to say about offer up but I do have a suggestion. I think you should be able to upload one small video of what your selling. For example if your looking at a car maybe you wanna see a small clip of it running or electronics you want to see it being functional because you can’t test it before you pick up cause some people want to meet in a public place. Just an idea I think it would be cool lol,5
2041,"Waste of Time: low offers: Offer Up used to be reliable for posting items and selling them. But it seems like their main buyer now just asks for items at $10 and then ghosts the seller. It’s a huge waste of time. Offer Up needs to get rid of low bidders, pausing their access to the app. If app users is offering $10 on a $60 item, or $40 on a $150 item, it makes the app an unlikely place I’ll post items again. 

A lot of the posts on Offer Up have become really junky—this doesn’t seem like a place to post good quality items with value over $10 or $20 and is, instead, a garage sale service.",2
2042,"App is glitchy and non existent customer service: I’ve used OfferUp for a long time and honestly I’m so disappointed with this app. I pay for a the promote plus subscription, but I don’t get any of the benefits. I pay $50 a month to post an extra 50 ads but the app doesn’t register my subscription and I don’t get any of my posts, it only allows me the 15 free ads every month. I’ve reached out to OfferUp several times to issue a refund or credit my ads and they just tell me to reset or reinstall the app, which I’ve done and it still doesn’t work. Half the time customer service won’t even respond to any of my emails. I will never purchase a subscription with them again.",1
2043,"Good all around features and layout,but…: …the ability to simply block someone from sending you unwanted messages or repetitive questions isn’t even an option.
I’ve had people tell me that I’m “asking too much” for particular things, and that they “can purchase it elsewhere for less”.

It’s hard to tell who these people are when they initially asking questions on an item, and becomes impossible when you find out they are just being and obnoxious troll.",4
2044,"Complete Froud: I’ve been trying to contact them in regards to my account that it’s been Locked out right after I send the item out to the buyer and it’s been one week that no one got back to me and now the buyer have my goods and want his money that I never ever received and I can’t even answer the guy to inform him because I’m locked out 
So very be careful with this application you can google and find out there are other peoples have the same issue",5
2045,"STOP THE FAKE NOTIFICATIONS: STIP the ANNOYING “fake” buyer notifications that make us think we have a buyer for the items we are trying to sell but instead it’s a notice to check out new listings or something the app thinks we may be interested in buying. I got so sick of these fake that when a REAL BUYER actually contacted me I didn’t even reply because the pings are the same sound so I just thought it was more spam marketing suggestions.  I’ve missed several sales because of this annoying feature PLEASE MAKE IT GO AWAY!!! Your loosing sales because your pushing for more sales! 

Make sense?",3
2046,"Switch over the Facebook marketplace: Half the people on this app are scam artists or people shady and try to sell you defective products. The adds is what killed it for me , I can’t even exit out of the add after it’s done ? The app also glitches so bad that it freezes up and I lose internet connection for 1 minute , I’ve tried redownload the app and everything and still the same issue . Lastly I find it incredibly frustrating and annoying that you cannot even search beyond 100 miles like other Facebook and Craigslist . So many issues I’m forced to leave an app I once lived because the developer simply doesn’t care about user experience anymore. 

Bye bye",1
2047,"Critical UX Bug: You guys have a major bug that is rendering this app useless right now (to me anyway). Filtering between pickup and shipping is broken. When I click back and forth between both tabs I’m clearly seeing the same full data set in both. I only want to look at items that I could pick up in person, but practically every item I click on is somewhere far away and for my current need that is not acceptable. This should be easily fixed but is extremely frustrating as a user, and I basically cannot patronize OfferUp until you fix this. If you want, contact me when this bug has been patched and I’ll retract my 1-star review or change it to 5 stars.",1
2048,Awful App: I hate offer up. I downloaded it in a new state when I moved and listed one item for sale (a bike). I didn’t get any hits so I honestly forgot about it and focused more on Facebook marketplace. Next thing I know I get an email a couple weeks later saying my account is removed for violating guidelines. I posted one posting of a bike? How is that violating guidelines. I emailed them and they gave me no explanation of why my account was terminated and no chance for remediation. It was super annoying and just unprofessional all around. Offer up is a very lame app with subpar customer service. Would never recommend to anyone anymore (even though I used to recommend them all the time). Very dissapointing.,1
2049,"Seller Beware: This “selling” site/app is nothing but bots and Low ball offers. Low balls are defined as 1/4 of the asking price or less. I’ve listed 20 items from shoes, video games to TVs. All of the offers are bots or unverified “buyers”. 1st, why does OfferUp allow unverifiable accounts to post or offer? 2nd why have they done ZERO TO COUNTER this. Waste of time. Beware. Be safe. Edit: Gave this app a couple more wks. No luck. Don’t waste your time. Nothing but low ball offers, flakes, and bots. Not sure how and item can have 1000 plus views and not have a single real buyer. The same item that had only 50 views on eBay sold for the same price. Seems fishy. Think they inflate “views” and do nothing for controlling bots and fakes. Time waste…good luck",1
2050,"Terrible communication & purchase interface: I have the worst luck on this app. People post items, don't respond, list prices and receipts of what they paid like I'm buying new. I come to offer up for like, garage sale prices, not what u paid. I could just buy it myself on Wayfair if I wanna pay full price! There is no way to contact a person beyond text in the app, the app strongly suggest not exchanging phone info and people listen. Maybe include a way to call in app like Uber. Twice I've driven out of my way with cash in hand for a person to completely stop responding! Or I've arrived and people take 30 mins to respond etc. It's obnoxious and I've had enough of people on this app, I'm done! 🙌🏾",1
2051,Good App until I got banned without being told anything.: I have been using this app since 2020. It is now 2022. I had 5 Star reviews and all I did was purchase thing not once sold anything. Today I was going to purchase something for the first time in a year. I slowly started to realize that my messages weren’t going through to buyers. I then started to look up what might be the problem. Online people who had the same problem said they were banned for reselling and other things related to selling. I email customer support and still haven’t heard a thing. I highly recommend do not buy or sell things on this app. Use Mercari or eBay way better than this crap app.,1
2052,"Worst app ever!!: I have used offerup for a few years now and started using the app this year. I buy and sell on it regularly. One day the app showed a teddy bear and said something went wrong and to try again later. Could never get back in. I deleted it, removed website data and cookies and it still wouldn’t work. Also, I couldn’t go through their website because “Cloudflare” won’t let me in without paying for an account from them. SCAM!! I have been denied for buying and selling used stuff! So nefarious. Plus, I can’t even gat a number or an email to contact without an error message popping up. I would love for someone to contact me, but I doubt that would ever happen.",1
2053,"Needs some work: Maybe it is just my luck but I received two smashed up fragile products this week and one that was the completely wrong item. I think this app is great in theory but it is so difficult to figure out how to submit a claim and fix any issues. Still waiting to hear back after a week from one of them, the item that was wrong item sent I have to work with the seller outside of the app to make it right and this last one was the most frustrating yet. 

It is really important for offer up to educate sellers how to package items, I just about died of laughter when I opened up my box to find a full 18+ piece glasswear set completely shattered and in one pile of glass.",1
2054,"Miss Let go!: People don’t bother using the app. They could eventually give you the boot as well. I give it 1 star because I cant give it 0. This app was ok at the beginning buying and selling.  Had top ratings for the 20 something things I happened to buy/sell on app.  Almost as soon as it switched Let go to Offer Up,  I got cut off. Days later I got an email stating I was removed due to violations of community guidelines. No other details or explanation given. Such BS. Im sticking to 5miles now, which is very much like Let go!",5
2055,"Do Not Use: As an Ebay user since 2001 I can honestly say this app is garbage. Even some of the ads that seem like listings, are scams. If a person asks you to send them money/ payment outside of the app you’re getting scammed. If you ship an item the “buyer protection” is a miserable joke and a waste of time. There are so many outdated listing from people that may have posted it and sold already or people that gave up on it, in any case if you use the buy now feature they will hold your money for 7 days before refunding you without a notice. This app is where scammers thrive and Offer Up does absolutely nothing to combat this issue, Sad to say that Facebook Market place might even be a better option. Save your time and money!",1
2056,"Ads: I think the app itself is great but I don’t like being messaged by the app with ads about things I’ve searched for. It’s just another example of having no privacy when it comes to search history. Ads are too are tailored to my recent searches to the point that if I click something just to view it, I start seeing tons of ads about it. Some ads are okay but can offer up stay out of my messages at least?",5
2057,"Awesome app, A LOT of bots: For starters, I really love this app! It's the perfect platform to reach tons of people and make money off of items you want to get rid of. However, within seconds of posting an item, I received multiple responses from bots. At first, I wasn't sure if they were really bots, but they hardly respond and just ask for personal information such as my phone number. This is very unsafe and annoying. So far, out of 15-20 replies, less than 5 have been real people. Please do something about this! Other than the bots, this app is perfect and I have no other complaints. Better than any other selling app.",3
2058,SOMETHING..  Not Too Look At....!!: I love getting on offer up.. there is so many great deal....!!!    But— there are a lot of repeat items on a daily bases.. seller who tends to post the same item every day.. sometimes twice a day..if there was an option too not view those items or block.. something how Facebook has that option.. it would be Great.. !!! so I wouldn’t  miss out on the deals I could have seen.. other than that I enjoy OFFER UP... thanks,5
2059,"Such a waste of time and money.: Offer up was good at one point, but that soon changed. Let’s not forget all the scamming that comes on in this app. Offerup doesn’t monitor that, nor will refund any more that I’ve lost- there is also no one to contact to make a complaint! Just when things were going sour, things got worst, my account had gotten deleted and now I’m frustrated that I won’t get my payments for the things that I’ve sold! Don’t waste time with this app. The app is sour, and there’s no support if you ever needed it. Offerup should re-evaluate their app, and themselves. They’re taking a 9% fee with every item I see but yet, cannot reimburse me money that I got scammed out on their app software. Such a shame. Save your time and sell on eBay.",1
2060,"Big big issue for sellers!!!: So I keep running across people who buy my items, receive them. Delete their offer up or block me. Ask for a refund, get the refund then don’t send the item back just a empty package. I contacted support and they need proof? I send the proof I have and they don’t reply or say it’s inadequate. Once blocked you can’t access message or anything related to the sale!!! I am a respected seller with over 100 reviews but a lot of scammers using this technique. This needs to be fixed or I’m done.",5
2061,"Feedback (items posted more than 6 months): Although I thoroughly enjoy OfferUp, I feel like most items that are not sold stay uploaded for 6-12 months...when I am interested in an item that is posted for this long; there seems to be a lag in communication or no communication from the seller. I am unsure if sellers give up after keeping something posted for this long. Perhaps there should be a time frame after a certain period where you need to repost the item.",5
2062,"Offer up: Too many phishing scams particularly on vehicles. As a former law enforcement officer and investigative journalist, this website’s security measures for scams is sorely lacking. Repeatedly I’ve uncovered such scams and notified the owners of this operation. Yet nothing seems to exist to filter out what is a “too good to be true” offer. Think before you offer money. Offers in my locality appear to be offered for sale here, but in fact the scammer doesn’t live locally. Always ask to meet somewhere to exam the item being sold. If they are legitimate, then follow up. Always- Buyer beware!

2d review 13 September 2019.
Not much change since last review. There are better, more reliable and safer venues in the used and four sale market. I stand by my first review. Don’t use this app.",1
2063,"Great Way To Sale And Save At The Same Time! Love It!: Items needed always with persistence you can find, save, purchase, within a timely manner! Other plus always great experience meeting other offer it up, users,always helpful,nice,thoughtful, even in parts of the metroplex, you may not be familiar, with! I always start my shopping thru offer it up! Family members call me, about using this app! Found it was a very useful simple app to apply on phone, and to use ASAP! So simple to use! My favorite app on earth! Deborah Pond!",5
2064,"Great app but poor customer service!: I like what the app offers but have had vary disappointing experiences with there customer service. I have had multiple people sell me broken items that seamed ok until getting home and finding they don’t work properly. After the first time I switched to paying through OfferUp only to find that even after filing for a refund they have many requirements that you find out about after you need your refund, and they only have slow automated messages that will respond after time requirements have lapsed! So then you still don’t get a refund! So sorry...",3
2065,"Easy to use: This site has allowed me to sell several items that would otherwise just be collecting dust and using space. I’m moving in January and I’ve gotten rid of several items that I don’t want to move and not use again. It pays to be patient when posting items, some will sell fast others not so fast but eventually they sell. And you might run into request to purchase that never follow through but hang in there the right buyer is just around the corner.",5
2066,"Horrible customer service: I had a bad experience shipping with Offer Up. First of all, they charge a 10% fee when you ship. Secondly, I had to ship 3 items to the same person, the buyer had to pay for shipping for each of the items which makes no sense. Also, I decided to ship two items together since one item was small and I was scared it would be lost by itself. Since the app was not able to track the shipping of the 3rd item, it thought I didn’t ship although I had marked ship manually. It did not release my money. After various attempts to reach customer service they did not do anything. There is not phone number to reach them. Overall, I learned my lesson and will never ship with them.",1
2067,"Great functional but security concern: I've had mostly good experience with this app, we moved from a state to another so had to sell a lot of stuff. Just one time I had a buyer that wanted to buy a baby swing but said they had no car, so I went to deliver it, and I was knocking on an empty apartment, spent one hour trying to find the buyer, with my baby and my toddler in the car. I submitted a complain, but there was nothing. I asked the buyer why she did that to me, and no answer. There should be something in the system to penalize either a buyer or a seller for frauds, for a no show.",4
2068,"Disappointed and confused: I’ve used this app a couple of times and had some success.  However, I posted 2 items about a week ago and they immediately showed up near the top.  Now after scrolling through thousands of items, I don’t see my items anywhere unless I do a search.  I guess they get pushed to the end after newer items are listed.   I scrolled for about 30 minutes and finally gave up.  It seems the fair way would be to rotate the items so they can all get equal exposure.  Also I got one response to one of the items about 3 days ago and I responded back immediately.  I haven’t heard anything back from this person or anyone else since.  Not sure if this person got my response or not.",1
2069,Difficult to post: I actually really love this app. I’ve bought and sold on here. But it’s been having issues letting me post a sale. Just doesn’t publish your listing. I’ve reviewed this app before and mentioned some minor bugs- but this problem has existed for awhile now and it “appears” that nobody is willing to address it. Either that or I’m the only person having this issue lol. Or maybe I’ve been banned from selling? In which case I’ll need to delete the app. But I’m trying my hardest to stick with it because when it works it works awesome. Wonder why I can’t get this fixed..... (I really wanna sell stuff!),3
2070,Scammers are everywhere: Be careful when do any type of business. I was contacted by someone and asked to have an item sent somewhere and they would pay by a different app. Saw thru the scam and they deleted their account afterwards that. Another time a girl was interested in something . Made a a time and place to meet. She of course did not show up. Pick somewhere local and never alone. Screen shot transaction for your own protection. These things may be rare . Overall I have sold items . Feel better when it’s someone who is a user of the app.,3
2071,Needs work: I have been having alot of problems lately . 6 times out of ten i have issues when posting and item it reads “something went wrong” or “posting has timed out” . Also its really slow to post. Another issue with the new update is when your looking on a person that has a lot of items on there page when looking at one and going back it takes you all the way to the top of the list again so you have to scroll down to find the last item you looked at and go from there. Its been a good app but there has been alot of glitches with new update. Fix these issues and i will give it a 5 star rating again!,2
2072,"Can’t see prices until you click on an item.: I don’t really like the UI for the app. Can’t see prices until you click on an item, and I’m looking for deals. So I end up constantly clicking on items and just immediately backing out because the price is too high. I was thinking about deleting the app because of the poor UI, but then OfferUp banned me. Why? No idea. I never posted anything. I never contacted anyone. I never made an offer. I literally was just browsing wasting time looking for a good deal that never came. I emailed support and 3 days later I got an email calling the ban a “technical glitch” and re-instating my account. However, I think I’m done with the company.",1
2073,"Horrible app: The app keeps deleting my listing immediately after posting. Getting in touch with customer service is a headache all on its own and then when they finally get back to me they keep sending me their “posting rules” as if I am violating them. I was attempting to sell an Xbox with a photo I took, did not mark up the value, offer financing or do any other weird stuff they don’t allow; yet I still cannot post the listing even though I have a paid subscription for additional views. App = Trash. Customer service = trash. I would not recommend using this to anyone at this point and will steer people towards other methods such as the FB marketplace. 10 thumbs down",1
2074,"So many Ads/ bad algorithms: They used to have ads here and there while your scrolling through items, now they will pop up on you while screen and make you watch an ad before resuming to your search. It’s very annoying and sometimes they put the “X” so high in the corner it won’t register your finger and you cant exit off the ad. Having to reopen the app and find where you were before. The app also has terrible algorithm compared to Facebook Marketplace. It works fine as far as buying and selling, but has become very annoying to use and I prefer Facebook Markerplace over Offerup now.",2
2075,"Banned for no reason: I have been using offerup since 2018 perfectly fine. The app was overall good. After 2021, however the app became much more scammy as they never took action against scam listings. They also add ads that lag your device which is ridiculous since you pay outrageous prices to ship at 12.9 %. My main reason of writing this review is that after close to 6 years on the app and multiple 5 star reviews they ban me for no reason at all. I asked multiple times to give a reason as I always follow the rules on the app. It’s crazy that I even have to write this as they make money off of me!! Sad to see such a great app turn bad. Guess now I’ll just use marketplace.",1
2076,"SLOWEST. APP. EVER.: This has been an ongoing problem for at least a year and has only gotten worse. NONE of my other apps behave the way OfferUp does, and it turns out TONS of people online have the same issue. Apparently OfferUp has purchased boatloads of fake reviews instead of fixing the problem. After dealing with an app that is so slow it’s barely even functional I checked online to see tons of people have the same issue and OfferUp doesn’t seem to care. It’s a real bummer cuz it used to be a great app. I hate to switch to buying from Facebook Marketplace cuz their search feature is hot garbage, but this app is trying its best to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Get your crap together OfferUp!!",1
2077,"Not good for sellers: The automated system keeps removing my listings with no information despite paying for premium upgrades to feature ads. There is no way to get a rep to review the decision, just a waste of your time and effort. Especially given the smaller number of buyers you are exposed to, compared to Craigslist or Facebook Martketplace, this just isn’t worth it. 

Also old items, long since sold, litter the interface so that also wastes buyers time as you have to inquire about items. All of this is needless and dysfunctional. I’ve given far too many chances to this app to overlook the problems again.",2
2078,"Very bad app: This app is terrible. I posted a vehicle for sale and was charged $7.99, but they flagged my post and didn’t tell me it was flagged. The next day I had zero views, so I thought it was glitched. I made another post and same thing happened, they charged me another $7.99 but didn’t deliver views; zero. I tried to contact them, but they don’t have phone contacts, only email. After a few days of messaging back and fourth they said they’d remove the flag, but by then I’d already sold the vehicle on Facebook Marketplace (which is free by the way). Finally they said that they would NOT refund me. Yeah, they didn’t deliver service, but wouldn’t refund me either. It was a nightmare. They stole $16 from me; thieves.",1
2079,"Suddenly stopped working: OfferUp worked great for a while. Then, suddenly, I was getting no responses to any of my messages, and zero views on all my newly posted listings. I thought it was maybe a fluke, or that maybe I just wasn’t posting items that folks wanted to view (I posted a NIB air conditioner during the hottest week of the year, however, which should have been popular) - but it sounds like quite a few people are having this issue and, so far, OfferUp has not done anything to fix it.

I’ve done tons of troubleshooting - tried uninstalling, reinstalling, updating, re-listing, etc. Nothing seems to have worked. I’ve missed out on purchases and, likely, sales as well.",1
2080,"Location and Cover Photo Issues: I am located in Las Vegas, but sometimes the posts say I’m posting from SEATTLE, WA. And every time I change the location on the listing, it changes to LAS VEGAS, NV in all caps when it wouldn’t use to show up in all caps. Also, it does not display the proper Cover photo that I select!

Update: Fixes this by deleting the app and downloading it again. But it occurs often! Also, when I publish a listing, sometimes it does not appear on my profile right away!",5
2081,"People are the problem: The app is pretty good. Communication with people is easy, and you can see when people read your messages which is really nice. However, too many people will message you that they want to buy when they have absolutely no interest. They message you that they want you item, and then you never hear from them again. And that makes selling on here kind of a nuisance. IF ONLY you could rate these people who waste your time, or the ones who plan to meet you somewhere and then never show up! Ridiculous.",3
2082,"Pretty cool but needs work: Not a bad app. I've sold several items quickly and it's easier to post than other sites. One thing I don't like is that you can't delete items that are sold and ones that have messages, thus cluttering the app when looking at what I have actively listed.

Update: started using this app again recently after taking about six years off and the same issue persist. You can’t just delete a listing which is very annoying. Also, I deleted a conversation and it keeps showing up. I’ll probably stop using this app again soon and not recommend it to other people.",2
2083,Profile being parked and items deleted for no reason!: Listed items can be marked unlisted for no reason because you won’t go any lower on your price. Then offer up parks your account so no one see’s what you’re trying to sell. Then it gets worse they start removing what you’ve posted with no reason and all they can do is say sorry? Who’s ever running this site needs a lot of training or there’s a lot of ppl that work there that are jealous of what your posting? None of it makes sense. Going to look for another app that buys and sells that’s better to utilize and these kinds of things won’t happen as OfferUp can’t give me an explanation to why they’re doing this to me?,1
2084,"This app can eat my shorts: I’m currently about to delete this application. Why you ask? Because I’m sick and tired of getting more notifications about “deals” of crap I’ve never even thought of buying. Also, if you open up said deals expecting related items, good luck bud. I have to keep the notifications on because I’m selling stuff and I forget often times. But I’m going to live with Facebook marketplace’s less than user friendly interface just to be free of the constant crap from this ridiculous app. I hope this gets to someone in charge of something and they feel stupid for this nonsense with the notifications. “Valentines deals for you?” Are you an idiot?",1
2085,"Just okay: I have archived an item multiple times because I can’t locate it to sell it right now. Then out of the blue I’m getting people asking me if it is still available because it automatically pops back on the main selling screen. What’s the point of having the archive option, if it automatically goes back to the main selling screen the next day? It makes me look like I am not a good seller. Then when I tried to delete it there’s no option to do that either. This app has been out long enough to avoid the silly stuff.",3
2086,Unable to message others: I’ve had an overall good experience with offerup until they required the use of Truyou. I have no problem verifying my identity however I have been unable to take pictures of my ID to submit for review. I cannot message anyone until my identity gets reviewed. Customer service notified me that it was because IOS 15 conflicts with the current version of Offerup and that they are working on an update. I’m unsure whether or not this problem is common because everyone that I know that uses offerup has never had this issue.,3
2087,"Cowardly customer service / Ban without explanation: I’ve been on OfferUp since 2017 and everything went very smoothly, until yesterday. I have over 400 reviews, all of which are 5 stars and I’m Tru You verified and without warning....BOOM! I seem to have been ghost banned?! I make a living on OfferUp, it’s is quite literally my ONLY job and now I am banned for unknown reasons??? Come on OfferUp!! We as part of the community deserve at least an answer when you ghost us, we also deserve a chance to right any wrongdoing. Yet you’ll let the phone scammers and people with 1-2 stars continue on?? Be careful everyone, the sellers with integrity like myself are being pushed out by scammers who pay to promote their frauds.",1
2088,"Need to do a better job removing scammers: Overall I really like the app.  However, the scammers are increasingly using this app now too.  OfferUp could do a better job monitoring and removing scams and the accounts that post them.  At least the more obvious ones.  I report them all the time to the team, but I see the scammers just repost using the same account again.  The obvious scams always ask you to contact them with their email outside of the app and usually way underpriced and multiple listings of the same item.  There has to be an easy way to block them.",3
2089,"Great but also full of scam bots: Love this app, bought and sold many things. Easy to navigate and communicate securely with buyers. HOWEVER, it seems I get a message EVERY DAY saying “I would like to buy this” and I ask to keep the conversation on the app because I’m used to scammers, and the next message asks me for my phone number. PLEASE find a way to clean scammers off the app, maybe an option to only receive messages from verified/rated users? It’s frustrating thinking I’m going to make a sale but it’s yet another scammer/bot.",4
2090,Don't lose your money: I shipped a package and i got a notification once the buyer received the item. A couple days later the buyer filed a claim and I was notified that I would be receiving and email about it and the email was never send and that was a month and a half ago. The money is still pending because the buyer has filed a claim and the buyer isn't even responding to messages anymore. I've tried reaching out to them through there social media's which don't look so good in the comments because lots of people are also having problems like me. I haven't received any messages back from anybody that works for OfferUp and I probably will never use this app again it was way better when letgo was its own app.,1
2091,"Scammers’ Heaven is on OfferUp! App: Scammers use it to sell fake stuff. I was scammed by someone who was verified on Facebook and on email and all the other badges they had such as payments verification, phone confirmation, and email. Of course none of them are good enough since you could fake all of it. This person met me at a police station so I thought they would be trustworthy, but I guess this is how they scam! Don’t buy stuff from this app if you care for your hard-earned money. They even had 12 5-ratings, and had sold and bought stuff previously on the app. I don’t think OfferUp is going to be able to return my money since they encourage cash transactions and  do not verify if product being sold is real, etc. Don’t use this app!",1
2092,sellers need more accountability. Too many old posts and unavailable items: The app is fine to search for items but too often the postings are for products sold long ago or unavailable. Sellers can take days to respond only for the buyer to find out the product is not for sale anymore. There is significant anxiety meeting face to face with the product and cash but there’s not much offered by the app to protect both parties. Shipping can help but buyers don’t seem to want to use that option and usually respond after many days that the item is unavailable.  Idling the buyer waiting for a response.,3
2093,"HATE the new update!!: Absolutely HATE the new update! It was so much better and easier on the eyes to list an item before being forced to update to your new version. Also hate that letgo is now a part of OfferUp. I left letgo for a reason and now it’s polluted OfferUp!!
Also, I try to browse through all of the listings because I want to see ALL of the listings. But if I click on any listing just to check it out, when I go back to the main page, everything changes to show all listings related to the one I just checked out. AND it’s bombarded with ADS also related to that listing. I want to view ALL listings, I don’t want everything viewable to be related to the ONE item I was only curious about. Makes me not want to click on ANY listing!",1
2094,The Scams: I would’ve gave y’all a five star if y’all can have someone monitor yalls site every minute. There’s always hundred of scams on here daily and I dont kno wye I’m the only one that can find them in minutes. Right when I get on I always report them every time I see them bass boats 1200 campers 1200 atv 1200. There’s so many scams that really discouraging me to go on to the offer up site. But I still do. Y’all need to learn on how to weed thru the scams cause it gets old as a purchaser and seller to deal with that. Please figure out a way to find the scams before there put on your site. It’s a waste of your loyal customers time and money. Thanks.,3
2095,"Good Marketing, Bad Communication: So, I’ve been a member of OfferUp for the past 3 years and I have to say that I have had both good and bad experiences. For one, most of my items sell quickly within a week or so. I use this as a secondary source of income so it’s positive. But I have met a few bad apples who paid with counterfeit bills and had no way of getting in touch with a real human to follow up a police report with an OfferUp representative. There is little to no communication so you’re in your own for the most part - Which has its pro’s & it’s con’s just like anything else!",4
2096,"messages from interested buyers disappear: Hi. I’ve had an OfferUp account for a couple of days now. I received messages about products I am trying to sell. And I think I also have an offer. They have all disappeared... when I look at my list of listings. The products I am concerned about have an image of another user under the product name. And the other product has an OfferUp price tag symbol which I believe means an offer. Yet when I open either of these products, it says no messages or offer. I am pretty frustrated because I tried deleting and re-downloading this app. Signed out and signed in. I actually read the message of interest from another user yesterday and now it’s gone. Terrible experience so far.",1
2097,"1 star: Terminated my account after a seller started an argument after I asked for a receipt so I can check the authenticity easier (not even sure if that was it or not after reading other reviews they ban a lot of ppl for nothing😒), before it was terminated I made a purchase which it said “offerup team is reviewing this offer” after the seller accepted it so the money already left my bank, then the offerup team declined and terminated my account,never got my money back. I reached out they said I would get a refund it 3-5 business day and after that passed I reached out again and no response. this was my first time using it too. also the filters aren’t too good, u have to send an “offer” even if it’s the price the seller put it as.",1
2098,"Better value, less follow through: I like Offer up for its convenience and lack of big fees. I always seem to find what I’m looking for, in one form or another. I enjoy exploring new neighborhoods when I                pick-up. The price points are generally much better than other selling apps. I’ve had mostly positive experiences buying and selling. The only cautions I’d share are, to make sure you’re comfortable and protected during an exchange, as these are usually cash transactions. Be prepared for quite a few folks not following through on the site.",4
2099,"Don’t Expect Much Help from OfferUp: When an honest buyer meets an honest seller, the transaction goes well.  However, if you have any problems with a buyer or seller, there is NO SUPPORT, unless you count endless looping form responses as support!  For example, I have a seller who owes me money for an item that was purchased from me.  I’ve been trying to get OfferUp’s help for about a month, and all I get are form/canned responses from them. I’ve asked to speak to someone, but they do not provide any names or phone numbers. OfferUp charges a fee to sellers, but they don’t appear to want to help a seller when needed! I’ll upgrade this rating if they help me get paid.",3
2100,Great app!! Small adjustment!! Great outcome!!: I believe that this app needs a new viewing formate.. when I say viewing I mean showing the price on the picture before clicking it... i click back space click back space ... marketplace on Facebook is smooth when all u do is scroll down an if u like some thing then u click because the price is on the main screen all ready in view... just a great idea that can have more time looking an less time back spacing for every image u click ..,5
2101,Beware ..: They have blocked many accounts of mine j been a member for years and  not only do they block me without notice at all I still get notifications of items on my email . Then I make a new email on the device and that account gets blocked  or  when u make the account u will be in the middle of doin a deal they they force u to either be a tru memeber. Ect this was the best  app to make money but now it’s a inconvenience that u portray that everything is all good and boom u ur account is un accessable  and the offer up people never reply u have a better chance winning the lottery people only deal wit offer up because it’s a buy now sale now thing .  They interfear wit the business part of it . It’s like they are law enforcement I’m goin back to Craigslist,1
2102,"Room for Improvements: I’ve sold several items and prefer this over Craigslist hands down. However, you still get so many people who end up not responding when they say they’re going to show up. I wish there was a way to rate no-shows or responding to potential buyers to hold them more accountable. This way we don’t have to waste time on these people.

Also the reply rate system is flawed because once you don’t need to speak to them anymore your rating goes down if you’re not the last one to respond. Offer Up needs to have a flag option “doesn’t require a response.”",3
2103,"Offerup doesn’t protect sellers - use with caution: I’ve been using Offerup for quite some time now. It’s great for selling stuff to people in your neighborhood. Also a great way to get robbed.

But beware when you start selling stuff using their nationwide shipping. It’s says in their guidelines “OfferUp will not be liable for, and you release us from any liability to you for, any losses, damages, or delays related to shipping.”

So if you sell something to someone in another state, and they decide they don’t like the item they can ask return it for a refund. If you refuse to take the item back, the buyer can make a claim and overturn your decision.

This happened to me but also when the item was returned to me it was damaged by the buyer.
Now I am out of a my item and the money from the sale. 

Offerup was not helpful with me the first time when I got robbed selling a laptop to a phony account on OfferUp. 

Also they did not help me at all when my sold item was returned to me damaged. I was not even able to make a claim with the shipper. All they did to help was cut and paste lines from their guidelines.

Use with caution",1
2104,"No customer support number- impossible to sell via mail: There is a major glitch in this app, it would not accept my address to sell via mail. I tried my own address as well as 3 family members addresses- none of which were accepted. There is no phone number to call for customer support, so don’t even bother going through the aggravation. I ended up getting this person’s phone number and address to manually go to the post office to sell the item. I made more selling that way without OfferUp cutting a little off the top, than I would’ve made selling in app. 

TLDR: Not worth the headache unless you intend to ONLY sell in person. If you have a problem, forget getting help via customer support in a timely fashion.",1
2105,Camille: I think offerup is great. I only wish the sellers that don’t live up to their end of the bargain should be reprimanded or some kind of review could be left for them. When a buyer purchases something and they accept the offer and then they don’t mail the item it’s not fair to the buyer that is expecting the item. It’s happened to me several times and it’s so disappointing. But the sellers that fulfill their end are just wonderful and should get a reward for being good sellers. If there is such a thing.,5
2106,"Decent when it’s local — terrible when it’s not: I’ve sold and bought a few things locally with virtually no problems. It was great. 

 However, when you offer to ship to wherever when selling an item, this is when the app turns into complete crap. The creators of this app have no control over the amount of scammer/bots that on their own App. I had my item up for sale for maybe 2 hours and was contacted by at least 10 bots/scammers before deciding to take it down. I understand that this is going to happen every now and again....but not of this magnitude. If you can’t handle your own users, don’t try to compete with other apps that can.",2
2107,"3rd time I can’t use the app and have to get a new phone!: This is the 3rd time offer up forces me to join truyou in order to continue using the app and sending messages. The problem is after I join truyou, I can’t send or receive messages even after reinstalling the app and signing out then back in. The only way I’ve been able to solve this issue is by getting a completely new phone, phone number, and email. This is ridiculous and customer service is horrible. They told me they fixed it and I should be good to use it but I can’t use it and I’ve spent a lot of money promoting my items. I give up on this app. I’m not buying a fourth phone and changing my number again. Ofer up needs to fix this issue ASAP",1
2108,Amazing app: I decided to take this time out to put a review for a OfferUp it’s very convenient for me by being on the road all the time on construction company never having time to shop for myself or shop for others I purchase one of my construction trucks from OfferUp it was very safe because once I clicked on it and I talk to the gentleman offer up make sure I was safe by tracking my location all the way into the deal was done I don’t think there’s a better app on the market then offer it,5
2109,"App ok. People have issues: I had this app for a little while, and only thing i was able to sell and was a low ball offer, but sold it (or so i thought). Was brand new never opened so couldnt take pics of the inside. They claimed it was used the metal has a little rust from sitting in the box i guess. They claimed it was used but there the one that unwrapped it so it couldnt have been used. Threatened to call the police. Should have let them. 
  So i filed a complaint and had to delete the app. It shouldnt be this hard / stressful to sell something. 
  Not the apps fault but think there should be better privacy and less ratings",3
2110,"App vs users: This app is in a rough spot. While the app itself is decent enough, the people who use it are impossible to deal with. I’ve posted dozens of items and have gotten hundreds of views and dozens of responses to my items. But on almost every item as soon as someone claims they want to purchase the item and you respond with an opportunity to exchange goods they disappear. Where as you have places like eBay where you can leave feedback or where people have to commit to purchasing the item, there is no such option for this. I have become beyond frustrated while using this app. But it’s free and you’re relying on the general public. So I guess that’s what you get.",2
2111,"Lame: I was only able to sell one item out of 10. Items listed are free to post initially, but quickly fall down the list and out of sight. The app does not allow you to repost an item, but does allow you to pay $$ to “boost” an item after the initial posting. If you are selling something for $20 or less, it is not worth it. You cannot delete an item once it has been posted. You can only mark it as “Sold” to a person on OfferUp who asked about the item. Most of my items sold on Craigslist, and I had more serious offers on CL Than on OfferUp.  In addition, there are a lot of commercial advertisers mixed in with individual persons on any searches. Overall, this is not the app you are looking for.",1
2112,"No Show: I’ve tried this app several times. Each time, I have a problem with my items not showing up on the home page and in the category listed. They’re never in either. If you don’t see my page, you don’t see my items. My items have sat there with absolutely no views. When I reach out to offer up to see what’s the problem, there’s never a reply, but after a couple days my items show up in the listed category n never makes it to the home page. And the only option for more views is to pay. Very frustrating. Customer service is terrible when trying to reach out for help. It takes several days for a response to any issue. And most of the time you get no response at all.",1
2113,"Personal information vulnerable!: Do not add your banking information! They do not tell you but there is no way to remove this information from their app and servers.  They claim that it is safe but really “safe” is very subjective nowadays with cyber security.  I’m sure Equifax said the same thing before they were hacked.

I think it is irresponsible and dangerous not to give us the option to remove our financial information.  They have my checking account, credit card, birthday, address info forever!",5
2114,"Major Security Concerns: I downloaded the OfferUp app tonight and attempted to create an account using Apple SSO. Upon creating my account, I saw that the app had actually logged me into another user’s account with a completely different email. I had full access to edit this user’s account settings, including changing their email and password, and modifying their payment accounts. Upon doing a quick google search, I found some Reddit posts with users describing the exact same issue, some posts being multiple years old. 

THIS IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING — not only that this issue is able to exist at all, but also that it has existed for what seems like multiple years.",1
2115,"Shipping policy as a shipper: Horrible shipping policy for a shipper. Sometimes there are extenuating circumstances that refrain from users unable to ship within 5 days, especially if the fifth day lands on a Sunday and your only option is sending through usps. I shipped the item on the 6th day before the transaction was canceled. Customer support was extremely unhelpful and not very sympathetic in my situation and refused to recharge the buyer even with proof of shipment. A simple one time courtesy is all I was asking for. Doesn’t make sense to me why you would turn away business since offer up collects on a portion of the sale. Now I am out the price of the item. Consider revamping your shipping policy and expanding shipping partners.",1
2116,They will ban your account without even look into the accusations!: After 2 years of using this app to over 80 sales and over 50 five star reviews they deleted my account with no warning and no notification. Anyone can falsely report your items on f you don’t except their offers or they are your competitors. No customer service what so ever sent several emails I just get auto responses my account was removed for not following guidelines. I encourage people to use another platform every since they bought let go this app is being controlled by a group of women that get financial kick backs from certain sellers to block other sellers for no just cause. Do I hear lawsuit anyone????,1
2117,"So unfortunate: This site (Letgo) was so much better before it  merged. Now it’s nothing but ads and things that are not even remotely local. It’s like just going to a temu type site now . A whole bunch of scam sites and trash. I will be deleting this site as soon as I finish this review. I am not usually the type of person to write a review or complain about a product or service , but this is just disheartening. You had a really great app when it first launched. I would spend a lot of time searching it. But since the change I just don’t even want to open it because of the frustration of navigating the junk.  Hope you get things figured out for your sake.",1
2118,OFFER UP IS STEALING MY MONEY !do not sell on this site: I just sold a sweater exactly two weeks ago and I still haven’t gotten my payment but the package is delivered and even the buyer isn’t responding anymore. Offer up you must be the worse selling app out ! Why is it taking more than the stated 3-5 business days to deposit only 23 dollars ? I have a bank account in my account. I have it open to deposit after calling the bank . So please explain why do y’all lie ? Or did I just send my clothes over to someone for free? This is unethical unacceptable behavior from what I thought was a trusted site . I would not trust this site anymore after this it is definitely not what it used to be .,1
2119,"Kicked off for no reason with over 25 5-star reviews: I was on OfferUp for over 3-years and collected well over 25 5-star reviews. I NEVER did anything against the guidelines and only used the app for buying and selling. One time as I was negotiating with a seller to order their product I was suddenly booted off the platform with ZERO explanation as to why! There was ZERO PROOF provided to me and customer service ignored me.

What kind of platform does that? It also became very difficult for your listings to be viewed if you do not pay for it to be promoted. And it’s FULL of scammers who want your cell phone number to steal your information. 
I moved to Facebook Marketplace, not perfect but much better and less scammers",1
2120,"Horrible horrible customer service: Here from another account just to shed light on how terrible the system of “safety” is how in gods name do you guys manage to delete an account of over 100purchases ? Wasn’t violating anything or even breaking the law in anyway , if there was a way to legally dispute this I would , super constant user and I honestly think you guys should slow the heck down before you guys start making life changing decisions. Absolutely terrible",5
2121,"DONT PAY FOR PREMIUM. YOU WONT GET IT.: A few months ago, they wrongly charged me for a service I never received. After two weeks of communication, they offered a three-day free trial for the wrongly charged device. They hadn't intended to refund me; I didn't dispute the double charge, assuming it would be resolved. The mishap occurred because they gave my premium membership to someone else and brushed off their mistake. A refund came only due to Apple, not the $40. Their poor support frustrated me. Post-refund, I shared my experience with fellow redditors who echoed similar sentiments about the company. Apple was my saviour, they forced them to do the refund. The app is ad-heavy. Months later, I confidently prefer Facebook Marketplace.",1
2122,"Very old listings: I’m searching for cars and find several posts that are 2 - 3 - 4 and even 5 years old. When I first started using OfferUp I would send sellers a message asking if I could come and see the auto, but they never replied. So now I have learned some sellers apparently just want to receive messages but have no intention of responding, and possibly don’t have a car for sale anymore but enjoy receiving messages anyway. Maybe old listings (several years old) could be automatically dropped if they don’t reply to messages of interest.",3
2123,"App makes it hard to want to use it: Would be nice the app didn’t make naturally scrolling a literal nightmare by making every passing finger swipe open an ad. That’s not how it should work. If I’m interested in a product I’ll select the ad. Otherwise don’t game the system by making swipes that pass an ad open it. This entire app is an exercise in frustration. I’ve stopped using the app mostly due to how annoying it’s become. If I were an advertiser, I’d reconsider advertising on OfferUp. You’re probably paying per click and I guarantee most of my clicks are forced and not because I’m interested. I’m immediately backing out.",2
2124,Decent app but: This app is great overall but…. When I was trying to sign in my account on offer up it’s asking me if my can verify my phone number and I did but now it all the sudden saying that “phone number with too many users”  which I only made one account and wanting to make another account how am I supposed to sell things on offer up if it’s not letting me verify my phone number I tried other phone numbers but won’t work. It can use some of that improvement,4
2125,Idk what these reviews are??: Idk what these other people are talking about…I barely get ads and I have sold 11 things. Yes there are people who try to scam but that happens anywhere honestly. This app is actually a really nice app! My favorite thing is that it gives the option to choose weight sizes because it makes it way easier on the shipper. I have so far had no problems with the app. Works very well. Just depends on what you sell because obviously there are more popular items then others!,4
2126,"Ashley Lorraine Macklin ~ Furniture Store: Absolutely gorgeous beautiful,  nearly Brand New merchandise in this store! Every inch of this store is immaculate, high quality merchandise, the owner and employee’s are pure angel’s,  very easy to talk to,  just down to earth  and genuinely  kind to everyone visiting this establishment, very comfortable and welcoming atmosphere,  It was a really good day for us, this was our very first time there, so we’re planning another trip to this store in 2 weeks.  
We are no doubt, customer’s for life now.",5
2127,"DO NOT USE THIS APP > read why: I had a buyer report that she never received an item, so I followed up and it was sent back by the post office. I contacted her and told her the issue. Per her request, she told me to resend it on the same tracking. I resent it. However, she reported that she needed a refund, which OfferUp gave her. So not only did she have my item but she also got her money back. 

I repeatedly tried to contact OfferUp and they email me a link that is broken. There’s no way of contacting anyone. So I lost money $$$$$. 

This app is a scammer paradise. So if you want to lose your item and money definitely download this company’s app. Otherwise, you’re better off going back to good ole EBay or Craigslist.",1
2128,"Offers cancellation: You guys need to find a away to separate the Accept the offer and decline the offer. It’s on a same bottom. A very small mistake and you press the decline the offer but you have no intention to decline it. I missed many sales because of this. It has to be separate. The accept button apart and the decline apart. Also you have to have The resume the offer too, in case you decline and after we change the mind and want to accept. We need to have notifications in case we need an update on our payement méthodes. Mercari does that which is helpful.",3
2129,"Apps need improvement: Overall it’s too fancy and everything. But the item doesn’t sell as often as it does. Sometimes I feel it’s a overkill. If I search for an item to put it like for me to sell, it keeps giving me ads for it but doesn’t sell my own product. Lots of times the ads on other 3rd party free websites have got my items sold. Like I even used promote plus. Nothing happened on even popular items. Also there is no separate section for sold items etc or categorized. They don’t help to promote or have service on how to sell items in that category for any paid services too.",2
2130,"Let go was my favorite: I love the concept of offer up/let go, but I liked that let go had the price of each item before you clicked on it. I could how many likes an item had to see if it was popular. One think I like a lot. Offer up you can bargain. Let go was better designed. Come on computer dudes make OfferUp as good as Letgo if your going to combine the apps. I guess both apps have different features, but letgo was more user friendly.",5
2131,"App has gone down hill since joining letgo: I had a pretty big profile and had been a member since 2015.  Up until offer up buying letgo ever thing was great. It’s like the joined and everything stopped working, messages not sending items disappearing then I go logged out and could t get back it. Completely gave up then about a month ago I decided to try again made a whole new profile different email etc. verified everything, app worked for about a week now we are back to the same thing as before. The worst thing about offer up is their non existent customer service. I’m done with this company. Extremely frustrating and disappointing.",1
2132,No customer service: My account has been shadow blocked for no reason. Stopped receiving messages 5 days ago didn’t realize that was the reason til I archived my postings and listed them again and now none get views and none show up when I search for my listings. What a grey app let these fake accounts keep theirs and stop showing real posts. My account isn’t blocked cause I can logout and login and have tried all their trouble shooting ideas and the same thing. I’m over this crappy app. To Facebook marketplace I go. OfferUp doesn’t message you back when you contact their customer service and never tell you why your account goes through these problems.,1
2133,Signed me into someone else’s profile: I was trying to do the true ID and was attempting to take a photo of my ID but I was unable to take a photo so I deleted the app and downloaded it again and I used my google to sign in I tried to do the true ID again and again it didn’t work and thank God it didn’t work because the app signed me into another person profile named leshawn something and that’s a major problem that the app signed me into someone else’s profile even after I had used my login and sign in I would address this is I were you guys God bless,3
2134,"Notifications: I downloaded this app to sell my old stuff. Now I know that people also use this app to buy stuff, but I really, really hate getting spammed with notifications to buy the very thing I am trying to sell. My literal own post was getting recommended for me to buy. Obviously no one wants to buy their own thing, much less other things that are very similar to the thing you are trying to get rid of. The app works well, hence the 3 stars, but the spam notifications drove me to the point of keeping my thing and just deleting the app.",3
2135,Why are u promotin sexual games: You know when offer up started it was for your common home folk Offer up has changed they have gotten money hungry so now what do u get? Tons of dealers especially selling cars Tons of store advertisement an a whole mess of scammers that they them selves could weed out by asking more than email an little info they ask to open an account. Offer up has infested itself with a lot of everything the common person that’s looking to buy used something from some else is possible but u get bombarded with other stuff. No customer service or contact unless u jumó thru whops. I mean it’s really become a depressing app for some is trying to telll. Mehhhh thumps down,1
2136,"Horrible setup: Posting don’t get deleted after being on OfferUp for to long, so when you go looking for something you find things from 5 years ago that where posted which those posting should get automatically deleted to make shopping easier and also you have no way of actually deleting your messages, I really miss letgo and I hate how letgo and OfferUp joined together and another thing with this app…they don’t mind having scammers on this site to allow people to get scam, I messaged someone about a camper and right away they asked for all my personal info to pass it on to eBay motors nope not happening so I reported to offer up and the post is still on offer up",1
2137,"SCAMS ALL DAY LONG: Why is Offer Up flooded with OBVIOUS scam profiles and they are not removed? They clearly are scamming people. It makes it extremely difficult to weed through the thousands of SCAMS to find a legit seller. This is by far their biggest problem. I witnessed 3 different profiles with the same vehicle for sell in 9 different cities!!! The same car!!!! It’s not hard to spot. Come on Offer Up team and clean up this mess that you are allowing. It’s most likely that the profiles that are scams, are paying the multiple vehicle posting fee, so you Offer Up profits off of the scammers personally. Why get rid of people who scam others if they are paying you, am I right!!! Dirty business.",2
2138,"Vague errors, horrible support, injected ads to questionable stores: Works ok when it works, but support is pretty bad and errors are useless. Took the support team over a month and multiple attempts to fix an issue rhat preventing me from bidding in the app and the web.

When it does work the search filter criteria is awful and its full of 3rd party ads that are hard to filter out , or worse months or even years old for sale items. All posts NEED an expiration of like 90 days at most otherwise there is just too much garbage.
Making things worse is some of them are for fly by night ecommerce stores that are highly questionable selling items for 1/4 of the retail value as new and total garbage urls.",1
2139,"terrible UI, dont download: edit: everytime i try to save an item my screen goes black. dont download this broken app they clearly dont care about. and since they bought letgo we have no where else to shop like this. thanks for nothing offerup.

i always preferred letgo over offerup. the UI was better in every way imaginable. no clue why the two merged but its terrible. getting the app to work on any given day is legit like playing the lottery at this point. eventually the screen just turns black and the app stops working. idk if this is because im using the ipad version of this app but obviously something is wrong somewhere.

ideally i wish the merger of the two apps never happened because letgo was truly superior in every way.",1
2140,"Scam Haven: The same day I updated to Offer Up, three women tried to sell me the same model, Nissan, color and just about the same mileage. They supposedly lived in three different cities. The name under their pictures didn’t match the name on the emails. I suggested meeting them at their local DMV to purchase the cars. They each had a sad story to tell. They actually thought that I would send money to a transport company and have the car delivered. Look for yourself, same identical pics of a white 2015 Nissan.",5
2141,"The 3 day promotions trial is a scheme: They say it’s free for 3 days but if you try to cancel they still charge you for the full month. You apparently do get 3 days free, but you are charged the remaining days of the one month subscription even if you cancel within the first 3 days. Everyone should write a review so they change this manipulative and uncaring practice. 
I have a family to provide for on a low budget income and I was hoping by giving the promo a try it would help me sell something to get over the hump and I would continue using offer up. When it didn’t work for me I tried to cancel. Offer up apparently doesn’t care about the little guy. If they contact me and offer a full refund I will change my review.",1
2142,"Full of duplicated scammy postings: I have filled out “reports” for items and users when I see duplicates and also fake luxury items (the platform is full of scammy fake trademark infringement items - from fake Chanel masks and tshirts to fake handbags, jewelry and accessories.

Also scammers have multiple profiles posting the same scams over my it like profiles, all fake - reported those also and still a majority of what is in this site.

The mail order guarantees are garbage straight garbage on offerup. I know that offerup notices a difference now. I use to be on this app 3-10x a day, now I’m on 1x a month. I haven’t got anything from offerup since the mail order rip off. I couldn’t talk to a human when I wanted a refund and after many many attempts I said forget it. Asa I gave up, I got a message from an actual offerup human saying thanks. I worded my messages very carefully so I would be able to notice the difference. I use mercari now. I love it",3
2144,Good go to for selling: I’ve been using OfferUp for a couple years at least now and I have found it to be easy to use and all their updates help to make the app a great and easy go-to for buying and selling. I’ve had pretty good luck selling most of the items I have posted and have straight forward communication with the buyer. I appreciate the measures this app has implemented to take away from many scam postings in comparison to other sites/apps.,5
2145,Bittersweet: My account wasn’t posting any offers. It would show up on my selling board but never on the main page. Even when I looked it up I couldn’t find my offer anywhere! No one gets my messages and no one is able to reach out to me. I even got a new phone and made a new email so I didn’t have any issues with my past account by creating a new one and it’s doing the same thing! I have lots to sell but it’s a waste of time to post if no one will see it. I would love if someone could help but there’s zero customer service contact info on the website. Just info on how to use the app. I would give it 5 stars if my account actually worked but I’m giving it 1 bc I have to give it something.,1
2146,"Maybe a time limit?: Don’t get me wrong, I love this app because it’s pretty easy to buy and sell and makes contact really easy. I loved let go and I feel like because you guys have merged, you should add some of their policies. Let go had a month limit on items to be sold and that was really helpful. I think you guys should have at least a 3 month limit because it’s kinda hard to find something when there are posts from 2 years ago. You could always repost them! Anyway, this is just a personal opinion but i think it would help a lot if you added some sort of time limit for sales.",2
2147,"Just bring back letgo!: If I could give it zero stars I would. I like to think of myself as very progressive and willing to try new things, but I tried OfferUp before and didn’t like it’s all. Now that I’m forced to use it because letgo no longer works(because they merged with OfferUp, I’m trying to force myself to like it. I built up a huge portfolio of good reviews on letgo which are now just the number of people saying they had a positive experience w me. VERY disappointed. The letgo app was very easy to navigate but the OfferUp app is confusing at times. If you’re going to merge the apps, at least bring everything over. 

Also..after trying to actually use OfferUp turns out I can’t sell services on OfferUp. So a chunk of my income is now gone.",1
2148,"Won’t deposit my earned money: I have tried numerous times to have my earnings deposited into my account and they haven’t been able to help me. First, someone pretended to help but simply transferred me to another person via email. Then, over email they told me that actually they don’t have a method of getting your earnings via deposit. In the app, it shows me that I can and I have done everything it says for me to do to get my money, but nothing has happened. Offerup doesn’t even have a contact number for customer service or any number for that matter. They only have social media outlets that rarely if not never respond to you. I’d suggest selling things on Letgo and Mercari instead (they give you your earned money easily).",1
2149,The best way to get rid of things that you don’t want to take to the dump: I am glad for offer up being here they have allowed me to get rid of things out of my home quickly because I must be out in under a week and that’s the best thing that’s ever come around I can see that right now much better than craigslist as I’ve put things on that place and I still have them offer up 15/20 minutes everything I’ve put out there is gone thank you very much for OfferUp,5
2150,"READ BEFORE USING!!: This app is full of scammers and shady people, every one who contacts you to buy or sell either doesn’t have a profit picture and is not a true you member or they are asking for payment outside of the application to scam you. Most say cash app, app pay, or even PayPal friends and family. 

The app does have its uses but for the most part it’s just filled with scammers and fake accounts so just watch your back when dealing through this app. I have messaged support many times about this issue still no resolution in sight. They should make it required to verify your account before being able to purchase and sell, maybe even add an extra level of security to make the scammers liable for damages..",1
2151,"The Reviewing System: I feel like there’s really nothing wrong with the app other than the rating system. I want to be able to, on my own time, go in a review the person I bought an item from. I haven’t been able to review the person because there’s no straight forward way to do it. Also I don’t really like how the only reviews are written in words such as “helpful” or “friendly”, I can’t write or express my full view on that person if I can only sum it up in a few words. I wanna be descriptive of how that person is that I’m reviewing.",4

I may be experiencing a glitch of some kind, but the item has been delivered for 6 days now and on offer ups app it still says “Item in transit, once delivery is made they buyer will have two days to inspect the item, then funds will be deposited”. 

I’ve reached out for support at least once a day with not a single response, only saying “I will be contacted by email.” 

From now on I’m going to stick to the tried and true ebay and Craigslist",4
2153,"Honest review of OfferUp: I love this app! The only reason I gave it four stars is because so often its members either don’t respond, or they commit to purchase something and never show up. So not only have you not sold to someone else, you’ve wasted your time waiting for them and possibly even driven to meet them.  Also, I’m not a fan of the new items listed by various companies.  If I wanted to purchase something from them rather than a used and more affordable item from an everyday person, I would’ve visited their store/site to begin with.",4
2154,"I love OfferUp: You can buy and sell anything (short of heroine and all that illegal stuff). Most of the people I sell and buy from are genuinely nice and (while they may fall short) as professional as they can be! There are of course stupid people on here too and stupid teenagers (trying to sell their moms’ purse and all), however there are stupid people everywhere so I don’t hold OfferUp against that. It’s a great way to earn some side cash if your a hustler and a great way to get a discount on super cheap used items. 5 stars all day!!",5

Over the whole month of December I have not been able to receive my notifications, send messages, my items that are posted are not being seen, viewed or offered on. I directly typed my posted item title in the search bar & my posting is nowhere to be found! I have contacted technical support five different messages and I have yet to receive anything back or fix. Horrible!",5
2156,"Used to be good but....: I used to sell everything on this app-literally- every year I’d go around the house, find all the things I no longer used or didn’t want, and I’d sell them and make a killing! Who needs yard sales? 
I can no longer use this app, however, because when I do post items to sell, I don’t get a notification when someone makes me an offer or sends a message. I’ve checked my notification settings and have “enabled notifications” and still nothing. I’m busy so I can’t always be on my phone, and that cha-ching noise whenever I got a message was the best, because it let me know what’s up. I’ve moved onto better apps like let go and Facebook. 
Maybe if you guys fix things I’ll return, by it’s doubtful.",1
2157,"Good deals but needs some improvement: I like OfferUp, I have sold and bought a lot of things here. The only issue I have is that they need to take “incident reports” reported by users more seriously. Also some features need to be improved. When a seller is not at home when you are there at the agreed time to sell what you had previously agreed on, the buyer has no way to rate the seller (as the sales never happened). Basically, my suggestion is that you should be able to rate anyone you had communication with. Other than this, good app.",4
2158,Cool cowboy boots: The boots were beautiful. They arrived promptly in excellent condition just as sold. The only thing I would remind people is to make sure that the sizing is correct. I ordered a 7 1/2. They were a 7 1/2. I actually wear a size 6 1/2 but anticipated insertsfor Art. The toes were pointier than I could tell and with the answers in it was a little tight lol but I love them. I am planning on taking them to the shoemaker to stretch them a bit hopefully that will make them a perfect match.,5
2159,"Bans ANY VPN, support lacking: Offerup does not allow its USA based users to enable any sort of VPN, even if the IP address is US based. A VPN is a necessary security precaution for many US companies and users, and disabling them is often not even an option. Additionally, it shouldn't be necessary to decrease my local security, whereas OfferUp should increase its fraud team. Also, the response from customer service is very slow or non-existent. Their final support response to us, is basically a VPN ban:
""Using a Virtual Private Service (VPS) or a Data Center that has previously experienced an account comprise is blocked by OfferUp. To access OfferUp, you will need to remove their Virtual Private Network (VPN) and login using your residential connection.""",1
2160,"Purchase of a hassock from Ramzi: I am pleased with all aspects of my purchase of the hassock from you. The entire experience was accurate, informative and very easy. The product itself seems to be very well made. FYI I have arranged with a local automotive leather seat repair company to save his remnants for me. They are free to me, he has them ready for me today and he will stuff the hassock. So I will be using my new hassock tonight. Thank you. Christina 
Merry Christmas to you and your family.",5
2161,"Good app ruined with ads: It’s really sad what happened to offer up because this was always my go-to when trying to buy used things, but the app is completely ruined with ads. They’ve recently made it impossible to avoid opening ads. If your finger slightly touches an ad it opens your browser and you have to return to the app. I was somehow able to live with this, but now it’s even worse. Now they’ve put in timed, unskippable ads. It’s like one of those games that you download and realize are horrible. Stick with fb marketplace. Soon enough people selling will realize it is turning people away with ads and will move to selling there anyway.",1
2162,"Could improve a lot!: Great app!
Great options!
Easy to use but there’s a lot of things that could definitely use some improvement! For instance; when I get a notification from the app saying there’s related items to my last research there’s actually 1 or 2 related items! Everything else has nothing to do!! Frustrating!! Or when I find the perfect item it was listed over a year or two ago and it got sold but somehow the post never got deleted and there’s no expiration time for them so they never disappear!! Frustrating!!",3
2163,"Outdated post with ridiculous pop up ads: This app use to be quite useful, now it’s known to be a haven for scammers and criminals to sell things. I’ve been ghosted and scammed on this platform. There’s no customer service and you can sell anything on here including illegal things. 

Now to top things off they have annoying ads that pop up every 5 seconds to promote a brand that you aren’t even interested in. Clearly the algorithm is completely off because those aren’t even close to what I look at. This app could be improved so much instead of having posts a year old or promoted just because they pay a fee. Becoming just like Facebook marketplace.",1
2164,"Forces me to turn my notifications on: I’ve used this app for years and over those years it’s progressively gotten worse finding new and different ways to try and force me to turn my notifications on. I’ve managed to just ignore it, usually closing the app and then reopening it. Or accepting it but never actually turning the notifications on then going back into the app. Now they have finally forced me to delete this app. I can’t even see any of my notifications that I have active unless I turn notifications on. So for this reason I’m deleting and will just use Facebook market place. Shame I have almost 100 reviews and enjoy scrolling through OfferUp.",1
2165,"Shame It Paired: …with Let Go. LG was so much better. Way easier to sell stuff. This one, you can’t rate the person after time. I had somebody lie to me, something I discovered 5 weeks later but I couldn’t review their product. I get notifications about things related to searches. I don’t want that. However, I often do not get notifications from people responding to me which my have cost me a few deals/sales. Overall it’s better than eBay but that’s a low bar.

Also, I’m familiar with the notification settings. Everything is turned off that I don’t want yet I still get annoying notifications.",2
2166,"Not good customer service: I never write reviews good or bad but this has to be said 👎

I had a customer who was upset that i didn’t want to accept a large amount of cash instead of Venmo. Since I canceled the meet up they reported me and the item I was selling simply because they were upset. OfferUp then blocked me from reposting the item then deactivated my account for “violating community guidelines”, which i did no such thing. 
When i emailed customer support and explained the situation, they did not hear me out or have a conversation about my side of the story. They sent back a generic email saying they have the right to block me; but for WHAT?? I violated nothing and had a good rating as a seller, the customer I'm assuming complained had zero rating and no basis for reporting me. 

I am so disappointed in this app and 10/10 do not recommend. The customer service is baseless and unprofessional. 

Many times my boyfriend and I have been offered drugs in trade for items… 

Take your business elsewhere you will be better off, I know I will.",1
2167,Bargain shopper: I’m a single mom and Offer Up has allowed me to work and be able to fine nice affordable 2nd hand a sometimes nearly new with options choices. I never had a bad experience and I so glad you guys created a platform to find any and everything. Get up the good work meaning safe transaction. And thank the folks who gives us the opportunity to make money and bless people homes that can usually be very expensive.,5
2168,"Making it simple: Life is way too complicated these days so the easier it is to use a site, like Offer Up, the quicker we can get back to all of those little details in our lives!  Besides, there are so many worthwhile items on this site and I appreciate the simplistic  way all of your customers can navigate your site!  Thank you for sharing this amazing website with us all!  Your #1fan from Carlsbad “The City by the Sea”",5
2169,TOO MANY SCAMMERS: I used to use letgo and stopped that because of too many scammers and creepy people so I deleted it.  I seen OfferUp and decided to give it a try.  Very disappointed to see even more scamming than letgo.  Several people messaged me trying to get me to fall for the “check” scam.  They said they are sending me a check along with money for the “movers”.  Wait til check clears then pay the “movers”.  Then the check will be fake and found weeks later only to be out of the money plus your items.  I’ve read about it and it happens a lot. Thank God I looked it up before I fell for it.  However most seniors and other people would fall for this very easy.  BEWARE THERE ARE MANY SCAMMERS OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!,1
2170,Remove Account for No Reason: I’ve used offer up for years. I’ve had hundreds of positive transactions and over 150 5 star reviews on my page.. My account was fully verified from Offer Up and my account got completely removed with no warning. I did absolutely nothing wrong and did not violate ANYTHING.. I was extremely disappointed and wrote offer up but they are refusing to respond or resolve the issue.. I then made a whole new email just to make another account and try it again and the exact same thing happened.. I am very disappointed and I can’t believe that happened. I’ll be looking for another ap to use since this one screwed me over,1
2171,"WONDERFUL!!!!: I’m in Love with OfferUp! I think it’s the best thing ever what a better thing to do with your things you either no longer need or want ... and a way for you to also find Great things that you need or want...
You can also make things and sell them ... I also love meeting all the people I have got to meet and know some of them it’s pretty amazing! It’s great when people come to a agreement on a price for a item... I’m on OfferUp just as much as I’m on any other shopping site... it’s Great! 
Thank You So Much!!!",5
2172,"SCAMMERS EVERYWHERE: Guys please be careful with the scammers on this app . It’s as if every person who inquired about something I have posted would say EXACTLY THE SAME THING as they were all reading off the same script . I almost shipped a phone to a scammer. They all will ask for email , phone number or any personal things you use . No one needs your phone number . This app really needs to do better and do some more strict verification in order to buy or sell on this app . Im hearing many people are getting scammed after doing my research thanks goodness I didn’t send out my $700 phone to someone who was never gonna pay me in the first place . OFFER UP PLEASE BE MORE STRICT IN VERIFYING PEOPLE . I am deleting this app from now on.",1
2173,"Good concept but...: The app is, overall, a good concept.   Bugs in the program that allow you to archive and then magically the listing re-appears in the active folder is very frustrating.  Another thing is the amount of phishing that is done is horrendous.  For example, I search for Tacoma will yield 5-10 new listing and 40-60 phony ones per day.  No matter how much I report them and the system removes them, the fake listing are re-generated within hours.   It's the same photos, amounts and email addresses in the listing, just the persons name is different.",4
2174,"Let Go Was way better: Most apps have way better features, let go had better features for sure, and they went and  bought let go and didn’t even add any of the awesome user friendly features it had. Such a pain to not be able to search exactly what your looking for, especially when looking at cars. You have to sift through so much to find what your looking for. The most annoying part is not being able to set a mileage range when looking for cars, you have to click on they’re predetermined sets and it still doesn’t work half the time. Never wrote a review for an app before but hate this app so much I had to. Especially since they shut down let go for this .",1
2175,New update.: They new update shows a black background which is nice and also the new features added to your post for sell page are great. I still wish that they would add a delete button for items you no longer have or sold somewhere else instead of archiving or marking as sold. It would also be great to have the price shown on items as your scrolling through so you dont have to click on each item just to look at the price. One more thing i wish they would of added is the option to view with grid or list for our selling posts.,3
2176,"F R U S T R A T I O N: OfferUp, can you please enable us to send pictures and videos of the product through the messaging inbox of the app so we don’t have to send our phone numbers to random strangers? I was in the middle of a transaction trying to sell a printer and the customer wanted to see that it worked & wanted me to send a video of the printer printing something. I didn’t want to HAVE to send my number to a random stranger for a one-time sale. I wish OfferUp could allow us to also attach a video of the product to our listings when we post them. 

Otherwise, this app is awesome & love selling & buying from this app 👍🏼",3
2177,"All good but the notifications: You guys realize that you're losing commerce on the app because of the random suggestions that pop up in the inbox, right? We have notifications for messages in the inbox but eventually get sick of them and turn inbox notifications off altogether. Now the item I've had for sale gets a message 3 weeks later but I've turned off notifications completely and I've gotten out of the habit of checking.

People have what I want to buy but have their inbox notifications turned off. Stop inboxing suggestions and handle them separately.",3
2178,"OfferUp ruined Letgo: Letgo was the easiest, most user friendly selling app I had used. It was so easy to communicate, to search different regions, that my wife banned me from using the app for a while after I bought tons of cheap furniture to redo our house. Since signing back on, I was told that Letgo merged with OfferUp. But in this new app, not only am I not able to search by region or adjust the distance of my search, or easily communicate with sellers, most of the posts on here are not from individual sellers, but are advertisements from online retailers, or are posts from months or even years back! Suffice it to say I’m done with this crappy app, and I’ll have to find an app that prioritizes local sellers and transactions above online retailers.",1
2179,"Laziest Developers Award 2020: At first use the app seems like the new Craigslist but better, until you try to shop for a used vehicle and have to wade through steaming, waist high piles of fake posts selling 2019 vehicles for $1200. When the devs can’t put their thinking caps on to figure out how to stop scammers from posting literally 50 of the same  off shore check scam posts all the in same day, then it’s either part of OfferUp’s profit base  or their developers are lame. Seriously, guys, it’s so bad that’s it’s gotta be because some dude at OfferUp showed up to the meeting any said, “I know! How bout we let these scammers post whatever they want and if they burn anyone, we take our share off the top!” Poor, short-sighted decision gentlemen, fix it.",1
2180,"Used to be great before Let Go was updated into app: I previously had no problems with the app. Once let go was brought in, my account became locked and I couldn’t get in anymore, mind you I had lots of stuff for sell and was involved in purchasing a truck.

I ended up having to create a whole new account just so I could try and sell/ buy again. Would love to be able to get back into my old account! Please fix!",5
2181,"Too Many Fakes: Not sure how the developer could combat this, but I’m not exaggerating, every time I’ve tried to sell something I’ve gotten into days-long exchanges with fake buyers. They either never show up or stop communicating. Not sure what the scam is, and even though I’m getting better at spotting them, they all kind of end up sounding the same. It’s very strange, and a complete waste of time. Craigslist is a lot slower, but I have a much easier time. OfferUp is too volatile and aggressive for me, and kind of seems unsafe, if I keep getting baited into giving my address to meet. Again, not really the app’s fault, but looking at other reviews, it seems like a bigger issue.",2
2182,"2good2b: Great site,  unbelievable people and support for what ever you seek!!  I recently ran into some very unfortunate circumstances that lead me to have to start over!! I went from a beautiful home to homeless!!  Upon stumbling upon this site;  I can truly see light at the end of the tunnel!!  I’ve gone from homeless to literally an apartment that anyone would be proud of.  I’ve furnished my place with everything from freebies to priceless antiques!!!  Not only have I found furnishings; I’ve developed unbelievable friendships, networking and fortunes !",5
2183,"Not as many sales: I had recently joined letgo and was having pretty quick sales. I had people contacting me often, not a week would go by without questions about an item and a lot of them resulted in sales in the short time I had it. The merger took place that supposedly would combine the best characteristics of letgo and offerup and would result in greater sales except that hasn’t happened for me. Days go by without anyone inquiring about items. The times they do usually result in no shows and I’ve only had one sale since the merger. I’m not sure if I’m the exception and other people are enjoying the change but I definitely had more success before.",2
2184,"Merger Let Down, I Miss LetGo.: Since LetGo and OfferUp combined, I’ve seen a considerable decline in messages and buyer traffic. I do enjoy being able to see how many times an item has been viewed, along with being able to discuss specs with buyers, but I haven’t had nearly the engagement that I got with LetGo. It seems my listings are lost in the huge feed, or they have gotten harder to find with the larger number of users.

For future app development and improvement, I would enjoy having a “Pending” option for items that are reserved and awaiting pickup. This is a great feature that is offered on Facebook Marketplace.",3
2185,Terrified and horrible experience do not get OfferUp: Great price items half the time but can’t really trust the people. I went to meet someone up for a ps4 on 8/3/20 and what happens a man points a gun at me and tells me to give me the money then he looked at my car and just ran off. Thank god because i had my son and my pregnant wife in the car. I seen him and his friend running off so I followed them and seen them go to a house inform the police and they caught them.i lost my money and now my wife and son are terrified of people. Just a really disappointing time I do not recommend this app. You literally pay to be robbed because the cops can’t give you the cash back and this app doesn’t care,1
2186,"Horrid customer support: The customer support for OfferUp is absolutely terrible. They will ignore half of your message and reply with a generic auto generated response 9/10 times. 

The only time I got an actual response is when I sent multiple messages over 2 days asking the same thing multiple times. They are now holding my money indefinitely and are requesting that I wait up to two days when I should have gotten my money two weeks ago. 

I had never had a problem with OfferUp in the past and after experiencing this I will gladly delete this trash off my phone and resuming my selling elsewhere as will I stop recommending people use this and instead switch to the much better managed alternatives.",1
2187,"Fix this please: Dear offer up I appreciate your help on making it easy to sell stuff, but there would be something I would like to be changed. I would like once you sell an item on your profile, the item is taken down. With this issue it takes a long time to scroll through because they are so many sold items it just takes space. I would really like that to be adjusted or at least have the option to erase the item that is sold. Other than that I would rate  the app 10/10.",4
2188,"Absolutely Terrible Customer Service: No phone number and have not responded to multiple emails. I’ve been a seller for several years with over 70 5 star reviews. I sell mainly antiques and jewelry and have always treated my clients with honesty and respect. I’m so disappointed in the customer service team. A policy of non-response is not a policy at all. They should be embarrassed.

Update: They responded to my review and gave me an email to contact. I did and still no response!

Update 2: Customer service finally responded (three days later) and apparently unblocked my account. They sent what looks like a blanket email with no details besides that I apparently posted a prohibited item. I responded by thanking them and asking for further clarification. I will keep updating as this continues to play out.

Update 3: My account was reinstated but I was never told why it was shadow banned in the first place. I have moved on to different, more user focused apps. Companies that operate like this do not survive in the long run so I’ll watch as this goes the way of MySpace and others that we cannot remember.",1
2189,"Charges: Offer up is great a lot better than letgo, but I do not like the fact that your app charges sellers like myself. Or at least you attempted to or it seems like you restrict others from viewing whatever items you are selling or I should say the seller is selling. Unless you pay. At least that is what my perception is based on the apps behavior or glitches as you may say. Other than that because I’ve bought several things from OfferUp,I think you’re great.",5
2190,"My “wish list”: This app & the whole ststem that makes up the OfferUp experience is great but here are a few things that would make it even more awesome & worthy of a 5-star rating: 
1. Show prices in the previews or show it in the headings. 
2. Have an option to “save draft /copy” when listing items for sale. 
3. The option to set a “reserve” price (like eBay) that automatically rejects offers that are lower than the minimum offer you would take.
4. Be able to leave feedback as buyers & sellers (also like eBay) that is visible to everyone.",4
2191,EZ PZ: I do love this app.  So much easier to communicate with folks compared with craigslist. You can drop a location using the map.  You can ask if something is still available with a single tap.  You get notifications about your items and items you’ve looked at that have sold. It is easy to manage a sale.  The app walks you right through posting an item beginning with uploading a photo. I highly recommend this app for the second hand marketplace.,5
2192,"Full of ads.: I want to love this app, but most of categories are swarmed with phone companies, like Sprint, T-Mobile, and Cricket, selling “free” phones. When you click any of the listing it’s nothing but spam about signing up for their phone plans. If you can manage to dig past all these stupid companies posts, the actual people posting actual items for sale are fantastic. And yes I’ve tried reporting these accounts and listings for breaking rules on what’s prohibited but they never get taken down or 10 more get posted in their place. Oh and when sorting items by newest the first page  10 or so items will be, then it goes back to having items that are 5+ months old mixed in with things listed that day.",1
2193,"All positive: I have purchased numerous items on Offer Up. The app is easy to navigate. Communication is simple.
Today I sold my first item. All the negotiating was done prior to purchase/ arrival to pick up.
 I will warn people to stick to the app to communicate. The App advises users to do so as well. I had one person ask for my cell phone # and when I said I would communicate only through the app I did not here back from them.  I would rather lose a sale than deal with a crazy person.",5
2194,"Extremely Disappointed: I wanted to like this App, but it has been nothing but problems from the moment I had a buyer. After I sent the item I started receiving notifications that I was running out of time to ship the item, after I had sent it to days prior. And then after the buyer received the item I shipped, OfferUp cancelled my sale and I did not receive payment for the new designed item that I had sold. It is very difficult to contact them when you have an issue, and the eventual response from support was vague and not helpful. Will not use the App again.

As stated above, I have tried to contact support. For the past 6 days, still no resolution and no payment for the item I shipped to the buyer.",1
2195,"Really Like: After having tried Letgo and getting nothing but super lowball offers and flakes (even though the stuff was low to begin with), I cancelled my acct and moved to OfferUp. Much better people on this site imo (although flakes here too), but overall way better. So, please don’t go changing this site OfferUp; every other place that does that screws things up; and you can bet I will drop you and revoke this review if you do!
If it ain’t broke don’t fix it! If it stays this way, I’m a happy customer.",5
2196,"Would be 5 stars if can post from desktop: Only allowing to post from the app, so from the phone is cumbersome. I understand posting from the phone is fast, but quality is restricted by the phone interface. Ideally, I would like to post from mobile and the go to edit it on desktop to enrich my post with additional pictures, type longer description .... and desktop is far better for that",5
2197,No one pay anything by shipping way: I just found a Dewalt Inspaction camera on OfferUp and the seller said everything works great. The seller wasn’t near me and there’s a shipping option with $12 shipping cost. I went to all shipping police and I saw the payer protection claim and I said I have protection from OfferUp. But when I got it and one hour letter I opened a payer protection claim. No one responded and I did another one and the third and no respond. 9-10 days letter they finally responded and they said your claim is declined because you only have two days to open payer protection claim!!?? I said I did but no one responded and there is no phone number so I can call and this is not my fault. Seems like you was waiting till I bass the two days so I can’t do claim.,1
2198,"Worst app ever: Don’t buy this app, when I first got it, I put up a couple of items for sale. I got offers within the next few weeks and everything. But then I got hacked by someone. They were posting a car for sale that I didn’t post and every time I kept deleting it, it would reappear again and again. They somehow changed my email too. I even changed my password too a couple of time, but they still were able to get onto the account. I contacted OfferUp twice about the issue and they never got back to me, just only said that they reported the issue. I had to deactivate my whole account and create a new one. Plus I was suppose to be selling someone an item the next day, but now I can’t.",1
2199,"No support whatsoever: Simply put, OfferUp provides an alternative to Craigslist. Which that side of the operation seems to run fine. However, if you decide to use the payment and deposit feature, be aware that you can not remove it! You can only replace it with an alternate form. I have made several request to their “support” team and all you get is an automated reply from Millie. I then ask them to remove my account altogether and they point me to the deactivate account option. They dont comprehend that i want my entire account removed or they refuse to do so. While you should be cautious of using sites like Craigslist and OfferUp for obvious safety reasons, I would also add you should be cautious adding personal data to their app.",1
2200,Searching a persons list of sale items: it's really annoying when you're trying to scroll through somebody's list of items for sale in case you want to do a bundle deal because once you click into an item it's automatically goes back up towards the top and you lose your place and have to scroll down again. This has happened several times to me when I'm looking at somebody's profile who has 200+ items for sale.,5
2201,"Great app, not-so-great users: The app itself is SO easy to list things to sell and to buy, I love it. Excellent user experience across the entire app and I really appreciate that. 

Unfortunately, it seems most prospective buyers ghost or ask for the most above-and-beyond favors. I might still be in a learning curve or it could just be how most users are across the app, which is truly sad. I hope that OfferUp can dedicate some time to promoting a more reliable and responsible user base in the future...because if it had that, it would be the best app for selling things period. As of now, it’s mostly a frustrating experience as a seller.",3
2202,"A great app but awful in practice: Although the app is great, just make sure you don’t forget that the buyers are human. My experience has been: Lots of “tire kickers” —they message you, ask if you’ll accept an amount, and then just stop responding after you agree to it. On the sales I have made, they were generally not easy. I had to wait a lot for people to show. People tend to be no-shows or they show up later than expected. 

The app provides an intuitive platform, but unlike what you see in the commercials, many of the buyers I’ve interacted with are really here to “lowball” you on what you’re selling, and they just often don’t follow through or make it difficult. 
I’ve had much better luck on Craig’s List.",1
2203,"Yes to OfferUp!: I like this app because it’s easy to use and you can filter it to see exactly what your looking for. I’ve sold and bought many things, it’s a great way to find local deals. The only issue I’ve come across is when looking on a persons profile once I click on an item & decide to go back it takes me to the top of their page again so I have to scroll all the way back to where I was. I’m sure it’s just a little glitch, other than that this app is great!",5
2204,Offer up: I absolutely love this app so easy very quick I have bought a couple items now just recently downloaded that no bugs or glitches great communication easy to access everything I recommend this highly to anyone that wants to not drive that far stay in your local area and buy nice inexpensive things and there's also a way to ask the seller to come down a little bit on the price it's amazing!!! Will use it for a very long time I guarantee that!,5
2205,"Good bare bones purchase and list app: I think the app is developed more with the buyer in mind.  As an occasional non-paying lister of items, I feel that the options for even minimal diversification at the most basic level are nonexistent. However, the results I’ve had have proven to be slow and happily semi-fruitful. 
I’m sure that somebody who pays to subscribe to the full capabilities or much more successful and have less turn overtime. Thanks for offering your platform for free!

2206,"Buggy but usable: Easy to use but has a lot of bugs
Unfortunately a lot of scammers use this app so one will need to exercise caution when buying items (especially expensive ones)
Feedbacks need to be open to the public so everyone can see what it was received for (like on eBay). Otherwise, a scammer may open 2 accounts, leave a couple of feedbacks from one account to another, creating an illusion of honesty, and scam several legitimate accounts
Ads are now killing the app as well. But oh well, without them, OfferUp couldn’t have survived",3
2207,"Please fix your app search function!: I like the app, but the search function is super annoying! If you try to type fast, the cursor automatically goes back to the beginning of the search bar. So you have to SLOWLY type to allow the search function to search with EVERY LETTER YOU TYPE. Extremely annoying.
Also, let's say you are in a search, and you wanted to add something or search something else on the fly. It automatically goes to the Job tab and searches the jobs instead of items. Please fix your app!",3
2208,"Shuts down CONSTANTLY!!: For the last month the app has been locking up/shutting down almost daily but sometimes multiple times per day! I have to delete it, reinstall, and start all over again. This is extremely frustrating when I’m trying to buy or sell and communicate with other users. 
PLEASE OfferUp, get it together! It’s almost unusable. And it’s not just me or my device. I get the same feedback from other buyers and sellers. I like the app and want to confusing it, but soon I will move on. Nobody has time. For all this nonsense. FIX IT!!",3
2209,"Over Up and Up and Up….: I like OU but I think the person to person selling is awkward at the least  and needs the  eBay  model of escrow using best fintech  and best fintech for security - yes there will be selling fees but perhaps cobrand with EBay to promote local listings and no forget the app ease and aesthetic content function.

With some analysis, you could figure out the customer base , there are many many things you just cannot ship with the big carriers!!! 

There are items folks are ready to take what I call “ shopcations”  on.

I think cities down on their luck and many small towns would be huge here and of course opportunities with the hospitality business etc.?

Lastly there is a huge opportunities in the upper scale flea markets like Brimfield,  Madison , Pasedena  for pre- market promotion, sale, and post market .

I could go on and on for development here because shipping is such a huge opportunity for OU in my belief and experience.",3
2210,"OfferUp 👎🏼: I’ve been using OfferUp for years off and on, I posted something I wasn’t aware was not allowed cbd oil and a bike part that had a lithium battery in it which I guess you can’t sell because you can’t ship it, instead of telling me you can’t post that they just shut down my account and won’t respond. It’s crazy it’s like the company is ran by an AI system that has no human intelligence behind it. Disappointed everyone I tell about it can’t believe it . Maybe a new app or some competition will would be good . Hint hint Charles hint hint Sean . If you can take a day off from developing video games for a second this area of the sales market needs something better asap",1
2211,"Extremely Unprofessional: I just created my account a few days ago. I noticed my messages were not going through and no one was able to see the items I had for sale. I put in a request for support and they falsely accused me of violating their guidelines through an automated message and removed my account. Since then I have messaged them explaining my account is brand new and I haven’t even had the chance to text anyone nor sell anything. The support team never responds. Instead they keep sending me the same automated message over and over. It’s sad because I was excited to use this app but so far, I’ve been mistreated and ignored by their support team.",1
2212,"Freezes and refreshes ALOT: Refreshes while you’re in the middle of using it. Also ads are purposely super sensitive to touch. No doubt because it looks to their advertisers like they’re getting a lot of hits and justifying the high amount they charged to be on Offerwhat?! Also doesn’t really show you new stuff when refreshed and you just want to see all the new things that have been getting posted. Just sticks you with mostly the same stuff you have been looking at over and over and over, UNLESS you go to a specific category then you’ll see alllll kinds of stuff! Like a whole other world!",2
2213,"Good, but annoying: Without manually turning off notifications from iPhone settings, you will consistently get notifications for things. I’ve checked every single app setting, turned off all notifications for email and push, yet still get stupid “things you should buy” notifications.

And it’s even more annoying when you’re actively trying to sell something and hear the ka-ching! notification, only to be let down by another worthless ad

Other than that, very convenient for buying and selling",3
2214,"This app was once great, now it’s hot garbage: This app was amazing. But then when they merged with letgo, scammer and lowballers galore! Not only that but you have Dealerships that deceive buyers making their profile look like a private seller until you click on the ad. Or stores like game shops that are hole in the wall places that put a price up on classic games for example “all ps2 games $2.99” just to get you to drive up there and the ad was false. Let’s get one thing clear offerup, you need to ban dealerships and stores to post their ads. They have the money to advertise it on tv, social media, and the fm radio. They’re just cutting corners to sucker buyers so buyers beware of the scammers, the scummy corpo dealerships, and lying stores!!",1
2215,"Merged with LetGo and Still Not Using Two Brains: PLACE PRICES ON THE GENERAL SEARCH PAGE! Why do all users need to filter to get a ballpark of prices when searching an item and seeing the price of the item was on each showcased photo, saving an immense amount of time. I’ve been an avid seller/buyer before the OfferUp and LetGo merger and enjoyed the system and ease messaging. The visual price feature was featured on LetGo but still hasn’t taken place in the merged app. This also creates false interest in items that may be wildly out-priced or a scam price, and users click the ad, only to add views to users’ posting that are easily inaccurate of organic interest.",2
2216,"Marketing push notifications: Please allow users to disable any marketing or other push notifications that are not related to communication between users trying to buy and sell. As a user of your app, I'd like to get responses from the items I have for sale in OfferUp, but not the advertising or marketing that is pushed in notifications. 

This is because I will choose to disable all notifications from the OfferUp app instead of getting random marketing notifications, which then has me ignoring the messages from other users, thus making the user experience worse.",2
2217,Offers made from scam accounts: This app doesn’t appear to have filters or vetting processes for scam accounts. My experience years back brought me “buyers” with bogus offers that never came to realized sales. Listing items again this year as i purge my garage to move proved that people who are shady are still here. No serious offers and baits to call or text ppl. I don’t take baits to start giving info as some of these people have requested of me while not even making an offer. I do worry for the unsuspecting people who may fall prey to the scamming people. The items i have listed here and marked sold have not sold through this app. They’ve been sales through other avenues.,1
2218,What happened to OfferUp?!?: Been buying and selling on this app since 2018 no problems until recently my account has been receiving 0 views and posts I’ve made completely disappear from the market no Idea why or how it happened but it seems the only thing you find on the main page are spams and scams filled up on you’re feed not sure if more pages like mine are getting shadowbanned like mine is but it’s getting to the point where I might need to delete my good old account that has accounted for many reviews unfortunately since I have not received any feedback from OfferUp themselves.,2
2219,"Save yourself time and money: The concept is awesome but the amount of fake accounts, counterfeit products and the nonexistent customer service or support from OfferUp makes this app and it’s use a mediocre and big waste of time for anyone looking to make a purchase. I have 3 transactions in limbo just in the last 7 business days with daily emails to customer support going unanswered. Not one response or even acknowledgement that they received my complaints. All 3 have gone past 5 days without being shipped yet billed to my credit card. At this point I will have to reach out to my credit card company to dispute the charges. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. OfferUp will not help in anyway.",1
2220,"Best app for Selling: The people on OfferUp are actually ready to buy, responsive and just all around good people. I have had such a great experience and both my husband and I sell items that would normally go to good will. This way, other people can enjoy items that they may not otherwise get access to. We also have bought bikes and many other items. All have been amazing buying purchases also!",5
2221,"Not the same: I’ve had offer up for a while and it has always been a great app. That’s up until this year, there are to many furniture stores advertising that it seems more like a catalog for furniture than to buy or sell inexpensive items. Having to scroll through all this furniture makes me not want to be on it anymore. I liked it when there was people actually selling items from their home! Yes, you can specifically search for stuff but looking through the home page use to be great to just browse through. Remove some of the furniture stores and I’d give it 5 stars.",2
2222,"Great app, a lot can be done for greatness!: 1- it is tiring to look for cara. Too many are scams, and they are soooo, obvious. 
2- it would be great of once sold a big SOLD came  across the post in the messages and favorites
3- it would be great if more than one post could be removed/unfavorited at the same time (selecting more than one and click one delete)
4. The fact that posts never expire, facilitates posts that have been forgotten, sold And not  deleted, sellers with no notifications or interest  in selling or replying.",4
2223,"Good app. Works good.: I wanna give it 5 stars since it works good but too many duplicate postings are bombarding and flooding the search result making it difficult to shop and taking longer to compare prices also because of that, which creates negative experience also. Offerup must filter and eliminate and screen abusive Sellers doing multiple posting of the same item or ban Seller temporarily for 6 months until they comply and not abuse the postings. They’re reported for duplicate postings but offerup doesn’t take good action/resolution.",4
2224,"Horrible app: Lots of glitches and technical issues!
I have problems with receiving notifications and messages! I am not getting the messages related to my posts despite the fact that it shows I have conversations; All my phone and app notifications settings is active. I have 2 items in my account that shows I have conversations for them but my inbox is empty! This is not the first time. Last week I had the same problem; it was showing I have conversation but the inbox was empty and after 24h the massage appeared. But this time it’s more than 24h plus it’s 2 items with the same issue! What’s the point of having this app if we can’t get massages.",1
2225,Frauds: Absolute failure as a company you bought your competitor and you still haven’t managed to filter out all the frauds and all the scammers in your sales when I click local only still shows a bunch of people that want to ship and if they actually do you ship they’ll try to ask you for extra money meanwhile all the fraud put their number in to the bio as letters claiming to be giving away some thing because I got something new or because it’s their anniversary or their birthday and then they ask you for shipping handling something like 20Or $30 then want to try to add a convenience fee the scammers are easily making 40 to $50-$100 from each person a fool and you guys are doing nothing about it,1
2226,"Too many scammers: The more I post, the more scammers respond demanding my personal phone number and address. Ongoing and compounding software issues make it difficult to post. Often times messages are not delivered in real time with huge lag-time delays. 
Would like the option to receive more than one notification/chime when a message is received; one chime only can be easily missed and buyers become agitated if they do not receive timely replies. 
Many Posts from other acct holders are several Years old and should be automatically deleted after a reasonable amount of time.",3
2227,OfferUp use to be good...: This app use to be my go to app but it has. Ow turned to garbage. I got scammed by someone selling some fake shoes and then when I needed OfferUp to contact the person so that I could give their info to the police department they wouldn’t. Also now there are so many people on it until even when you post your item it is never at the top. I also even did the bump thing for $8 and still didn’t get not one person interested on a brand new bathroom vanity worth over $1700 selling it at less than half price. This app really was better now it’s not and I really would like to get my $8.00 back because I didn’t even get one person that was interested and that was even over a weekend?!?!,1
2228,"Annoyed: I’m disappointed In the fact that some months I can change the distance of my search and then other months I can only use a distance of 30 miles . This is super annoying especially when ur trying to look for something rare or hard to find in ur location. Idk why this app keeps doing that, maybe it’s a bug, maybe they are looking out for us to keep us safe, maybe they don’t agree with us waisting to much gas, maybe, maybe. Plz fix this issue. FB marketplace does the same thing . I’m going to their app next to leave the same review",3
2229,Needs some work.: Anytime I’m looking to buy something there’s a lot of things that are from a year ago that aren’t for sale. It’s a lil annoying that these posts don’t get deleted after a certain amount of time or inactivity. I know this app can be so much better & would like to see things that are actually still available so we’re not wasting our time searching through things that pop up from a year ago that aren’t available or that aren’t relevant to the search. Please work on making our search & app experience better for us all! Thank you 😉😎,3
2230,"A waste of time: *Posting an item on here can take seconds... if it’s just a photo and you don’t want your item to sell. If you do want it to sell it takes much longer to add in all the details to promote it to sell. I spent HOURSSS doing this for 25 items and literally got one response asking if an item was still available.
*There unfortunately is just no audience on here. It’s full of people wanting to sell things but no buyers. I mean NONE. You can see how many times an item has been viewed. Some of my items- new with tags popular name brand clothing- have never even been viewed!!! 
*Stick with Facebook Marketplace if you wan to actually sell something!!! If you want to was time out of your life, get OfferUp. 🤦🏼‍♀️",1
2231,"Not too happy with it: I used letgo a lot before this new update to offerup/let go. Letgo was a lot more user friendly and once it was updated I lost all my messages and stuff I had posted. Also, my main complain is offer up has a lot of adds for products that take you to fraudulent websites. I like to buy my power tools on line and have noticed a lot of posts to websites that offer deals too good to be true, in fact after doing a lot of research and reading reviews, a lot of these sites offer good prices but your items never get delivered. Just wish this app could monitor this closer.",3
2232,"Like to buy from here but I’m not seeing my “for sale” posts: So I’ve bought quite a bit on here before and have always been happy with it but now I’m trying to sell stuff and I can’t find my posts listed at all.  It’s been several days (thought it might take time to officially get posted) and I’m looking up words the titles I used, in the area I posted from and nothing.  

Also this problem doesn’t seem to be addressed in the help section so I’m hoping someone from Offer Up will reply to this comment and please help me.  We’re moving and I have a bunch of stuff to sell but I’m not going to put the time in to post it if it’s not going to show up.  

Thank you.",1
2233,"Change it back to Let Go!: I do not receive any notifications on my phone. I’m trying to sell things and I don’t get any notifications when people are sending me questions. I miss the suggested messages, such as “is this still available?” when you are contacting a buyer or seller.

The transition from Let Go to offer up was terrible. I had postings to sell items on both platforms that were lost.  Could not leave feedback for items that I sold or bought from Let Go.  All of the ratings and comments from Let Go were lost and it was like starting as new user.

So far not impressed at all with Offer Up and miss Let Go. I will be looking for other options to sell my items.",1
2234,"Horrible. I hate that we lost LetGo: When LetGo merged with OfferUp we had high hopes that it would bring more qualified buyers for our stuff but we’ve been sorely disappointed. Every single item we post gets scammers and bots that send messages of “is this available” and when you say yes, they always ask for personal information like your email or cell number and it’s just very annoying and disheartening that these accounts are allowed to exist on the platform. And don’t get me started on the number of scams and ads on the buying page. It seems like every 4th item “for sale” is a link that takes you to external sites like EBay or Wayfair. Horrible platform and im very disappointed that LetGo was bought by them.",1
2235,"Limited by WiFi requirements!  I Don’t  like the Snub to Letitgo users.: I don’t like the fact that in order to use OfferUp the user must be connected to WiFi....it’s so limiting!!!
I chose to use Letitgo because I didn’t need to be connected to WiFi. Setting up sells and searching for items in my local area was easy.  If I wanted to be involved in shipping I use EBay!  I am very disappointed also in the loss of my posted items and having to reset things up!! This is a real pain!! I’m frustrated by this process.  The merger or acquisition is great for OfferUp & Letitgo as companies but not all users are pleased with the dismissal of what users find beneficial on each platform.  Needing WiFi is so limiting to users who sell on the go or not from home!",1
2236,Favorite: My favorite APP and it always will be. on my account that needed to be cleared up and so it was and now I’m very happy to be able to use my account again and be able to keep making money from using it everyday. I’m very happy with the support team as they did a tremendous job dealing with my account issues and solving all of my problems I was having with my account. I give this APP a solid 5 Stars because they went above and beyond to help me. Thanks again Offer Up!,5
2237,My opinion: I used to love offer up but I do not like the fact that they allow retailers on the site since most people looking here do not want to pay retail or they wouldn’t be on this site. Also I don’t like my viewing being tracked since it keeps new items that post Fromm being at the top of the viewing when I want to see what’s new. I don’t feel my viewing should be arranged according to what I looked for in the past unless I set alerts for that item. These changes have kept me from looking at your site and I used to look everyday n purchased many things on this site.,3
2238,"Great for seller just okay for buyers: I really like the concept, and if folks are using this instead of Craigslist it’s nice to be on both platforms. 
Both of which are basically free and I love that. 

As a buyer I find that the way items are shown doesn’t make much sense, I have to click on a picture of a laptop to see the price and that laptop looks exactly the same as the one with more RAM, for example. It’s pretty annoying and time consuming. 
Putting a price and short title would be awesome! Especially if your buying or selling items that look so similar but vary greatly in the details. Thanks!",3
2239,"Fees Stink, Otherwise Great: This marketplace is a great resource for finding and selling all kinds of items locally as well as regionally or statewide. When it comes to shipping nationwide, it gets more iffy with security, and the fees are extremely high, and KEEP BEING RAISED! Just put up to at least 9.9% as of my last shipment out July 2019...
Otherwise, OfferUp is true to its name in the sense that you or anyone else can offer things up to a large user base, target localized buyers, and have some fun doing so and meeting new people to entrepreneur with.",5
2240,"Best App to Sell or Buy Items: OfferUp is hands down the best App to buy or sell used or new goods. It’s very user friendly and has a great rating system for particular users. I have had major success with OfferUp in selling a large array of products. The best alternative to Craigslist, as I don’t feel very safe with Craigslist anymore due to scammers and bots. OfferUp makes it very simple. Take a pic, write a description, set price and location and that’s it! Very satisfied with this app. Wish it had been around sooner!",5
2241,Annoying questions!!!!: People that shop around just to see what they can ask!!! So annoying people should be blocked after so many times asking is it available and then never reply again. Just like it adds alert when people ask for an address and sends you to location. Gets frustrating to get questioned and they really don’t want it at all. Just wanna ask stupid questions! Not always the easiest sells!!! People normally sale things because they might need money or because they trade not needed things for the new needed!!! Stop with the ridiculous questions!,3
2242,"Needs some work: This app could be a lot better but they have some work to do. First of all, they nickel and dime you for everything. You want to “promote” your item? (Bump it up so more people see it). It’ll cost you at least $2.99. If a buyer asks you to hold the item with their cashless payment system, OfferUp keeps a portion of the sale price. How is that an incentive to use this “feature”?  It’s not. Other sales apps are more user doesn’t and don’t charge you for everything. You can’t even delete an item once it’s listed, you can only archive it. This app could be a lot better but right now I think there are a lot of improvements to be made.",2
2243,“TruYou” verifications fraud: Offer up claims it’s free but actually after using the app for awhile they demand your phone number and government issued ID.  They do this so they can sell your information to telemarketing company’s for solid leads.  That is how they profit secretly on your behalf whiling claiming it’s for “safety reason” which is a small fraction of the excuse.  People still get scammed regardless and it’s not like offerup takes the scammers to small claims court or refund you on behalf of you nor share the scammers information with you.  The only thing you will get from them is “they are TruYou verified” but you cannot obtain the sellers/buyers real name and phone number prior to meeting up for a “safe” transaction which makes this service pointless to the end-user.,1
2244,"Pretty good but could be great: I give 3 stars because you have to archive everything instead of deleting it.  I don’t want a constant reminder of tons of low ball offers or people chatting me up just because they are selling something similar or whatever. There also needs to be a way to read reviews of others and write feedback more. I hate when people just become non responsive, stand you up, or say messed up things.  As of now all you can do is rate a person after they mark it sold and you bought it.  But what about all the other variables? Please think about it OfferUp!",3
2245,I don’t like the new update.: I love OfferUp. I have been an OfferUp shopper for the past two years and since then they keep doing new things to it. Don’t fix what’s not broke! Before you were able to just go to the top left corner to go to categories but now if you’re scrolling through everything then decide you want a specific category you have to scroll all the way back to the top for that option. That’s the only thing that’s driving me crazy right now. Besides that I will continue to shop OfferUp just fix that dang it. Lol,4
2246,"FantAPPstick: Offerup gives a seller and buyer more than just a product, it provides a sense of community. The interface is so simple to use you'll be putting cash in your pocket in no time. The TruYou feature serves as a safety feature to buyers allowing them to see that there's a real person on the other side of the transaction and not just a bot. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is trying to clear up some space in your home or even to sell as a means of extra income.",5
2247,"Great way to sell your unwanted stuff: I really love this site. I recently moved and was fortunate enough to buy all new furniture but had a house full of stuff that I now had no room for. I was able to sell almost everything that I didn’t want through this site and another site. My only complaint is that there are bored people out there that literally enjoy messing with people. Pretending they are interested to string you along but really have no intention of buying anything. Which is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, I give it a 👍.",4
2248,Love this offer up: I like having a OfferUp to sell stuff and to purchase whether it’s new or used This is a great format to get rid of stuff that you no longer need or want to sell. I would highly recommend this and if you’re a woman you can meet wherever you want if you’re scared or nervous you can meet at a police station or wherever you feel safe plus the people are rated as well so you can count on being safe.,5
2249,"Ads make app unusable: I understand that they are trying to make money, but i get full screen ads every three listings i look at. This is just abusive at this point and makes the app impossible to use. 8 dollars a month is WAY too expensive for just trying to see what is available when barely even bought anything. 

This app is in trouble of it requires this much abusive advertising and to charge such an exorbitant amount of money to ignore them.

Good by OfferUp. You used to be good and now you are unusable. I am deleting this garbage app for good, and I recommend everyone else does for this company to learn they cant so this and expect people to stick around.",1
2250,"Do not attempt the Free Trail!!!!: Don’t do the 3 day free promotion plus trail period!!! It will say you can cancel anytime before the 3 days but will continue to change you for the monthly subscription even if you’re not using the service. It’s no way to change or remove your bank card from the account even if you go through apple services it will not allow you to update you info, only prompts you to renew the subscription. Again don’t do the free trial, unless you want to be stuck paying for something monthly your mot even using. Also even through it being charge for this monthly system isn’t allowing me to utilize the product, it bogus.",1
2251,"Profile lost: I loved using this app to sell and buy. Recently I got a new phone. I switched all my apps over and when I logged in to the app again I lost all my items I was selling on here. I still receive emails  from my profile but unable  to receive messages and respond back to those for some strange reason. I contacted OfferUp and they reset my profile but still unable to retrieve my stuff. Since then, I’ve been very disappointed that my profile items were lost and cannot be recovered. I’m hesitant to put items back on because what if it’s lost again. So know I just browse",2
2252,"My account: I have been using offer up for 8 years. Last year I saw some shoes on here and sent the person my offer. I’m return they tried to solicit sex. I was very upset and asked the person to stop contacting me next thing I know my page was taken away because the disgusting individual reported me. Why would you take my page and block me and they are the ones soliciting sec on your platform. Offer has become a unfair app, and I’m very disappointed because this was a great a platform. You guys definitely let the scammers and bad ppl take over. I use fb market place now and they protect the consumers and investigate everything thoroughly unlike offer up.",1
2253,"Great app but is missing: Great way to resell and buy items. However, sometimes I need to ask sellers for more pictures or proof of purchase for certain items and the only flaw is that you can’t send pictures through the chat. Offerup suggests to not share personal information but I would have to share my personal contact information for this reason and sometimes that can be sketchy. Wishing that was a function accessible directly though Offerup chat.",4
2254,"Merge was a bust!: I’m not going to repeat all the same complaints everyone else has but they are all true. Lost a good app and got stuck with an inferior app. Scam bots come through the back end of this app soliciting personal information. That is either on purpose or tells you how secure this app is. There is no way within 30 seconds of posting that I get a message soliciting personal information without it proving this theory. My listing doesn’t show for many minutes to the public yet instantly get messages asking for my number. Extremely sketchy app. 
  This app is basically dead and is nothing more than a source of ad revenue. One of the worst sales apps I’ve ever seen.",1
2255,"Confused? Ripped off?: I had a king bed frame I was selling, had pictures, descriptions and everything for it and it was submitted and up for sell with an additional paid promotion, I close the app hoping for some results, the last time I checked I had 17 views but after that, I opened the app up and my bed frame post was gone, so I go try to repost it and all of my pictures are removed, can you guys explain that? For a bed frame just to be removed out of the blue? Now I had things. I was going to pay for with that money but for it to take my paid promotion and my post and remove it without my knowledge? How strange. I’m gonna need my promo money back as well as answers :)",1
2256,"Disgusting App: I have never ever seen an App this horrible, I have my account for over 2 years, I have over 20x 5 Star Reviews, lots of purchases, verified with my documents and even with that being said, they disable my account every time I offer more than $500 to any seller, this is pathetic. I lost thousands worth of purchases because they just cancel my transaction and the sellers think I’m trying to scam them. But of course, OfferUp always charges you the money first, then they go and cancel the transaction after a lot of hours and block your account, WORST app of all, don’t waste your time, I can’t wait to file a class action lawsuit against this disgusting app.",1
2257,"Ad pop please stop: This new update ad that suddenly makes the ad pop is just horrible, especially if it doesn’t show where to uncheck to exit the the ad, that it takes over the entire screen. I get offer up you need ads for revenue but don’t block the entire screen, instead use half the phones screen. This way the user doesn’t think that a virus took over your phones screen. Best thing to do is exit the app and start over again, not good.",4
2258,"OfferUp allows counterfeit sales: The app is great. Easy to use. The 2 stars come from the company’s willingness to host fraudulent sellers and their refusal to do anything about it. For months I attempted to have them ban a seller who sold counterfeit Apple airpods (I bought them). I sent them a proof from Apple that said the products were counterfeit. They never, not once, even acknowledged it. I tried reaching out to them even through Twitter. Nothing. The person continued selling the airpods for months. Eventually I gave up. In other words, I would never buy anything through them that’s not local. I can meet locally and pay directly.",2
2259,"No help From offer up customer support.: I shipped an item with the mailing receipt they provided me and after a week of it mailed through USPS in the designated time they gave me. I have not been paid by the person who bought it (they ignored me) and then OfferUp has given me no support. I provided them A shipping receipt, screenshots of messages confirming they received it. 
I am not getting paid and my item was given away for free. I don’t know what to do now since they just told me to “contact the buyer nicely” to get them to pay me. Until this gets resolved….I am telling people to NEVER ship an item on OfferUp ever again and will post it everywhere I am able so people aren’t scammed",1

2261,"Good selling site but ALWAYS be wary..: Sold a few items and went great, though one time selling my switch i agreed to receive half of the money we agreed on and i’ve not receive the rest but that is of my own fault, but you must ALWAYS ship through the app when selling, ALWAYS choose a public spot to meet during morning, and before anything ALWAYS make sure you receive full payment of what you’re selling unlike me..",5
2262,"Too many mind games: Its a great app but ever since I’ve had it I only made one sale. I plan to give it another go but what bothers me soo much is I don’t know if it’s people or bots. They will send extremely low offers and if I accept no response just read or sometimes never opened.

If someone ask if this is still available then I answer multiple questions eventually they will say they’re interested then when it comes time they never respond or leave on read.

Im not saying once or twice cause that would be petty but im talking weeks in a row it’s either they want it or not cant gather and run across the city for nothing especially with gas.

So I don’t know if those are bots or people who wanna waste time but if they are bots then I highly appreciate it being taken care of especially cause most have no profile picture. 

On the other hand great app soon as there are improvements without a doubt I’ll be adding three extra stars.

Thanks,",2

I was asked to provide my first and last name, my address and also my Social Security number.

2264,"Offer up a great place to turn your unused item into Cash: Ever since I discovered Offer Up I have made room in my garage by posting for sale items and in turn making extra money , it has been a great source to put items I or my family is no longer are  using and giving a second life to the items , I m very greatful to be part of this community . Offer up a great place to turn your clutter  into cash !!",5
2265,nice idea - corporate execution: this app sells your search data to the likes of meta/facebook. i know because my searches on it end up as product ads on my social feeds. offerup monitors your messages between users and gives you warnings or flat out scrubs any attempts at sharing a phone number with a buyer or seller. adverts and online sales are mixed in with relevant local search results (many of which are years old!!). offerup does not give you granular control of notifications- so if you don’t want to miss buyer/seller communications- it means you also get sucked into the app when ‘items you may be interested in’ become available.  i’m convinced reply-rates are super low/slow because no one has notifications turned on (mentioned above). the warnings about sharing phone# or even bringing up venmo for as a payment option in a message to a buyer/seller creates a fear atmosphere rather than community. pictures don’t zoom well. craigslist is better.,2
2266,"Unhappy customer: OfferUp was a great source to buy and sell once upon a time. I don’t believe OfferUp does it’s due diligence to  screen vendors prior to allowing them to post on their website. I relied on the fact that if they were linked with OfferUp that I wouldn’t need to worry about providing sensitive information. I ended up purchasing an item from hackers with a false item to not only steal my credit card information but continue receiving hundreds of phishing emails daily. I trusted OfferUp and trusted that vendors they allow on their website would be screened for these types of situations (and I’m not referring to the people that post items individually). Either way, Very unhappy…",1
2267,Good app: I’ve been a verified member of OfferUp for a few years and I can say that the app has come a long ways from its early days. I have brought and sold many items here with little to no problems. The only issue these days are the spam posts that seems to plague the site. There should be a quicker way to flag them. Other than that it’s a good site to find useful items at a fraction of the price. Well sometimes anyway lol,5
2268,"A few glaring issues ruin an otherwise cool app: 1) Messages with suggested posts are 99% completely wrong about what I want to look at and aren’t how I want to get this information, so they just make me keep push notifications for messages off, which ruins a feature I would like to use when I’m actually messaging with sellers or buyers. Please remove this feature or make it optional.

2) Retailer and spam posts are repetitive and excessive and make the app way less fun and interesting to use. Please restrict these types of posts.

These two issues seriously affect both of the core functions of the app.",2
2269,Frustrated: I’ve bought and sold many things from offer up. One thing I disagree with is when someone doesn’t reply back and wants you to send an email instead. I’ve tried it once when I wanted to buy a motorcycle the response I got back was…. A car being sold for desperate needs or whatever the case may be. Don’t send emails to those offers they’re pretty much fake accounts. That’s my opinion.,5
2270,"“No Reply” Results: I agree with another reviewer who said this concept is good; however if sellers fail to reply even when specifically asked to do so, it makes me look to other online programs which require more accountability.  I have wasted time using Offerup since no one has bothered to reply.  If item is no longer available the seller should be required to remove the posting.  This system is not allowing me to post a 1-star review so I changed it to 2 stars, then to 3 stars just to get this posted after trying many unique nicknames.",3
2271,"Could be great but the way listings are done leaves room for improvement: Have used the app a lot over the years and there are some glaringly obvious problems. 

Listings that offer shipping automatically relist if seller doesn’t ship item, doesn’t communicate, etc. 

Listings that are technically inactive either from users no longer on the app, no longer in the area where item was listed, non responsive, items being listed for years, etc. leads to a huge waste of time trying to find specific items.

Search terms leave room for improvement. Items don’t come up using certain word terms but come up on others. 

Requiring sellers to periodically validate that item is still available and active. Removing old listings or expired accounts that have not been active will get rid of the junk postings, help eliminate OfferUp having to refund items that are never shipped, etc.",3
2272,"Locations are frequently off: The “LetGo” app allowed me to pick my location. This allowed me to choose where I would meet. Like a county park or store parking lot that had people around to improve safety.

Also, I found the search options in LetGo were also better to filter out unwanted items by price or location.

I will continue to sell my items on OfferUp and look for good deals for things I need.  The more we can recycle and reuse, the less the land fills will grow and the cleaner the oceans will be.",4
2273,"Never get responses: I’ve been using this app for almost 3-4 years now and it’s always worked perfectly fine, however I lost access to my account and made a new one and I have yet to this day received a response from a single person on this app for the last year, I’ve made multiple accounts even my girlfriends account and not a single response, been looking urgently to secure items for great prices but things just don’t work like they used to, Also wanted to point out CUSTOMER SERVICE is none existent, so if you are hoping to get any help for any reason at all, give up, they have never helped me with a single problem, just get on Mercari or eBay 🤷🏽‍♂️",1
2274,"Bring back landscape mode on iPads: I’m a long time OfferUp user, this app makes it easy to buy and sell items, review the seller or buyer’s ratings and facilitate transactions that are protected from fraud. 

As much as I love this app, the most recent app upgrade has eliminated landscape mode on the iPad. This is a HUGE inconvenience as it requires that you hold the iPad in portrait mode. Most iPad cases allow for the iPad to stay upright while in landscape mode and having to pick up the iPad every time to navigate posts is not convenient, hurts the user experience and makes it less fun to search for product! 

PLEASE BRING BACK LANDSCAPE MODE!",3
2275,"Don’t need this, but I do: I really don’t need another application on my phone to use the offer up service. I think it’s really lame that you can go onto a desktop version and buy stuff in browse everything but you can’t sell anything they’re just so they can force you to download their app. I don’t ever recall downloading craigslist but we used it all the time when it was popular. They really need to stop forcing us to download the app. I’m just going to sell my item and delete the stupid app anyways. Most the time I use offer up to buy stuff and I never would use an app for that. I would go to the desktop version for bigger images, more images on one page, and easier use",1
2276,"BANNED FOR LIFE: You guys IP banned me and when I contacted support you said I broke community guidelines. It’s the same automated message because when I messaged back on what I broke and what can be done to fix it, you guys send the same message that I broke the rules. There’s no warning to what you break and no way to use the app once you’re banned FYI. Worst selling app there is and the worst customer service I have ever had. You’d think with one of the biggest selling platforms that atleast they’d have good customer service but nope, garbage. I’m surprised people still use this app honestly. Only way to get unbanned I guess is to message one of those computer hackers or get a new phone number and phone and carrier which is just wrong.",1
2277,Terrible customer service and never got paid for sale: Anyone new to this app needs to be careful there is no customer service at all with this app and if there is they don’t care about your issues enough to contact you. I made a sale on here and in the middle of the transaction it was cancelled AFTER I shipped the product so needless to say I didn’t get paid for what I sold. Even though the buyer received the product . I tried to contact customer service and all I got back was an automated response.  It’s impossible to get any help from this app.  They claim to back your sales but they don’t they won’t even contact u back. So you’re on your own with this app. Gets lost in the mail oh well NO ONE HERE CARES,1
2278,"Recent update has ruined the app: I have been a user since March 2015, and use the app multiple (sometimes way too many) times per week. This new update seems terrible so far. It runs much slower. Messages are not showing up. For a current item I have messaged the seller about and made an offer, it does not show up in messages. I have to search for the item again and click Ask to see those messages. 
As others have said the lines between ads and local items has been blurred even further. 
Reverting back to what worked well for years with minor tweaks make more sense then this overhaul that runs poorly.",2
2279,"Cars and Trucks update needed!!: Hopefully the developers will read this and take serious note. I’m a private person looking to find a car private party which is extremely hard on this site. There are plenty of people that post their cars on here that don’t work at a dealership but impossible to find them since dealerships spam it. There needs to be a filter to sort all of them out. Also with their new update, it needs a tile filter as well. They been import ing their app but barely have any features that really stand out. If I wanted a vehicle from a dealership I wouldn’t go on this app. There are plenty of others. Please add a filter for private sales and title status. I love this app but help the real people out there.",1
2280,"No notifications and number badge on app: App is very good and handy to have when selling stuffs but I have a down side on it. 

So ever since I installed this app I have never received a message notification from other members. Also the number of notifications on the app do not show. I have uninstalled it and turn off and on notifications but it seems not to make a difference. This is an ongoing problem and I would like for it to get fix. My current iPhone is a 6s.",5
2281,"Almost perfect but annoying flaws: The search by location is still doesn’t work well (it doesn’t arrange them by distance going outward. It seems random) and it never saves my search radius either. Also, please add a a way to HIDE listings. I see the same listings so many times and sometimes lose track of which ones I reached out to already and often see things I know I don’t want to see each time I search. It would really help narrow results down when searching for exactly what you want. Fox and add that stuff and you’ve got a pretty flawless app. :) Keep up the good work.",3
2282,"Got ripped off by this app: Users be warned, it is a good site if you do all selling/purchasing in person. Had good luck with a few transactions, but tried to do the shipping thing, got the shipping label from this app, put the item in the mail the next morning. The package was never checked in by the post office, but it somehow got shipped out to the buyer. It was received and I never got paid. I am now out $200. I tried to contact the buyer to try to get paid and he won’t respond to me. OfferUp says it is not there problem and they are going to delete my account for trying to get my payment. I guess it is my fault for not making sure it was checked in at the post office.",1
2283,Meh: I kinda liked letgo better. I get this one has shipping which I will never use( I only want local stuff and only cash purchases) I suppose it is a good platform. But NONE of my Listings from letgo transferred over! Really annoying. Also not all seller’s have a drivers license you know? So u should be able to get enough pints for a verification score just like letgo! Also u need a way to include a bio. Meh meh I will have to get used to it. But it seems like things on letgo sold faster and there where more people and less bots. I have posted only a few things and a ton of bots have come through already.,3
2284,Great selling app: I’ve used OfferUp for quite sometime and I absolutely love it . There are a few ppl that flake but that is in no way the Apps fault . I had a suggestion for the app. If you could add the ability to make it possible to write a little “about me” in our profile that would make me love the app even more . We would be able to write down our availability / where we live / if we are able to meet in some other city where we work for example etc etc . But overall I love the app and I love the not so knew shipping option .,4
2285,Won’t let me accept offers >:(: Hi offerup glitches a lot. I have a special place for this app because it is the first platform I sold something online. But lately there’s been a lot of performance issues — issues affecting you and me. You won’t get the 20% service fee from me if I cannot make money if the app automatically rejects an offer due to poor performance issues. Other than that I love selling on this app because of the nationwide shipping and selling local. Just the performance issues become annoying and upsetting. I’ll add the two stars when the performance issues resolve.,3
2286,"Was once a good thing: The app used to be great and actually useful.  Pawn shops, furniture warehouses, and shiesty car dealerships have completely ruined this app.  Also, once you search for a bicycle, for example, that’s the majority of items that come up from then on.  You should at least give the user the option to clear cache/cookies to reset their search history.  You can still find miscellaneous items you may need, but don’t necessarily need to be new.....once you get past all of the pawn shops....who’s prices mostly match the items BRAND NEW price.  It used to be like garage sale shopping from the comfort of your home.  Can you bring that back?",2
2287,"Constant account locks: I enjoy using the app, when it works for 5 minutes. The rest of the time my account gets locked for no discernible reason. I’ve messaged OfferUp over 25 times and each time, after a few hours, they unlock it and send me an generic apology email. Unfortunately, my account locks again within minutes and the cycle repeats. Please fix my account permanently or I will have to abandon the app entirely.

Update: OfferUp replied to this review with an email to get this fixed. All they did was exactly what support did 30 times before and stopped replying. I’ve missed out on every item of interest and wasted enough time to warrant buying new instead of used. I would not recommend this app.",1
2288,"Probably the worst selling app: Would give 0 stars if I could!!

 I got messages nearly every day from creepy men asking me to send them used underwear. Had more of these types of people than any other site I’ve been on.
The actual selling process was easy and the shipping options were great!
But then I got an email saying my account had been removed because I kept posting prohibited items despite all the warnings I’d been given. I never received any said warnings so I was confused and reached out to support, but they restated the claim and said it was irreversible. Still have no idea why my account was removed.

Update: I had since made a new account since support claimed my other account couldn’t be reinstated for whatever reason. But I checked the app for my new account after having it for a month or so to find that all of my listings were gone and I couldn’t access any of my information because I needed to “log in” to view it. I was logged in. I logged out, deleted the app, re-downloaded it, logged back in and still the same issues.",1
2289,Are the Sellers Asleep on this Website?: I have tried contacting many Sellers on this website about wanting to buy their item being sold but they never respond. Yet I see their item still listed for sale month after month. I did have one Seller respond to me that the item being sold was at her parents house and she would get it the following Monday then there was another excuse that her mother was sick. So I just gave up. What ever happen to the good old days when Sellers responded to inquiries about their items being sold and actually had the item they’re selling in their procession?,3

I haven't bought anything on here nor did I ever update my information on offer-up to have my bank account linked... yes i like using your services to view whats on there or try to sell an item but nor did I ever get charged for it in the past... as soon as I get my refund I will no longer be using your service and ill be closing my account so i wont be charged once more....

Within 2 days of using this app, I find the perfect rv and bought it this past weekend. Great finds, I wish there was an easier way to navigate the search by state & county instead of zip code...to really do your research you have to google search and make a list of nearby zip codes to find other offers close to you. That’s the only weak point, besides that it’s a great app + it’s FREE!",5

I’m looking around my house right now because if it’s not nailed down it might as well be cash money LOL.",5

No notification, no reasoning from them about what went wrong and what steps should i take now. I was following all the rules, posted and sold many items same way before this happened out of nowhere. I tried to contact offerup customer service, but they dont seem to be helpful, just kept sending me the same general email. Like the customer service doesnt even exist :)
Also they make it almost impossible to deactivate your account, but i will keep trying.
Worst experience with selling app.",1
2294,"Good app. Bad customer support.: The app is good when it doesn't block it's customers. Right now the app blocks all hotwire users which means I have to constantly toggle wifi in and off which is extremely unpleasant. Tried to reach their customer support and their response for the past year has been: ""we will get back to you"". This doesn't give me confidence in an application that is trying to be the next ebay. Letgo app beats their service any day...oh and it doesn't block hotwire users.",5

One of the things I constantly look for are automotive related. Such as tools, parts, and tires. Tires being the most. Before I could find a set of tires from a local seller quite easy, but now that the app has grown, local tire shops have been spamming tire sizes which make it increasingly difficult to find what I want. I go on the app because I dont want to buy from a shop. 
I wish there was some way to seperate the businesses from the private sellers.",2
2298,"Worthless Waist of Time: If you think Craigslist was terrible, well your in for a surprise this is even worse. Here’s how this works, you offer up all your personal information to this scam of a app. You better have your kidney and first born ready to hand over to them just to verify your account before you can list an item for sale. Then after you create a listing you’ll get “views” but you’ll never get an offer. Because anyone whose anyone isn’t using this joke of a app. So don’t waist your time, I unfortunately waisted mine.

2299,"waste of time: too many ads…too many notifications.   No way to opt out of usless notifications….they should only be for seller/buyer communication. many sellers will check a msg once and not again which makes negotiation impossible. getting notifications while at work, because of item recommendations, or sellers I follow, is useless. Also timed ads for products I’ll never use when browsing, and can’t back out is maddening. You should be able to X out items that are old/sold/or forgotten by sellers, like Craigslist.

I loved this for selling and now it’s just nothing like it was a few years ago. Adding the “ premium” just has made the app terrible as all they want is money from you or to sell your data for money. There is no support for creepy buyers who just will make a new account instantly if you try to report them. 

Honestly it’s a shame.",1
2302,"Unusable Platform: I have never once had a decent experience on this app. The platform is riddled with substantially more ads than real posts and 95% of the “real” posts are bots or people who can’t seem to use this app. The filtering system for searching is terrible and there is no way of setting any kind of size filter, as well as no way to see the price or title of the listing without clicking on it. On top of this, you won’t even receive messages from buyers or sellers on time without purchasing the premium membership!

I’m selling an item so I look to see what other people are selling them for, now I have a full page of an item that I DONT WANT!

The last straw was when I logged on and typing now jumps between already typed letters making it impossible to search for anything. i.e. If I type ""sheet"" it will come out ""shtet"".

Make sure to keep your notification off otherwise they will send you ads as messages from buyers/sellers. Sneaky SOB's!

Since I have been victimized by this I will be reporting these and other underhanded practices to the correct agency.

Issue : But strangely it always shows one or two push notifications , no matter how many times I turn off / uncheck all the push notifications boxes and save. Nowadays I feel like the app developers do this on purpose… i.e. they would probably send emails notifications, w/o user approval , if the regulator fines were not so cheap. Maybe they fix this “bug “ or I delete the app. 🙏

Update: Followed steps app developer responded with and did not fix the issue… still get notifications from ppl I follow and things I have searched even though all notifications are turned off.",1
2318,Customer support: I was removed from the site because I supposedly violated the rules. I placed a vehicle online to sell and I put in the description that the title was lost but would help them get another one. The next day my ad was wiped out along with the other items I was selling. I have been on this site for years buying and selling with no issues. I did not have the opportunity to explain my side and if I was trying to hide anything I would not have put it in the advertising. I cannot get in contact with anyone from offer up because it is one dead end after another. I used to enjoy this site but it has become worse over time,1
2319,"Impossible to work with: I have been on offerup for 8 years now. About once a year they ban my account for no apparent reason. I had 113 reviews with a 4.5 star rating. I looked into this issues and it seems 1000s of sellers are experiencing the same issue. Out of the blue your account will no longer get any views or interactions. They ban you with no explanation!!!!! It’s been years like this and you would think overtime they would fix this repeating issue. Banning good fair sellers without any warning or explanation is not fair at all when you look at how many spam/scam accounts there are on this app. Disappointing, sad, unfair, and rude!!!! Do better offerup you were so good at one time",1
2320,This is a tool and ur own business: This is amazing tool / App just to have on you laptop tablet and phone . Easy to make a quick buck and it easy to sell thing  plus plus it’s easy over all.  It also teach you how to sell item/stuff and how to promote .. BetterYou explain something to clear the picture for the items  your selling . You grab the peoples attention and the faster it go. Now get to make yourself some cash …!!,5
2321,"THE WORST RESELLING APP: I sell/buy on dozens of sites, and this one has to be by far the worst one. Little to no customer support, scam and illegal goods all over the site, and once you run into an issue (i.e. receiving damaged goods like I did or my girlfriends getting scammed out of $500) good luck trying to get any help from their support. Not only that, but they are extremely aggressive if you try to fix the issue, they eventually corner you into a wall and tell you to screw off. Mercari, eBay, heck even Facebook Marketplace are much better than this. I guess this is what happens when you lack a support team, nothing but failures and ending up like  Craigslist. Don’t even bother with these people.",1
2322,"They stopped listing my products for no reason: For some reason they stopped listing my products to the point where I could search them up and everyone else’s product shows up but mine. I first noticed this when I payed for promotion but they still kept it from the public and kept the money, I highly doubt that they care so don’t expect them to. As long as they are getting rich, they don’t care. I told them so many times about this. My HP laptop has had 1 view for the entire month now and I can’t find it when I search it up so I can see why it only has one view. I had to get low balled at a pawn shop that has no respect for people",1
2323,Forget this app: I used to love offerup I would use it daily to buy and sell all the time my account had 100+ 5 start reviews I also spend money to promote multiple of my adds as well I had a monthly subscription with them at 20$ a month to sell my stuff and for some reason they blocked me from my account and this it the second time they did this to me the first time I had to get a new phone with a new number to get the app again and at this point I’m done giving my money to this app. I try to contact them and I haven’t heard back idk what I did wrong but I can’t get it this issue resolved so I want to say one think to offerup and it’s creators F you!!!,1
2324,"Great app, one thing with my experience though..: This app is easy and simple to use of course, but one thing that is frustrating is finding a used car. The app is littered with dealers advertising their cars, listing the down payment only, as well as accounts with no history trying to steer you to an email only scam with a absurdly under priced car. I feel like a sale by owner, or sale by dealer filter option is needed.",5
2325,"Offer up review: I’ve had some items on offer up for a couple weeks. 
I’m selling Designer Clothing that’s good quality and some homeschooling items that were pretty expensive when I purchased. So far not much has sold. The shipping is substantial and you have to ask yourself if you want to reduce your asking price to cover it. Meeting up with people can be a little troublesome. 
I noticed there are posted items that have been there for years. 
So far it’s been an ok experience. There are things you can learn about pricing etc.",3
2326,"Scam central: This app is a hot bed for scams. It’s exactly like Craig’s list or old eBay. 
This is somewhat expected, and customers should be careful. Why I rate offer up so low is their inactivity when a post is reported to be a scam. 
I had several posters try to scam me. So I reported them as actually trying to scam me. Offer up did nothing. I’d get an auto response and nothing more. They wouldn’t even take the scammers posts down. 
I won’t use offer up anymore. I have had good experiences in it, but more bad. It’s really they state if people these days more than the app. But the app needs to do an ethical part of prevention or they just offer a means for dishonest people to take advantage of others.",1
2327,"Not safe for women: The app is dangerous for women. We get disgusting harassment, but also have to suss out whether that man who wants to buy something is actually trying to trick us into meeting him, find out where we live, etc etc. I am afraid of selling anything on the app because they do NOTHING to remove the men who behave like this. 

I’ve contacted OfferUp’s customer service department, sent them screenshots of sexual and harassing messages, reported profiles over and over… Nothing. They do absolutely nothing about the men who harass women on their platform. It’s not possible to be visibly female on OfferUp without harassment, and since this app LEADS TO PEOPLE MEETING IN PERSON, it’s not just about the gross messages, it’s about safety.",1
2328,"Love the App but needs improvement: The app is great, but what I don’t like is the fact that there are so many old posts. Posts that range from 1 year to 3 years old. That’s unheard of. Posts should expire in 30 days. I have contacted some users trying to buy some items but they are not responding due mainly because the ad is over a year old. Perhaps the developers will fix that in the next update. 🙏🙏

Also when searching items within an specific mile range (pickup only), I see items from thousands of miles away.",3
2329,"Sudden requirement of TruYou ruins the app for me: I have bought and sold many items over the years with OfferUp, but as of about a week ago, I can’t send or reply to any messages. I tried contacting support and they said I need to upload my ID to TruYou. Why is this a requirement? No other selling site requires this, and I’m not interested in giving my information away to a third party unnecessarily. I have about 80 reviews on my account (all five stars) and now this app is rendered useless. It was great while it lasted, I was able to sell things with ease and find many great deals. Please remove this new requirement, especially for accounts with loads of confirmed transactions.",1
2330,"Offer up + let go garbage: Long time user of offer up as a seller and buyer , this site went to crap after merging with let go , always the same items at the top of the page day after day and all the let go flakes are now on offer up , never used let go because non responses and shady people . I used to find great deals as well as give good deals on offer up but I will try to avoid using anymore .",5
2331,"What happened to offerup ?: I’m not sure what’s going on I usually get 4 to 5 inquiries on stuff I sell no clue why  I haven’t got one since over a week  I’m hoping it’s not because they’ve merged with let go  but something isn’t right I haven’t got one message in over a week . I’ve logged out , I downloaded the latest version I  the whole nine yards  hoping it isn’t a glitch or something  I enjoy using offerup to suppliment my income and it had been really good to me up until now .",5
2332,"Better to use eBay or an irl yard sale: Download this app if you’re looking for a marketplace where people try to sell their dirty, used crap for more than retail. Then when you list your own used crap for below what it’s worth, the only messages you get are creeps who want your information and the occasional person who didn’t read the description. You’ll get views on your listings for literally 15 minutes after posting, and no one will every click on them again no matter how much you lower the price or update with more info. Complete waste of time. eBay might be a rip off, but at least you can sell and buy things for the correct price.",1
2333,"Terrible shipping fees: I've been on offer up for about five years now, and I have always just used it to meet up for smaller things. Recently, however, I decided on selling a computer part for several hundred and decided I would ship it since the safe anyway it sold. It came with a hefty fee of over 12% for me and a cut from the buyer ($58 and $45) much higher than it was not long ago and much higher than pretty much any other app and to make matters worse, even though the item shipped a day after the purchase, I won't get my money for almost two weeks absolutely terrible. I definitely don’t recommend it just use eBay.",2
2334,"Navigating not convenient: I like the service but navigating the app is a bit of a hassle.  You create a listing from your laptop (have to use the app on your phone), you can’t upload pictures from your phones photo album (you have to take pictures as your create your posting), you can’t tell how the app is going to crop your photo pics are often cut off once you view them after posting and you have to start the entire process all over again), and you aren’t able to reorder your photo (so again, restart the photo taking and upload process all over again... and again if the app crops your Pictor incorrectly.",2
2335,"BAD APP NOW GREATER IN THE PAST: I have trouble uploading ,people stopped replying ,I tried deleting account to sign up again with my same email I can’t even log in the site to delete my account? You get many updates and none of them solved the issue I disconnected WiFi got a new phone (no I didn’t get a new phone for just the issue I just wanted to upgrade)and it still didn’t resolve the issue I tried contacting for support and it doesn’t let me log in so I’m stuck in a big loop go back to the old days where this Great where scammers weren’t even a thing in the past on this app now it’s like super crazy with scams.0 stars as of September 2020 but if you back to 2017 or 2018 I’d give it a full blown 5 stars",1
2336,"Hoarders welcome: This site. Has allowed me sell off many of my Grannies Treasures . It’s so easy I just upload the items and keep my ears open for that CHACHING notice and I have a sale.....Beware of crazies though, they’re out there , offer up allows me to choose my meeting spot and always sends me warnings when I’m doing things unsafe such as giving out my personal phone number...plus you can block someone if they’re being rude or inappropriate. Good luck and thank you offer up platform",5
2337,"The letgo merge: The reason I downloaded letgo was because the app was al around superior and more suited for what I was looking to buy. After re-downloading the app I can admit it’s not bad and it gets the job done, that is all I can say in support of this app. The format of this app lacked the simplicity letgo had and for some reason no matter what I search items unrelated to the seat will appear. Also not really a problem with the app but more of a problem for me was that there was not enough diversity? If I searched for a car in my area most of the cars would be from the same dealer, but like I said that’s not really the apps problem and that’s what Autotrader and CarGurus are for.",2
2338,"Just deleted it: I was using Letgo until they were acquired by this horrible app. You can not filter automobiles by dealer or private person. So I have to look at ridiculously low priced vehicles that are not really for sale at the low low prices they advertise. There is no way to distinguish who is dealer or private sale. Using this app to look for an automobile is worthless. Unfortunately, this is what the world has come to. Apps that have no moderation for ads. Ads that have been in this app for months and not removed (one ad was in here for two years, is the car still for sale? Is anyone looking at the ads in support?) It was fun using Letgo while it lasted. Bye.",2
2339,Feed: OfferUp should put in a disabling feature for accounts that are fake and scams. For example if you look up a MacBook Pro 10/15 Mac listed will have the same disc rip toon and different accounts something along the lines of wanting to give the Mac out for free just because it’s one they don’t use or their daughter is graduating or etc. but they always end in give me a reason why you need the laptop and they will give it to you. Obviously all scams but they consume the feed of the actual real stuff and over the past 3 years of using offer up it has gotten progressively worse.,3
2340,"Great app! Just be aware of scammers.: I’m not here to bust this app for anything wrong. It has never given me problems over the years that I’ve been issuing it. Just saying if you are using and or about to get this app, there is a bunch of scammers going around. They usually say “ I’m out of town and need to ship it to my daughter” their location is usually out of state from where you are and the account was only created within this year. Hope this helps someone.",5
2341,To many old posts!: This is a good user friendly app. The only problem is that there are too many old posts (6mo-2yrs old) most are no longer available and people who post them don’t mark them as sold. This makes it difficult to weed out what’s available and what’s not available anymore. Offer up should put time limits on posts and make users update the selling status in a certain amount of time. If the user fails to update in the allotted time the item or items should be deleted by default . This will keep the app cleaner and less cluttered with old posts.,3
2342,"Sketchy Business: I used OfferUp SEVERAL years ago and never sold an item.  I deleted my account and yet I repeatedly over the last two years have gotten random emails saying someone in another state has logged into my account (that again, I deactivated).  The latest one whoever logged into my account changed my email so I can’t even go in to delete it (AGAIN).  I contacted OfferUp and they say the emails are sent in error??? Yet today, I received another email from them saying suspicious activity has been reported on my “account.”  Do not use this if you don’t want to get hacked.  Luckily, I’ve never put any personal info on my account so whoever is hacking it can’t get much out of it but still, super sketchy app.",1
2343,"Exceptional quality, great communication: I have bought some exceptional items on Offer Up.  The quality of furniture, clothing/shoes, and antiques is much better than Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.  The internal communication, with options for texts and email communication, creates good flow between seller and buyer.  I love the follow up opportunities to rate the overall experience, as well.  The site is user friendly, too!  This is my favorite online buying option for quality, next owner items.",5
2344,"Great App, Too Many Store Sellers: Great app. Much better than using Craigslist and fewer scammers! Have only come across one so far and was easily able to report and block them. Love that everything is done in the app. 

There are, however, when looking at furniture, far too many brick and mortar stores posting their band new store items. They’re basically using this as their website to sell their furniture. It’s hard to tell until you get in the post and see and the search is flooded with them. I think most people on here are looking for items from sellers that aren’t a business.",3
2345,"I 🧡this app: Ever since I joined this app Feb 2016, I have purchased and sold over 100 stuffs.  I liked this app compare  to others because it’s easier to post and communicate. Others like Craigslist it’s hard when the seller only provide email and no contact#, no ratings of the seller, not much info at all that u can’t really trust. OfferUp is the best and I’m glad to find out about it from a friend. I don’t have to shop and sell my items to a rip off retail stores anymore. I give it a 5⭐️’s",5
2346,"Awesome app, but service fee is too high: I've been using OfferUp for about 5 months now and I've been able to get the things I need fairly quickly for a great price. But when I began selling some of my items on OfferUp, including shipping, the service fee was rediculous. It charged a nearly 10% service fee which was absolutely rediculous. I could of sold this through eBay for a much smaller service fee. I could have even sold through the Facebook Marketplace for no service fee at all or even Craigslist. I do not plan to sell through OfferUp anytime soln.

This app is awesome until you hit the servicee fee.",3
2347,"Cash less payments NO THANK YOU! Bye OfferUp: So I’m reading with the new “UPDATE” this app will go cashless. No thank you. I am a seller and do cash and carry. People are welcomed to inspect items and check them out before handing me the money. If this app takes away the option of cash in hand at time of purchase I will delete the app and not look back. Another “sales app” did the same and I quit using it. 
Cashless payments open up the ability of severe fraud against sellers and I will not be screwed over by a false “claim” when someone has my item and my money is withheld or taken back.. 

The developer really needs to reconsider and if they don’t think very hard about this then they should be ready to loose a lot of sellers.",1
2348,"Serves its purpose: The app is easy to use and the chat function works well, seems to update in real time. I also like the function that tells you the number views (letgo doesn’t offer that). Now what I don’t like is that when people rate you, you don’t get feedback. After one sale that seemed to go well, I received a bad review and don’t know what the issue was but it’ll be an uphill climb to offset the one negative review and I don’t know what to improve on to avoid it down the road. Overall so far so good, aside from the lack of feedback.",4
2349,Disappointed! Loyal customer: I’ve been using this app for a few months now. In the past month I’ve noticed I haven’t received any offer. I’ve also recently been looking for a car and I’ve contacted the seller but I haven’t received anything back. I came to a realization that my messages aren’t sending even though it says it they are. Also I’m not able to receive any message and buyer can’t view my offers!! I’ve missed out on so many opportunities due to this issue. It’s very frustrating I’ve been wasting my time on the app trying to contact sellers and buyer. I’ve sent an email to their team regarding this issue. I hope they can fix this ASAP so I can change my review to a 5 star! Thank you,1
2350,"Do not use the shipping option!!!: OfferUp has helped me buy and sell many items, but I will NEVER use the app to buy something being shipped ever again. The scammers and thieves have quickly learned that this is THE best place to offload stolen merchandise, because there are virtually no protections for buyers. So-called Customer Service just gives you the run around, as will the seller in the hopes that you let the 3 day window for returns lapse. 3 days?!? Even if you file a claim, you only get 3 days to reply with the requested and completely unnecessary information they want to proceed with the claim. So unless you want to buy stolen merchandise and get stuck with it when it doesn’t work, don’t buy anything being shipped on OfferUp.",1
2351,"Ads from Walmart and Kohl’s: If I wanted to shop at a box store, I would.  Every time I click on something to just view it, the home page is just riddled with ads from commercial businesses.  My mom has an old coffee grinder.  I saw one on here and opened it to just see how much it was selling for.  Now, every few photos are of new coffee pots or grinders from Walmart or a Kohl’s.  Before that, it was an Xbox 360 Guitar Hero guitar, then a crib (which I accidentally selected).  Initially, I didn’t give it much thought, but now it bugs me.  The page is cluttered enough with items to review without the ads.  It’s ridiculous!  I have the Walmart app.  If I wanted a new coffee pot, I would go there first!",2
2352,"Messaging interface needs serious reboot: Whether I am on mobile or on the desktop, my messages fail to send. The only why I can contact someone is through making an offer (which is suboptimal because I am shopping for cars so before I can make a money $$$ offer I need to actually SEE the vehicle first); furthermore, the text that I send after I make an offer never shows up in my messages and any other dialogue other than the offer does not appear. I am in serious need of a car!!! There are some great deals on this app but there is absolutely no point in having these products when you can’t even contact the sellers!!!!",2
2353,"Needs improvement: Difficult to look for items when I’m getting an advertisement every two minutes. I really do not like that. I close the app as soon as the ad starts up. I also don’t like that the app will freeze if you happen to zoom in on a photo and then switch apps. If you look at an item, answer a text, and go back to the offerup app, you have to close it out completely or hope you can exit the photo viewer so you can re-enter the zoom mode. It’s been like that for a year. Please fix it",3
2354,Posts and messages: The app was working fine for a while but then all of a sudden I posted and I noticed after three days that I didn't get any views or any messages which is strange. Then I tried to purchase things on there and nobody replied. I messaged one of my friends on there and they never received my messages so apparently either I was blocked from doing anything on there or something might be wrong with the app it's been about a week I have sent many messages with no replies. I have enjoyed the app but until now it upsets me that nobody told me that there was an issue if I've been banned or anything like that but I do recommend it I just don't agree that they don't contact you if there's an issue,1
2355,"Literally could not make a shipping purchase, falsely banned multiple times: Very disheartening and sad that i have to give a review like this but I got the app very recently too for a specific pair of shoe. Found a pair in my size and went to try and purchase it by sending an offer 

Offer was accepted by seller, and then it went under review (expected for a first purchase and also over $200)

Then out of no where , offer was cancelled and my account was banned! Emailed support and the account got unbanned pretty quickly which was good of them, and they stated they fixed the issue on my account . Went to go buy them again, and SAME thing happened.",1
2356,"Imperfect app, customer service went downhill: I’ve used the app for a few years now. But since the app added ads and merged with other platform, customer service is non existence. In the past when I contact them, I would immediately receive a response. Now, not one respond back. Maybe one automated response letting me know that it’s being looked at lol. None of my concerns have been resolved. Also the app now have so many glitches, at least with iPhone (hence my efforts to contact them about). Anyway it’s frustrating.",3
2357,"What happened?!?: The latest update is garbage. Today I can’t message anyone after they reply to my message. I’m trying to reply to somebody that I made an offer to, and I keep getting this pop-up that says whoops! My message might have violated some rule or something. It did not violate any rule. All I was trying to say is OK, no worries. Let me think about it and I will let you know. That’s exactly what I wrote. And I tried logging out and logging back in edit still happening. I sent a support request but this is time sensitive and super annoying.",3
2358,"It’s alright: I’m just going to state what I don’t like about this app. Seeing posts with free when it’s not or random numbers that aren’t the price. There maybe should be an option for people who want to just hear offers from people when they’re not sure about price yet. Also hate it when I see a post from like 3-5 yrs ago. At that point, more than likely it’s not gonna be available but the post is still up. There should be a time limit on these things to renew if still available or make them update to sold.",3
2359,"Always In Need of Refinement: My two biggest issues with this app are 1) users are often unreliable. Maybe there could be better filtering out of unreliable users, or a better rating system or something. And 2) when you sign up to receive notifications for when a given item is posted, most of the notifications you get do not even show you new posts. They just show the same list of posts you’ve seen along with a few ads. Obv OfferUp just wants people opening their app and doesn’t seem to care about the actual user experience.",2
2360,"Best app to sell your stuff: I really enjoy it! Have sold couple articles and also bought… most of the time all good.
I just consider the “sell faster” option is very expensive and you should consider a better strategy to have more adepts.
A second thing to consider as a very popular app is paying more attention in fraud detection, specially when it comes to tickets sellers. Yes, I got scammed and it is horribly frustrating :(",5
2361,"what gives?!!: They need to make a spot so you can upload a picture here. Everyone has to see this! on my iPad Pro, latest model, anyway and up-to-date software. It seems when you do a search on offer up a white page covers the whole page. If you turn it portrait mode then you could see where the ads are there, but cut off. Looks like OfferUp has a major bug and needs to fix.
Oh yeah and I tried to reinstall the app no difference… like I said major problem. Now if I could just find their customer service number, I mean they have to have one right?,  I had one when I was 10 years old operating a lawnmowing business.",1
2362,Was better before: The app is so laggy now that they added all these other options like jobs etc. it gets so annoying. There’s also a TON of scammers and doesn’t look like OfferUp does anything about it because scam pages are left there for days or weeks that i have noticed. Even after being reported. Also it’s very annoying seeing stores use the app to advertise their products. Like cell phone stores posting phone financing etc and they’ll have a million of the same post and take up all searches basically. I love but hate this app because of all these things,2
2363,"Items FOR SALE posted too long: I'm interested in a lot of items for sale. It is common for me to follow up on an item but it was posted ""2 years ago"", or 1 year ago or several months. It's ridiculous and a waste of time to sort through so many aged posts. The seller obviously doesn't pull the ad. OfferUp should automatically remove posts that are greater than 3 months, or some equivalent. This site used to be fabulous. Not so much now because of this issue. 
Thanks",4
2364,"Good app to have: Cool app. When you need some quick cash this is the best app to use, especially when you have things sitting in your closet that you have never used. I've made over $800 with this app. I mean of course it could be better by allowing you to delete posts completely, block people so they can't keep messaging you, I don't understand what the block feature does lol but great app . Also wish they would let you use emails you've used before, if you can verify it's yours I don't see why a app in 2022 can't do that.",3
2365,Deactivated my account: OfferUp deactivated my account for “violating” their terms and conditions. The only things I’ve ever done is exactly what I’m supposed to on this app. I’ve messaged sellers if an item was available and seeing when I could pick something up. I even bought an item from someone and we had no issues. I reached out to OfferUp to see exactly why I got deactivated and it’s been a couple of months and haven’t heard from them. I had to start a new account and since then I’ve tried messaging people for their items they’re selling and no one will respond as if OfferUp is stopping my messages from going to them. I’ll be deleting this useless app.,1
2366,"Loading: Once you put a few things in your list it wont let you scroll all the way down anymore, it just shows a loading sign, then if you clear everything in the list it says theres something in it still but when you click on it there’s nothing there so you’re stuck with an empty list you can’t get rid of. Both my boyfriend and I have experienced this problem on our accounts. Other than that its a great app.",4
2367,Focus area more!: So far have had pretty good experience from this app. What drives me crazy about it though is that I can’t focus in on a radius of less than 5 miles for local listings. I live in a city and rarely have access to a car. My Facebook marketplace is set to 1 mile radius and this is really nice. Offer up should allow for more narrow local range to accommodate city livers! There is a HUGE difference between 1 mile and 5 miles in a city. I don’t have time or resources to go that far normally and makes it time consuming to sort through listings,3
2368,"Not my go to app to sell items: Ive sold a minimal amount of items on this app. Its mostly ads and scam promotions for shipped items from like wayfair and like sites. It’s quite disappointing. My second disappointment not an issue of the app, it is really the people who use it. There were very few people that were serious and responded and showed up. The rest of the people are scammer, phishing and just rude people who will not respond, not show up when they said they would or low ball you. Communication through this app seems to be quite difficult. Ive been reporting maybe accounts since 2021.",2
2369,"Lego was better: I know you acquired Letgo! But their platform was more user-friendly and more popular. OfferUp is dead in my area. In other areas it’s somewhat better but still not as good or as popular as the letgo app. One thing that I don’t like about the OfferUp app is let go app you could move your location around on the map instead of knowing or looking up all the ZIP Codes.  Also a lot of inactivity on the app as well… people will list something and sell it and not update.  A lot of people just don’t respond on this app!  I’m not sure what it is , but Letgo format was better… seems to be more scammers as well.",2
2370,"Fix the bugs (edit): I wasn’t able to post anything for sale in over a year and just gave up, Recently I tried again and still couldn’t get photos to load. I finally made a new account and now I can use the app. My previous account wasn’t disabled for anything I did, it just seemed to have locked up for some reason.  Maybe offer up can take a look at how photos are being loaded in the app and fix any problems they are unaware of.",4
2371,Seller beware if mailing out something: If you sell something that you have to mail out make sure that you have it scanned and that you get a receipt to say that it has been received from the United States Postal Service at our Post office. We just have a bin to throw it in and sometimes the package will not be scanned into the system but sent out and delivered I have sent out multiple packages that have not been scanned through their system so offer up says they will not pay because there is no scam. You can contact the customer they can say they received it but no further action will be taken and you will lose out so seller beware,1
2372,"Price doesn’t show on home page and distance always resets: It’s okay. The app is function but online is better-ish. The app doesn’t show you price on the home page so you constantly have to click on the item to see price, and you can’t swipe to the next item you have to back out and click on a new item. It also ALWAYS resets your distance and delivery options. There is more on FB marketplace too. Just simply because people use FB more but this is a good service just use the online feature.",3
2373,"Lots of negative changes: It used to be good when I downloaded back in 2016. I Had over 500+ sales, 5 star reviews . Me and my wife encountered a creep that made us errase our account and open up a new one do to safety concerns. This violates the terms of service and causes you to get banned. Somehow all my family members have an account and got banned and they don’t even post on OfferUp? Yet there are hundreds of scammers and OfferUp does absolutely nothing. Value your safety over an app that wants to leave no freedom. Ditch this app, definitely not worth the hassle if it could be lost within seconds with no warning. Not fair for actual people that care about selling their items.",1
2374,"Worst selling app: This app has so many development issues. It has caused me lost two sales. The first one I click to accept the offer and after I put in the return address the app kept saying something went wrong and won’t let me proceed. I had to close the app and reopen, and guess what, the app has decided to cancel the offer for me!! Moving on to the next sale, I just got a massage that someone is interested and asking when to trade. It showed up in my notifications center so I opened the app to reply, and guess what? There was no message could be found anywhere, even though it clearly said I had 1 conversation related to the item! Worst app ever!",1
2375,"Useful but annoying: The app is useful for selling/buying but the only issue I have is the push notifications. Even after turning them off in account settings they still go through. The thing is, it’s notifications for things you previously searched for. So if I searched for a specific item, found one I liked and bought it, weeks/months later I’m still receiving “recommendations” for the same item I already purchased.",4
2376,"Like it but: I like it have very much but lately it seems to be run over by scam ads for cars. They always seem to be for sale for $600, $800, $1000 or $1200 and only want to communicate via Gmail. Most of the time they have the same “car“ for sale in many different cities. They always claim to be in the military about to be deployed and this is why they’re selling it so cheap I need to go through the transaction so quickly. It’s a total scam and an old one but I guess they have found some success on here because many times they have almost half of the ads for automobiles on here.",3
2377,"My account will not work!: I have been using offer up for about 5 years and all of a sudden my account was deleted or removed. I couldn’t even log in. So I made a new one thinking okay maybe something on offer ups end was wrong. So I made a whole new email and offer up, but the problem is people can’t send me messages. It says something went wrong try again later. So I sent out messages to my brothers account and he never got my offer I know for a fact because I was sitting right next to him. I even try sending more and more people and not one single reply from anyone. I really hope offer up can help me. I love this app.",1
2378,"Very Bad. Look elsewhere.: Used to be good but now it’s really bad. Lots of ads cleverly disguised as whatever you were searching for.  And if you want to remove an item you have to mark it “sold,” whether you actually sold it or not.  That’s annoying.  I listed several items for pretty low prices and got no responses for several weeks.  I went to delete the listing and found I could not; I could only mark as sold. So I decided to leave them on for a little longer. Then I forgot about the listings and gave the items away.  several months later I started getting inquiries via the app asking if my items were still available.  Went to delete the ads but again, I couldn’t delete them I have to mark them as sold. Just annoying. 

Old listings should expire, like they do on craigslist.  

When trying to buy things I’ve run into sellers who’ve experienced the same thing. 

Additionally this app tracks you and sells your data.  So if you use the app, you are the product.",1
2379,"Dear OfferUp,: I clicked the 3 day free trial for the promo by clicking a button that popped up. After the three days I tried canceling the subscription but the was no where that would let (not in the app, not in the email, not in the App Store) it was very sneaky. It wasn’t til I received an email that had a receipt for $20 that I didn’t want to pay. I didn’t even give them my card information so I have no idea how they took the money. Luckily the receipt had a clear unsubscribe button that should have been on the app and the other emails. I filed a problem report asking for a refund but I don’t think they’ll give it to me. OfferUp, I want a refund or this is definitely a scam.",1
2380,"The best free app!!! Helped me get rid of a lot of stuff...: This app is wonderful, especially when you’re trying to get rid of the clutter, things you don’t use around the house anymore, something that you only used that you purchased for a while, but don’t need it anymore. It’s also a place to find stuff at it extremely good deal instead of paying retail. We are better than retail! It’s only a deal if you come out ahead, and it’s easy to do on offer up....   :)",5
2381,Worst Update: As soon as offer up put out the new update remodeling the whole app and changing how everything works it completely messed up the way you buy and sell. Theres so much bugs with the app now. You cant move through the description easy to change a word or sentence without the marker shooting all the way to where it was before if you were scrolling through the description to change something. And when you post something it doesn't work it lags a couple times and you have to repost the same thing twice or three times before it actually shows up on your listing. You guys really need to fix these bugs its been like this for too long.,1
2382,"Banned My Account Because I Wouldn’t Sell: I am moving and started to post old furniture and items. It was going well, met some nice people and gave away a lot of my stuff. I tried to post some of my kitchen items and I kept getting error messages. I was able to create a posting but it wouldn’t finish posting. I logged out to log back in, but I wasn’t able to log back in. More error messages, even after trying to change my password. I didn’t sell or give away anything sketchy and everyone was happy. No help or contact back from customer support. I can only think that since I was giving most stuff away for free, LetGo wasn’t making any money, so they deactivated my account 🤷‍♂️",1
2383,"So many bots/scams: I have used OfferUp for years without issue! I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or not, but ever since they merged with LetGo I have been getting a large amount of messages on my items saying something like “I’m interested in the item, please give me your number so I can contact you.” More recently someone sent me a link saying to contact them on Facebook but the link was not for Facebook. I try to report them but there isn’t a good option for reporting people who have fake looking profiles and trying to scam you. Would be helpful if people had to go through a better verification process to message users or at least create a report feature for accounts that are fake/scams.",1
2384,Why I’m not liking this app: This app is full of robots that want your number so watch out for that. The first 30 second I put my items for sale I get a bunch of messages from the same “person” asking me for my number even if u say no it just gonna keep asking you for ur private information you’d think with how many rates and people downloaded this that they will make better upgrades to keep this sort of things from happening. 1st day using the had 5 robots trying to steal my information now I’m really considering deleting this app even though I haven’t had it for 48 hours.,2
2385,"The Worst!!!!!: I hate the offerup app it’s OLD AND OUTDATED!!!! I literally put the same exact listings on letgo and offerup and I NEVER got one message on offerup actually everything thing I already been sold on letgo all these years is still listed in my offerup app for sale with STILL not one hit or view!! Nothing is updated with my letgo data, I lost my seller reputation, DETAILED reviews, chats, all my listings sold and to who, everything!!! Offerup build a rep by fake users, fake app DL #’s, letgo was way better idk why it wasn’t the other way around where letgo bought offerup instead. This is TERRIBLE and offerup scrambling for app fixes last minute after they locked users out of letgo is just bad business!",1
2386,"Please add option to filter for only verified users: Please add option to filter for only verified users. Lots of scammers especially in cars that post multiple times from different locations with the same blurry pic. They even got smarter and started adding regular items on the side and pretend to be a girl, mother with child, or use pictures of kids to make it look like they’re a family person. Please add the verified filter especially when searching for cars. I love the app, the interface is awesome, the verified thing is revolutionary",4
2387,So far ... very good experience: I’m kinda new to OfferUp but have had very positive experiences so far ... The sellers I have dealt with so so far been very courteous n interactions were handled in a professional manner ... n lets face it we all have unused items that are just taking up useful space in our homes n why not let someone else make good use out of those items while clearing out clutter n our homes at the same time ..  n even make a few bucks ... definitely a win .. win for all ...,5
2388,"Suggestion: The app is great. Overall, it is user friendly. However, when faced with a family emergency, I struggled to find something like a “travel notification” or “temporary absence” to put things on hold in the app in order to prevent getting negative reviews from people who would try to contact me when I’m gone. I’ve encountered other users’ comments on the problem too, that they were blocked and harmed by negative reviews when they were traveling. That is troublesome. I’d hate to delete this app just because my reputation is likely to be tarnished. Please fix the issue ASAP. Thanks.",3
2389,Don’t ever mail anything with this app: So I posted a coin for sale on this app. I live in Georgia he lives Florida. He pays me for the coin OfferUp holds the money well I mailed the coin and clicked it was mailed when I did I noticed there was no way to enter the tracking number well come to find out they want you to print their shipping label and they don’t ask no size of the package or anything so needless to say the person got their coin OfferUp cancels the order and gives the buyer back their money. This app is crap,5
2390,"Annoying in app notifications!: In general I like this app minus the flaky people at times, I have made some side cash which is great. However I hate the in app notifications. I turn off notifications on the app yet still get alerts that indicate I have a “message” so I go back into the app only to discover it’s from offerup telling me to check out some sort of category of junk I don’t want. I see no way to turn this off, it’s like forced advertising and it’s annoying.",5
2391,"Was great until...: ...they changed it so you have to basically pay to hold item even if you are just making an offer. What if I get there and don’t like the item? Have to wait days to get my money back? What if the seller takes 3 -4 days to respond and I find a different deal? Now my money is tied up. Especially on high ticket items. This was a horrible change. I sell things as well and sometimes people flake out, oh well. Not a good enough reason to change a successful format. If OfferUp wants to make money, then just charge a fee to post items. I’m just going to start using Facebook market place and Letgo. Most people post on all 3 anyway. I just always like OfferUp better. Not anymore. Too bad.",1
2392,"Item received button: The app interface and ease of use are good. However, there needs to be a button for “item received” on the buyers side, if an item is shipped. I currently shipped an item, the buyer received it and said everything was good in the messages, but funds aren’t released because usps forgot to scan the item when they delivered it. This can be mitigated if there is a button for the buyer to mark when they have received it. This is the second day the buyer has had the item and no indication that funds have been or will be released to me. Please fix. Thank you",3
2393,"Great app: Just one thing that would make this app perfect if the seller could post a 30sec video of the things they’re selling so the buyer could see that the item works before purchasing, most if not everyone Mets up at a public place for a deal and do not share phone numbers with anyone, so that being said it would be great if we could post a shot video of like electronics, cars, ect. On here to get a little bit of piece of mind! That’s all other than that love the app!",5
2394,"Discrimination: There are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed. 
Also there is some discrimination going on . I have a friend that pays for items to be promoted and can can get away with posting  prohibited items .. . As a seller your unable to post a “look at my page.” Or have “yard sale” post which is all prohibited. But if your a paying app user you can get away with it .the app is suppos to be free . Also if you use key words they opt you out from posting certain things due to prohibition however I seen alcohol being sold with no key words just under bottles . 

After many attempts of trying to  contact offer up and them failing to contact me back I definitely don’t regret the 1 star .rating .",1
2395,"Thank you users: I read the reviews and being a top EBay seller and utilizing other selling apps, I pride my reputation and items with the utmost regard. I installed but deleted after reading the reviews, as I can’t bring myself to using an app that randomly bans and deletes accounts of their top members and allows a scamming system that is more than apparent from I trusted users. Again, thank you to the users that did things the right way and I hate that there are so many desperate and criminal people out there that find the need to take advantage of users looking for deals and bargains. Karma is coming for you. I think I’ll stick with EBay, Facebook, and other trusted sites where it’s easier to weed out the scamming bargain thugs",1
2396,"Irrelevant Ads Galore: I’ve enjoyed using this app to find local goods in the local area that I may want to purchase, but as of late since the last few updates you can’t even login to the OfferUp app without being bombarded with video ads for games and $hi# on the AppStore that has nothing to do with goods and or services offered on your platform. In the past you would find ads while scrolling but now you can’t even look at a product without a video ad taking over the entire screen.  I’m here on your platform yet your  trying to drive your customers off platform?",2
2397,"Needs Major Fixes: The app used to be add free, but now it’s an ad every time I message a seller. The app itself is slow and sometimes takes forever just to boot to the home screen. I don’t categorize most of my saves so they go to quick saves. I’ve had a lot of saved items deleted from my list and even 25(not including the ones I’ve deleted) lists named “Saves” randomly added and reordered. If that’s not a bug, I don’t know what is. I would give 0 stars and delete the app, but some sellers and buyers solely use it. I would also improve my rating if the app itself is improved. It’s crazy when Craigslist has a better platform. Do better.",1
2398,"Account banned randomly: I have been using Offerup since 2019, yesterday i reached out to OfferUp Support since my messages were not going through and my posts were not actually showing up, they got back to me this morning saying my account was banned due to “violations of community guidelines”. I had not even used the app for about 1 week since i had problems with my phone. How does that make sense? The app itself is great, the costumer support is a joke. They refuse to give me a reason for the ban and keep giving the same automated default message about violations of community guidelines… i had never had such a bad experience with a costumer support team…",1
2399,"20$ membership: I understand maybe even a 3$ donation charge to help maintaining the website etc , but 20$ a month to sell something once or twice a year , and there is not as many people on there in my area at all now . What a great representation for what is wrong in America with your new business model . Craigslist is a saint compared to you

Just realized I canceled my bulls*** trial when they said if I did it 24 hours before the last day it wouldn’t charge my account 20$ , not only is my post active but so is the membership . This business is litterally only a scam and no one should use them anymore . I will litterally everyone I know about my experience",1
2400,Great place to sell new or unwanted things.: The app is great place to sell new or unwanted things. Only thing I’d suggest is if you guys can make a filter that lets us choose to browse truyou members only that are verified. That way we feel a bit more secure. There has been a lot of scammers on the app recently. It doesn’t have to be a mandatory thing but keep it as a safer option for the ones that would like to choose it. Thanks,5
2401,The worst experience ever: Why is is so hard to get help with an issue !!! I have emailed support they don’t respond !!! in chat you guys respond a hour later after I’ve logged out ! Then say I wast there to get help I am leaving 1 star review and will be escalating this if I am not paid ! The buyer received the product and refuse to review the product or return it ! You keep sending emails and notifications saying my direct deposit details need to be updated to be paid and I have been updated it !! You guys keep sayings it not !  I would like my money for the product I just sold and I will no longer be doing business with you all this is ridiculous!,1
2402,"Some major flaws!!: 1. After you block a seller, you can still see the ads of that seller. So what does “block” do? 2. SO MANY sellers duplicate the same ads over and over again. I saw one guy created more than 10 listings in one week for the same item with the same picture. I reported multiple times but nothing happened. 3. I’m only interested in items of certain categories within 10 miles from where I am, so I set the filters to be that way. But every time I open the app, the filters reset automatically to default settings. So I have to manually choose local, distance, category, over and over. 4. So many scammers.",1
2403,"Couple side notes: Be nice if you could make the length of time something has been posted a little easier to find in the ad also make people putt there stuff in the appropriate category oh and instead of people having to list there stuff as $0 dollars make it so there is another way if there is some type of negotiation or whatever other wise pretty good web site. I have personally done $50,000 grand or more on your site. Thx guys keep up the good work. Curt",4
2404,"Tried 20 times to buy, but it wouldn’t work!: I’ve used the site before, but had an updated credit card number, but same everything.  So offer up wanted to scan my card, so I turned on the camera.  Tried for over an hour, would not scan, thus would not send info to seller to secure the item.  It was an expensive item too that was very important to me.  I emailed offer up for help, their computer spit back standard balcony, then I emailed the scanning site, same nonsense.  The seller was stellar, but her hands were tied.  No sale offer up, I went elsewhere.
Your incompetence is totally to blame.  I used to recommend your site, but not now!",1
2405,"Ads have become ridiculous: Used to use this app all of the time, but now the ads make the app unbearable. They used to be very non invasive and not inconvenient. Now they are multiple blocks long, sometimes taking up as much as 6 posts in a row. I mean, come on, 6 posts?!?! Also ads will take up your entire screen, forcing to watch the advertisement for a specific amount of time. 5 seconds or not, I do not want a pop up on my entire screen. These changes have completely changed the users experience and have definitely turned me away from the app.",2
2406,"Not what it used to be…: I don’t know what’s changed but I find better offers on Market Place via FB and craigslist. Anything listed on here, people always want to bargain even lower. I got used to that but the new features of “is it available” or whatever seems to attract a lot of scams etc. I also don’t see a lot of my usual sellers anymore either. The app is not what it used to be. I honestly do not like businesses posting on here as well when I am looking for something used. I have to scroll for a long time. There needs to be a section for just  commercial businesses, they also falsely advertise “used” even though it’s a new item etc.",1
2407,"Good but: Works well for what you need to do, but or sell. Negatives is a lot of businesses selling here but should be private parties. Then sales adds with one sale price and in comments a different price - false advertising. Then you find resellers and scammers, want to buy cheap then you find the person delisting your item later for much more. OfferUp corporation should get involved more to close the adds that are incorrect. If you put up with it you find use of the app. The algorithm is bad too where people post the same thing 20+ times.",3
2408,needs more attention. but a good app: this a solid selling app. i use it quite often as i sell items for a living. but they really need to pay more attention. they dont have any customer service which blows my mind because its a huge app & company. i’ve even offered myself to work for them haha which is goofy but i dont see how any company wouldnt have customer service of some sort. there is no number you can call for offer up. there is a few emails but no one ever replies. if anything were to happen to your account you basically just have to deal with it. you cant contact anyone. i think thats a huge problem they have. they really only need to hire like 30 people or so maybe a few more but its nothing much at all for a company this size. otherwise its a great selling app. this app and facebook marketplace are the 2 apps i support for selling locally,3
2409,"Wish you could do more via the web: I wish I could post offers via the web. I am finally getting around  to selling the stuff that I’ve accumulated. I photographed them, exported, and removed them from my library. I had also taken a number of photos with my standalone camera. I now I’ll have to put them all back in my photo library and change the date so that they are easy to find within the app. Just saying it would be nice…",4
2410,They kept deleting my post: I had two watches for sale one Apple Watch and one Samsung Watch one in a box blue and the other one black with white belt. Did not look nothing alike at all. They kept deleting my Samsung Watch saying it was a duplicate when it was not and again they looked nothing alike. So I emailed them and told them and the response I got was we will delete your account if you continue to post duplicates it made me so upset because whoever was doing this really could see or know the difference between the 2. Now my account is not getting any views and I can’t get a reply. OfferUp needs better communication skills with the people that use the app.,1

She handled my purchase like a pro, packaged adequately for a cross country trip and will certainly see my business again.

A true source of quality and value in these times of click and return purchases.",5

I don’t know if it’s remotely possible for OfferUp to build a software that can detect scammers, but it would be nice. I now realize that I am fully responsible for falling into the trap of a scammer. I don’t know if using an app like Zelle is okay as far as receiving payment goes, but I lost $500 listening to the scammer. I know I should’ve known better and I never used an app like Zelle and quite frankly, I want to delete my OfferUp account so I can avoid scammers posing as potential customers.",1

2414,"Needs some obvious features.: Been using this app for years now and there are three things that drive me crazy.

1. Can’t send photos in chat. Sometimes people want more photos or sometimes it’s easier to make a video. Have to ask for peoples phone numbers to show the things that are in the post photos.

2. 12% fees are ridiculous. If you’re gonna ship, use Facebook Marketplace or Mercari.

3. I sell the same products sometimes as I have .on going inventory and there is no repost option after I sell one item. There is a sell another option that comes up but you still have to re-enter all the information again. I want to be able to rate the buyer and get a rating from them. But since I don’t want to make a new listing every time, I just don’t mark it as sold and no one gets a rating.",4

I've tried to reach out multiple times to get more info or see what can be done and have waited weeks but got absolutely no response. I reached out with another inquiry and got the same b.s. statement about guidelines with no info and again no follow up afterwards. If you want to lose money and get no support, this is the app for you. I'm moving and recommending people use other apps instead. Ones with better customer support.",1
2416,"Arbitrary Deletion of Posts: Zero stars for deleting all of my active posts for no apparent reason.  
It takes time to take quality photos of what you’re selling, and it’s more than irking when all that time and effort gets flushed down the toilet arbitrarily.  Apparently I had “unusual activity” (which consisted of one new post, how scandalous), and their response to that was to delete everything and lock me out of my account.  
I would understand the account freeze if they thought I’d been hacked, but why delete my posts?  Couldn’t you make them inactive?  There weren’t any harmful images or words or spam, so what gives?
Save your time, use another app.",1

I listed 2 framed anime fan art of Cowboy Bebop faces my friend painted. After 3 days I check the app to see if there are any hits. Instead the app says there is a login error and I need to log in again. I try again and it said that my account was cancelled due to guidelines. No warning, no email/notification, just cancelled. I don’t what rule I broke. I was not notified. And I guess I had one chance not to screw up. 

So I wasted a lot of time on a buggy app, with no obvious option for support , that won’t let you sell your art.",1
2418,"Best app: I’ve been using this app now for over 5 years and I have found and sold many many items. It’s all about the gift of negotiation and you can find absolutely everything. You meet new people that you can actually trust. I bought a paddle board once and they literally dropped it off at my house. Bought 3 Motocycle on this app and actually made some great contacts. 
I highly recommend it. 
Thank you OfferApp",5
2419,BLOCK FEATURE DOESN’T WORK‼️‼️: The developer needs to fix the blocking feature‼️‼️There’s a lot of idiots on this app that might make lowball offers and when you tell them not to contact you anymore and block them they still continue to send messages. Whenever I block someone I STILL GET MESSAGES FROM THEM no matter how many times I’ve reported them and it shows that they are BLOCKED. OfferUp allows people to harass you on this app! I never had this issue with the Letgo app. I miss using Letgo and I wish they never merged with OfferUp because I always hated OfferUp. I’m about to switch to another app if this feature is not fixed in the next few days‼️‼️ FIX THE BLOCKING FEATURE NOW‼️‼️,1
2420,User Friendly: I’ve downloaded multiple apps like this but this one has been amazing to me! It’s very very user friendly. On other apps it took about a week for people to start making offers on some of my items. But it only took a few hours for almost 5 people to make offers! Very very great app and I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to clear out there closet or their house.,5

2422,"Almost extinct, failing: Mostly overpriced junk, and scams.  Sometimes questionable merchants ads with name brand looking items at a fourth of the actual price, clearly a scam but no place to flag it.

Exchanged emails with merchant who ordered the batteries twice more giving me a (known as a scam) tracking system that twice tracked from China after weeks of entries on the tracking entries it was out for delivery and never delivered.

I try to report as many as possible, but it seems for every one that I report 5 more take its place. I’m starting to see more scam posts than actual posts. And not to mention the aggressive targeted ads. You could be scrolling for awhile seeing nothing but ads for graphics cards and then you miss click on a shoe post and the rest of the ads you will see will be about shoes.",1

I haven’t received any warning on any rule breaking or any explanation from offer up 
So I don’t understand why this is happening 
I haven’t changed anything in my settings or any info on my account at all 
I have tried getting in contact with customer service with no luck 
It’s so frustrating because I can’t use my own acct to reach out to sellers and to have to use my husband’s phone to contact sellers when he’s trying to use it also to message sellers for things he needs 
I hope to hear back from customer service soon",2
2425,"Basically Useless Now: This is the worst app to use just use the Facebook marketplace or mercari honestly, there are way to many scammers and people seem interested but end up not showing or answering and its almost impossible to sell something I went about 2 months with just 5 views you’re gonna have to pay the app if you want to sell something, also when i finally sold something, it logged me out and it doesn’t let me log in it says that I cant log in right now and when i checked my profile using another it said my account was deactivated, didn’t even notify me or anything this app is just straight up useless honestly",1
2426,Good at first glance: The app normally doesn’t want to remember when you change the search radius and glitches back to the original search criteria. There needs to be something done about the inactive users on offer up. I message a lot of people inquiring about their items but never hear back. Maybe if they don’t login for X amount of time or if they don’t respond to any messages somethings should happen to their account and item posted so customers aren’t looking at items that are no longer available.,3
2427,"OfferUp: Offer-up is a good website. So far so good. I like knowing what’s going on in the neighborhood. However I don’t like the fact that I was having a yard sale, I posted my fish tank for sale, I explained the fish in the tank was not for sales only the tank. Because I didn’t get a chance to take the fishes out. I also know that you can’t sales live animal on the page, it’s in the rules. They took my hole yard sale post down. Other yard sales app just let you take the one item off, not the hole post.",4
2428,"Don’t think I’ll be using their shipping again.: Their billing system should be more accurate, as a seller for a 100 dollar item I get charged 14 dollar plus 1dollar for instant deposit, just for them to tell me, it’s gonna take two day after the item arrives. Than I say it’s okay, after the two day pass, they tell me it’s gonna take 5 business days for the money to reach your account even though I paid for instant, which is within 24h. Their support team is quite useless and take forever to replay. Their replies are literally useless. I could have read what’s in the site myself. Have people that actually solve issues not prolong them.",1
2429,"More difficult and expensive: The picture loading used to be so much easier. Now it’s multiple steps and time consuming. They have raised their take to 13%. Which if you’re a vendor means they are taking that off the whole amount not just your profit. I’m being charged on the money I paid for an item. Eg. If I pay $20 fir an item and sell it for $30 they take $4 out of my $10 profit. I also have to spend money on bubble wrap and boxes and drive it to the post office. I’m getting about $5 in reality. 

Of course the person buying it is going to offer $20 anyway!!!!!😛",3
2430,Lots of scammers: I have been using this app since 2018. It used to be great to buy and sell cars and other things. I even sold 1 car myself and lots of other stuff but now when I went back to app in order to buy new car. I found lots of scammers that are asking you to email to get details of the car. And after they ask you to order the car through eBay. They send you the link to the car listing on eBay website which is fake. If you click on the payment option it works but if you click on other things like eBay logo and other buttons like help and other things it doesn’t work. And you can’t find that car on eBay official website,1
2431,"I used to love let go: I’m sad to have seen let go merge with offer up, I think the let go app worked way smoother and was more intuitive to navigate. When I navigate away from offer up app to text or do anything else the app shuts down and every time it has to reopen again. It’s full of glitches, and I couldn’t figure out how to list my listings for free. I can only list it as 0 dollars which I understand is the same thing, but when I listed things for free I would be blown up on let go and had my items gone same day or next day. Now it seems that it takes forever. Maybe people don’t want free stuff because of covid, but I’m sure there’s still a lot of people who want free stuff.",1
2432,"Don’t waste your time you’re better off on eBay: I had 5 pending sales ready to the shipped out and then all of a sudden my account was deactivated on the offerup side. While I’m still getting emails from them TELLING ME TO SHIP OUT WHAT IVE SOLD. But you know that’s cool, deactivate my account without warning or a courtesy email. A lot of people have this problem, and offerup refuses to address it on social media or anything else. What a useless company. I’ll take my business elsewhere. Don’t waste your time on this app once you make a lot of sales they’ll deactivate your account and expect you to still ship out your goods without any payment. Would give this 0 stars if I could.",1
2433,"Good app, add this filter if you can: If possible could you add a private party/dealership filter for the car category. For example, if I wanted a used car from a private seller only. Then I would see only private sellers, but if I wanted to go through a dealership, then I could see only dealerships. There’s a huge difference in price between the two. When I filter price range, I would see dealership posts within that price range, using the price as a down payment.",5
2434,"Great concept, notifications need work: Notifications are a pain point for this app. I either need to have them enabled, in which case I get nag messages and advertisements and I have to open the app to clear the notifications, or I have to turn off notifications completely and remember to check on my own. Extremely annoying that I can’t disable marketing messages and that the app abuses the notification system like that. I will be filing a complaint with Apple. Literally just add a button to turn off the marketing notifications so that all I get notified for is an actual message about something I listed.",2
2435,"New Update Is Horrible: I updated the app and added items for sale.  What has happened? This is horrible and deserves no stars!  No views!  No views!  No views!  Wrong location and it won’t change!   Wrong location and it won’t change!  Wrong location and it won’t change!  Will no longer go in landscape mode!  Will no longer go in landscape mode!  Will no longer go in landscape mode!  I spent all day trying to fix these things to no avail.  Time is money and this app is now not worth the trouble.  In fact, it’s not worth anything at all, if my location doesn’t show correctly and I have no views.  Put back the landscape mode.  It was so much better before.  What has happened, OfferUp?",1
2436,"Love OfferUp, the new update is terrible.: Remove new page graphics. The “slide” graphic when clicking on anything slows down browsing and makes the app appear sluggish. 

Please bring back category Icons. Sorting through a drop down menu takes much longer when hunting through several different categories. 

Don’t bury the favorites!!!!! Burying the saved items is a terrible idea. Please keep it front and center, with the old style to search through selling, buying, or favorites. Why bury that feature in account details? 

Remove excess clutter. This is a mobile app. Instead of attempting to cram all the functionality into the mobile app, improve the desktop version. The devs seem to have it backward on this one. The desktop version doesn’t allow much more than browsing, while the new update tries to fit much more functionality into the mobile app at the cost of...functionality. I don’t want to select 500 options to get to where I could in one before.",1
2437,"Got a sketchy person msging me in the first 5mins i made an acc: I see a lot of good reviews for this app and i was even recommended by a family member but im most likely going to stick to depop. I’m trying to sell preloved clothing and wanted to use more than one app and in the first 5 mins i uploaded my offers i got a sketchy msg asking if my clothing is still available and i said yes then they presumed to demand my number. i was naive to give it because their reasoning was that they needed to know what i wasn’t a scam but the msg they forwarded me needed me to click on a link so i immediately blocked the person. I already reported the person. So sad i dont think i’ll use this app, i liked that i could use apple pay on it too. oh well.",1
2438,"Terrible app ZERO protection for fraud item: Do not use this app or trust this company they sell many fraudulent items on their website and they will not protect the buyer on their purchases.  

I followed the directions to a T in the dispute with the seller and also with offerup and did not get back to me timely.

On me going to ask them again they banned me from their site and their app and I am out $440 plus tax and an on an iPhone that I purchased that was not an iPhone it was a Chinese clone of an iPhone be very careful of this fraudulent company in the final reply to me they said they have the right to ban because I asked about this issue twice this is deplorable company do not trust them!!",1
2439,"DO NOT USE!! $$$$ stolen!: I spent hundreds of dollars over the last year using offer up and promoting my items just for them to delete my account. Out of no where I noticed my account was being weird and when I emailed their customer service, they told me that one of my listings was posted wrong and they reactivated my account. 30 minutes later I got another email saying they deleted my account. When I asked why or for clarification, I didn't get an answer. I’m not sure why they would want to lose such a high paying customer (especially since most people use the app for free) but it goes to show that they just don’t care about any of their users. Paying or not.",1
2440,Flagged: I’m so upset at this someone flagged me and I honestly don’t understand why and why I cannot contact anyone to discuss this with I don’t understand how they can just flag me and not ask me or verify me . I have been using offer you for a while and always sold my things one day I was so just running around I couldn’t get to the buyer and he flags me ??? Someone help to see how I can get my account back other then this I loved offer up !,5
2441,"Good app, too many spam accounts: I've used this app on and off for a while and I like it. Until I go to post something. I get notifications every few seconds from random spam accounts that had to have been made that same day, or very recent. No full name or profile picture; asking me for my personal information as well as asking about things I'd already explained. Along with a generic ""I'm buying this as a gift I'll pay you an extra $150."" I wish they would do more to monitor stuff like this, because it really drives me away from wanting to use it.",3
2442,"I love this app.: I can set my location & perimeter or buy from the entire country.  Sellers & buyers are held accountable by a rating system. It amuses me when a buyer offers a bid of 90% lower than asking price. However, Everyone had been so kind & professional.  The process used to be on the face of picture/ad but now you have to click it open. Not a big deal.  I have sold & purchased several times. You can always find lots of listings for what you need. Amazing!!!!",5
2443,"Banned Without Proof: I used OfferUp for a while and I loved it. I used it to buy stuff first, then I started to sell.
At first selling was very easy and user friendly, but they got very complicated. Now, OfferUp is a horrible platform for sale!!!!
I got banned for no reason! They send me an email saying that they removed my account and didn’t give any specific reason! All my items are authentic and have serial Numbers! They never look at my items nor give a warning! I had a 5 star review and great communication with buyers. I even report scammers. Yet, my account gets banned!

My friends is telling me that OfferUp is banning and blacklisting a lot of sellers for no reason. Look on chat rooms on google and you can find a lot of conversation regarding this issue! 

I highly recommend using Letgo, Facebook marketplace, or Ebay to sell!

Avoid OfferUp!!! Because once you get banned you can’t buy nor sell on your phone again! 

OfferUp is terrible!! And the customer service doesn’t help with reactivate it neither!",1
2444,"Good for people who know: Good for selling you get lots of messages quick. I personally have got scammed a few times, you really need to know the products you buy. BE CAREFUL. Ask questions and learn about the product before buying. Meet at a public place, don’t get it shipped or ship stuff to others. OfferUp would be close to perfect if it had some sort of money back if you get scammed but I see where that could be a gate. Overall if you be careful and play your repertoire right you should be good but scamming is becoming more common.",4
2445,"flaky buyers, bad UX, worse support: I’ve been using OfferUp for a couple of years to sell random things around the house. But I’ve decided to try another app because:

1. The buyers here are flaky. I’ve had 2-3 no shows.
2. They added a cool feature called Hold for Pickup to fix the no-show issue where the buyer prepays for an item and OfferUp holds the money for a couple of days until you meet up and the sale takes place. Great! Except it doesn’t work if the buyer messages you before using the feature. Every buyer messages you to confirm the item is still available (symptom of another usability issue)
3. I emailed support to find out how these buyers can use Hold for Pickup and they replied 4 times without ever answering the original question. The last message basically suggested that my account was about to be suspended (?!?) and he “fixed the issue”

I’m gonna try some other apps like LetGo and maybe even the Craigslist app.",3
2446,"Problems with initial setup.: A lot of times When I check the site for new items I notice it’s showing items not only out of state but far beyond my 30 mile commitment area. So to correct it I noticed it moved my setting from pickup to all and my 30 area of interest has also moved to 50+ or when set at 30 shows items in excess of that limit?
You could make it easier to transmit my response by eliminating the nickname entry. I’ve tried several names and all have been supposedly taken. Big waste of time.",4
2447,My account was hacked There is no help: I joined offer up in August 2016 and I’ve had mixed results. I’ve had a lot of people Stiff etc.  which I have never had on craigslist. That being said I have been able to sell some things on the app and I have bought a few things too.  Yesterday my account was hacked and the email address was changed so I can’t do anything to fix it. There’s no way to reach out to anyone in this company. The person who hacked my account listed a car for sale numerous times causing my phone to blow up. I do not think anyone runs offer up or cares about it I think it’s just out there and if you use it you’re on your own. I would give it zero stars if I could.,1
2448,"Can use some small improvements: I like the app. It serves it's purpose. 
The app has no control over flakes and people who false advertisement. I wish there was a way to ding people who do false advertise or don't show up etc. You can only report and offer to block. 

I'd like a quick edit button for my saved items. You have to click on each item to remove and it's time consuming. If an items sells or is unlisted just automatically remove from my list. If it's gone, I have no need to see it any longer under my saved items.

Offer up makes $ off posted ADs so the option to pay via offer up and hold items for sale is not something I want. 

I like cash and the item gone asap! I always advise whom every gets here and pays for it, gets the item. If it's sold I will contact the other interested party asap. No one likes their time wasted.",4
2449,"Not safe! No way of knowing issues!: This app does not allow you to edit your reviews.
This is very dangerous for innocent people making purchases or researching products. I personally made a purchase based on information I got from this app and now I’m thousands of dollars lost due to a fraud putting false information in this app. USE CAUTION! This app harasses you to leave a review after you have made a purchase but leaves you totally hanging when you are left with a negative experience. I hope others that feel this way or have had similar experiences (read online about how you can’t edit reviews. I’m not the only one.) speak up and let them know it’s a one star app until changes are made.",1
2450,"Glitches: I did like this app at first but for the past 2 days I’ve had tech problems where I can’t view messages or postings! I can only see my profile. It’s made things difficult because I was going to meet someone for a sale, but we didn’t exchange numbers yet. So they must think I changed my name. I contacted OfferUp a few times on Facebook, but they gave the responded after 48 hours! I updated the app and rebooted my phone but that didn’t help either.",5
2451,"3/5: I love the convenience of the app. Lots of great deals to choose from. There is two big things that need to be improved on this app. 
1. ‼️Weed out the scammers ‼️ there is a lot of post with scam written all over, i constantly report the pages but it seems like nothing is done. 
2. I think if your going to use this app it needs more security. I’ve had some deals go bad where the sellers item wasn’t as described. I couldn’t do anything or report it. I have had someone actually run off with a phone I was selling and one person who gave me fake money. I couldn’t report the person(s)",3
2452,"Great App, but...: This app is great! Love the features and the amount of views it gets and all. I would give it 5 stars, but there’s one thing that is frustrating. Since I do want the notifications on due to messages or questions people have, I searched and bought a drum set on this app. And it’s been over a year already and I still get notifications regularly saying “Drum related items for you” or even weirder “mirror related items for you” 🤔 And there’s no way to turn these specific notifications off. Please fix. Thanks!",4
2453,"Scam: I would give this app 0 stars but that feature is not available. 

While I realized this app was target it towards the novice in sales (a bit  different from Craigslist) I feel I been had not once not twice but three times they have a button which it helps you promote your items for a fee in the main feed but the sad thing is there is not buyers or prospects yet they continue taking your money. I try reaching out to their help forum with no luck.",5
2454,"Very unfair app!!!: I loved using offer up up until now. I have been a member since September 2014. It was the best way to sell locally. I have 5 rating with over 50 reviews. I have been respectful and necer scammed d any of my customers. Out of nowhere my app starts to fail, or so I thought. Now I’m realizing that my account has been banned without any notification or warning from offer up. It is time to move forward with other websites or go back to eBay. I do not recommend this app!!!",5
2455,"Ads are awful, disrupt using app and phone: I usually love this app but noticed it’s getting painful to use with ads. Ads everywhere you accidentally hit, it presents you with ads that don’t have an “x” so you sit there waiting… I just close the whole app and lose the search or go to Facebook market place. What drew me to write this review is an ad just caused my music to pause. You kidding me? Small inconvenience but I was playing it on a loud speaker so it was very apparent. these ads don’t do anything for me the normal end user. Quit being greedy and stop sending ads. I’m not doing premium with either",2
2456,"Horrible app feeding off the elderly with ads: My second 1 star review of this app. First review was about the notifications you cannot turn off. This review is about your insane ads that take over the app all the time. They’re obtrusive and get clicked on even if you’re nowhere near the ad on the screen. And now new ads today say “New Ram truck for Seniors only $10,000!” And “Over 75? Get a free car! Click here!” You should be ASHAMED Feeding off the elderly. What has this world come to? OfferUp, your app, your team, your developers, and your business model are all absolute trash. Just garbage. Unbelievable in this day and age that your app is openly attempting to scam the unaware and weak.",1
2457,"No longer will be using: I used to love OfferUp. Super user friendly and amazing to buy and sell stuff off of. Recently though, they’ve integrated pop ups and, unless you upgrade and pay a fee, you have to sit through the pop up until it’s over. It’s extremely frustrating. It made me start veering away from using it, but I still would every now and then. Now, the notifications keep alerting me to things I’ve been looking for, even though I have all notifications, except for chats, turned off through the app. Facebook Marketplace is so much better now!",2
2458,"USE FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE OR ANYWHERE ELSE THEY ARE USELESS: They 110% fraud. This person has repeatedly done it. I literally went step-by-step with Offer Up skylines it is legal to sell car in Georgia where the speedometer don’t work along with the odometer and said clean title said what is the emissions up-to-date was it this man can have a missions on that car with a title for Mississippi signed in Alabama but he’s got Georgia tags. They and I only asked for 2000 back to help pay for itbecause he lied through and so I said, what about my buyer protect they told me to get the money back from him I am going to spread word like wildfire. It’s already started going viral they are useless they will never help you y’all need to run.",1
2459,Still no refund: Me and the seller got into it over messages and now they won’t ship. I had to wait it out to get the purchase canceled (which is stupid btw) then they claimed to having refund me on the 24 of September but I have yet to see any of my money put back on my card. Customer support is useless. I’m not sure if they’re bots or just dumb because it seems like no matter what I say they have a programmed response to refer me to an article. -10/10 don’t recommend actually buying on the app unless your meeting up in person because crap like this happens. And the amount of scammers on this app is unreal. Just stick to eBay for your own safety.,1
2460,Good App!: Easy to use. User friendly. I’m not tech savvy but had no trouble setting it up and posting.  The selling process is simple. Notifications come right to you. No need to open email or text to review them and respond. Easy to monitor progress and number of consumer views. This helps to manage the asking price. Had success selling two sofa and love seat sets and a set of drums at fair prices. Will continue to use OfferUp. It works!,5
2461,"OfferUpaholic, that’s me!!: I cannot believe I never looked into this app until now!!  Quite a few of my friends use it to get rid of household stuff or make extra spending money for whatever... I immediately found some really cute items that I absolutely loooove ❤️but I need to have a little more self control cuz the money DOES add up quickly.  Well.... maybe I can start listing items and putting up offers of my own to balance out what I’ve been buying 😂😂",5
2462,"App is never monitored: This app use to be great. I have made a couple thousand on it when I first found this app. However the last 2-3 years it seems no one manages posts anymore. You may search for something and tons of items show up but when you click on them the majority will say “posted a year ago” or longer.

Thats a bit much I think if a user has not logged in and renewed their item or had to confirm in app that its still for sell that the item should be removed. Either hire people to fish through posts and delete old stuff that is not updated or create a software to manage this.

Good luck in the future!",1
2463,No longer relevant: OfferUp/let go used to be a thing and using it I had positive results across the board. This time I used OfferUp and Facebook market. Paid $20 for a month of promo plus on OfferUp as it had served me well before and paid nothing for Facebook market. Of the dozens of items I listed on both platforms I sold one on OfferUp. The rest sold on Facebook market. So I’m not bothering anymore. Annoying also is that you cannot login with you Apple ID on your computer when using OfferUp. Inconvenient for me. So this ends my relationship with the company and now I’m listing on Facebook. And I hate Facebook.,2
2464,"Waste of time!!!: This app is very selective about who they let post ads, you should consider yourself lucky if your ad gets posted! And if it does get posted it’s usually a scammer trying to steal what your selling! And god forbid if you let someone else log in to the app (I.e. a friend or family member) useing your phone cuz then they delete your profile and won’t give you a reason why they deleted your profile! They just do it and you have no recourse and any money that they are holding of yours just disappears as well as any items that they have of yours if you don’t care about what happens to your property then this is the app for you!

UPDATE!!!

OfferUp has decided to keep my $2,500 and they tell me to wait 10 days for reimbursement but it’s been 32 days  
This App is nothing more that a con game!!!! They stole my money don’t let them steal yours and delete your account so you have no recourse!!!! No customer service! No one to talk to, it’s obviously a group of thieves!!!!! Don’t waste your time and money!!!!!",1
2465,"Shipping on OfferUp: I sold an item on offer up through the shipping method.
Printed out there prepaid shipping label given to me and shipped out the item. 
Three days go by and I get a notification saying the order was canceled because I did not ship the item in time and telling me “don’t ship the item”…Though I shipped out the item days ago! A refund was sent to buyer and I am out of the product I sold and the money I made.. I don’t know what’s gonna happen to my item that was shipped out days ago that is now apparently canceled because it wasn’t shipped out. It says to contact customer support and they will reach back within 2 to 3 business days… Ridiculous",1
2466,"Went from okay to bad: You can no longer change the radius of the search. I always set it to 5 or 10 miles. Now it is only 30 miles with no option to change, so the app is no longer something I will use, as it just wastes time showing me tons of stuff, half of which are too far to drive with current gas prices. 

Also, I didn’t realize how time consuming it is to delete saved items, so I quit saving items and never look at that list. 

I miss the way it used to be and I really miss LetGo. 🙁",3
2467,"First time using the app!!: Well I sold my first 3 items, I appreciate that, but I found it difficult to navigate, also the scammers sent me emails trying to get some codes, 2 people said since I have no reviews they will not come to my home to buy, I offered to deliver still no but it’s much easier to take pics and upload them Craigslist but overall so far so good, thanks for the pocket change, it came in handy today!! Have a great day!! Overall satisfied new client!!",4
2468,"Need to do better job cleaning up posts: I enjoy everything about the app except for the fact that there are items for sale from 1-2 years ago and you know darned well they aren’t for sale anymore.  Also, tons and tons of autos for sale from various scammers that all post the same pictures of the same cars, always $1,200 and always tell you to contact them at some goofy gmail address. The site could do a better job of cleaning out these posts and just cancel out posts that are 6+ months old.",3
2469,"Old post should be removed: More like a 3.5. Items should be deleted or updated after 6 months. There are items from 2, 3 & 4 years ago (no current updates). A waist of my time asking “is this still available”! And way too many Same items posted by way too many different people. I counted 20 same vehicle for sale by at least 6 different people in 6 different cities (I stopped looking after 6). And no way to delete or complain.",4
2470,"2 stars out of PITY: Where do I start. This app gave me so many problems after fooling me thinking that I was only going to need to subscribe to promote my listings and once I unlisted them the subscription would be over. It continued to
bill me about $20-25 every few weeks without my notice. After a couple months I noticed the billing and how they had already taken over $100 worth of my money when I DIDNT EVEN HAVE THE APP ANYMORE. I remember seeing the free trial and cancel anytime, yet when I deleted my listings and deleted my ACCOUNT my card was still being charged to “promote my listing”. Not to mention it’s full of scammers, except the app is a scammer itself!",2
2471,"Don’t use this app: For the second time I have sold to someone out of state only to have offer up cancel the sale after the item was mailed. I have yet to receive payment for either sale. The first time I was able to talk to customer service and was told it’s my problem not theirs. This time I’ve gotten no response at all. Their rating on BBB is an f and all reviews are bad, multiple complaints. I will be reporting them today.

Update:
A senior customer service rep sent an email apologizing for the troubles I had. He corrected the mistake however, I still disagree with offerup’s shipping policies.",3
2472,"Too many Scammers trying to buy: Giving this app 1 star as the platform needs to do more to prevent scammer bots from trying to buy things.  It is super annoying to constantly get notifications of a buyer making an offer for what turns out to be a scam:   Offer ends up being “ Actually, I'm currently out of town at the moment can I make payment via a cashier's check and the moving company help pick up after the check clears”.   

And the user who makes the offer is usually a bee profile that has only confirmed email.  As a user, I’d much prefer a more involved process to join the platform which requires multiple verification steps if by doing so these fake bots would go away.",1
2473,"OfferUp should have taken the LetGo format: First, let me say I’ve been using both apps for a few years now and in that time, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that LetGo was the far superior app. Limited ads which only showed when looking at a specific item (OfferUp shows them while you’re scrolling which means you’ll accidentally click on things fairly often). Virtually zero spam or scams on LetGo, while OfferUp has more scams than Craigslist which is saying something. I hate that they merged and took the far inferior version between the two and will most likely end up ditching using it altogether now unless they work on it.",2
2474,"Very disappointed. HATE IT!: Update:

I clicked on a shoe listing by mistake. As a result I am flooded with many many shoe listings and I counted 22 commercial ads for shoes and boots - just in the beginning of the listings. I don’t want shoes!!!

This app is a scam. Bad for the seller and even worse for the buyer. 

—————————————————————-
I am very disappointed to see the merger. I was a regular user of Letgo and greatly preferred it over Offerup. I already had an offer up account but never used it. I don’t like it. 

No matter what you look at on offer up you are  bombarded with ads for similar products. Sometimes you click something mistakenly or out of curiosity - not because you want to buy it. For example, I have no interest in women’s jewelry but somehow I must’ve clicked on something. Now I’m flooded with ads for items I have no interest in. 
Also, now my Letgo history is gone - including my user name and photo. 

Never had a scam problem on Letgo. Offerup is loaded with scammers. 

If offer up had adopted some of Letgos workings - maybe. Guess I’m moving back to craigslist.",1
2475,"Account for Antaño: Hello, I have been an active member since Fall 2016. Recently, I experienced unusual activity on my account. The number had been changed and the email as well various times. I tried contacting support at least a dozen times via phone and email with no response at all. What’s the problem? NOW MY ACCOUNT ISN’T RECOGNIZED!!! I had impeccable reviews and a good reputation. This is not fair especially because it’s been two weeks with no resolve. I am completely disappointed now with this app. Pretty terrible. How do you not rectify this situation? Not okay. The name on my account was “Antaño” in Chicago, IL. Please make this right.",3
2476,"Useless app & customer service: OfferUp is useless. I was trying to purchase a snowboard this week & I have tried three other purchases in the past. Messages weren’t going through/never went through to the sellers. I contacted OfferUp about the issue through Facebook messenger, because they don’t have a dedicated link through their app. My messages were ignored for a couple of days and when they did finally reach out to me, they said they had “started a ticket”. Days went by, and eventually the item sold. Despite me putting in offers days prior, only to have the seller not receive them. 

Today was the third time & final time I’ve had this issue with OfferUp. 

Absolutely useless.",1
2477,Major  headache: I’m writing this review based on how now instead of seeing your local listings you automatically see all. And you have to manually press pick up every time and it’s became annoying. Also recently all of my sales have disappeared. Before I had 1 thousand plus sales show on my profile and for the past month it hasn’t shown. I depend on my rating and sales track to make sales. Please fix this soon. Thanks . I am a veteran offer up user,5
2478,"Re-activation: I’ve been on offer up and I left because a lot of people would try to low ball you on the items you were selling. I decided to re-activate my account because I’m moving and red to sale some items, so I started with updating a new password and there was no problem. However, the problem comes when I go to log in with my new password. I logged in with my email and password and would log me in and immediately log me out saying “logged out”. I hate the fact that offer up doesn’t have a way to contact them when issues like this arise, it’s very frustrating and I don’t know why this is happening so I can’t post anything !OFFER UP FIX THIS AND HAVE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO CONTACT YOU!",1
2479,"No customer service: I have had offer up for years! One day I can’t log in. So I try to reset my password and it says I don’t exist, so I try to open it up again with a new account and it says I already exist! I email customer service for over a month with NO Response! Meanwhile they keep sending me updates on my stats!!!! So do I exist or not?!!! And why can’t I log in? Why will no one help me? BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Horrible!!!!!!!!!!! They even keep sending me emails saying I have messages on my items and that I need to respond to the messages. Well I can’t respond because I can’t sign into my account, and I cannot get anybody from customer service to help me going on two months with this problem.",1
2480,Haven’t got any views on my products and can’t find any: It’s been about a week now I haven’t got any views or messages before I would get messages and a lot of views for the stuff I post I haven’t got nothing now it’s been a week it’s getting frustrated I haven’t got any views or messages was wondering why I’ve done a lot of stuff to try to fix the problem and nothing was hoping u can help me I love this app a lot and I do sell a lot of electronics and golf stuff can anybody help me,5
2481,"Loved the app...until my phone blew up with responses to items that other people were selling: Loved the app...until my phone blew up with responses to items that other people were selling! I don’t have a clue what was going on with OfferUp that day, but I was getting responses to listings that were not mine. My phone was blowing up with that coin sound notification....one after another nonstop! I was extremely P’d off.... the only way to stop it, was to completely delete my account and the app! Up until then, I was really happy with the app! I’m gonna try to download the app and try again, hopefully that problem doesn’t happen again....!",2
2482,"Has been a great app in the last year, but....: Offer up has been a great app. They start out simple and then edit some cross promotional advertisements and that’s fine but lately there have been so many spammers primarily with cell phones and computers filling the feed and repeating it so folks like me who are just sell a little things like we always have been we get lost in the feed. OfferUp has a big spamming problem right now at least in my market and they don’t seem to be doing much about it. All we can do is report the spammers and then block them they need to add a filter",3
2483,"Love this app!: I've sold so many things and still selling! I love this app and it's sooooo useful!

Some issues:
-So many people who bail on meeting and randomly don't show up!
-SOOOOO many outdated items that weren't marked as ""sold!"" 
     Suggestion: Every three or so months, offerup should send a renewal notification that asks if they have sold the item yet. If there is no respond within a week or so, offerup can automatically take it down. 
If the seller says he hasn't yet sold the item, then offerup can just leave it there.

So yah, it definitely needs a deep cleansing!

-Also, it would be sooooo nice if we could send individual messages to buyers. So many times buyers want more pictures, and we have to exchange numbers in order for that to be accomplished and that pretty much goes against everything offerup believes in.",5
2484,"Good app. Miss old settings.: I use this often to buy and sell items. I like the new rating system that allows you to give more feedback than just a number of stars. I do, however, miss the old search options. Currently I can only search by things that are close or things that were recently posted. Why not both? I used to be able to look at new items and choose how many miles away I wanted to look. I hope this is updated soon to make it more user friendly.",4
2485,"Great interface, but could use some tweaks: I’ve been using OfferUp for about 2 years now. It’s very convenient and easy to browse what’s for sale in the area, but if you want to search for something specific, it lacks the filtering ability like you see with Craigslist. The rules are also way more strict - too strict - than Craigslist. Ive made legit posts for collectible items that are replicas or ceremonial versions of military pieces, and they get removed for being ‘Fake’ or ‘Weapons’. But you’ll see scams and spam posts left and right.",4
2486,"Forever Glitchy with messaging: Great concept, I’ve bought and sold many things. However the app messaging system is forever glitching. It refreshes constantly but fails to show new messages. It has cost me many deals because it shows new messages and when I open the app they’re not there! I just did the update and now it’s worse. I was waiting to hear from someone to purchase an item from them and the deal is going to be lost because my messages just refresh and never open, although I have a notification. This needs to be fixed",3
2487,"I am a Business Owner and I like this app for all options to sell good and limited services: I feel they need to have a area that allows us business owners to share job opportunities. 
Plus to sale e-commerce products and services. I own a Nutrition and Coaching business and every time I create an ad it gets flagged for medical use not at all the case. They need to my MH and look at the business that I’m in and the products that I have.",5
2488,"No customer service: The buy sell part is great but whenever you need to deal with someone from customer service, just give up. I had over 150 transactions and over 70 5 star review Andy account was suspended for “violating” guidelines, but never telling me specifically what was in violation. All I had posted was tools. I got a message from OfferUp saying that I should try to repost the item and make sure there is nothing violating the rules. When I reposted the items they suspended my account and o could never get ahold of anybody to resolve this issue. Now I made another account but nothing I’ve posted is being viewed and nobody is receiving my messages.",1
2489,Should be a sueable offense: If you offer the option to turn off notifications for recommendations and items from seller I follow which I never follow sellers anyway then I should actually not receive the notifications. Literally daily I get notifications about crap I didn’t ask to be notified about and actively went on and turned off notifications for. I don’t want extra crap suggested to me. Especially with sally whom I purchased a table from weeks ago is now selling a bag of gravel. Or I once searched for soda stream stuff and now every day I get “soda stream related items” notifications. Stop seriously. I’m about to delete this app permanently.,1
2490,"Push Notifications + Posts Deleted: I have turned off all push notifications in this app, I have no saved searches…. AND YET… I still regularly get notifications for “saved searches” and “new items from sellers I follow”. Turning off notifications should, now stay with me here, turn off the notifications.

I have also recently run into an issue with posting items for sale. Every time I post an item with more than 3 pictures and any descriptive text (taken and written by ME), my post is immediately deleted. Every time. Read through guidelines and I’m not breaking any of them. Only received automated replies to my help tickets",1
2491,Need to add price and title in thumbnail!: Facebook marketplace has this feature and it’s so useful because I don’t want to go clicking on things I like to find out they’re not free because I’m usually looking for plants or gardening stuff and they’ll give me plenty free without having to spend any money. The free tab isnt the best because it doesn’t show all the free listings because not everyone uploads them the right way. I have gotten PLENTY of good free things from OfferUp but it’s much more of a hassle,4
2492,It’s okay but…: I use OfferUp a lot. I have at least 1000 items for sale if not more. But one day my account got deactivated for no reason. I messaged customer service to get it back. They said it was a technical error and gave me my account back BUT 100s of my posts were missing! I contacted customer support multiple times but they were no help in helping to get my posts back up. I wish their  customer support would be live rather than email and automated responses. They need more agents that can take calls or chat online! That would make the OfferUp experience so much more better!,2
2493,"Offer up went down hill: Offer up used to be an Amazing app but after it started charging for the boost your items dont get viewed since they get black listed if you dont purchase the boost so it pretty much forces you to buy it just so people can at least look at the item and the adds are horrible you cannot scroll down without a app popping up every 5 seconds and their not even add you would like it something completely random,But alot of people have been switching to other app and recommended it since they are getting more success so i did and I recommend as well because it worked better",1
2494,"Terrible customer service and overpriced.: I was offered a free trial on their “promote plus”, which I accepted. I was immediately charged $20 because I didn’t realize that the confirmation screen didn’t have a free trial actually listed. I immediately asked for a refund (didn’t keep using their service), but I haven’t heard anything back and it’s been days. In addition, I realized the “promote plus” only allowed me to promote ONE ITEM for $20. Ridiculously overpriced, and I never got a single message on any of my items for sale. I ended up just using Facebook Marketplace, Mercari, etc. Very disappointed with this app and the lack of communication from their support team.",1
2495,I use to love this app but someone reported and I never got it back: I would sell here almost everyday I had my business going I had all my customers here . But two years later someone reported my page just because I didn’t deliver one of my  product to them I know this because few hours later it was taken down . Anyway after those two years trying to get my account back no one from offer up never responded to me back to get my account back . I hate this app ever since I lost my business because of them not responding back to me!  I have a child and that’s was the only way I would get money for ourselves .,1
2496,"App isn’t designed for smaller screened phones: Tried to email customer support and the app wont let me submit my request, telling me my email isn’t valid even though it is. I had wanted to let customer support know that I can’t rate my buyer. I just sold my first item through OfferUp and when I go to rate the buyer I can’t scroll beneath the stars to confirm/submit my rating. I’m now going to miss out on possibly gaining ratings myself because of this faulty glitch. The app is clearly not designed for smaller screen phones. I don’t appreciate how you can’t even message customer support for help.",2
2497,"This is my opinion: There is a lot of fake ads here. Some people are just trying to get your attention so they can sell some other stuff that they are selling. I find something and txt them and they just disappear. Funny, but OfferUp is not aware of this. I report that to them and they send me idiotic generic I don’t care style message that says call police and report it if it was some violation. Basically, they promote that!
I almost never sell anything here.
Also, I try to log in with my VPN on like if I was in other US city and they tell me you are out of US, haha.
Idea is good but it is not functioning well.",2
2498,"Not good for local use: It’s ok if you’re lucky enough to sell anything but it doesn’t seem like there’s much activity, new things aren’t posted often, and offers don’t come in quickly. I attempt to buy and sell and don’t have much luck. Your feed will be made up of ads, websites selling items they think you want, someone who will ship from California, a ton of whatever the last thing you searched was, and the same user who has 1,000 things for sale. The feed needs to be totally redesigned, unless this is not meant for people hoping to do local exchanges.",2
2499,"Better as LetGo: This app was once a good tool to connect local buyers with sellers in a safe manner.  Now it is about 50% advertising.  It seems like it tries to use an algorithm to make suggestions unfortunately it can’t always distinguish between types of items.  While I’m sure the goal was to be helpful, it comes off as trying to push a stream of off topic items into what now seems to be a social media feed.  Unfortunately this app has slid a long way from what it was 2-3 years ago.  However it does offer a verified user system that adds a level of safety above Craig’s List.",2
2500,Doesn’t work: I have tried so many times to create an account that will allow me to buy or even message people and it’s like my messages don’t go through and I have tried posting items to sell and the post either gets deleted or no one even sees it like it never posted. It used to work amazingly and all of a sudden it won’t even let me do anything. Pretty much this app is USELESS……..,5
2501,"Good app: Good app. Bought pretty much everything I’ve treated myself with whenever I got some extra cash laying around off of this app. Trying to sell something a bit valuable on it now which is new, but when it comes to items of lesser value I’ve had great experiences. Every user I’ve bought off is to the point and has never ripped me off. Be vigilant and I’m sure you’ll have the same experience.",5
2502,"Terrible experiences!!: I don’t think if anyone works in this company because I couldn’t reach them for a week, sent maybe 10 emails. All the sudden they suspended my account for no reason and tried to reach them for why is that happened but couldn’t reach anybody!! My account been closed for over a week for no reason then when they activated my account all my postings was messed up. They couldn’t restore my account right!! And now today for another issue I been waiting for 4 days to get some help!!!
I will probably not gonna use this app anymore. 

And one other thing is there is toooooo many scammers. I almost not trust anybody here!!",1
2503,"Big problem with app: I use to sell alot of things on this app and for the past year or so i post something and i only can see it, i get no views no one contacts me, i am a legit seller with good reviews etc. I also try to message people to buy something and no one ever responds to me. Idk the problem and there is no customer service. Its like im shadowbanned from this app, bc i know others with the same problem on this app!!",5
2504,"Cleaning out garage: Offer up has been a motivator in cleaning out garage. No garage sales, quick and is app takes only seconds to list items. This app has helped me organize my garage and make money at the same time. I have had no issues with potential buyers and OfferUp keeps me educated and informed of potential scams as well as what information not to provide that could jeopardize my private information.",5
2505,"Excellent options to choose from: Offer up a a great way to find things directly in your community,near or far it’s optional . You actually get to see the items on line just like online shopping but 70% less most times , you can find new or used items as well .Overall I love offer up for its ease in posting and multiple ways to list categories to save time in searches 🙏🏽",5
2506,"Fix this please: Everything is good on this site the only problem I don’t like is that you have people that has stuff still posted from 2 , 3 years ago. I think you should send them a message to update their merchandise if they have “NOT-SOLD” it or give them a time period to delete it and if they don’t don’t follow through by the end of the time I think “ offer up”should delete it..",5
2507,"Sometimes, the miracle happens.: Basically, not the most useful/fruitful app I have ever used. For the most part, not a lot of quality pieces are posted and not a lot of quality customers will be making contact. However, the miracle happens once in a while. I have sold quality/expensive pieces and bought them as well... but, it’s not abundant. Never know when the sweet deal will happen, keep at it.",5
2508,Great app and easy to use: I’ve been selling on here for over 5 years. This app is great and very easy to use but people are shady on here and most of the the time don’t show. One thing I would suggest is not to use the quick send text of “is it still available?” I get this every time and reply yes with no further response. It’s so freakin annoying. I do sell all kinds of stuff on here and also got some good deals.,5
2509,"Good Deals, Needs A Send Video/Picture Option: I’ve found some pretty great deals on here. Lots of scammers on here as well so be careful. My main gripe is that if I’m buying something I want to make sure that it works, like video game consoles. So I have to request a video and the native messaging service doesn’t have an option to add video or pictures. I got a text now number just to receive videos to make sure the consoles work. Offer up warns against giving out numbers but how else am I supposed to double check that it works??",3
2510,I’m so mad right now: I have been a member of OfferUp for years and I have over 200 sales and 5 stars rating on my profile. I made one small mistake and didn’t read the guildlines not realizing CBD was not allowed to be posted. It was up for one day and my account was removed from OfferUp and I emailed them asking if I could just take down that post and they said there’s no way I’m getting my account back and I’m not allowed to make another one. They’re literally treating me like I was selling illegal stuff. I’m so mad and confused why they had to delete my whole account just because of one violation. They couldn’t just deleted the post and gave me a warning.,1
2511,Average user: Haven’t had any issues at all on this app. I’ve put stuff up and successfully sold it for what I wanted and a lot faster than I expected. I’ve also purchased things through this app. So I’ve been on both sides and have had only good experiences on both ends. As far as development and software goes I know nothing. The app is easy to use. It’s the people on it and the area you are in that will make it a unique situation good or bad.,5
2512,Good finds!: I have found some great deals here. Like the convenience of something like an online garage sale. Just like anywhere you find both decent and flaky people. Watch out for scammers! Stick to communicating only on the app to prevent the scammers. I reduced a star because the message part of it is quite slow. It doesn’t always refresh messages right away so often times you would need to go into the message inbox and reclick on that particular message.,4
2513,"Glitchy description entering.: I don’t know what happened to this app maybe the updates made editing, copying, pasting basically horrid. I don’t get this on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist app. I had to delete all the text and have a pre made description on my note taking app and paste them all at once. Fix the glitches, one positive is that you can upload all photos now without being stuck in download circle. Before I had to upload one photo and list it then go back and edit it to add the rest of the photos.",3
2514,"App not working correctly: I tried to make a purchase on an item and the app would not allow it to go through. I called the business who was selling the item to let them know I wanted to pay for it but offer up wouldn’t work. It didn’t let me send messages to the seller either. When I called the business to let them know I wanted to purchase it, they said to call back. I called back and they sold the item. If Offer Up worked properly, I would have been able to purchase the item. How many others has this happened to??",2
2515,"SHOULD ADD A SEND PICTURE FEATURE: OfferUp as a whole is a pretty good app for local buying and selling . HOWEVER, I do think that a send picture feature should be added to the text chat . They recommend not sending other ways of communication but if someone wants additional pictures as of now they have to make a whole listing. This feature would make the OfferUp messenger system more efficient and will make there no need to use other sorts of communication.",4
2516,"Love everything but the ads: I love everything about the app except for how many sponsored ads are displayed. It’s more than half the results ever since I updated and I just think it takes away from the real purpose of the app, which is to find affordable resale finds. If I’m on offer up looking for a rug, I’m probably not the target demographic to advertise a $16,000 Persian rug to with sponsored ads. Meanwhile, it only takes away from my experience as a user for having to scroll more and double check if I’m clicking an ad or not when I’m selecting. Just personal opinion though.",3
2517,"OFFER UP IS TRASH: To anyone who used this service years ago it is nothing like it was. I guess offer up bought out let go and now let go doesn’t exits which was a real shame. Let go was exactly what a person wants when doing this , offer up is currently full of fake people (bots) that pretend to buy my stuff daily. There are hardly any real people it seems on this app and it’s forced me to write my first ever app review. Please cut the crap and give us a genuine app for buying and selling things. I will not use this app until you fix this major issue of fake people. I’d recommend anyone reading this sticks to eBay and I’m about to test out varage sale. Good luck !",1
2518,"Disappointed in the new update: Offer up used to be so easy to use and loved to buy things because it was very easy to find what I needed. With the new update it makes it nearly impossible for you to actually find what you searched in the search bar. For example I’m trying to look up a Ford truck but instead of just trucks popping up there’s cars and other things that I don’t want to look at and it’s making my search very difficult. I hate this app I don’t even shop on there anymore because when I search for a specific item it’s cluttered with crap I am did not search for, I will be deleting this app👎🏼",1
2519,Offer up has gone bad: Offer up has always been mine and my moms favorite account to sell and purchase items. Right when OfferUp has partners up with Letgo everything has gone downhill . I never do anything wrong for my account to be banned and EVERY account I have has forbidden me to sign is and is always messing up on me and my mother. I always try and find a way to contact them but their is never any EMAIL or number . I’m just really frustrated at this point because I purchased products from sellers and can’t even see if it has been shipped or if the order even went threw to be processed!! . It’s really messed up and I’m so very dissatisfied and disappointed in what OfferUp has become.,1
2520,Very easy and convenient app: I love using OfferUp....cause a persons junk can be another person treasure! You will be amaze with things people are selling or things you can sell to make some fast cash! But just like any other app...always remember to meet in a public place and NEVER give your address to ANYONE! This app has really paid some bills in my household lol! I would recommend this app to anyone looking to buy or sell some new or used items for reasonable prices 🤩,5
2521,"Customer service BAD! Will not give your money back!: RED FLAG🚩 THEY DO NOT EXCEPT PAYPAL!!!!! Almost stuff on there is a scam! 
I made an offer on some shoes on the app. It was $45+$5 shipping so $50. Right when I sent that offer to the seller he accepted it and then few minutes later cancel the order. The money was supposed go back to my account. It said pending it would take 3-4 days put it back in my account. I waited and they never put it back in. So I contact offerup 3 times and said my money was back in my account when it wasn’t! I called my bank and they said the money was never put in my account so they lied . Also this has been 2 weeks dealing with this !!!!!!!",1
2522,"Nothing compared to letgo.: I’m in the northwestern Pennsylvania area, and letgo was quite popular here. Once letgo teamed up with offer up there are glitches on the app, not many people use offerup locally yet, and it’s a lot slower than letgo.       A bunch of scammers on offerup selling drugs for delivery fee. As well a lot of people giving away “free” Xbox’s and playstations for delivery fee.   You’ll never see your item or money back.  Also people don’t respond nearly as often on offerup.   Disappointed as letgo was great by itself and there is a reason I’ve never heard of offerup until the two teamed up.  
Sorry letgo team you got screwed on this one.    
Time to go back to Facebook marketplace...",1
2523,"B-: I love this app but still need a couple changes they should raise the limit to 2,500 on shipping outside your state and they should have instant pay so seller like I can get there money faster definitely wait till item is delivered 1-2 days and they should have a monthly subscription for sellers who sell a lot of items instead of paying for every listing 😳 but definitely recommend this app if u looking for anything u need for local purposes and shipping",5
2524,90% Great 10% Ok: The app overall is great. I downloaded it to look for cars and other things. I got good results but I questioned Some of the prices. For example at a car dealership a very nice car was $500 and I thought that was the entire price with no extra fees but I Later texted them and they said it was as low as that. So it would be nice to get the exact price. Again it is a lovely and smart app that gives you the ability to contact the seller it also gives the ability to sell your own belongings.,4
2525,"Untrustworthy: My account has been removed without warning because one person somewhere told them I broke a policy rule. I have a family and to help pay the bills I have been selling jewelry. I was enjoying the site and things were going ok until I just recently was informed my account was closed for selling illicit substances. I was enjoying the app, but this one is not good for sellers. Competition or any one can just accuse and kill your account. I have pending transactions I was counting on to help pay the bills. Merry Xmas to me I guess. The developers need manual reviewers. I have only been getting automated responses. I will find a way to make up for this but if you are looking to use this app, think again.",1
2526,"Often Buggy: Offer up as a service is awesome.  It’s been a good experience buying and selling using this service.  The app however needs work.  Always running into issues.  For a longtime I was not able to access the app through my WiFi at home.  Could not find a solution on the online forums or contacting Offerup.  Had to resort to switching to 5g to use the app at home.  Now it won’t let my post items.  Again, no solution for the error I am receiving and I do not have much confidence in customer support.  Will just have to find a way to work around this.",3
2527,"Worst customer service: It’s been has been 2 weeks since I emailed them about my account, every time I logged in they logged me out right back, I emailed them about the issues I be having,  they told me a specialist supposed to email me with a solution but still haven’t get an email.
I have 25 rating with 5 stars never had any with any of my customers, for some reasons they banned my account and I would like an answer on how to resolve that issue",5
2528,"Bad business practices. No punishment or acknowledgement given!: I used to love this “service” whenever I had to get rid of things or buy some stuff, but now...not so much! I bought an Xbox One from someone recently and it just sucked. I knew something was up when we situated a deal for really cheap, but I still (stupidly) went through with it. Gave the dude the money and then off I went. 

Well, it was a brick. Didn’t work at all. Contacted him...heard nothing. Contacted OfferUp and they said that there wasn’t really anything they could do since it was a cash-only deal—which I do get and understand.

However! They said they’d reach out to him to try and figure it out...but I never got an update. So now? Guess what? He’s selling a gaming rig and a car. WHAT? He has no ratings and he’s still selling things. He screwed me over and now he’ll do the same to someone else.

But OfferUp doesn’t care. Which is why I’m leaving this bogus “service” to go elsewhere...somewhere that is held more accountable when things go sideways.

Thanks for absolutely nothing!",1
2529,OfferUp is a Great app❤️❤️: I think OfferUp is a great app because it gives you the chance to get rid of things you don’t want anymore and get some money for it. I believe that the risk of being ripped off is very slim because of the system OfferUp has. I believe it is safe to say that everything you buy will be what you expect. Even I have a aguante at selling items that I don’t want anymore. I believe you can make some good money and meet some great people! Keep up the great work OfferUp,5
2530,"Decent app with absolute garbage support.: Pretty much being an app version of Craigslist, I really liked OfferUp when i first started using it.  For a couple years I’ve bought and sold a bunch of stuff with no issues. All that changed when the app stopped letting me make or receive offers and send or receive messages. 

At some point the app broke. I tried for three months to get support to fix my account before I gave up. There is no contact for support in the app. I had to go to FaceBook Messenger and Twitter to contact support. Initially they replied saying I would be contacted via email, but when I replied to let them know I hadn’t been contacted they didn’t even bother to read the messages.",1
2531,"What I think of offer up: I think offer up is really cool. Because I get to sell some of my items. That I don’t use. On the other hand, I get to buy inexpensive things as an example, an iPhone X. And the most great thing is we get to meet the person with the item halfway, or they can drop the item at my house. Also we can go to there house and get our item. Well that is just something I would like to say. And that you also know that I LOVE 🥳😄this app.",5
2532,"Buyers: Would like to find a way to rate people that don’t buy, but waste your time with many questions and say they will meet up but then never respond or follow through. Huge waste of time. And would be nice if the shipping price was automatically added to the buyer when they choose the ship option instead of purchaser having to add that to the cost of product. When I accept an offer then have to ad shipping to cover that cost it looks bad for seller and if it’s not added then it comes out of sellers pocket. Should be automatically added on buyers end.",3
2533,"Disappointed: Up until about couple weeks ago, everything was ok. Since then my over 800+ sales are gone and it says I’ve only sold 6 things and purchased 100+, I can’t get any help fixing this pretty big problem. Tonight, I just noticed all my offers (over 200 items)  are not showing up and only 4 items are! This is really disappointing since before this month things were running along really well.",5
2534,"WASTING TIME: If you like wasting peoples time or like your time to be wasted, then this is the app for you. You will have plenty of individuals text you that they're interested in your item, then set up a meet up and never show up. This has been my experience and that of others on this app and other similar apps. 
This app is not the problem but the people that are buying stuff here. There should be an option to rate the buyers on how unreliable they are.",5
2535,"Sold items: Why are items that have been sold and not marked “sold” still listed for sale(ask/offer). When an item is sold and it is still listed, a message shows up that “those items have been sold”, but it doesn’t say which items they are referring to. When you have multiple items that you are following, it gets frustrating.",5
2536,What’s EBay: Since I started using the OfferUp app I haven’t went back to eBay because of all the hoops you got to jump through and on top of it they want to charge you. If you Have items that people want you’ll make top dollar but if you come here with trash you’re just wasting everyone’s time. As long as people keep it real and honest this is a great place to sell your items not to say that there are not losers out there trying to scam u cuz they are. Just be careful,5
2537,"Great app, improvements still need to be made.: Newest version won’t connect. 

I always get responses when I send help requests. Last time I was notified a fix came out for a bug I reported. The app is constantly being improved. 

Users who are reporting there ads getting deleted re-check the rules they have changed and are more strict then other apps. They do not allow stock photos, animals or home made food. Which I appreciate.

The only annoyances I have are two many car dealer ads. They do not allow ads but allow car dealers. I still don't understand that one.  You can't delete messages and people who click buy and never respond, then your stuck with messages until you archive you're item and start over.

Overall this is the best app I have found. This one also has more users then the other ones for my area.",4
2538,"SCAMMING CENTRAL: I have attempted to make multiple purchases on this app. Every time I wrote someone about an item or try to send an offer or try to make a purchase it would automatically cancel. On top of that, whenever I would write three different people about a product it’s the same person. they were the exact same messages in the exact same order and they would keep canceling my purchase and ask for my personal information and say the app won’t let me ship but we can ship it USPS and then you just send me the money outside of the OfferUp app. I would never trust this app. Mercari App is the safest place to sell and buy used goods.",1
2539,"Junk App: Twice I purchased items at asking price. Both times the buyer said nothing and the sale was canceled a day or two later. No messages, no explanations, just wasted a day of my life. This is from sellers with high ratings! After this happens there’s no way to complain or give someone a bad rating. So I’m just going to give offer up a bad rating. 

Also it loves to switch you to search for jobs, so many times I tried an item search but somehow it had switched to a jobs search. Another waste of time. 

Finally there are junk ads that popup on certain screens…why do they need junk ads if it’s a legit business/app?",1
2540,Hidden treasures: This might be one of the best apps to find all kinds of broke down items for cheap. You break it I’ll fix it.  The only negative is not the site but the people who DO NOT follow through when they say they want something. There should be some sort of account suspension for those not following through or the lack of communication after they “commit” to an item. Thank you Offer Up!,5
2541,"Offer Up used to be great until: I used Offer Up for a couple of years and was really starting to like it, as well as starting to generate a lot of sales.   Then, out of nowhere, they deleted my account and told me that I violated their community guidelines and told me that I would never be allowed back on.  But here’s the thing, I have no idea what I did wrong, and can’t even imagine what the mistake I might have made could have been.   I have tried reaching out to them for support, but have received no response other than being told I violated community guidelines.   It is frustrating because I really was starting to enjoy using the app.",1
2542,Used to be great: This app used to be great. Unfortunately it’s now clogged up with hundreds of duplicate ads from dealers of all kinds that post every single day. Do the operators of this app honestly think I’m browsing for NEW goods offered by stores? The whole idea behind this was that this is people to people. The dealers have gotten good at hiding that they are in fact sealed until you click on the ad. No filter for dealers has made it unusable for many types of items. Now throw in forced ad viewing and I’m just going back to Craigslist and FB marketplace. Why would I pay a premium to avoid forced ads only to be bombarded with all the dealer listings.,1
2543,"Don’t sell in 1st Day, or PAY $ then FORGET ABOIT IT!: This App used to be 1 of 2 best for selling. Every since they added “BOO$TING UR ITEM$” & whatever algorithm they use for not PURCHASING the “BOOST POST” option, you’re 99% sure not gonna sell or get over 30+ views per item, POPULAR or NOT it’s gonna sit. You’ll get more Ads from the App to LIST MORE ITEMS, than BUYERS. Your BETTER OFF ON ‘FB MARKETPLACE’ ‘EBAY’ or literally ‘CRAIGSLIST’ yeah I know who would think ‘CRAIGSLIST’ would sell the same LISTING BEFORE ‘OFFER UP’. I wanna say in 3ish YEARS ON OFFER UP IVE SOLD ZERO ITEMS & GOTTEN ABOUT AVG .25 messages about LISTING! So frustrating that OFFER UP would put MONEY & ADS before GIVING SELLERS A WINNING CHANCE. THIS APP OFFER UP IS A COMPLETE “L” FOR LOSS, LOST, LOSER, LAME!!! SELL ON MERCARI ALSO IF YOUR GONNA SELL OUTSIDE YOUR AREA!",1
2544,"Great app: I shop here all the time, great all around and I like the shipping options that they have and to verify the order when it gets to your home or place of business. One thing as a shopper or buyer. They need to have a time limit on some of these posts. I am seeing posts from like 6 years ago and thats a really long time! Perhaps posts should be automatically deleted after a year as past to keep all postings updated and current?",4
2545,"Easy to use but no real buyers: The app has intuitive functionality, but my listings have sold elsewhere. The messages I receive from this app are generic, like “is this available?” but no response after that. Also I have more people on this app ask whether I will ship a large piece of used furniture, although I specify local only. 

Your company should merge with Craig’s List. I’ve sold more stuff on there lately than FB mktpl, but their interface for making a post is atrocious. That’s my marketing suggestion for today! Lol. Good luck!",3
2546,"Too Annoying: The app sprinkles in ads throughout the posts that you’re looking at which makes you more susceptible to accidentally tap on one by accident. When this happens it throws you out of the app immediately and on to some other webpage. On top of that, now the app completely interrupts your session and makes you sit through an ad for about a minute. Also, no matter how many notifications you turn off, they still find ways to bug you. There are way too many other apps that don’t use these ad tactics for me to stick around with this one.",2
2547,Needs auto cleanup of ads: Platform is surprisingly popular for how riddled it is with old ads. The search functions are no help in finding sellers who are actually monitoring their ads and will really sell. Their reviews are inaccurate because their is no rating impact when they don’t respond. One only rates those who you buy from.  I give it 3 stars because lots of users here. But the developers aren’t addressing issues of old obsolete content.  Need a way to see items posted in last 6 months or similar.,3
2548,"Good, could use a couple improvements.: Great platform and app. Have bought and sold multiple items successfully. 
Would love to see a couple updates:
-I often send messages to a seller only to never hear back and the app shows that they have never read the message. Would love for there to be a time-out or some sort of way to indicate that a seller has become unresponsive to messages. 
-when I search for something I usually find a few that are recent postings, then it will jump to postings from 2, 3, 4, years ago. Seems like it would be good for postings to be automatically removed or archived after a certain amount of time. 

Will keep using. Love the updates that have have been put in place already.",5
2549,"Overall not bad: The app overall isn’t bad.  However, I wish it would give users the ability to either hide things they don’t want to see or users they don’t want to interact with any longer.   I do agree with another review, if the item has been posted for more than 4 months - it should be automatically removed.  And if a person isn’t replying to messages, then they shouldn’t be allowed to post. Everyone’s time is valuable.",4
2550,"People don’t treat the app seriously: This app is very user friendly and has a wide variety of items for varying prices. However, the reason I’m not awarded the app 5 stars is the quality of the user. Dispute a user have if a good reputation on the app. I get many offers and even when I accept their offer with no negotiation, no response. This has happened significantly more frequently then getting a legitimate buyer. I feel people treat the app as a video game rather than a marketplace.",4
2551,"Bad Customer Service: I have used Offer Up for a few years. The application itself is good. The search engine still needs work. For example: if you put your settings for Local. You will still get out of state item generated in you search. 
No here is why I gave a 2. The customer support is none existent. I posted a brand new unopened Fire Stick. The item was removed from Offer Up. I received an email stating that it was against their policy to post such items. I did not know. 
Then my account was banned / closed. With another email stating so. I pleaded my case. 
As I researched how me much to sell it for. I saw a plethora of Fire Sticks being sold. So I posted mine. 
I understand that they removed the item. But since I am not a habitual person that does this. I would assume that my great sell’s recorders, and 5 star reviews would be taken in account. 
From what I have read and looked up. I will not be able to reopen my account.",2
2552,"Offer up is 75% for the buyer: Offer up is 75% for the buyer and 25% for the seller.  This is an app where buyers want a GREAT deal and will ask for a lower price, even if you the seller, think you have priced your item way under value.  Don’t be offended, post it somewhere else if you want more money.  If an item you post doesn’t sell the first week, you better mark it down or archive it if you don’t want to mark it down.🙃 It is still fun to make a sale and meet people.",4
2553,"Unsuspecting sellers beware: All the hassle of eBay, with a few flakey customers from Craigslist, only looking for giveaway prices as if you just set it on a table at a yard sale, but instead you have to message them over and over, coordinate, no shows, and pay offer up’s fees. 

And even if you do find a actual buyer, it’s been rigged to favor scammers who use the system to screw the seller out of their money in the end, and that’s run away legit sellers to the point that legit buyers are gone too. 

The app works okay, but the company needs to advertise and promote this to get more buyers, otherwise it’s just dying a quiet death. I shouldn’t have bothered with it.",1
2554,"Lots of scam and lack of customer support: Lots of obvious and not so obvious scam. Got a seller that ask for release of payment before shipping and OfferUp won’t help and won’t contact back to help solve and had to wait. Customer support are nonexistent which is just as bad as the scammer, both will never contact you back even with so many reports and attempt to contact to get help to cancel order. Better to use eBay if ordering anything to ship. At least they have someone to help

Really feels like offerup customer service just doesn’t care, which is really bad when they hold your money for a few days even when you encountered a scammer seller.",1
2555,Used car lot post: This application would be way better if it wasn’t swamped with cars . So many post of used vehicles of all kinds from used car lots clogging up the feed . I’ll post something for sale and it gets lost in a sea of used vehicles. I’d say more than half of the feed is used car lot vehicles. This is the main reason I stopped using this application. I used to sale things regularly on here but no point in it if people can’t see your post from getting lost in between vehicles.,3
2556,"Not bad, but can be better.: From a seller’s point of view, it lacks:
1) Ability to search in your inventory of listed items. 
2) Ability to delete a listing.  Now, you can archive or mark it sold only. 
3) More shipping choices: 4oz, 8oz, 1 lb, plus the current ones. 
4) Ability to cancel an accepted order, if you can’t fulfill the order. Example, during packing, I broke a fragile item. I waited 3 days for the order to be canceled automatically. Meanwhile the buyer’s money was kept hostage. 
5) Ability to make changes to you listing from OfferUp’s website. The current website functionality is at bare minimum. I could update my inventory much better using a full keyboard computer than my phone. 

Despite all that it is still a good app and I appreciate all the folks who are making OfferUp possible. 

Harry",4
2557,I do like this app but…: It needs to have better sorting options.  Like you should be able to sort by distance but also secondary be able to sort by how long a post has been listed.  Simple things like that would make the app work better.  The sorting by just one option isn’t enough.  You can get distance closest first but see listing from four years ago.  You can see the newest listings but they’re at the furthest point of your search radius.  It become unnerving and daunting after a while.,3
2558,"App is good but has sellers scamming!: lately, it's been crowded with scammers who sell something at a very low price with a scenario of having a wedding anniversary, birthday, child passing (unbearable), graduation, etc. i have been scammed by one of these scammers, so please, do yourself a favor and stay away from items which are being sold for way lower than they should. and for the app developer, please scan your sellers! right now, you basically have 1 scammer with multiple posts from multiple users, and they joined a month after the other.",3
2559,"No accessibility functions: When I first use this app, voiceover was able to read properly labeled buttons and I was able to navigate through the app successfully. Now after a recent update, no buttons are labeled and navigating through the app using voiceover is impossible. This is no good. I am unable to make any changes to any items that I had for sale previously, because it is impossible to navigate the application now. Please, for the love of all things, update your app by labeling buttons properly for those of us that are visually impaired and depend on voiceover to navigate.",2
2560,"💵💵💵: Great and simple way to get stuff you don’t use to a home where it will be used and get a little money in your pocket. Also a great way to acquire things you need for less then they would be in stores. 

Only thing I don’t like about Offer up is coordinating meet up times with sometimes unreliable buyers / sellers, but that is more so just an annoying fact of life then it is the fault of Offer Up.",5
2561,"Broken messaging: Conversations not working correctly (not at all) means the app as it stands is useless.  The notification works, the supporting email works, but viewing the message through the app in any way does not.  It’s only saving grace is the supporting emails which can be responded to via email only.. do not click “reply in app”. That will bring you to a black screen void.  I refuse to connect my phone number to the app.  The whole point was to have all communication done via the app!  If you can’t communicate you cannot buy anything much less try and sell something.",2
2562,Love the app but needs a few updates: I love the app easy to use to post things you want to sell and even find things your looking for  but if You change my mind in wanting to sell the item you have listed or I sell it on another app you aren’t able to just delete the item like all the other apps do. This app doesn’t make that an easy option as of yet definitely something that needs to be looked into. As all the other selling apps even Facebook Marketplace have this option.,3
2563,"I DON’T NEED A NURSING BRA!: I’m in my 40s, and I’m a guy so why does Offer Up think I want notifications about nursing bras for sale? (who would buy a used nursing bra? Gross!) I was searching for a new desk chair and in scrolling through search results I accidentally clicked on a post for a nursing bra. Two problems with that: 1) why did a posting for a nursing bra show up when I searched for a desk chair?  2) why am I getting notifications for new postings of nursing bras and not desk chairs, or car parts or tools? Those are things I have searched for and spent time viewing. 

This app has great potential but development efforts have been wasted sneaking ads into the listing views and providing stupid “intelligence” based on user searches.

The app developer needs to be refocused on
- better security to reduce fake accounts
- intelligent controls that the user can adjust
- throttle back the amount of ads and make a clearer separation between advertisements and user posts",2
2564,What happened?: I used to love this app because I had a lot of useless stuff at my home and I can earn money too by freeing up some space! But 3 days ago I was going to post something so I can sell it and it said it was posted but when I checked it wasn’t there I tried even talking to people on the app trying to test it out but no reply it was as if everything was blocked for me so please fix it.,5
2565,"Great but many old posts: Great app but maybe the devs should pause posts over a couple of months old. Most older posts (years!) are probably gone but users forget to delete the posts. There’s too many old posts to scroll through and is a waste of time. If things are really still available the system should let users know their ad is paused and needs to be reposted to keep it alive.

Also having a link to post suggestions instead of leaving reviews to let them know.",4
2566,"Just ok: I’ve used Offer Up for a number of years now, and I’m still lukewarm on it. I’ve found that the community has really tapered off and it’s difficult to find people who are buying or selling quality items and who are generally friendly and courteous. Most of my interactions range from fine to poor, and I see myself as a generally pleasant buyer and seller. 
Additionally, I get notifications regarding incoming messages intermittently, which has taken my profiles replay rate down from 100% to 85% for no reason, when I prided myself on being responsive. 
Overall, the app is fine, I probably wouldn’t recommend it.",2
2567,"Money laundering front: If I could give this a zero star rating I would because this platform is a criminals dream. This platform is incredibly hard to get ahold of ANY kind of customer support and no real way to verify the person buying from you is who they say they are. 99% of the time the people ghost you and waste your time and energy.

Offerup’s idea of “customer service” is just to repeatedly deliver you back to their q & a page. Very unhelpful, especially when you cannot report the person performing fraud through their app because they can just make the account disappear off of their platform. 

Overall this is an incredibly shady platform that I would not recommend to ANYONE!",1
2568,"I Hate the new app update!!!: I have been with OfferUp at least two years.  I have 153 reviews, so I’m not new. I have tried to contact you but only gets me to most common questions. This is the only way I have found to let you know how I feel about the new app.  My inquiries have been reduced and I can’t look through the people “I follow” postings anymore.  Since people don’t always post in the correct classification, I can’t count on search to find what I’m looking for. By going to the “people I follow”, I can look through their postings. There is no tech support for the app. I’m so unsatisfied with the new platform I think I will stop posting.   Two months ago I would have rated OfferUp 5 stars.",1
2569,"Who let the dogs out????😡: I NEVER cared for OfferUp!!! But I LOVED letgo!!! I am so disappointed with the merger of the two! All my information has been lost!!! Plus I was in the middle of purchasing items, but all information gone!!!😡My log in information is WRONG!!! I have been trying to figure it out, because there were certain items,I was truly interested in!!! But unfortunately, like everything else lately, all that is good,turns bad!!! Who let the dogs out????",5
2570,"App used to be great  but bugs with tracking shipping: App used to be great  but is bugging with the scanning of usps tracking number creating a huge mess with Item for Sale. Customer support is not answering in more than a week. Tried their offerup twitter support , their offerup facebook support and support from their own website but not even one answer.
For that reason i give only one star untill they fix those problems.",5
2571,"Scammers: This app is such a scammer for the sellers. I have gotten scammed on this app five different times. I have lost so much money, it isn’t even funny. I had to go to my local police and file police reports. These people on here are frauds. DO NOT trust these people on here. I can’t tell you how bad people are on here. Also they message u but once you make that payment they stop messaging you back. There isn’t any way to call for customer support, and when you report them all this app tells you is go to ur local police place and file a report. Like how is that suppose to help me. These people are all over the world, how can r local police do anything. They can’t get ur money back. DO NOT USE THIS APP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
2572,"Horrible customer service moved to LetGo: Used OfferUp for a year with successful meet ups through the app until OfferUp banned me once I tried getting help with my account. I recently tried to get help with my account because I started to get no views on my listings for about 2 weeks. After the second week, I made another account to see if I still had the problem. So I emailed customer service on why my account had no views then they banned me for opening up another account. I believe OfferUp bans your account if you don’t use their shipping services within a year. I recommend LetGo if you don’t want to waste your time on OfferUp.",2
2573,"SUPER FRUSTRATED: location randomly changes: SUPER FRUSTRATED My location randomly changed from Waddell, AZ to Seattle, Washington. I’m talking multiple of posts. At least four. I’ll change it back and it changes again. I changed my password thinking maybe I was hacked. My son started posting for me on his account. It started happening to him but at least a close by city in AZ. I haven’t even been to Washington in 25 years. It’s not my phone’s location. I’ll have people contacting me from Arizona and then the next day from Washington.  I then have to go back in and change it again. I haven’t figured out how to contact anyone from OfferUp for help. OFFERUP PLEASE FIX!!!!!",2
2574,"Offer Up Beats Craigslist for Security: I have been a frequent user of OfferUp and Craigslist for 5 years. I very much prefer the security of OfferUp. I have a profile buyers can see and I can see their profile. 

When I list with CL I immediately get 2-5 scam computer generated replies from distant phone numbers. I do not get any from OfferUp.  

Things to Improve:  OfferUp should expire listings after 90 days automatically. Too many things hang out there long after they are sold.",5
2575,"Not happy at all !!!: I’m at one point I loved offer up. Now it’s become a huge headache and has caused me so much stress ! 
Not only did they remove 926 listings as an error they never relisted them. 
So I take the loss and start to list from scratch , I made arrangements with a few customers to come pick up merchandise and guess what , the site is glitching. Telling me to sign up for Tru You which I already did. You can no longer see my listings , I can’t sent messages. So now my customers are going to be upset because they are going to think I’m ignoring them. This is not a good look for this site. I email them , no answer. I go to Twitter , receive a response to DM them , I do and they don’t reply. This is a joke.",1
2576,App issues: So I love this App - I’ve used it for a few years and I love that it’s gone national. But here are a few complaints that I have. Selling books-I ship media mail and app doesn’t offer lower ship rate for media mail- you lose the buyers with the high ship cost of a heavy book. What’s up that I can only access your app in my LTE phone setting and not via WIFI. Correct this please or is it my community internet provider? App is def 5 stars as user friendly!,5
2577,"Great Platform, but still New: I’ve been using OfferUp for over 6 months. I’ve made at least a handful of purchases. You have to love the variety of what you can find, not to mention some of people you meet are nice. At times I’m able to get better deals and stuff that wasn’t included in the sellers post. I review has to do with there policy’s. I’ve had many of my posts taking down time and time again. After multiple edits and looking at the policy’s, I was clearly following the guidelines. So you have to word some stuff a certain way just to avoid them deleting your post. Definitely recommend OfferUp, it just needs a better system of handling posts not following the guidelines.",1
2578,"Items I Upload Don’t Show up: After I had a login issue for the longest time, customer service was a helpful source and issue got fixed - star for that!  However, after I started uploading items, at first, had many views, messages and offers. Then when I started to upload new items (once per week) I tracked that each item doesn’t show on the page and I don’t get views.  I find my (recent uploaded items) only when I search them by name - how can others find what I am trying to sell?  So, this is a very disappointing policy pushing users for an upgrade, best thing about an app or product is ‘honesty’.  Also, I’d rather see a ‘delete’ feature over only ‘archive’.",1
2579,"First impressions: I’m new to Offer Up. I listed 6 items, and soon after got 4 or 5 offers. I responded and none answered. After a week or so, I lowered the prices and got a few
more inquiries. I’ve sold half the items since and had good experiences with these buyers. 
I just wish that potential buyers would have the courtesy of responding once they’ve initiated an offer. 
All in all, I think Offer Up is a better option for those selling bulky items and/or don’t want to ship items, than are EBay, Craig’s list etc.",4
2580,"Way better than 2 other market re-sale sites: I actually was only using another market for used items. It was there I learned from another seller about this site and 1 other.  Between all three sites and apps I would say this is my favorite one with all the notifications, the cash register little sounds that you get with the notifications, and most sellers are reasonably priced. It’s easy to navigate too.  I am addicted to it 😍!!",5
2581,Not a good system: I like the fact that you can make a offer and lock it in. But the wait if the seller accepts the offer needs fixing. The offer will time out after 24 hours. But there is no consequence if the seller does not respond to a offer. This needs to be changed. The item needs to be either deleted of unlisted. I don’t like making a offer and waist time waiting if the seller will accept the offer. Loosing out on other items.,5
2582,"This app is a joke.: I seriously cannot understand how this app stays up without running properly. I’ve reported a ridiculous amount of people (fine - that’s my issues with them, but I don’t understand the point of reporting anything tbh), sold 2 items and shipped them at the same time, yet still waiting for 1 of the payments, constantly find out that people aren’t getting notifications (luckily I just keep opening up the app so I see if there’s responses)... suddenly I’ll have messages from 3 different people all at once. Can you not handle all the traffic to your site? It’s easier to go back to the good ol’ craigslist days. Wish I could work for you guys to get it straight.",1
2583,"Only one issue: I love OfferUp. Though not perfect, the community is a lot more legit than other selling platforms. I feel safer with purchasing from this site. The main thing I find to be annoying though, is that the prices aren’t listed in the feed. You have to click each individual item to view the price. I wish you could see them as you scroll. Hopefully enough people agree so the developers could update that soon.",5
2584,"Wish I could combine all my sells I’ve ever had: Over the years Ive had multiple accounts due to cell phone carrier changes, phone upgrades etc. I love selling my items on OfferUp over all the other selling sights. The only thing I don’t like is the fact that it’s so hard to communicate with OfferUp staff regarding issues. All together in my OfferUp journey I’ve had a total of 537 ratings with 5 stars. If your reading this try to help me get these back on my page thx.",5
2585,"App OK — Users NOT So Much: I’ve had an equal number of experiences as buyer and seller here; more bad than good. The interface works fine, but their platform insists on controlling communications under a guise of “safety”, but the messages are duplicated in eMail (with a lot of distracting, useless and superfluous garbage) and the timing can be confusing — sometimes the OfferUp app message comes first / sometimes the eMail. The difference can be several minutes, even hours. I rarely have delays using plain text messages. The main problem, however, is FLAKY USERS who lack the respect and courtesy to notify you if they get delayed or change their mind about a sale or a purchase after arranging a meet to consummate the deal.",1
2586,"Easy to use, don’t like online stores tracking you: App is easy to use, can spend ours browsing. 
Only thing I dislike is, once you click on an item, online stores offer you the same item either new or second hand also, which means somewhere your choices are tracked and suggested to retailers. It would be cool to only see the private party sales items that site was probably designed for, but I get running a site probably costs some money. Like it as much or more than CraigList",4
2587,App works well but too many notifications: Why? Why do they have to have a great product but feel the need to shove notifications down our throats? I have all the push notifications turned off inside the app but they still send reminders or recommendations. I can’t turn all notifications off or I won’t get messages when I’m actually trying to sell/buy things. I don’t need your app to remind me to go sell something when I’m already using it. Im already using your app so who are you advertising to? You’re just frustrating existing customers.,3
2588,"Reminder notifications: It’s very annoying when offer up sends me the generic notifications that basically are just reminding me that I have the app on my phone, if it’s not a message from someone who’s trying to buy something that I posted I do not want a notification for it. Hearing the OfferUp notification ping, then checking my phone only to see that it’s a generic notification from the app trying to get me to open the app and search for stuff that I’m not looking for is very annoying.  Could you PLEASE update the app to send fewer of these types of notifications",3
2589,"Unable to contact support / to question or comment: I would give 5 stars because it’s a ok app but I’ve experienced some issues, like not being able to connect when using a VPN. I’ve thought about doing the boost option on one of my items I am trying to sell but only having the option to pay by in app option is a drawback. It would be great to use a different payment option like PayPal, Venmo, or Cash app.  I’m also kinda bummed there’s so many prohibited items. Some of them don’t make any sense.",4
2590,"Im a fan: Si far I don’t like the lengthy period you end up waiting for payment but, in reality I do actually really love the audience I’m able to reach; the fees are high sadly forcing me to charge more just to get what I need for my items subsequently bringing down the population or demographic of customer I tend to attract based on affordability rendering my ability to make sales a little less likely or to move slower and I don’t know how m",5
2591,"Offerup: Was working fine until now I’m able to send message to people but seems like it’s not getting through I get no response and I’m able to post but it won’t go on listing and stays at zero views all I can do is view people’s items.
Solution I contacted customer service over 15 times and have been always transferred to this other department which never replies I missed out on buying stuff I wanted I’m using I phone idk what’s wrong with app even tried download and reinstalling it many other people have this issue will probably use other apps since no one is helping me from offerup support team it’s really disappointing been using this app long time and it’s not working",1
2592,"Suspended Account: This app has given me the worst possible experience with customer service that I have ever had to deal with. Not only can I not get an answer as to why my account was suspended 3 separate times, but they even admit it was a technical error and reinstate it twice. The third time, however, I keep getting the same vague message that I “violated user guidelines” which I reviewed and definitely did not violate, and I can’t get a hold of an actual person to help me with this issue. All this has happened over the last 48 hours and I have yet to resolve it after constantly trying to get a hold of someone. 1 star is too generous.",1
2593,"Good seller, Honest, Open and friendly: I intend to buy an apple monitor from this guy. After talking with him about the condition of the monitor, I found him to be very friendly, open, and honest. I decided to schedule a time to come and see it. When I met him,  I found him even more friendly and especially very honest. I decided to buy another monitor from him to make him happy. Thank you Charles Hopping. recommend this seller.",5
2594,"Easy to use: I’ve been using offer up for years to buy and sell household items. I like it most for its ease of use. Easy to post. Easy to communicate. Easy to find things. 

I’m a pretty cautious person and have found this app to be safe and secure. Sometimes my items sell faster than others, but I don’t pay for any extra stuff on the app so it’s pretty decent just using the free features.",5
2595,Seller Ratings are Inaccurate: There is no way to review someone who bailed on meeting up with you last minute. I had a guy that was supposed to meet up with me today but he messaged me this morning saying that he is selling it to someone else. Unfortunately there is now way to leave someone a bad review unless you actually purchased the product. OfferUp should really fix this in the app because it leads people to think that they are good seller when they actually are not. I will be using Facebook marketplace until this gets fixed because there are too many scammers on OfferUp.,2
2596,Do not use this ap: I have been using this app to buy and sell computer hardware and support my family. I offered $15 for an item that one person had posted for $60. He agreed and told me to meet at ‘laugh factory’ in west hollywood. I drove for 30 minutes tonbet there and after waiting for 20 minutes the guy started making fun of me like ‘go inside fun factory and make them laugh with your $15 offer’!?? Seriously? If my offer is low then just say its low. We got into a text war and i blocked him. Next day offerup blocked me!!! Sweiously? I was the victom not him. Offerup treats everyone unjust. Try to use facebook marketplace instead. DO NOT ISE THIS APP. Lots of scammers use it.,1
2597,"Can’t give feedback: It was easy to use, and convenient for communication between buyer and seller. But when it came time to leave a review for my seller, it gave me a notification but when I click on the notification to leave them a review, nothing happens. This leaves my seller without any feedback. This should be fixed as soon as possible as people rely on their reviews to be able to sell in the future. 
Otherwise it’s a great app!",4
2598,"Banning users for no reason.: I really liked the app at first, but then when they started offering promoting items at a cost $, views dropped dramatically. Suddenly, the only way to get views on the items you list is by purchasing for promotion. In addition, without violating any of the terms of service they banned my account for no reason - out of the blue. No warning, no mention, no explanation of what terms were violated. 

I did some research online to see if this was happening to other users, and the internet is loaded with complaints from other users experiencing the same issue. I think they banned my account because I had better luck selling my items on another platform (which they give you the option to mention when you unlist/archive the item). Really a disappointment. 

Also, their shipping policy is messed up. You can’t ship some small items, even if it’s in a category that should. 

eBay, Etsy, Craigslist, Nextdoor, etc…. All much easier.",1
2599,"Horrible App: There is way too much spam on this app. Every time I post an item for sale, I get a spam message from a fake buyer who is not serious about buying. I spend a lot of time reporting spam. Instead of having people spend money on promotions have people to pay a fee to use the app. This will deter fake users and you will have real people who are serious about selling their stuff. You must tighten up the app. Right now it’s a mess. Also, correct erroneous messages when reporting a problem. For the last week I have been getting a message “oops something must be wrong.” This app is way below where it needs to be.",1
2600,"OfferUp Review: Amazing. Whatever you can think of you can find it here cheaper. I am a huge sports collectible person, and I find Jerseys here that are usually 130 bucks, and find them for only 40 bucks. Also a very safe messaging system, no pictures can sent, leaving the bad pictures people may send to you out of the picture. The people are very friendly and I highly recommend.",5
2601,"Customer service issues: Customer service is absolutely useless. I just opened an account, have never sold before or bought before, yet somehow have a rating of 3 stars. When I reached out their first response was “we cannot change ratings” without even looking at my question. When I asked how I even had ratings on a brand new account, they said it was because my account linked to my Facebook one. Which also doesn’t make sense, as I have a 5 star rating there. It seems very fishy as that will deter people from buying from me? But they refuse to change it, which also makes me wonder how legitimate this app is.",1
2602,"Great app, needs QOL updates: Overall great app but would like to suggest some quality of life changes:

First off, it is incredibly annoying having to set my preferred distance range every time that i open the app. There should be a way to set default distance/local settings so that they stay the same until changed manually.

Secondly, we should have the option to set filters on the home page. All the options we have for filters when you search for a specific item should also be available on the main home page.

Third, we should be able to block a user without having to report them. Sometimes i encounter people who will try to make repeated lowball offers and while they are not doing anything wrong, i simply don't want to deal with them.",4
2603,"Not Worth It: I’ve used various methods before such as FB Marketplace, Etsy, Craigslist, EBay & Poshmark/Mercari for almost 10 years. I recently decided to try OfferUp to sell an Instapot. Upon delivery the buyer requested a refund and submitted photos of the item seemingly beaten in with a smashed lid as if some had taken a hammer to it. In the photos it shows that the box and packaging totally intact. When I reported that as suspicious to OfferUp I was told that unfortunately nothing can be done and the damaged item will be returned to me with the funds being refunded to the buyer. I feel like I’ve been scammed and was given no direction from customer support. I advise against this platform wholeheartedly.",1
2604,"Trash app: I’ve been using offer up for years, and I have to say I’ve hit a point where I’m extremely annoyed and frustrated with this app. I click one car and suddenly my whole page is full of mostly cars (90%). Not to mention the garbage ads I accidentally click every 2 seconds while I’m scrolling. At least ask me if I want to switch to a web browser before directly taking me there away from offer up. Offer up has been going down hill over the last few years and it’s sad because I used to enjoy it. My advice is go to Facebook market place at this point. I’d put zero stars if I could.",1
2605,Lack of customer service.: I keep getting kicked out from offer up and it does not give me a reason why? I had over 170 5 star reviews. I make another account and I get kicked out again. I message ppl and it sends however they never read it because it gets blocked by offer up. And then offer up had a really bad tech support. Doesn’t even have a customer service number and the email is pretty  useless as one never gets an email back relating to the problem. It’s just an automatic email and no real person looks at the problem trying to be resolved. Customer service is non existing if problem arises.,1
2606,"HORRIBLE FOR SELLERS: If you want to sell your product via shipping, you might as well go to your local street corner and hand it out for free. There are zero protections for the seller. Products arrive to the buyer and they can literally claim ANYTHING is wrong and get a full refund. Product damaged? They don’t have to submit photos and there isn’t a way to get the damage verified through the app. They’re supposed to send the item back, but good luck actually getting your item back and in one piece. Customer support is probably the worst I have ever experienced. Their entire purpose is to protect the buyer. DO NOT USE THIS APP unless you want to lose money and your inventory.",1
2607,"The problem with adds: The app itself is fine, very usable. But the advertisements have become a problem. They’re too hypersensitive. They activate just scrolling over them. In a 5 minute window the app will redirect me to safari to download something or other up to 4 times. I never click on the adds. They genuinely open from being scrolled passed. And the placement is fine honestly the adds are well implemented where they wouldn’t be intrusive if not for constantly taking me off the actual app I’m trying to use. Completely opening another tab",2
2608,Need a lot of work: I try to buy something on this app and I get no response from 100% of people . A lot of items are on here for years so you’ll be wasting your time trying to find something you need . There are a lot of scammers on this app as well . You need to be careful and watch out for newly made accounts and accounts that have repeated/screenshotted images of the item . I’ve tried to contact someone about an item for at least 2 weeks now and NOBODY replies . There should be a feature where items are taken down if they don’t get sold . Too many fake accounts . Will be looking elsewhere to find things I need .,1
2609,"PLEASE,remove stuff that is not available: They really need to purge people and ads for stuff that isn’t available. Nothing is more aggravating than seeing just what you been looking for and then notice the ad is 3 years old. Ugh   Also purge the crackheads that don’t accept the money for crap they selling. Why put something for sale if you don’t want to let it go for your asking price.",5
2610,0 stars if I could: I wish I could give this 0 stars. Complete waste of space on my phone. I wish you would bring back let go cause this is a horrible app. Had a profile for a good while and was told my account was disabled because of community guidelines. Since then I could not log in and they told me it would be deleted forever. So I make another one and no one has messaged me back on that one nor have they looked at anything I’m selling! This is a joke!!! Got an email today that they banned my other account for violating community guideline by selling drugs which had never been posted on my account! You people are a joke,1
2611,"Spam…: The problem with this app now is it merge with letgo… the reason I didn’t use letgo is because it was plagued with spam posts from pawn shop,multiple employees from used phone store,scammers, and search result... back when offerup app first launched I can easily find people near me.. sold and bought few things.. but now, after they merge with letgo if the items listed is some what popular.. you would scroll through endless spam posts from those vender I mention above that utilize their employees… when it work, it work… but I feel like they need to get spammers under control.",2
2612,"Back in the day.: I used to be able to sell or buy from locals with ease. Now, there are so many types of sellers. I see big box stores promoting in here and it’s not what the site used to be about. When I got laid off during covid, this was a great way to sell my used items and make a couple bucks to pay my bills. I can’t sell anything anymore on here without it being a hassle. This all happened, in my opinion, when you bought out let go. I am still trying on here but not as much as I used to. I now use Facebook or the Nextdoor app. Bring back the old style.",2
2613,Horrible customer service possible stolen card info: I did an update and I was logged off and now I can’t log in and after 15 emails they keep giving me the run around. I had high seller ratings and lots of sales and now I can’t get my account back. I had all my card info in there as well where I only used that card and now I had fraud charges on that card. I made a new account while they so call work on their log in link problems and their new update makes you click on their add links with out clicking them. Does it on both my phones as well so they most likely are doing fake clicks to get revenue very shady.,1
2614,"Easily scammed: If you are scammed OfferUp does not refund you

I had a situation where I sold a hair cutting system, paid $200 for it. I sold it for $80. OfferUp gives you 5 days to ship an item and on the 5th day I dropped it off. USPS did not scan it until the 6th day, and so OfferUp refunded the buyer, but my item was already in transit. By the time the item arrived I messaged OfferUp explaining that I sent off the item they paid for but OfferUp still refunded them. OfferUp responded with a worker named Jessica explaining they couldn’t do anything about it, and told me to message the buyer about it. Buyer has not responded. So, the buyer has a free item and I have lost money. Thanks OfferUp, very unhelpful team.",1
2615,"Promotes Spam and Scam Sellers: My posting was deleted because I didn’t put a picture up in time all while hundreds of thousands of scam post vehicle listings are left unregulated on this app’s marketplace.  So many 2012 vehicle postings who’s images look “brand new” but miraculously have an asking price of only $1200?  Why aren’t those postings investigated?  Change your guidelines !  I tried contacting their support team about this and not only were they unable to help I used up my free monthly vehicle post just for not uploading a picture in time!  I won’t be paying the 5 dollars to post on this marketplace, I posted on Craigslist because it’s more regulated!, sellers BEWARE.",1
2616,Works: I like this app. BUT you need to be able to send photos in private messages to people who are interested in your item and would like more photos.  Bc as of now there is no way and if you try and us the web version to do it it doesn’t sync with your mobile app and you still can’t send an interested party more photos of an item they are interested in. Love the app BUT not being able to send more photos in messenger is infuriating!,4
2617,"Overall good: The app is overall good think 2 improvements that could be made is the ability to delete or archive more than one listing at a time. Also the ability to pin a message as just one listing on possibly like a ending options automatically for each pot if you’d like. Bc it’s a pain to archive each post separately, it’s also a bit time consuming to have to post a message to buyers on each post (example where you meet)",4
2618,"Scam posts?: I absolutely love this app but since I’ve reinstalled all I come across is scam posts that always give me the same reply telling me to email their aunt or what not because they are selling for them. I emailed 4 of the ones I was interested in and what do you know. They all emailed back the same exact thing word for word on 4 different posts. It’s very unfortunate because it makes the app look 1 star worthy, when in all reality it’s a 5 star app with a few problems. Please work on this problem of scam posts.",4
2619,"Site issues are very evident: I have posted items with no response, nothing from no one and I have asked asked several people to buy their posted item... but I do not get a reply...nothing again from no one from no one. I have given my info and or items I am selling to people to see my page and they can not find it... and when they do it says I have nothing posted.... but I do. The really funny thing is I can see that people have viewed my items. Please fix this issue sooner than later because I really like this site but have to use another to move my items. I will eventually give up and not come back to this site if it is not going to work.",1
2620,"Truck and Cars: The trucks and cars are nice and priced pretty good, the only think is you do-not know if it’s real or not. When sending a message asking if about a Truck you get no response so you do not get the chance to make an offer, I have made offers for the full price and got no answer, if you request to see the inside of the truck you get no answer etc. I would love to buy a truck off of OfferUp but no one respond to the messages",5
2621,"No seller rules enforced, poor service: I went through this process recently, searched for a long while on Craigslist, OfferUp, facebook.  I finally settled in on an OrderUp seller had some communication, made an offer which was accepted, went to the bank for cash,  then the seller ghosted me.  I spent a lot of time and effort in this process now I’m back to square one and have missed out on some of the other items from other sellers so I’ll probably end up paying more.  Customer service didn’t care, they said they only deal with “serious” issues.  If there are no rules and accountability on sellers I think I’m done with this app.  I’ll stick to Craigslist, at least I know what I’m getting.",1
2622,Don’t ship items: It’s nice to sell stuff locally but when shipping items it takes FOREVER for you to get your money which isn’t okay ... once they rate it it should be released but they make you wait up to 5 days after the 2 days the person has to rate you ... totally not fair I feel after the buyer rates you should have your money or once tracking is provided half or something ... not fair when you send a product worth a lot you have to wait weeeks to be paid but the buyer gets the items no problem ... sucky stick to local only !,3
2623,Will never use this app again.: Purchased an item a week ago with the Buy-It-Now feature. Said offer was received and accepted. Paid for the item in full. The seller then messaged back and said they never accepted the Buy It Now offer? I thought that’s what but it now meant! Messaged the seller several times with no response back. The site said if the seller doesn’t ship in 3 days my order would be cancelled and my money returned. It’s now going on 6 days and item still not shipped. No the site says I have to wait 6 days before I can “maybe” get my money back. What a waste of my time. I will never use this app again. Lesson learned.,1
2624,"Too many scammers: It’s too bad that Letgo no longer exists on its own. I was a user of both Letgo and OfferUp (both as seller and buyer), but I found that Letgo was much easier, simpler, less ads, and many more real buyers/sellers. Now with OfferUp, depending on what I am trying to buy (electronics are the toughest), it is difficult to find legitimate sellers. I found there are so many people posting things trying to get you to send them payment outside the app “so they can ship you the item”. All the attempted scams and fake posts, people not responding, and the fear of someone trying to steal my money or hack my accounts has me looking for a different app to take my business to.",1
2625,"Cool Interface, Not So Cool Usage: Love the major facelift on the app and that you can delete messages. Though, after the update the app glitches when sending and receiving messages. It’s delayed or sends multiple notifications, even after you’ve read them. Sometimes it takes multiple times to send a message. You can’t follow people anymore or see the posts from people you used to follow. The algorithm or AI consistently shows items like the last item you looked at but there’s not a way to “reset” it. If these can be fixed, it’d be great.",3
2626,"LetGo was better: OfferUp is garbage. Way more scammers, difficult posting settings, and advertisements that get in the way of browsing listings and pop up in your message threads. It has a shipping option and some sort of way to save payment through them. When posting an item it’s a default selection to make your item shippable  This is not the type of app I want to use to sell off things in my area. It’s not supposed to be eBay. When OfferUp and LetGo came out, I chose to use LetGo because it was better in every way and now they have “merged,” I can’t get rid of anything anymore. No one serious uses this. I’ve gone back to Craig’s List.",1
2627,"So bad since recent changes! 🤬: Offerup USED to be a great app before merging with LetGo (also a terrible app). I would post items and immediately have multiple views and people messaging me. Now I post items and get ZERO views and no responses! I have had one item posted for over two months with only 2 VIEWS!!! As I have been a member for over 5 years I don’t really want to cancel and deactivate my membership, but it seems like that may be my only option!

You can message them on fb or on here and they provide you with an email address to send support requests to and you NEVER hear from them again!

Been so respectful to others, showing up on time, described my item in an honest details. Whatever OfferUp was asking endlessly of my personal info in order to continue use the app I was providing with smile. And outta sudden my account is blocked & deactivated. 

Great App but obviously too irresponsible on the way they treat their users! Like scammers all around I countless times reporting them to you as they obviously nonlocal who ask fo credential or contact out if the app, and my reward was to deactivate my honest real account. 

Such a sad story!",1
2629,"Waste of time: I used to use this app and made decent money for a while. Then it seems like all the people that used it got cheaper and cheaper. Always trying to get deals and making peasant-like offers for your items. It always seems to be someone who doesn’t know what GPS is or how to use it when it comes down to meeting someone to make a sale in person. And OfferUp now charges close to 13% for online sales. 
Forget about buying. Tons of fake items. People trying to sell their trash for a quick buck. Items are in awful condition and they’ll ask for full retail prices. Anything else of interest is going for way more than it’s worth. Just stay away.",1
2630,"No option to remove an ad?: So if you post something and decide later on to pull your ad, there is no option to delete it?  That’s kinda dumb. They tell you not to mark the item as sold if you didn’t sell it but how do you remove what you are no longer offering up? Also, the promotion feature is a joke. Here you are trying to sell an item and they are another app looking for money. All items should be equal, not promoted. Also there are a lot of people selling junk on here especially speakers with no-name brands and overhyped specs. Buyer beware. I will probably just opt to use Craigslist as I really see no benefit of offerup.",2
2631,"Needs a couple changes!!: I’ve been using Craigslist and eBay for over a decade and there are a couple things that REALLY need to be added to this app. Right away, you have to give us the ability to hide an ad, because I keep accidentally hitting the same ads that I’m NOT interested in. Another change that is needed is the ability to see the price of an item before hitting the item. It’s a waste of time to hit an ad only to see the price. Besides those two complaints, the app is great!",4

I had no idea about not being aloud to post these despite they are electronics and there was no tobacco or drugs referred to in the post. Personally I used them for vape juice that did not contain neither but that’s besides the point. They removed the 2 items then sent me another email stating my account was being deleted because I violated there policy which in fact I did but it was 1 time and I had no idea about not being aloud due to the fact I see many listings with the same products. Very quick to react and unforgiving at the same time.,1

Also I message people and they don’t get my messages! I deleted the app reinstalled, made new accounts even reset my active account, but not solved! I even erased everything on my phone and didn’t fix the problem! I even emailed offer up 2x and they never responded! Worse service of all time.",5
2635,Claim: I just recently bought a product and had it shipped and when I received it the next day I installed it but to find out that it was broken in the back so offer up has a protection plan . You have 3 days to inspect and get a refund so the next day I did a claim but was told I had to wait until I received the product to place a claim . I had allready received the product . I tried contacting them and no response I took pictures of the notification letting me know I couldn’t place a claim . A week later I finally get the notification I had received the product . A WEEK LATER. So I placed a claim and was told it’s too late . The app is horrible and service . I will be reporting this to the bbb,1
2636,"Functional App: The app works well, but is annoying. If you want to edit a listing, you have to flip through all the pages. Stupid. Worse than that is you cannot delete notifications or even shut them off. At least as far as I can tell. Today I got a loud notification about doll related items near me. Huh? I’ve never had any interest in dolls, and I couldn’t trash the stupid message. This app forces you to accept things that other apps provide options for. I only use offer up if something doesn’t sell on FB Marketplace. Which means not very often.",3
2637,"Some update ideas: *2nd request: Add an appointment option with a confirmation option and then an arrival option to track these people who leave you hanging after they rack up a bill and leave you in the dust... 
also a sham on you option would be greatly appreciated if they do this under their profile.  Quit window shopping on my page.

2638,"Nice when it functions as needed: Hey offer up, 
First my notifications stopped sending and now my whole phone restarts when I open your app for more than 60 seconds, what’s going on? Can you fix this for 11?

The app is great, what’s not so great are the users, no shows, selling prohibited items, no notifications coming in. Those are just minor frustrations though. I feel as though OfferUp is the best place to sell locally due to the personalization and level of trust due to the TruYou app that is used for further verification.",4

Then I finally find out that my account was tagged for some odd reason. I’ve may be sold 30 things total, all different, inexpensive and have perfect ratings from my sales so not sure why I’d be tagged??? I would recommend finding another platform as I am going to do.",1
2640,Offer up: In my opinion this app is so good because you pick up your items that I am you selected and you know you just people just put it up and it's no rip you know he could checkSometimes you could even even put up suggestions to a close item I know you just put links and can you know can we go you could ask before offering you know sounds it is it's a really good app.,5
2641,"Worst Selling App Ever!!!: I had to delete the app because I tried selling and there’s a LOT of scammers in the app trying to get your information. Finally I got tired and deleted the app and canceled the subscription I have to pay just to use the “WORST” selling app!!! After a few days they charged me $22. I emailed the support and this is what they said “ There are no refunds for charges incurred by the 3-day free trial. Additionally, there are no refunds (prorated or otherwise) for changing or canceling your Promote Plus subscription.

Mind you I was not on trial period as I have to pay upfront just to promote what I’m selling. So if you don’t want to experience what I have to deal with, better to stay away from this app and use other apps that are user friendly and doesn’t have a lot of scammers!!! I still have to make sure that they will not charge me again!",1
2642,Offer up is garbage: A couple months ago they deleted my account of 5+ years with many many sales and purchases. After using the app for years with good ratings for listing a item I purchased on offer up. I had already had item posted for sale for over a year. Also many others have the same types of items listed. Now going strictly by the tos the item is apparently a violation. But to have  an account many years old. And with good reviews just deleted. with no warning just a generic your listing has been removed. With no idea about being banned and a user life time banned is just trash,1
2643,No prices in app: When you search anything it just shows you a bunch of pictures of listings. No pricing or any other info until you click it. Absolutely idiotic design. Horrendous full screen ads that take your screen hostage. They need a relist/update feature. They need a block profile feature. So many accounts that spam your feed daily with scams or just businesses spamming thousands of worthless items. This should be a secondhand marketplace. Overall they are just way too slow. There’s no reason to use their platform over facebook.,2
2644,"Just ok: The app has lots of issues. When I used to list cars, they were rarely accurate with options and some makes were missing crucial details that made listing them (especially at $5 each) pretty irritating. Now they are insisting on getting a SSN to sell with shipping even when the law (really really stupid law) clearly states it’s unnecessary when a seller is under $600 for the year. Personally, I won’t be selling anything else that’s not local. They take 12.9% AND will not pay without a social. I’m out. Sorry.",3
2645,Member since let it go!: You sold your soul to the add company’s. Sorry to tell you that but you need to hear it. Some add like a third are scammers. You need to screen better not just swim in the money they pay. The view window gap in between the adds is small and if you scroll up half the page is covered by adds. Then you want me to pay to list a motor vehicle! Wow dude you have got too greedy. In closing you site is not that special but sure. But I have hope you will take this and make it better. Oh one more thing why can’t a photo be sent in message upon request?,2
2646,"Good for the most part: I like that you have a fair amount of buyers 
What I don’t like is the blocking of contact information. I want a buyer to call me so I know that are real not just messages. 
I am not happy about the fee structure either. There should be a tiered amount of flat rate ads. Why do you charge for Furnitire ads but not for video games etc? 
Lastly I prefer using a computer to post but you are unable to  provide that. 
Other than that offer up is good. If you corrected the above issues I would give 5 stars",3
2647,"They won’t give me my money: It has been 2 weeks since I sold an item to a buyer. The buyer was satisfied when the item received over a week ago. I have sent many emails because I have quick deposit on, and it still says I need to add a deposit account and my money isn’t even in my balance. No replies to any emails. Many sellers in this app have reported the same issue, and they did not get responses as well. It would be nice if we could receive our money such as we do in better apps like poshmark then have people waiting for months on end. It’s fine though because I won’t be using this app ever again.",1
2648,"Too many ads: I used to love this app I was on it more then any other app. Recently started having issues where it would tell me I had something in my inbox, when I didn’t. I uninstalled and reinstalled and oh my more ads then ever before!! And now It takes up your entire screen so you have to wait to find the box to close.

I don’t see myself using this app to purchase anymore due to this issue. I will have to find another platform to use.

Get rid of the ads. We are all on here trying to buy used items at a fraction of the cost and you are promoting things we do not want to pay full price for.",1
2649,"Potential to be great again: The most annoying part of the app is dead postings. Posts should have a shelf life with an automatic removal after 90 days. Keep it fresh, interesting and new. Absolutely no reason to search for something and have results that posted 3 years ago. In some cases 30 days is long enough. Frequently contact sellers and they state they sold it or gave it away and never updated the post. OfferUp should trigger an automatic update for removal that is time sensitive. It would greatly enhance the app experience and make the use of the app way more efficient. Purge dead postings!",2
2650,Ads? Seriously?: Talk about an app that sold out. For years offerup has been my go to app to buy and sell various things. But with their latest addition of ads that pop up when you make an offer or shoot a message is just ridiculous. Then they have the audacity to offer an “Offer Up Premium” upgrade. My brother in Christ you guys are artificially creating a hinderance to your users (who by the way have been upholding your app’s community for the last several years) then pushing them to give you money to fix a problem that you created for them. What a sham.,2
2651,Buyers: Too many potential buyers on this website or simply pulling your chain. What I mean by that is that they make offers and tell you they’ll be there and they never show up and never communicate with you after that. This happens at least 70% of the time. I believe there should be someway to write or somehow rate these buyers once they have contacted you so that other sellers can see how often these people don’t show up so that they don’t waste their time.,4
2652,"Could Be Better: The lag in performing different functions is frustrating. Too many times the screen icon indicates there in a message in the inbox, only to find it’s a glitch that won’t clear. Have to delete the App. then reinstall only to have to do it over and over. Also way too many ads get mixed in with the pages that are viewed. Even when to don’t want the App to track you it still does. I was generous with 3 stars, only because you can’t give two and a half stars.",3
2653,"needs a lot of work: (1) block/hide users from feed. (2) choose to hide/grey out listings you've already seen (3) scroll left/right between listings and not go back out to feed each time (4) Saved items: (a) need sort function by date/price, (b) ability to select and move/delete multiple items at once, (c) map listing (5) price on listing on main feed ***half these suggestions were available on letgo, offerUp is a sad downgrade ***also had issues with people not being able to see my items, including ones I paid to have ""promoted""",2
2654,"Hard to follow safety guidelines when messaging unreliable: I've been using OfferUp since it first came out but the reliability of its messaging system has gotten worse, not better. Just today, I wasn't able to access my messages at a crucial point in a transaction. Then when they came back online, the message I sent to one seller, went to another seller while I was waiting for them to meet me. I finally had to call their cell phone, which isn't recommended due to safety reasons, but I had no choice!",3
2655,"The user interface is soooo bad: I’ve been waiting for years for them to fix the user interface. I used Let Go because it was so much better but then they merged and still haven’t fixed the app. They really didn’t seem to think the layout through. You can’t see any of the prices or descriptions on the search screen until you actually click on the picture. Also they don’t delete/deactivate listings EVER. So once you finally find something you like, you click on it only to find out it was posted 4 years ago (and it’s likely not available at this point).

How are these not fixed yet????",1
2656,"Worse than Craigslist: 7 items listed. First response the person asked for my number. AFTER it was given, a message appeared warning me it’s not safe to give phone numbers out. That should have been advised while creating an account. Every last person who has since messaged me remind me of robot-callers; except these ppl demand your phone number and refuse to use the app messaging service. I had high hopes for the app after watching a couple of you tubers sing it’s praises. In a seller protection article, the app doesn’t protect sellers, only says they have investigators who work on the case(s).  Hope you have better luck than I did.",1
2657,"Used to be a good app: Wanted to sell my car on here, they told me I get 1 free car post a month, which is fine for me, however after I spent around 10-15 minutes writing the description for the car (has a lot of mods) and posting it, they took my post down, claiming that “I didn’t pay” to post the car, but it was my first car post. The worst part is that I had no way to access the post they deleted so I couldn’t copy all the stuff I wrote down. They also wanted $5 bucks to put up another post of my car. Tried to email them and contact them about it, but heard absolutely nothing. Stay away from this horrible app, Facebook marketplace is way better.",1
2658,"Nobody uses this there are no buyers: It’s an easy enough to use app, the problem is there are no buyers on this it’s just people trying to list our stuff. As soon as you list anything you get a spam message from some foreign country about four times for your “calling number” and then once every three weeks you get somebody asking about an item. I’m sure deals happen but I would say about 95% of the time nobody is looking to buy anything, Unless of course you are looking for a rare toy that you can’t find on eBay for a good price, and people just ask for that same price here, except there’s no recourse if it’s fake",1
2659,Unresponsive Sellers: I’ve asked questions and made offers on items and the sellers do not reply. I finally received a reply from a seller to purchase an item after messaging 20 other sellers to purchase the same item and this seller wanted me to purchase the item thru Paypal. I have listed a few items for sale and there are random people with no pictures or verifications wanting to purchase my items. It’s annoying that you want to spend your money and ask questions but sellers do not look at their messages. I made a purchase yesterday and OfferUp says the seller has a few days to ship the item to me so hopefully the seller wakes up and ships out my item.,1
2660,This is a great way to sell something and fast: I put a bicycle for sale on offer up and within 2 minutes I started getting offers. Meet up with someone and had the bike sold all within 90 minutes. And that was my first time ever selling anything on here. I also see they offer a shipping method for someone who would like to purchase but is not local. This is way better then letgo because I have used that in past.,5
2661,"Keeps logging me off right after I log in.: I don't know why but after my account that I've had for like 4 years, I try to log into the app or even the website and then it instantly logs me off again by itself.

Found out I had been shadow banned from OfferUp and for no reason given.  I had all top reviews, verified in all ways, sold and bought lots of things, paid OfferUp to spotlight my items, etc.   I have no idea why I was banned.  I asked customer service via email and never got a response.

Keep running your business like this and you will be the next America Online.  I.E. think your own farts don't stink until a few years later your out of business.",1
2662,"Letgo > OfferUp: Every day since offerup destroyed Letgo has been a nightmare. OfferUp, if you took a lesson or two from Letgo, you might have taken some of its users with you. I see why Letgo was such a problem for you. Every time I message someone on OfferUp for a local deal, they have posted their item several months ago and probably no one responded so they stopped checking. Why? Because for local deals you use Letgo. Now, still, I cannot sell/buy locally. I wish y’all would have stuck to your shipping game. Also, if you had let users bring their already posted items from Letgo, millions of for sale items wouldn’t have gotten lost in a dead platform overnight. Thanks for nothing!",1
2663,"Not happy: I miss the simplicity of let go. I don’t like offerup at all. I like seeing what’s for sale near me and I feel like Let Go made it easier for me to sell. As I know that offerup has similar features, it just feels like there’s not enough people selling or buying in my area like they were on let go... only people that are Interested in my items are from out of state and I’m not buying or selling anything to anyone out of state. I want Let Go to be its own app again. In my opinion offerup shouldn’t have been meshed together with let go. None of my data or items were even moved to the new Offerup/Letgo app so I had to start all over again.",1
2664,"Scammer seller and lots of fakes site: Some said this is a good site not in my experience. First! Encountered scammer seller twice already. I don’t like and don’t buy those counterfeits but they are not my responsibility so I don’t really deal with them. 2nd! This site removed my vintage LV bag claiming it’s fake! How could you say it’s fake minutes after I listed it? And how did you let those SUPER FAKE Louis Vuitton bag get posted?! Maybe my bag is also fake coz I got it pre loved and I never get it authenticated but it’s not one of those super fake that you have on your site posted. My bag doesn’t show any sign that it’s fake, it’s prints, craftsmanship, leather, and everything shows it’s real and more real than those on your site",1
2665,"YOU WILL GET SCAMMED: There are sellers on this app that will scam you and sale you broken/ unusable items. In my case, I was a first time buyer using this app and met up with a guy to buy a bicycle. The buyer stated that the bike was in perfect condition with no issues. When I got the bike home, i noticed (what I couldn’t tell from pictures) that the paint was rusted, tires flat, no breaks or break pads, no handle grips. Bike is basically garbage and now I’m out of $100. I tried to report guy and then he blocked me so no further  actions could be held against him. I am highly frustrated of this whole experience and will NEVER use this app for anything as there are no consequences for fraudulent sellers and they will basically steal your money.",1
2666,"Nuisance: Items listed on this app are often sold, but the sellers are too lazy to remove the ad or mark it as sold. Many of the items have been listed for months or even years!! Sellers don’t bother to reply when contacted as to whether their item is still for sale. Suggestion: follow a more evolved site such as CraigsList, put a defined limit on the amount of time a listing will be posted before being removed by Offer Up, or optionally re-listed by the seller. One month for items MAX.  STOP WASTING BUYERS TIME WITH ITEMS ALREADY SOLD!!! I do expect to get a response from Offer Up admin. (Note: Offer Up has no way that I could find to contact them directly, and that is poor customer service.)",1
2667,General relations report: I was robbed by a guy named Frank Castillo and he does lawnmower repair work . I reported him to OfferUp but he is still able to get on OfferUp with his listing thus making other people susceptible to falling prey to an unfortunate predicament as happened to me . I believe if someone reports an act that is against the law or to the well being of one through an OfferUp transaction that person should be held liable and blocked from posting anything on OfferUp,5
2668,"For the developers: I use this app a bit and overall really like it, I mostly use this on an iPad and a rally annoying problem I’ve been having is when I try to type something up in the message section, like to text someone, the keyboard comes up and blocks what I’m typing, I can still type but I can’t see what I’m typing,
If this can be fixed I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise, a great way to sell and buy!",5
2669,"I love this app!: I’ve sold and bought many kid items on here. It’s convenient and affordable. 
I just wish I was able to DELETE an item permanently, marking it as sold is not enough and archiving it will only hide it for ... I’m guessing a month, and then it comes back up. By that time I’ve put it away in my garage because it’s not in season. I sell a lot of similar items and would be nice to have more control over what I no longer want to show.",5
2670,"Vendors say “will ship” but won’t!: More often than not I will find an item for sale that the vendor has listed as “will ship”, but then refuses to ship!!! Most of the items I’m interested in are in other parts of the country, and this makes for a very frustrating shopping experience. I have money to spend and place full price offers on such items, only to get my offer declined because they refuse to ship (after they list it as “will ship”). This happens at least 90% of the time and I’m about to take my shopping dollars elsewhere. Can there please be a policy in place that vendors are only allowed to advertise as “will ship” if are actually willing to ship the item?!?!",1
2671,"Good marketplace, buggy app, poor online support: The app is ok. I frequently have to restart the app because it hangs when I make a posting (iOS, iPhone 7). Sometimes if you go a few levels deep looking at your postings it’s hard to get back to the home screen so the only easy thing is to restart the app. On the website you can view your products and chat with potential customers but you can’t edit your listings or create new listings... which would be a nice feature and something other marketplaces have had for quite some time.",3
2672,"No customer service: Are used to love using OfferUp but since my old account froze I’ve not been able to use it at all. There’s no exclamation what happened and there’s no customer service. A friend of mine had the same thing happened and she finally got customer service after a few months and they told her it was a technical glitch so it sounds like the website just has a lot of problems still. You could be like I was, literally in the middle of texting someone so you could pick up an item from them and then your account glitches and you suddenly can’t do anything at all. Not cool. Wouldn’t be so bad if they had a customer service department",1
2673,"Good Design, Poor Management: Summary: Hotbed for scammers, hackers, flakes and low-ballers...beware!

I like the layout and functionality of OfferUp. The only bug I’ve come across is an inability to mark things as ‘Sold Somewhere Else’ (denoting that the item has been sold outside of the OfferUp platform). 

Most of the items that I’ve posted have been sold off of the platform (to people on Craigslist) because I’ve gotten very little interest from genuine buyers. Most people on this app are scammers and hackers. People are rude, flakey and pushy.....some people even try to hit on me through the apps messaging platform. It’s been a serious headache dealing with all this trash. 

I know scammers plague these types of sites but I hope that OfferUp can do more to deter these lousy fake users because it’s barely worth posting on OfferUp at all 😞.",5
2674,Is shipping worth it?: I find that being from New Hampshire sellers are hesitant to actually sell you the item that you want because it’s oddly shaped or the weight of it is it really a flat rate shipping? And if the item is available then why can I buy it without a huge process of how maybe we’ll maybe and then not be able to buy it because someone locally was coming to look at it or something like that silly and frustrating,5
2675,They will let scammers take your money with ease: I used to love the app for simple meet ups but the buy and ship feature is just messed up. Twice now I have been scammed and The scammer gets away clean. First I buy an Apple Watch that never gets sent to me. Offer up doesn’t nothing to the buyer. Now I buy an iPad that the owner was deceiving about and is iCloud locked. That means I can’t use it AT ALL. So I’m short $200 and again in this case offer up did nothing to reprimand the seller. He is still free to scam others as he pleases. I wasn’t helped in either instance and it’s sad that they let this kind of theft to go on so easily while the users suffer the consequences. Extremely unsatisfied,1
2676,"Number#1: By far one of the best selling apps there is and ""FREE"" it can't get any better than that!!! Thanks ,only thing I wish you guys would show the price on the picture  it'll save us time,we won't bother looking if the price is too high. 

I love this app but now they show you items from far away from your home, what’s the point of adding the mile radius from your home if they’re gonna just show you what they want from super far away. ☹️",5
2677,"Inadequate payment scheme: The app is now biased against sellers. The new payment features are very inadequate compared to Facebook Marketplace: OfferUp charges a 7.9% fee, holds payment until a buyer “reviews” item and then tacks on another 5-6 business days. Payment is instantaneous in other apps, so I guess the OfferUp folks just want to make interest while holding sellers’ money. I will only allow in-person cash purchases if I continue to use OfferUp.

It’s already tough enough for sellers, having to deal with no-shows, flakes and low-ballers. You’re making Craigslist look like a better solution with every new nickel and dime dig into the seller’s wallet.",2
2678,"Easy and Convenient: I love offerup. It’s nice to communicate privately with buyer/sellers and sometimes form a buy/sell relationship. For instance with children’s clothes, I’ve found buyers with children just younger than mine who I now notify if I have clothes to get rid of. There are always bad seeds out there but I have bought and sold quite a few times and have never had an issue with anyone. I like the format of the app too.  Always meet in a public place of course!",5
2679,"Terrible app! Don’t get it!!: This app is all a scam, they will log you out of your account and won’t let you back in, it’s all a scam to take your money!!! They won’t let me back into my account! And they are just trying to steal money and trick you!! Don’t get this app!!!!!!! Trust me I am a honest, fair person, and this app is just ridiculous, it keeps logging me out and saying my password is wrong but it’s just because they are going to take my account for them self’s! And also I have tried calling them so they can help me get back in but NO they won’t help!!!! Don’t get this scamming app!!!!!!!!!!!!! And also it doesn’t let u do no stars you have to do at least one!!! How fake can this thing get!!",1
2680,"Not the only one: Seems like I'm not the only one who's been having the problem if there offers not showing up. I've contacted you guys for the past month and still no response. It's been getting really annoying because I've been an OfferUp member for over 2 years and have 245 good 5 stars and I'm a tru u member. It's annoying when I try to post and nothing pops up. I've contacted and emailed you guys and still, nothing. Please fix this issue.",5
2681,"Needs improvement: It has its issues that don’t make it easy to navigate items. You cannot swipe from one item to the next, you have to open one by one, going back in order to see the next item on the list. Also, you have to select the search area every time you open the app since it won’t let you save it in your preferences, it always goes back to 30 miles. Finally, if I remove a product from my saved list, it goes back to the first item, all the way up, and I am forced to scroll down again.",3
2682,Review4offerup: I like this app not only you can help people in needs you can sell some of your items quick for very reasonable price I never had this b4 I just find out that this is a good way to sell that you don't need in your house instead of keeping them don't throw them away if you know if is very good condition sell it. And my only way also to give it away for free and help also those people in needs thanks you offer-up (BE BLESS)😊😊🇺🇸🇺🇸👍🏻👍🏻,5
2683,"BEWARE OF SCAMMERS: I’ve had many people wanting to purchase things that I am selling but the people that contact me only want to pay through a check. I’ve told them multiple time that I do not accept checks and they consist on paying with a check and sending it through mail. I wasn’t so sure about this so I googled it and sure enough I discovered that this is a scam. People will offer checks as payment and then request that their mover will come get it for them. Do not believe this, the check will bounce and you will be lost without product. Be careful in using this app. Do not accept checks from anyone even if they offer to give you more money for the product. ITS A SCAM.",1
2684,"Duplicate adds - why are you removing them: I have an item listed once and decide to list it again, it’s different, yet the same item. 
After I post the second time, in only a matter of minutes, my first ad with all my detail that I did not include in the second ad is now gone. REALLY. . . NOT COOL!!!

There are adds that are 1-3 years old on OfferUp and are still listed and you decide to remove my what you think is a duplicate ad from my account. . My account is current and active.
I have every right to list it twice, say in two different areas like kids and then in furniture. .  
I do not appreciate my first ad being removed by you, it has all my detail in it that I didn’t transfer or copy to the new one yet. . . . 
I do appreciate what you are trying to do in keeping people from listing things 30+ times but what you are now doing is wrong.
I hope you reconsider your policy. 

Note - I was never informed of this change in your policy. . 
I do like your program but really, is this the correct way. . I hope not",1
2685,"New Layout: I’ve been using offerup for a long time now. I absolutely love it!!!! But the last change that was made, having all these different categories, just really stinks. I feel there should be 2 different ones, Cars n Trucks  &. General. I like to scroll through and see everything that’s out there to buy. Now if there is a way to do this, I’m sorry, I haven’t seen it yet. Please let me know. Other then that, it’s an awesome app and concept!!!!!",5
2686,"Banned me for no Reason: As one of the previous reviews stated that they were banned for no apparent reason I was also banned without an explanation. I was a very trustworthy seller with a score of 26 and five full stars. I took a lot of time on my ads, I was very descriptive in my listings I had lots of customers and now offerup took it all away from me. 
 They must not like experienced sellers. Don't waste your time with offer up, instead download Craigslist it's way better.",5
2687,"Ok, but......: This app been one of my best selling apps I have worked with, but so lately I notice that this app needs to grab more attention to costumers. I've been working with this app over 2years and everything has been fine to me ,but so lately this app been dusty and hasn't really brought attention to people. I highly suggest you to do some sort of update to make it more dull and popular. This well really bring attention to the app and gain more reviews and rates .",5
2688,Easy to use: This app is super convenient. Easy to upload anything you want to sell and only a click. It’s so convenient to buy also in the comfort of your own home. Always be aware and make sure to meet in public places or bring a friend or two with you for pickups you also have the option to ship items or receive shipping. Stay safe and happy shoppings.,5
2689,"Terrible experience: Offer up is an easy way to sell and buy things. But this has been happening a lot, someone tells us they are going to buy an item and they never show up! It is hard when you have two children to go out and sell and something when the person that wants to buy the item doesn't show up. Please make an alarm or something something to remind the person they need to go.",4
2690,"Keeps getting worse: On top of the problems that it's always had… You can only leave feedback for someone who buys something from you, specifics are awful, etc. Now there's a bunch of new settings in the search but you can't save any of your settings so every time you search you have to re-select two or three things. and now functions of the listing feature aren't working such as the toggle for firm on price does nothing. 

And now regular users can't see a listing for 30 minutes address posted. With as few hits as you get on OfferUp there's no point…

It's time to go back to Facebook marketplace.",1
2691,"Never Using This App Again: This app is a scam, i downloded it to get buys snd then all i got were fake bots trying to get my personal information. Another thing is I used a free trial to get my item further recommendations, yet even tho i cancelled the free trail it locker me in for another month anyways. I tried to cancel it but the app only said “we cant cancel subscriptions in the app” even though the free trial advertised an “easy to cancel subscription”. For a month now I havent been able to download, nor purchase anything in the app store or in-app purchases. Even Apple doesnt let me cancel and continues to try and charge my card.   Do NOT use this app.",1
2692,"Still Discriminating Disabling Certain Accounts: OfferUp continues to discriminate against certain sellers and continues to disable only certain sellers accounts with zero help from customer support. Even more ridiculous, getting daily emails from OfferUp for the past 6 months about how much “they miss me” telling me to “check out all the deals” when they disabled my seller account for no reason and NO ONE took the time to even read my appeals. It’s a slap in a sellers face to ban our account for NO REASON and then continue to send us emails to buy off of their site. I tell everyone to NEVER use OfferUp after what they did to me and other sellers!!",1
2693,"Awful Clickbait Notification Tone Can’t Be Changed: What if an app could use a tone as clickbait for its notifications? OfferUp does it. How? It misuses a cash register tone—a cha ching similar to the tone used by eBay when you’ve sold something or Venmo when you’ve received cash—for standard notifications.  So your phone goes cha ching like a cash register when OfferUp notifications hit your phone about some items it wants you to buy from its platform, or a seller replies to a message. So I end up turning off the sound and sometimes missing notifications.  Change this OfferUp!",2
2694,"It’s alright: Can only use in areas where people use the app or you’ll just get nothing. Also, the ads are insane, they are on every two rows of items and if you even touch near the huge ad block that takes up more than half a phone’s page, it’ll slow your phone down then open up your browser and take you to a link. And if you try to catch it early and swipe down, it just opens your Notification Center on iPhone… devs need to try using the app they created.",3
2695,"Not all it’s cracked up to be: You make people pay to post cars which is ridiculous because Facebook lets you do it for free with a much bigger audience and platform..  did you know you can post to 20 different groups that can possibly have over 100k — 1.m per group? Can I do that on offer up? No I can only post to my specific area… then you make it seem as if it’s guaranteed for an item to get sold when in fact there is no guarantee.
On top not that you promise a customer that they’ll get responses twice as fast but how can you promise that when you can’t force the other person to respond.l if they don’t want to.",1
2696,"Decent platform, just a little clunky and slow: This is a decent selling platform, but it is a little bit slow. It also doesn’t have really quick ways to delete multiple postings at one time. when you open a listing to edit it, you have to progress through several pages in order to get all the information. Facebook marketplace has a little more convenient posting platform.",4
2697,"Bad service costumer: I can't use the application because it won't let me verify my identity, when I take a photo of my identity document the application tells me that it doesn't detect the barcode on the document and it won't let me send the photo, I already tried from all angles possible with different documents and the same thing happens to me I sent a message to support they told me to install the application again I did it and the problem remains the same in the end they told me they were sorry about that but apparently there is no solution and they don't answer my questions messages to solve the problem",1
2698,"No words: The reviewer before me laid out a few specific issues with the app. And the Developer Response was to me a terrible response! Instead the Developer should had responded a thank you and had said we will surely look into these specific issues that you mentioned!  NOT… if there is anything specific we can look into, please contact us! Like really? The issues the person mentioned wasn’t good specific issues??? And that is why I removed the app and moved on! 
I wasn’t gonna ever leave a review! But I see not enough negative reviews are put up to make the Developer want to change! That in itself I only give 1 star.",1
2699,"Great app, worthless customer service: App is great for selling. Until you get shadow banned or blocked from using the app. Worse part is they give you zero insight as to why you cannot use functions of app it just happens without a reason. Then you try to email them and have to wait days before having someone try to help. Then reply back and have to wait a long period again. It’s ridiculous it’s 2023 we’re doing email support ? Come on at least hire enough people to be able to offer support via email. Super frustrating I am losing money because of this and you offer zero help no good for business !!!! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",1
2700,"Great app, needs more features: I love the app, but I think there are a few changes that could be added to clutter the market. Having pages go away when they are sold is one. I’ve also seen plenty of items from like 3+ years ago that are still here. Also an enhanced search would help ( new items in the last 30 days, 7 days etc) would help as well.",5
2701,Banned out of no where: I have been using Offer Up for a few years now and worked hard on building my account. This last month I hit 300 reviews and have a 5-star rating. A few days ago I noticed my new listings weren’t getting any views. So I reached out to Offer Up. They said my account got removed because I had “Prohibited Items.” All I sell are house plants! I emailed them back asking which items do I have listed that are prohibited? I received no response. I am beyond upset. There goes all my hard work and dedication. Beware to all sellers! Do not trust Offer Up and go find a platform elsewhere that is more secure and reliable.,1
2702,Used to be good: Not sure what’s been going on lately but the last few updates don’t allow me to go to my photo album when selecting photos to upload. This is a problem because I don’t necessarily always have photos that I took the same day. I am posting something that I took photos of weeks or months ago and I need to go to an album to find the photos so I don’t have to scroll endlessly. These recent versions of the app just glitch out and I’m not gonna scroll for three minutes to find photos. I’ll just post my stuff somewhere else.,2
2703,"Good app but filled with scammers: I’ve made some good sales on here and I’ve bought some good stuff on here. My only complaint is their lack of effort to stop you from getting scammed, someone sold me a broken item at a high price. When I contacted customer support to see what i could do about it they just basically gave me a copy and paste response about how they can’t do anything about it, they take no actions against those accounts. Not a report not a change in rating nothing. They’re free to scam the next person",3
2704,"Full of products from long-gone, inactive sellers: Full of products from long-gone, inactive users who have probably uninstalled the app. Why can’t OfferUp hide products from sellers who clearly aren’t active anymore? Why congest your marketplace with items from people who will never respond? I’m more likely to delete this app out of sheer frustration than I would be at a lack of search results turning up. 

I remember being frustrated and deleting this app myself back before they had fine grained control of push notifications, so that is a massive improvement and the only reason I don’t give up completely on this app.",1
2705,"Offer up doesn’t try to prevent fake advertisements: There’s a lot of people put misleading and fake advertisements to sell their cars at offer including fake adds and very low prices without inside pictures and offer up doesn’t track those as supposedly,I keep put notes to you on those thief's but you don’t follow them and try to prevent them from doing that,also people put unrealistic very low price for a car but when I click on it inside they said this is down payment only by at the main page they said the price as very cheap,",2
2706,"Too many ads at time of posting: This is one of the better apps for selling or buying items from other people. However in recent months my feed has been flooded with ads instead of actual items for sale. This isn’t too much of a problem as I only use this app for sales and not purchases, however now my inbox has ads in it. Upon going to my messages tab, 2 of the 5 visible messages on the page load, are ads and not actual messages. This is poor design and feels incredibly greedy.

So many bots. So many flaky people.",2
2707,"Good with room for improvement: Does what it should do, some annoying things like not being able to make new saved lists from the web interface, and I wish lists could be re-ordered. Item deletion is more difficult than it needs to be, and wish there was a way to filter saved items by distance from current location. Customer support is spotty, sometimes helpful sometimes not at all",4
2708,"Whaddya mean, “customer support”?: The major difficulty with this app is the deplorable lack of customer service.  If you have a problem, you are referred to a host of articles to read, which usually have nothing to do with the issue you are trying to address.
When they took over LETGO, it would have been nice if they had retained the option to use the app on a desktop computer - it’s so much easier to type on an actual keyboard!
They are diligent regarding safety, though, and that is quite commendable.",3
2709,"Items Remain on Platform After Sold: Items remain in the platform for years after they are sold so it gives the appearance that there are more items for sale than there actually are.  Maybe that’s good for generating ad revenue, but it’s TERRIBLE for consumers.  It wastes a great deal of time and lessons the credibility of the platform.

Suggestion, participants Must renew their items for sale monthly on a Monday.  Many people who use the platform are too Lazy to delete an item they don’t have for sale any longer because they don’t care about the integrity of the platform.  Cancel the the items that are no longer for sale.",1
2710,Removing ads: Great app for selling and buying the only thing I see wrong is folks who have things sold they leave them up for upto a year and they don’t respond after asking if it’s still available. You would think it would have a time limit on the ads and if it hasn’t sold they need to repost it instead of leaving it up for months or even years.,5
2711,"OfferUp-  Check this out !!: I give this app five stars because it is number one for obsessive compulsive indecisive buyers that cannot make up their mind and will definitely bug you all day until you respond of course because when you’re ready to meet them it’s almost as if they forgot what their phone was or what they were doing or if they wanted it lol   

                          1Honest review by.   Howard N",5
2712,Multiple listings on every page of the same item: Please don’t allow 3 to 4 pics of the same item to be posted on every page.  I don’t want shipping items yet they show up anyways after I selected pick up only and within 30 miles.  I also receive items posted 2 and 3 years ago.  I stopped using offer up for the above reasons.,5
2713,"Came over from letgo: There are way way way more ads on offer up, and they’re not very easily distinguishable so you can be scrolling and accidentally launch one. The layout is way more cluttered and it’s hard to see the pictures because there are so many. WAY more mattress scams than letgo and way more fake posts also. All within about 15 minutes of exploring the app. 
Such a drag!",5
2714,"Lots of old postings: This app would be 5 stars, but what’s really becomes irritating is I’ll be searching for something and find it and be excited, and it to click on it and see the posting is up to 5 years old and that person is no longer even selling on offer up. My suggestions is simple, implement a system where sellers have to confirm their item is still for sale every like 14 days or so, this way the abandoned postings will start to disappear. 

Other than that, I like offer up and use it a lot. But that’s one issue really upsets me.",3
2715,"Boycott OfferUp: OfferUp makes their money through ad revenue. They are selling paid ads two companies that have set up scam selling sites, who then sell their non-existing products to people who go to their sites through the ads.

To be clear, this is not a person trying to scam their neighbor. These are businesses that are buying ads on OfferUp, making OfferUp money, and then ripping off hundreds or thousands of people every day. This is a highly organized scamming business and offer up has written proof that they know about it, and are not doing anything about it. They continue to serve hundreds or thousands of ads for these rip off artists and make money from it.",1
2716,"Poor app function: I thought it was just my old smartphone that was having an issue after the let go/offer up merge, but after having a new phone for a while I see it’s just the app itself. Regardless of signal it’s often having problems connecting to its own servers (even when other things on my phone have no problem), you can’t list things on a website like letgo when the app isn’t working, the review process is very difficult, and the search parameters are extremely inaccurate. Add to that the ads that pull up whatever you were just looking at (and are 50% of the content) and you get an overall terrible experience.",1
2717,"Good Not Great: Though Offerup is an overall good buying and selling platform, it does have its issues. My main problem with this platform is the shipping feature. When posting with the shipping feature I have received many scam messages and requests, which have been easy for me to sniff out, but could be trouble for someone else. The other problem with the shipping feature: FEES! Offerup takes a MASSIVE 12% fee, as well as making the buyer pay shipping prices and fees of their own. On the bright side the platform seems to be very good for local buy sell trade.",3
2718,"Beware!: I have had offer up and let go for a few years and never sold anything from either one, but I have made a couple of purchases, but not in the last 2 years or so.. and last week I go through my email and find out someone hacked my account from New York and posted items on there for sale with my email address, and the same thing happened the week before on let go, I had to delete both of my accounts, these sites are not safe to use. I don’t know what they get out of that, or how they did it, or how bad it can get, but I got the hell out. Just giving every one a heads up on what’s going on, and what can happen! Stay safe out there!",1
2719,"Terrible app: First of all unlike Facebook Marketplace they don’t have Covid safety recommendations. When you message people about “no touch” payment they issue a warning suggesting that you use cash which is ridiculous right now. Second, since I’ve signed up I’ve sold six items on Facebook and nothing on this app, posting literally the same items. All I get is spam messages for people who are clearly scammers. A complete waste of time. I had a lot more success on let go though that app was downhill recently as well. Now I predominantly make all my sales on Facebook marketplace. This app is garbage because they all they want you to do is pay for promotion. Don’t bother with it.",1
2720,"Great app would recommend it: I would recommend it as I’ve bought some things on it before and also the people sometimes give great deals on products, but one thing I would say is purchase with caution as people do sometimes like to scam, it’s never happened to me personally but sometimes they claim a knockoff of something such as AirPods people would say “original” so I would recommend purchasing of 100% verified users",5
2721,"Updating Listings: Listings should be updated regularly. There are way too many old postings that have not been removed yet when you ask if the items are still available or state that you are interested in purchasing an item, the seller never responds. These listings should be removed so buyers know that they are looking at currently available items. Each week or so a message should be sent to the seller asking the status of an unsold item, no response will get the item removed.",3
2722,"1 out of 5 stars: Every time you try to contact customer service, or receive any type of help at all OfferUp will just redirect you to nothing. It says update your account and I click on it ...it then redirects me to the App Store with no option to update. It has been days since I heard from anybody and my product has been sold, I have been left a great review ..but I cannot have access to my funds.?????? Don’t get me wrong offer up is great if you want to buy something but not if your the seller and you ship.",3
2723,Deactivated Me And Kept My Money: I have used Offer Up daily for 4 months to sell/buy a number of items. Last night my account was deactivated without so much as a email notifying me. I simply cannot access my items for sale or my profile. Worse of all I have items out for delivery with money still in cue and it seems Offer Up has deactivated my account without issuing a reason. I have a 5 star rating with over 100 sales. Offer Up keeps a percentage of everything sold/shipped on the app. I have been a respectful and reliable user of the app. Offer Up has made a good deal of money from my sales. The customer service is terrible. Worst I have ever dealt with.,1
2724,REMOVE “is this still available” OPTION: I completely love the app I come from selling on Craigslist so I understand selling online comes with flakes. I don’t see what the need for the “is this still available” option is for since we delete ads as they are sold. I really would love for that option to be removed. Also the way offer up just blocks your complete cell phone after an account is flagged is ridiculous. Without ANY explanation they just block your account & cell phone. Anyway other than those two factors I love the app !,3
2725,Best app in the world: I enjoy viewing items and purchasing them sellers have always been nice and the prices really help me to be able to stay on a budget with my family and pets .I wish the owner of offer up would let me back in so that i can save money for me and my family. No matter what offer up will always be the best place to sell and buy its one of the site i sold the most on to make money to help support my family ❤️🙏🏽👍🏽,5
2726,"Keep msgs in APP not on phone: If you make a transaction make sure that you keep all of your conversations within the app itself.  Users may ask you to call them at a phone number or text them personally.

I’ve had a guy sell me something and then before confirming had me call him.  Everything was done on the phone so when I bought the item that was actually damaged.  I went to rate him lower.  I couldn’t rate him lower because he’d already marked it as sold to somebody else.

There was no conversation history showing that I was actually the one who bought the item so offer up doesn’t allow you to rate anybody without actually being the account that was the confirmed buyer.

Anyways, I didn’t want to rate the guy a 1.  I was going to give him 4 stars because the item said he bought it for 250 was selling it for 50 and that he’d only had it for 3 months.  What probably happened was that he bought it at the local swap meet, said that purchased it and then sold the broken item to me.",1
2727,"A few things bad....: Overall a good place to make some cash when getting rid of stuff you don’t have use for. Few drawbacks are the scammers(ask for your address on large items and never show up) or aren’t willing to meet at a neutral location, scammers who list costume jewelry for white gold or silver, low-ballers who offer way more than half of what your asking for, and some people who ask to lower the price and ask to deliver. Smdh. Also seems like some people are using Offer Up as a social network. Which it is not. I’m sure OfferUp would agree.",3
2728,"Customer Service Ruins This App: Just like the next person I love OfferUp. But ever since someone hacked my profile and I got it recovered, I have not been able to send out messages to any sellers, I have not been able to do much not even update my profile. I even made a new profile and the same thing happened. I contacted customer service many times and not even a response was I able to get. I would love if this issue was resolved.",5
2729,"Terrible Experiences: Let me start off by expressing the app within itself is wonderful as in its user friendly, very easy to navigate and even provides times to list items you might be interested in based upon previous searches. However, the people are not as friendly. I have expressed interest on many items, coordinated and set up times to retrieve the items only for the individual to tell me a day before that they decided to sell it to someone else. That is just rude and unprofessional. I don’t take times to write reviews but this was getting too far out of hand. Maybe the team at Offer Up could provide etiquette tips when selling and buying",1
2730,"Great App: I’ve been a member of OfferUp since about 2015. This is a great selling app! I’ve sold lots of items on OfferUp without any problems with the people I meet or the app itself. It’s just works, and I love things that just work. 

It’s easy to use, but remember to be cautious like with any other app when selling. Use your instincts! I have a certain way that I sell on this app and it has never failed me. This app is definitely a 5 star app for me.

 Thank you OfferUp team!",5
2731,They ban you for no reason: I’m a verified user on offer up. Followed app guidelines and have good rating. Only had two posts. They banned me for no reason or explanation. When I try to contact help to get an explanation they ban my ip and phone from even contacting them. Don’t use this app. All they have on here is a bunch of scammers that they don’t do anything about but the people who actually aren’t scammers are the ones they ban. Warning : do not buy through this app.,5
2732,Deleting boards: I’ve been using Offer Up for quite some time both to buy and sell items. My biggest ongoing issue is the saved boards. I wish there was an easier way to edit items on my board. I consistently update my app and yet each time I want to remove an individual item from my board and then go back to the top of the list. Then I’m forced to scroll down and remove the next item and continue the tedious process all over again. I wish there was a fast way to remove multiple items from my boards.,3
2733,"There should be a delete option: Offer-up is an amazing app I’ve had it for almost 2 years and had an amazing experience with it ,but there should be a delete option with the items you are selling it gets kind of exhausting archiving the item and waiting on it to get off the page . I’m not writing this because the app is bad but there should be a delete option on your own posts .",5
2734,"Where's the customer service??: I have been trying to sell and buy things for the past 2 months but there seems to be some kind of glitch going around that won't let people send messages or post things to sell. I have emailed and contacted the customer support through Twitter multiple times just to get a generic response that ""someone from support will contact you"" and they never do. I never rate apps so I'm actually going out of my way to rate this because I want them to notice what's going on. I used to love this app and used it to buy so many things. Hopefully they can get back to me and fix the problem but until then this app is virtually unusable.",1
2735,"SELLER BEWARE!!! BBB F Rating: It has been two weeks and Offer Up has not released the money the buyer payed for my item. I contacted my bank and they reported that OfferUp actually cancelled my deposit for no reason. They have not contacted me regarding the issue. Their is no customer service phone support AND they do not respond to their Twitter or email requests for support.

I've checked the Better Business Bureau and they have an active Red Alert regarding OfferUp Inc for not responding to their customers (or to BBB for that matter), for not releasing funds in a timely manner, and for other various complaints. For these reasons, the BBB has given them an F rating!!! 

I urge you not to download this app. I recommend selling on eBay or Letgo instead.",1
2736,One small thing...: I’ve been using this app for years this app has facilitated multiple transactions never giving me a bad one the only thing that I can say that I would change about the app is when looking for certain products is that the prices are posted on the thumbnail rather than you having to click on the actual post to see details of how much someone wants for a particular item other than that that would be my only criticism towards this app,4
2737,"Good app, but could be improved.: I’m noticing small bugs more often than i’d like. When ever I have the option to rate my buyers, i always get an error message and it never works. Shipping is far too expensive, especially for items with a higher weight. I was selling a nintendo ds, and nobody wanted the price i had, they all went extremely lower than my expectations. Not to mention the service fee they remove from every item you sell. 7% or more can really add up on more expensive items.",4
2738,"Great but curated and chosen for you not always best: Love the app but I’m starting to move away from it. They continue to get big. When I post something I’m not planning on shipping it. That’s why I have a wonderful platform named eBay.
This is a great tool to sell things to people near you. I also don’t appreciate how as of late (September 2018) I’m not able to just search and see what people are posting. Instead I’m shown what is popular and every time I try to set it based on the newest postings I’m getting shifted back to popular. I also don’t always appreciate curated items. I’m starting to like this app a lot less and I’m an OfferUp poweruser.",2
2739,"Discrimination!: My account was removed because i supposedly broke their rules and guidelines by posting a Louis Vuitton purse. They said I broke the rules because they aren’t able to prove if it’s real or fake. They shouldn’t allow any purse of any kind to be posted on here since they can’t prove it’s real or not but instead the choose to just remove my account. Offer up picks and chooses which account they want to remove. I’ve had my account for about 2 years and have made many purchases and sales. Very disappointed in how they’re treating me. Search up Louis Vuitton and tons of people still have their account , anything on here can be fake and their allowed to still sell. They are unfair",1
2740,"Great app, mostly good users: This (free!!) app has helped me free up some closet space and put some extra bucks in my pocket. Sure, a good portion of the users will haggle, and then never message you again, but that’s every place you try to sell. The rating system helps weed those out pretty well. 

I’ve never had a bad encounter with someone who actually showed up to meet me somewhere to buy. All have been nice people. So yeah, this app works. And the interface is easy.",5
2741,"Great for home & Business: I’ve been using OfferUp for over 3 years now. When I I need equipment quick for my salon and store this is the first place I look. When I’m working on a home project o come here almost immediately. OfferUp is to my family what other big name stores are to others. It’s safe, accurate, and I’ve only had one issue with a seller but that has nothing to do with the site. Some people will fall through the cracks. Thank you",5
2742,"Just to be good: I just to spend hours looking at the stuff for sale here sometimes looking to buy sometimes just to spend time 
I’m saying just to be because now I can’t stand it for more than 10 minutes because it’s so much comercial stuff that the up doesn’t work properly I think the owners of it got way too greedy that they don’t care about us anymore",5
2743,"Beware of what u buy!!!: I personally don't like apps, but this one is easy to understand. The problem is junk posting and/or duplicate posting. This app used to be cool before everyone came to advertise or their own business. I don't like that u can't rate a seller when purchasing an item unless the seller sends it to u. Also, there's no strict punishment for folks who scam others!!.... It's a good way to sell items when you're an honest seller, except when u run into those that stand u up when it's time to meet. :/",4
2744,"We should be able to read reviews: I've seen many accounts where the seller has low stars, but I can't see why they have a low star rating because there's no option to read their reviews. Please change this setting so all buyers can know why this certain person has this rating and if we should buy from them or not. It's important to trust your seller, but how can I? There's so many scammers on this app and no one will be able to know, if we can't see a review that someone left. Please change it ASAP because this is getting annoying. All the other selling apps I've used, has this option. Seems like offer up is the only one that doesn't.",1
2745,"It seems people that use OfferUp are a special breed of their own: I like the app, and I like the platform, I have just never dealt with such annoying, lowballing, shady people in my entire life. It’s as if everyone that uses the app just sits around making offers that are about 20% of what you’re asking just to see if you would accept it, and if for some crazy reason you do decide to accept it, they never end up following through. The app has a long way to go and they need a better way of managing the frauds and the scammers, because no matter how many times you report someone, nothing is ever done about it",2
2746,"Good app but has bugs: First off I have a Monthly subscription, secondly the app was working perfectly fine the first few days then on the 4th day my camera roll when I list a item, has my camera roll blank they have my pictures but you have to guess which picture it is. When I press select photo all albums recent pic previews before you select a pic is all blank. So I have to guess what picture I’m selecting. But the first 3 days I was able to see all the pics in my camera roll.",3
2747,"Uhg!!: I used to love this app. Used it for everything I needed to get rid of. Was great for buying and selling and even trading stuff. But now I can’t stand it. Why does everything have to become a notification? So freaking irritating. I’ll see a alert pop up on the icon, I think somebody is making an offer on something I’m selling, there is a message in my inbox!  but no, it’s just an alert for something I searched for the night before. Just make that an option, not something happens automatically. UnListing all my stuff and going back to craigslist.",2
2748,"Full screen ads are horrible: Been using this app for around 8 years now, and the ads have only gotten worse over time, but I could deal with them. Up until today, when I just got my first full screen ad on this app. I will not buy premium. Sad to see this happen.

Update: now the search function doesn’t work anymore. They changed it so that you can no longer search for specific things. I searched for a specific bike model, and the results included a bunch of random bikes that are nothing like the one I searched for. 

Shame on everyone who allowed these changes to go through.",1
2749,"OfferUp sold out, barely functional now: Echoing other reviews. I loved OfferUp for a long time but the changes they’ve made in the past few years are garbage. I won’t use it anymore because the experience is too irritating and I resent the constant barrage of ads. I redownloaded today and searched for less than 1 minute before the app made me watch a 30 second ad (?!). Then while scrolling the ads are placed so that your thumb is consistently clicking them by accident, directing you to a new screen. I’m not going to pay for a subscription to a poorly-designed, barely functional app full of people’s garbage. OfferUp is delusional.",1
2750,"App has declined: I used to post and sell a lot of things on OfferUp, but over the last few years the quality has really declined. Almost every item is linked to an actual store, and you don’t know until you click into it; there are a ton of scam Clickbait items that draw you in just to promote a warehouse where the item can be found at a much higher cost; I hardly get any replies on any items anymore and it seems like it wants you to pay for the “premier” version to get more views, but even when I did that- I got no bites or hits. Got more hits and sold items better on Facebook marketplace and craigslist.",1
2751,"Great App to buy and sell locally: OfferUp is a great app to facilitate buying and selling directly from your home or anywhere. The posting process is easy and simple, just a few clicks after you setup your personal profile. Almost instantly after you post your item, viewers may search the item according to the product category, for example household items or furnitures.",5
2752,"This app is not the best: I got this app for the first time about a week ago. I just was planning to buy stuff, not sell. The thing about the sellers on this app is they don’t seem serious about making a sale at all. I would message sellers asking if an item is still available and they would leave me on delivered for days. I even would have conversations with sellers about buying a product and they would randomly stop responding and become inactive from the app. If you want to buy or sell, try a different app. Do not waste your time on this one.",2
2753,Excellent app: I really like the app for the business. Only problem I see is charging every transaction 12.9%. Which makes it more expensive to seller and buyer. And I think that is too much. Plus when we talk to the customer or buyer and we try to show him pictures we can’t send any pictures on messages. Maybe that another point you guys may be can work on it.,5
2754,"They are not consistent: They allow people to offer shipping and scamming and delete legitimate accounts that only sell or offer services locally and penalize and don’t give you an opportunity by specifically pointing out what made an account deletion, I won’t use this app as it is just not necessary and a waste of time I would rather have a new app made that could easily out do this one, if you want I would be happy to collaborate on one that is better. That actually has standards rather than opinionated moderators and security to keep others from asking ridiculous high prices for things because they are not in stock.",1
2755,"Hard to buy and sell: Are used to be able to buy and sell stuff on this so easily. It doesn’t seem to be the same as it used to be. It always shows me the same thing over and over and no variety. I have to very specifically look for something if I want to find it. Most of the buyers seem to be frustrated as well. As I have not sold the last few items on this site. I don’t know why it’s harder, but it is. If I post something I can never go back and find it on the site because I don’t pay for the site I feel like it’s pushed to the bottom used to be my favorite place to shop.",1
2756,My review: I love offer up but I don’t know what is going on it’s been it deleted my account 3 different times I have to redo it the first time I had it for years and all of a sudden it just deleted my account I had for years and I’ve had to restart all over again but now I write to people to buy something and they will not answer me or txt me back I’ve lost so many things I have wanted to buy can u see what is going on I had already been verified and everything plz let me know what going on,3
2757,"False notifications: I’ve been using offer up for many years and love it. Thought I have had problems with direct payments when selling/shipping through the site - I just called customer support and they sent me my $$. 

I’m furious with the false notifications! I’ve updated this app…turned off my phone…turned off offer up notifications under settings then back on… there’s constantly 1 notification that keeps showing on the app. It’s annoying AS F. Please fix this asap! Grrrrrr",3
2758,"Beware! Fake accounts seem to run this app!: I’ve posted many items on this app since I chose to try it out a few weeks ago. All I have to say right now is wow do I get a whole lot of people asking me for my number, when I tell them that I do everything through the app as is obviously suggested for the sellers own safety, they don’t message anymore. I look at their accounts and right away you can tell they’re fake accounts. It’s wild. Something should really be done about this. Unfortunately it does not seem to be working out for me at all. What a shame.",2
2759,"fraudulent activity occuring re-occuring 3 day promo: Used this app for a while no problems , then recently their system rejected my   posting and still billed me for the 3day promo feature I paid for along with the  posting . 
I kindly asked OfferUp support to refund me because my ad was rejected multiple times with no clear reason  . 
They just gave me a fake scripted  tech support response about sign in and out etc . No refund!  then their techsuport morons or AI , double  billed me again in what seemd like a subscription process that side steps Apples  subscriptions policy . One star
until they fix this nonsense . Avoid  their scam
3day promo feature  it is a  hidden subcription!",1
2760,"Great App for personal sales: The app is really good and is flexible for those who are looking to sell one item or buy a single item. Everything else is great except for one issue, when people post their items “Sold”. Tech-support or someone in charge should immediately remove them from the board. There’s been instances where items are still on the board but we’re marked as sold.",5
2761,"Last few updates ruined the app: I have loved OfferUp and have been using it for years.  Over the last couple of months the developers moved the search alerts to a “notifications” tab that is constantly failing to load.  You open the notifications tab and it may show you your search results for a second and then they disappear.  Sometimes you open the tab and it loads after 10 seconds.

I get the new interface, but as a daily user of this app the search alerts are the number one thing I open.  Please don’t nest it in multiple menus deep to get to.  This is not better.",1
2762,"Helpful but Glitches: I’ve been using this app for about 3 years now. I love it but lately it’s been REALLY slow. I have updated it, turned on and off my wifi, at multiple locations and it’s still the same. I have updated the latest version and even googled it but it’s a problem with the app. 

I’ve purchased many things from OfferUp. The only thing that bothers me is that it’s a constant lag, glitches and freezes all the time.",4
2763,"Fake people on the app, just like the fake reviews here: I have been fooled by the fake paid for reviews. I re-downloaded this app thinking they had made improvements, nope they made it worse.  This app is a complete joke, the layout is horrible. The search bar is completely useless. Everyone on it is a scammer or trolling, I’ve never been able to sell or buy anything on it. This is like Facebook marketplace but 10x worse, it’s actually funny how bad it is. And now they want to charge you money??  For the privilege to post your items on their crappy app?? LOL no thank you…Deleting this horrible app and never downloading it again.",1
2764,"The app is not bad, the filters are 🤷‍♀️: So far I have been able to sell one item and buy two. No issues with the people, but I think the filters in the app need work.  Also, verifying people should consist of more than phones number and email. It’s a little vague. 
Otherwise I would have given this thing 5 stars, because I’ve gotten lucky with the three people I’ve dealt with. No issues. Hopefully this continues to be the case.",4
2765,Customer support: I forgot my password and I asked for help and it went on for 10 months going back and forth with customer service and couldn’t get any help to get my password reset only after trying to login with what I think the password was I finally found out what the password was to get back into my account . I have sent over 25 request for help to the customer service with no solution up to this I had no problem with offer and have sold over 100 items and still have 100 items listed with them high pockets,2
2766,"Worst response time/ customer service ever!!!!!: I needed to sell a few things to pay for a surgery that my cat needs soon and offer up removed my post for a Nintendo Switch TWICE!! tried to contact customer service to get the issue resolved and 3 days later I just got an auto response saying that they needed to verify my account,To make things a little worse I originally never wanted to disclose why I was selling things but I only did so only in hopes that they wouldn’t remove the post again low and behold the post was removed I’d stay away from this app if you need to sell things quick WITCH WAS A WHOLE PITCH POINT IN YOUR TV ADDS!!!!!!!",1
2767,"App is Fine But: I have had successful transactions through offer up. However it has taken a bit of time to weed through who is actually private seller and who is a company. If I wanted to buy from a company, I would just do so on their website. I come to offer up so I can get deals from people selling their things. Idk it’s just annoying clicking on items that seem to be perfect for me with the price tag of regular in store items because it’s the actual store trying to sell.",3
2768,"Local sales: I used to be able to find items, buy and sale locally in my city and surrounding areas with LETGO fast; now with OFFERUP everything and everyone is together.
I always received communication from people interested in my things and sold my items fast through LETGO; now most of my sales are NOT originated in OFFERUP. Only sales with shipping charges are occurring.
OFFERUP has a great platform for selling and shipping outside local area this worked well for me.  I wish it would be more friendly for local sales.  Thank you.",3
2769,"This app is a Scam... or ...: Had so many views and responses for all my items. Every time I asked what would be a good time to meet up , radio silence. Then i would sell on craigslist, and i would get a response every time and sold. My experience leads me to believe that they have people responding who were never interested, to encourage people to buy their promoted package. I have unsuccessfully been unable to sell anything on this app which is a few posts. I have sold everything with ease on craigslist and other apps. There are scams on craigslist as well, but mostly with housing. Craigslist still the better choice. Offer up not worth it.",1
2770,"Not working after update: I updated the OfferUp app and now it doesn’t work correctly. When I try to open up the listings, I get an error message advising “Unable to load”…”we were unable to load the page due to network connection issues.” After several times deleting and reinstalling app, rebooting phone, logging in/out, turning on/off of networks, etc., the app will not work. This is happening on both devices I updated the app on (iPad and iPhone). Luckily, I had 1 iPhone that I did not update from the previous version, so I’m able to view the listings on the OfferUp app. Fix the bugs in this update!",1
2771,SCAMMERS and Horrible transaction process: Only scammers is this app. It can’t verify your banking information. The steps required to verify you are who you are is ridiculous and SUPER buggy. In order to confirm my banking information I had to uninstall and reinstall the app four times!!! And then no one can accept my payment process anyway. I have to leave the app and pay through Zelle or Venmo. Which completely defeats the purpose of the app. There is no way that it has to be this hard to send someone money. There are literally five different apps that do this so much easier. Horrible experience. Never going to use it again.,1
2772,"Bring back let go: This is hands down the worst marketplace app ever let go should have absorbed offer up not the other way around. The ui is decent / but they don’t delete old posts so you can be looking for something and find a good price and it’ll say posted 3 years ago no joke / I have posted things on let go and bought things and had no issues on here I never make any sales and when I’m trying to buy most people don’t respond probably because they deleted this trash app / 

I HATE THIS APP / can’t stress this enough they’re never going to fix it like most developers so steer clear and stick to FB marketplace",1
2773,"Good & Scams: OfferUp is a great way to buy almost anything at a good price but unfortunately there are also scammers, no shows and low ballers.

The best way to use this app is to check the seller’s info.  How long have they been a member, how many sales, how good is their feedback etc.  Generally from what I have noticed is that scammers tend to offer extremely low prices for expensive items (even used items) and want you to text them.  Stay away from those.   

If OfferUp can better filter these type of scammers, it will help improve the overall experience.  Currently, you can report suspicious sellers but that takes away from searching for specific items as scammers can flood the site with fake postings that you will need to filter through on your own.

Good deals are to be found if you are willing to put in the time and effort.",3
2774,"Issues and more issues: I am CONSTANTLY logged out of my account for no apparent reason.

I delete and redownload the app, switch from wifi to cellular data, update the app, restart my device, change my password, reboot the app...

I’ve tried accessing it on my computer as well and restarting the browser... NOTHING.

I have people waiting on me to make purchases and no way to reach them because of this app and it’s continual crashing.

Whenever I receive a response form the support team it’s a lousy one with the same information I’ve already tried or an apology and zero helpful information.

Why can OfferUp not get this handled and under control?

Not to mention the scams and spams. It’s beyond harassment from people on there. I have reported and blocked and I still encounter this issue daily. I can’t post an item without 3+ scammers commenting and asking for my phone number.

Get it together OfferUp. I’ve waited 2 weeks and still cannot access my account.",1
2775,"What’s going on with your app?: Got a notification that my listing violated policy and has been removed.  Didn’t state the violation; I have no idea what it could be.  I never got a clear notification that it had posted in the first place. App mentioned that they sent me an email explaining how to re-post my listing; no email found including my junk mail.  Frustrating. Selected ‘app support’ link but it was unresponsive.  More frustrating.  All this capped off with all the folks I shared my listing with telling me that the link doesn’t go to my listing. Haha, that’s because the app removed it without telling me the ‘specific’ reason....jokes on me!",1
2776,"Very effective and efficient- sold all in 4 days: I am moving out of town and decided to try the app. Started to list a few items - when I got a huge response and started selling, listed more stuff. As they sold listed even more. In 4 days I sold nearly all of my furniture and knick knacks (3 bedroom house). 

There are a few crank messages and scammers but more often than not the app warns you when someone asks for private info like phone numbers. 

Just be diligent and don’t call anyone or give them your number and give your address to only those with a verified location and phone. Anyone who has zero purchases or do not have a location listed on their profile is suspect. 

Overall I am happy. I’ll use the app for more stuff in the future.",5
2777,"Not working anymore: I ordered something... then the next day it doesn’t work anymore. Did an update and same thing. Now I can’t tell if I’m getting my order!!!! The developers website is down completely! So I’m writing this review. I’m disappointed at why there is no recovery method for users who order something from a site and end up wondering if their order will be delivered!!! UPDATE: after going to the web interface of the app, I was able to reinstall from the web link. It seems the direct link from the App Store is an issue.",3
2778,Fix the problems!: OfferUp was great until the changes that came along around the time they merged or acquired LetGo. Typing and editing item descriptions is difficult cause the cursor won’t go where I want it too. We can no longer access sellers/users that we used to follow. Messages don’t always show up in the messages box. Example: I see the number of conversations under the item listing detail but it never showed up in the messages in box. There are a lot more glitches that weren’t there before. I’ve been using The Craigslist app more cause OfferUp has gotten quirky. Hoping they fix their stuff.,2
2779,"Lousy: I have been selling on Craigslist since the early 2000’s, and on Facebook marketplace and then on offer up & letgo. I list my items in all 3 places, and rarely rarely do they sell from OfferUp. The “sending an offer” feature of this ap has created a weird lowballing culture, of getting constant offers of like an 80% discount. It’s very irritating. I get less flakes on Craigslist because at least on Craigslist people have to take the time to draft an email with coherent questions and information, on this ap people just constantly click the “is it available” button endlessly and do not follow through.",2
2780,"Horrible Uodate: For some stupid reason, the map isn’t interactive anymore.  You can’t see your proximity to seller. You have no idea if the deal is worth the drive unless you ask them for their address so you can google maps their location prior to confirming you’re will to do the drive to pick up the item.  I’m so annoyed!!! I used to rave about this app on all my social media accounts.",5
2781,"Terrible update: Latest update is terrible. Now every other item is an ad, so frustrating. It use to be much more user friendly, but now the moment you tap on an item, it suddenly gives you ads for that item nonstop and you accidentally end up clicking on a website when you just want to see local deals! Also keeps trying to push items it thinks you’re interested in, making it harder just to browse nearby items. Plus, you can’t switch to landscape mode anymore. Please bring that feature back!",2
2782,"OfferUp: I love OfferUp. I just would like for you guys to have better control of people’s posts. Like lately people has been posting very nice cars for sale for incredible, unbelievable and ridiculous very low prices. Also in the report section I would like to see an option to report people for not responding after numerous attempts to communicate. People post things for sale and when you are interested they never respond, ever.",5
2783,"Messages disappear: Created an account after they merged with Let Go.  Put 1 item up and started getting offers but as soon as I viewed a message I could no longer find it again in the app.   Also, every offer I got was shady with people stating they were out of town but would mail a cashiers check as deposit until they could pick up, to which they had no idea.  Either way just kept asking for name and mailing address.  Not being able to track conversations on the app and buyers able to pay through app or other online options is a hassle I don’t need.",2
2784,"Was good entil the messaging feature stopped working: After using this app for about 6 hours I was liking it, messaging someone about a purchase and receiving messages about items I had just posted minutes ago. Now my app randomly wont allow ,e to send messages,  every message gets “flagged” and doesn’t go through. Even if I say “hi”. It says “this is a violation of our policy error r37kprmm”... but it makes no sense.  I sent a message to offer up support,  no response for 3 hours,  there isn’t a phone support center.   Now I’m unable to respond to several message threads for no reason..  Bad experience with offer up so far.  I never had any issue like this on let-go",1
2785,"Needs uniform picture sizes.: This app needs to be updated to work more like letgo.  The human eye sees symmetry easier, uneven small picture sizes make it hard to see what is being displayed quickly at a glance.  It is unfair to a seller if they get a tiny picture, and it makes the buyers eyes tired when searching for any length of time.  On iPads and iPhones, you should be able to swipe and see each item in a search instead of having a hodge podge of mismatched picture sizes that you have to scroll down through.  Also, you should be able to delete the eBay messages sent to you (unsolicited) on messenger.",2
2786,"Prank or scam calls... and pictures: I keep getting these prank offers saying they are interested but then they ask me to call them or look them up on Facebook... I can’t report them because it’s different names all the time ... but the message  is always the exact same.... what do I do about that ... it’s really getting bad.... 
  I also wish that when I do get a legit customer that I could send them additional pictures if they request them without making a new post or editing the old one...
Thank you for listening....",3
2787,"Too many bad experiences with buyers: This app used to be better, but far too many people have begun to use it, simply to screw with sellers. It’s too anonymous so that people use it like a toy. Many missed planned meetings, or fake profiles making offers on several of items you list, only to never follow through or show for your appointment. I have spent so much time photographing and listing items for this app, only to be scammed and abused by buyers. My recommendation: stick with Facebook’s Marketplace. You’ll have a far better, real, buyer/seller experience. Using OfferUp and Letgo have turned my stomach, making me donate items to Goodwill just to avoid the frustration of so many scammers on this app.",1
2788,"Disappointed customer: I’ve used this application for many years always told my friends about it. But out of no where my account got cancel and was told I broke the rules. I never post it anything out of the rules. I reached out to offer up and was told that I couldn’t appeal my case and I couldn’t open another account. So disappointed with the experience at the end with no real explanation of what I post it wrong with no warning. It was my only income in this hard time selling use items. It took me a 5 years good reputation to build trust in my account. Customer services not really good, not personalized. Feels like a robot answer you. Very very disappointed customer!!!",1
2789,Faulty equipment: Offer up is good but it’s the seller sometimes I purchase a refrigerator that doesn’t keep cold and it’s sitting empty in my kitchen I tried selling it back on this site being honest that it doesn’t hold its temperature and things doesn’t stay cold marked it down at a reasonable price but no one wants it. The seller knew this item wasn’t working properly. I also purchase a stove and that seller knew it takes forever for the fire to come on because all those burners needs fixing it just flicker continuously before any flames appear. This seller never mentioned it just said it works but left out the faulty information,2
2790,"A bug & a better idea: First, I can’t rate a seller & I can’t select the option for selling my item to someone off the app. I’m hoping this is a quick-fix bug.
Second, I would LOVE for there to be a “pending” button. I archived an item because a million people were messaging me & I had someone picking it up—but then all of the messages associated with the item disappeared & I couldn’t coordinate with my buyer. Please add a pending button. Thank you.",5
2791,"So much better than Letgo: I emailed Letgo and told them to delete my account, I got tired of everything being “one tap,” Which resulted in a lot of mistaken messages being sent saying, “is the product still available?” Also, Offer Up actually requires a user to create their ad. Letgo would post ads immediately after taking a photo, and auto-generate a title.  This caused way too many ads with no description and an incorrect headline.",5
2792,"Unresponsive developer. Seller hostile policies: I’ve sold one item on Offer Up. No, I take that back. I’ve sold one item and then had to take it back when the buyer changed his mind. 

I too quickly have a positive rating to the buyer, as I saw after I had refunded his entire purchase price, that he had left me a one star rating. 

He won’t respond to messages or texts. And Offer Up sent me a canned letter that didn’t even address the concerns in my letter. 

I’m left with a single star rating that will be the first thing potential buyers will see about me. I’ve made hundreds of sales on eBay, some for multiple thousands of dollars. I have 100% positive ratings there. But after one (cancelled) sale on Offer Up, I have an uphill climb to have legitimacy with its users.  Why would I bother?

So with no way to mark a sold item as not sold, no recourse for a spiteful (or erroneous) single star rating, and customer service that doesn’t read emails before sending a canned response, I won’t be using Offer Up again. 

Sellers beware.",1
2793,"had the worse customer service and too many retailers flooding the posts: had a post i worked hard on taken down even though it was in no way in violation of their terms of service probably only reported by someone else trying to sell a similar item or equally frustrated they did the same to them.

i tried to appeal to get my ad back up and just got a cookie cutter response cut and pasted from someone named trisha. tried to respond to that and another unpersonalized answer even to that. what is to stop someone from “trolling” and reporting competing ads if you dont have a real human verifying these ads are really in violation of your rules before you take them down and then the appeal process is totally fake

also added bonus, i live in a city with a lot of retailers, if i try to search locally, more than half my ads are just people posting from retail stores like furniture and stuff, how is that even allowed at all? if i wanted to buy something at a retail store, i would have gone to a retail store",1
2794,"Offer up app: Love the app had it for quite some years now. Have always enjoyed using it because it’s very simple to upload items and @ the same time get ride off or buy things u dnt find in order websites and minutes away from home. 

But unfortunately this past few months I haven’t been able to upload any item and I haven’t been able to get a hold of any offer up rep. 
 I’am getting frustrated I might just delete the app if I can’t get this issue Fixed ASAP.",4
2795,"My Personal Review!: First.  I love your transaction ring tone, 
“Cha Ching $!”  Fantastic!

Secondly, you’ve made it very easy to navigate our saved searches.  Meaning, when I’m notified that new items have arrived which relate to products I desire, you organize them with precision.  From top to bottom.  Then when a buyer clicks on an alert we can easily view the latest addition. Why?  Because you separate the items we’ve already seen.  Who does that?  I don’t want to waste my precious time eyeballing things already reviewed!

Finally, you do a very thorough job of screening buyers.  I believe this is for security reasons.  My only PERSONAL regret is having to take my picture.  Purely stemming from my own vanity issues 😉❣️

Thank you for bringing your refreshing website to the world!!!

Sincerely,
Kanani Wolf",5
2796,"Good App, Terrible Community: The app works well enough like so many of these sorts of apps these days. However, if you plan on selling anything on here, be prepared for people to drastically lowball you with their offers and then get mad when you don’t accept them. If you’re okay with the super-aggressive type of bargaining, then maybe this is the place for you. As for me, the community around an app like this is as important as the functionality of the app itself. And my personal experience with the people using this app has be terrible so far with very few exceptions.",3
2797,Great Way to Sell: Offer up is a great way To sell your old items. Sometimes you encounter people who set appointments and don’t show up but that only means you need to clearly connect with people and find out if they are serious about purchasing your item. However I don’t like when I encounter advertisements for items at full price. If I wanted to pay full price for items I would go to the store and not look for them on Offer Up. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.,4
2798,"Love the App: Great idea for an app and I’ve had a lot of success with it. My only complaint is about the rating system - the seller is forced to be the first to rate the other individual and the person who purchased the item sees their rating. Therefore, even if you have major issues with someone and they prove to be difficult to work with, if you don’t want an unfair rating based upon your rating, you’re essentially forced to lie and are unable to warn others about the issues that may arise.",4
2799,"Horrible Experience: This app is useless.  Nobody responds to any inquiries on things being sold and support says there’s nothing wrong with my account.  Considering they have a pay-for option to prioritize messages to sellers, I have no doubt messages from free accounts just don’t make it to the sellers at all.  This company is ripping people off with their subscription to be able to just use the most basic functions of the app.  If you’re not paying their subscription fee, they’ll block your messages from going to sellers and visibility on anything you’re trying to sell as well.  This service and app is USELESS!!! 👎",1
2800,I love to shell: Selling is pretty easy on the phone app or you need your phone and you can list an item in seconds. Just wish there was a way to get rid of the scammers that tell you text them on their phone number and message them through another way of communication when they’re already texting and communicating with you through the app,5
2801,"What happened to this app?: Used to be a great app but now it’s gone down hill over the years. Spammy listings from dealers still when trying to look for certain price range vehicles, the usual scam listings that never get taken down and then there’s so many of them asking to email them, the ads that pop up all of a sudden when looking for items and so on. But to put the nail in the coffin I can’t even use this app with mobile data, I have to use Wi-Fi to even load the app up now which makes no sense this app has pretty much become a dead weight so to speak on my phone so I think it’s time to delete.",1
2802,"Ads that will make you close the app: When ads pop up across the entire screen it takes a few seconds for the x to appear in the top right corner…. Except you can’t click it! 
At this point you either click the add that takes you safari and go back to the app (incredibly frustrating) or close the app out, reopen and start your search all over again… come on people, how is this serving us? As hard as it is to keep people on an app you’re forcing people off of it!
It’s the most obvious flaw for any app owner to correct.",2
2803,"Great app but has flaws.: It’s a great app I really like it. I have sold and purchased many items. But you should implement a feature where unsold items get unlisted automatically after a month, unless you reenlist it. It’s really annoying to search for something and an item from three years ago that never got marked as sold by the user never got removed. Other than that the app is really easy to navigate and posting is a breeze. I know its the user’s fault to not marking as sold, BUT of they got removed automatically that would not be an issue.",2
2804,"No customer service / shady app: Hello,

I've been selling on OfferUp for years now and the amount of times I've been robbed and attempted to scam me is ridiculous. There is no authorization for all users, just selected users who want to be trusted, every account should have a valid phone number attached. Only verified accounts require you to verify through ID. This app is ridiculous, I could make a new account, meet up with someone and rob them, that person would have no way of tracking me through the app. If the victim were to contact customer support, there is no help only automated responses.

This app breeds criminals and is synonymous with everyone as a shady application. Instead of OfferUp I've turned to verified users on Facebook marketplace where people who post have a verified acc with a registered email and phone number.

If you use this application, use it to buy not sell because you will be robbed, maybe by force or unlike me by gun point. Thank you so much.",1
2805,"This app is a mess and hasn’t changed at all: This app is full of scam posters it’s impossible to tell which accounts are legit and which ones aren’t. Yeah some people have reviews that can verify them but most don’t. 

You can’t swipe left or right to the next item. You can’t hide certain profiles that spam their posting everywhere. 

This app was better when it was called LetGo. Now OfferUp just offers up a terrible user experience and they can’t even stop the scammers and spammers. 

I’m tired of this app being so terrible. I can’t trust anyone and no one is willing to trust me. Just look and see for yourself. Try to find something you want and bam spam and scam everywhere. 

Then you report it and they give you some automatic response and do nothing. Oh god forbid you tell someone you don’t want their offer because then they will spam your listing with false reports and get your account locked. 

Terrible app. Do something to make it better.",1
2806,200+ 5 Star 2017 Account Banned without reason: As a full time college student I earn all my income from selling on this platform and have 200+ all 5 star reviews every buyer was satisfied. I then wake up to not only my account being banned but me as a person and it states “If you believe we have made a mistake contact us” which I did and all I get are automated messages “Broke community guideline and posting rules” which clearly I did not and they refuse to look into my account tell me on how exactly I broke community guidelines and posting rules. I am surprised this app has yet to be sued and hope one day they target the wrong person.,1
2807,"OfferUp is impossible to get help from: I bought an item on offer up, and when it arrived, it was missing pieces. I opened up a claim through their app because they do not have a customer service number. After the two day window had passed, they sent me an email that said that they could not refund my money because I did not provide any proof. I’m not sure what they wanted for proof but I did explain in the request for a refund that the unit was missing pieces. I am very disappointed with offer up. I had done a lot of business through this app before, but I have reservations of using them in the future.",1
2808,"Banned for buying an item?: Apparently you get sent a message to wait for 32 hours after creating a new account being all excited, that you finally found someone who is willing to sell to you without asking which precinct they would love to sleep in (Scammers). 

So once the amazing 32 hours of anticipation is over you will get a message that you were banned for disobeying community guidelines, after hustling through the lists of scammers and reporting these people, YOU WILL BE THE ONE WHO GETS BANNED. The email arrives you account has been “removed” for disobeying community guidelines. 

Outstanding performance! App of the year! Absolute world class!",1
2809,"Categorically: I really spend a lot of time looking through some of the different categories. I would like to see the app make a prompt for offers. When your looking through the FREE section and you constantly come across people writing 
NOT FREE SHOOT OFFERS or LOW ballers will be ignored. That’s frustrating and they should have there own place to advertise those items . 

Thanks for your consideration

2810,Too many fake ads to give it five stars: Offer up start it off as a very good software for trading and purchasing locally and nationally. Over the last year or so it has been taken over by those posting false and fake ads in hopes to gain access to transfer viruses and malware onto unsuspecting phones and computers. I myself have reported at least 500 people posting fake ads. Most of these ads requiring people to contact a Gmail account versus using the software contact information provided.,3
2811,Account: This is the worst app to look for selling and buying items at a low cost. I made an account and haven’t even had the chance to post any items to sell when I received an email saying my account was removed for violating the community guidelines. How are guidelines violated when the account wasn’t even used yet? Nothing was bought or sold on my account and they just removed it and the email says opening a new account after one has already been removed is not allowed. WORST APP EVER!!! I would not recommend anyone use this app. Look for something better and don’t waste your time.,1
2812,"Don’t waste your time: I’ve been using this app for about 2 years ago, and it has completely gone to trash. It’s filled with old shoes and gross items, and half the people don’t reply to inquiry or response after asking about your product. Seriously, don’t waste your time and use one of the MANY other sites out there for resale. In addition, they will delete your listings randomly (another waste of time). I’ve had headphones and karate practice items listed, and they’ve been deleted. They literally just want dirty old shoes and yard sale trash on their site, sitting for months. You’ll find better items on Craigslist.",1
2813,"Great App, but be careful!: I love using OfferUp to find deals on unique pieces and things I need and don’t want to pay full price for. However, “buyers beware”! There are some scammers out here. I ran into a pretty scary situation where I was lured to the destination and the person deleted the post and message thread! Luckily, I was able to flee before they got to me. I reported this to OfferUp but didn’t get a response. I feel like there needs to be better follow up regarding matters like this and screening for sellers.",4
2814,"Terrible Moderation & User Remorse: So everybody has an occasional mess-up, a while ago I had one. It was mostly just me messaging the seller why they kept ignoring & leaving on read — because yknow, makes NO sense; especially when you’re unable to get a reason or answer in return. So anyways, Offerup thought it was smart to not only ban me, but not have ANY methods of site usage or appeals available to me, a user. Other users I’ve seen are upset about this too, don’t think this was only done to me.
For this very reason & how common it is to be ignored, this app is overall pretty terrible. Absolutely dog s hit. I say this with full honesty & authenticity.",1
2815,"Needs better organizing: I used to love this App, but it has changed and become frustrating.  It should show the with newest and “paid to post” offers at top and previous offers below those.  In other words, show them in order as they come.  Also, stop the repetition of them as we scroll down.  It’s so annoying!  We think we’re seeing new items, but instead it’s all the offers listed all over again.  It’s ok to have an end of the list of offers posted.",3
2816,"OfferUp Bad: OfferUp delivers one of the worst customer service experience possible. A larger purchase I had made was cancelled and a short while later my account removed. My account had registered over 2,000 sales with 233 5-star reviews prior to this happening. After 20+ emails over several weeks, with 5 generic copy/paste responses sprinkled in, my account was turned back on without explanation or an apology. If you’re comfortable using a platform where you could have your account removed indiscriminately, purchases cancelled, all listings posted permanently removed and dealing with weeks of headaches, this is the platform for you!!!",1
2817,Fakes: So first off Iv only sold on here a few times and got scammed by a lady who paid me less then what my item sold for and she agreed to pay full price and showed up with less cash and handed it to my oldest daughter in her twenties and drove off when I contacted said buyer she ignored me for over a week before opening my message with no response because she knew she was scamming me I reported it with no response back her acct is still up I look in the fre section often and all I see is posts of people trying to collect money for stuff it’s a joke this site is nothing but scammers .,2
2818,"Location bug: Overall the app does what it is supposed to do by connecting buyers and sellers. There is a bug which is very annoying and contributes to the sloppiness of how this app runs. All my posts for selling items show my mapped location about 10 miles away from my actual location. I have confirmed my zip is correct and I have location services turned on. I notice many other posts in chicago have the same seller neighborhood location so it can’t be just me. 

Seems like an easy defect in the app to fix. When?",3
2819,"Used to be better: Ever since the total change of the layout, the app has been slower to load listings, a lot less responsive, lost standard intuitive features, and just all around a terrible experience. You can’t even pull down from looking at photos in listings to exit from them anymore, swiping back to the previous page has been taken out, the boarder with viewing images now hovers all the time, and sorting is never accurate when set to newest listings. I miss the old UI when things actually worked well.",2
2820,Offer up should not be use for people to advertise themselves: Love offer up for buying and selling items but recently I see a lot of people offering their services for handyman advertising them self on this site and this is not what offer up is about I see this all over they are not selling anything except their services some days is just those people so I started to go on offer up less because of that.,5
2821,"Great App w Areas of Improvement: Great app with a couple areas of improvement as a new user: 

1) being able to message pictures in its messengers 
2) being able to call the person (w/o having his/her number public) like Uber or Lyft 
3) a little bit more improvement on UX in terms of having the necessities out there for easier access (i.e. blocking or reporting a person)
4) sometimes people inquire for one item but end up buying another item when you actually meet. But there’s no function to match the buyer with the item if they haven’t directly inquired about that item. This makes it harder to rate the buyer and inquire back for a review for myself.

Not sure there are legal aspects that are involved in the decisions to not have these functions. But would be a better time for users selling through the app.",4
2822,"Price Gouging and Junk: The app is a good platform to find things second hand I purchased my first truck on here from another user with a good experience. On the other hand those who run the app allow people to price gouge on things like electronics and vehicles and allow it to be posted. They don’t help anyone when doing that and support those who are trying to take advantage of others but don’t allow specific items that “violate their agreement” (2A items/ accessories, not firearms). It is at the point to where it is unbearable to scroll through items due to those who try to take advantage of others flooding the app.",1
2823,"People kept harassing me and asking for personal information: I normally don't review apps but I feel like this needs to be heard. I signed up for an account to sell a camera and a Chromecast about a week ago and this has been an absolute nightmare. Just about every single person who messaged me about the camera harassed me, one person kept trying to pressure me into meeting up with them even though I told them no and that I was not comfortable with it and one asked me for my phone number. Trying to sell the Chromecast had somewhat similar results with one person asking for my home address. Totally and completely unsafe. Reported 3 people in one week's time. What a joke.",1
2824,"Error message after error message: The app hasn’t allowed me to post for a couple weeks now. It alerts me to a server error. I followed all the guidance on the website...deleted and reinstalled, logged out, restarted my device, switched to cellular from wifi (and back and forth). I emailed customer service. It still doesn’t work and I haven’t gotten a response. When I try to access my archived items I get a different error message. If I click my reviews another error message. So glad I paid $15 for the month of ‘promotion plus’...basically flushed that money down the toilet... I wouldn’t be trying to sell stuff on the app if I had money to throw away... 🙄",1
2825,"Too many scammers: Good lord! I’ve been trying to buy a laptop (shipped) and literally every person I’ve tried to buy from has tried to get me to pay outside of the OfferUp app. It’s a shame because I like everything else about the app. Especially the search function. I don’t have to reset all the filters when I change a word in the search bar- That’s a huge time saver. I also like being able to just send an offer. Nice! 
Unfortunately none of it matters if I can’t buy anything- since legitimate sellers apparently don’t exist anymore.",3
2826,"Worst customer service ever: Had a problem posting an item. I was trying to post a new one as it had been up for a while and then i would archive the old post. I have always done this in the past and never had any problem. Something happened and I could no longer post so I emailed customer support. Apparently it’s considered duplicate posting so I have to archive the post first. Instead of just informing me of this, whatever person was on the other end said they removed my duplicate posts(which there were no duplicate posts on my page by the way) and then began threatening to delete my account. Very rude employee who is definitely not there to help.",1
2827,"My OfferUp Review: I have used offer up in several occasions and have always got what I expected without exception. The people have always been pleasant to deal with and have not experience any weird situations.
When I have sold things on OfferUp the people who have contacted me have always been pleasant and have always done what the said they would do.
In short, I have never been ripped of and would recommend using OfferUp without reservation:)",5
2828,"Can’t Post Anything: Two stars for UI design. Minus three for bugs.
As a new user, I downloaded the App and created an account fresh. I created my first posting and when I went to post it, it just says “Something Went Wrong. An unknown error has occurred”.
I killed the app and recreated the posting, same error. I did a quick search to find this is a known problem and the suggestion was to delete and reinstall the app, clear the cache or contact support. I’d be all about any of these if I hadn’t just downloaded the app, fresh, 5 minutes prior. If the app is so buggy it can get corrupt that fast, it’s not very well made.",2
2829,"Good concept terrible execution: App is great for finding items to buy and selling but problem is that in my experience more than 50% of the sellers on here do not respond and when u let offer up know they literally do nothing about it. They need to take action on these people by not allowing them to post or temporarily suspend their account.  

Their nationwide selling is a great idea however these sellers do not even realize they are listing them for sale nationwide and then when you offer to buy they either ignore you or then say it’s for sale local only cuz they don’t want to ship. Very very frustrating.",2
2830,"Good platform overall: I like the app and more often than not I find what I am looking for locally.
They also seem to have less con artists compared with other platforms.
I just have two qualms: the amount of ads is higher than I would care for, and their content is somewhat deceptive.
The other issue: it would be so much nicer if the price is displayed on the main picture, thereby eliminating the need to tap on it a couple of times to get to the details and the price - just as you have it on the computer version thru a browser.",3
2831,"Good App, A lot to improve!: Nice app that allows people to buy and sell stuff. I’ve done several purchases and sales. The in app shipping is good to a lot of details should be fixed. The biggest problem is the fake posts especially in iPhone section. Did you search iPhone X, XS or any new models, you see a lot of duplicate posts with some low quality pictures. Also, they don’t communicate with in app. Instead, they attach some weird email addresses and phone numbers. 100% scammers!! It would be nice if OfferUp can add the ability to send pictures in chatting.",3
2832,"Good app: I’m only giving 3 stars because of the experience. The app itself is awesome. I’ve sold things on there off and on a few years now. Seems like since the years have gone by the people are trashy. Wanting something for nothing. And then wanting to argue over the price. Like really? 

This app need to make it mandatory for every user to be a Trumember. That’s where the profile is filled out 100% and a pic of their photo ID card is submitted before approval. 

That way we serious, wholesome, and fair sellers can actually talk to other serious, wholesome, and fair people.",3
2833,"This crap is not working: What’s good guys i been using your app for about 4yrs now never had an issue with it till last month. For some reason i can’t send messages, follow any sellers i can only quick save items. even my items aren’t getting any views. So when i received an e-mail informing me of the maintenance shut down i was exited. I can’t lie i depend on this app a lot. But once the app was up and running NOTHING CHANGE. I’m still having the same PROBLEMS not sure what was the real purpose of the shutdown.",4
2834,"Too many unnecessary notifications!: I like this app a lot but I absolutely HATE getting notifications that sound like someone messaging me about a product and it turns out to be the app telling me to use it! There NEEDS to be a different tone for notifications. Or just go back to the days where the app only notified me of a message. This is the same reason I got rid of Letgo, the notifications telling me to use the app were so overwhelming, it made me resent the app even more, eventually leading to its deletion. So please, for the sake of humanity, Stop the unnecessary notifications!",3
2835,"Needs a Few Fearures: This app is pretty good overall, but I do think there’s a few things that would make the app a lot better. Being able to restrict your searches to verified sellers would be great. Being able to block people outright (without having to report their account) would be fantastic, and get rid of some of the clutter like the car salesman that post 10-15 cars at a time, and repost them every other day. There are a few more minor features that could make it more user friendly, but all in all it’s a decent app.",3
2836,Overall good: Good place to sell and buy stuff. I like that it puts true you option that way you know who is selling. I think the app should delete the stuff that has been sold so we can see more of the new items people post. I keep seeing a lot of items that are sold so I have to do more scrolling to get to the items that are still up for sale. The only thing I don’t like is people post things online and they take ages to reply if you want to sell an item please reply,4
2837,"Hit or Miss: I only use this app to sell things. My posts are always great quality, I sell great items, I have great personal reviews from my buyers.. BUT the buyers are a hit or miss. Either fantastic or completely ghost you. Buyers generally try to negotiate which is expected & fine by me, but depending on your area you may get super cheap buyers. Sometimes my feed is really active & other times I’ll go months without getting an offer. I still keep the app active on my phone for when a buyer does pop up, but it’s definitely not a steady source of extra pocket cash.",3
2838,Worst App Ever: So I’ve been using OfferUp for a couple years now and I think that overtime it’s gotten progressively worse customer service has always been the absolute worst whoever they have moderating moderates very selectively and even though there are people on this app selling drugs and selling them selves and doing all kinds of illegal stuff if I post a vape battery my stuff is pulled and then I report someone for threatening me because I refused to buy their over priced item and they delete my account. This is just not worth my time and complaints anymore and I’ll be using a different private sales app hence forth. I recommend if you’re going to sell your stuff do it with another app,1
2839,"Frustrated User: I wish I can give this app no stars! Why would you add shipping worldwide if your users will not get their money?? I am reporting this business to the BBB!! There is NO customer service to help if something takes place with an order, your account, your deposit and unsafe practices! DO Not respond to this review with “ contact support with any questions”, because your support does not support!! Automated responses is not support!! Take off worldwide shipping if you can not respond to people’s request !!! I want my money !!! How dare you cancel an order that has been delivered and received to a customer and you have not given me my payment!!! You guys are NOT a professional business!!",1
2840,"Awesome: As soon as I started here, I received several requests for information and I was able to get my replies completed quickly! Unfortunately, I have not been able to sell either after I drastically reduced both. Still waiting for someone to understand that these are brand new and never used and has all of the details required! Please respond!",5
2841,Great app for buying/selling: I am very happy with the way in which this app works.  I’ve already posted and sold a couple of great items. Very quickly I might add.  The reason for 4 stars - I would really like a way to change that status to “pending pickup”. One of my items was so popular I had many many offers and it was a little annoying having to type that out every time.  Not a huge deal but I’ll bet that others would appreciate the additional feature.,4
2842,"Offerup app: Like the app it seems to be fairly easy use. Things that I would like to see change are a tutorial on how to use it. The ability to send photos within the message system, if someone what's more photos of a specific thing or area of a sale item. A button for bartering interest like the firm button you already have. 
I think the bump feature is good but I think it cost too much. I wish there was a faster way to transfer data like ad to offer up. Like photos and data... just a thought. Overall I like it.",3
2843,"Fixed: Notification sound gone: Ever since I updated, I'm not getting notifications anymore. I'm receiving the messages and such, just not being alerted that a new message has arrived. Because of this I have missed needed messages from a few people.

Edit: i uninstalled the app and reinstalled. re-enabled the notifications from the profile page of the app and now they are working again. Not sure why they stopped in the first place, but fixed now.",4
2844,"Not bad for free: I have found that the connections with sellers on this app are more reliable than those on FB marketplace. It’s easy to post and communicate with others. I like that you can rate sellers and buyers. Plus the archive feature and deletions of ads is very convenient. The one thing I would suggest is less adds in between uses. Overall use of app the pop ups have been more disruptive in last 3-6 months, so that why I would give it a 4 it would be 3.5 . It’s a free app so I guess that’s the trade off?!?",3
2845,"Useless app: I’ve been using OfferUp for a while now, and I’m extremely disappointed. Every time I post an item, it feels like it’s completely invisible. My listings get zero views, no matter how well I describe them or how many pictures I upload. It’s frustrating to spend time setting up posts only to have them buried or ignored.
I’ve tried everything from adjusting prices to refreshing the posts, but nothing seems to work. Compared to other platforms, the visibility here is just terrible. If you’re looking to actually sell something, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. OfferUp just isn’t worth the hassle.",1
2846,"It’s Overwhelming with  “DEVELOPERS PAY PER CLICK ADS”,  “PAY TO POST” and no “TRAFFIC” anymore.: I have had this app for many many years. I would post for sale something and I would get 30 to 50 offers a day.  Now 1 a month if I am lucky. It was Awsome for sellers and buyers alike.  Then the posting of the same items over and over again to stay at the top of the list.  Trolls came shortly after that fallowed by “DEVELOPER CLICK ADS EVERYWHERE “.  Now we have to PAY TO POST MOST OF THE TIME.  It’s very rare when you get a response from buyers or sellers as if your post are hidden.  Now that Letgo and OfferUp are one this site has only one place to go and it’s not up.",1
2847,"No one seems to really want to sell: Maybe there is just some quirk about this app that I don’t yet understand, but nobody seems to really want to sell anything. I put in to purchase a lava lamp only to be met with the seller is considering your offer. I was never contacted one way or the other about the offer or the order, so I canceled the transaction. The second item has been paid and sitting in my inbox without any notice from the seller, despite my attempt to contact them.  If I don’t hear from them or see some movement, I will now have to request a refund.  I will likely not be using this app again.",1
2848,"Has become to commercialized: This app has become two commercialized, between the advertisements, and the notifications that have nothing to do with messages it’s annoying. Additionally, I used to be able to sell things very easily on this app and that is no longer the situation now if you want to sell something you have to pay extra to get it bumped up. Facebook marketplace which is free is so much better! And my stuff actually sells on Facebook rather than this app",3
2849,"this app is not it anymore: y’all trying to do too much. best part about offerup when it started was that it was simple to list things quickly. i get you added ads for revenue.. but the placement? sometimes i “click” on ads by scrolling past them, and you put ads in messages to make them look like an unread message? also, nobody is looking for a job on offerup. just one more thing to clutter up what used to be a really nice and clean UI. don’t get me started on the hot mess under the seller tab now. i miss what offerup used to be, clean, simple, and quick. and for the love of gawd why can’t you make ads expire??",1
2850,"Another app getting political: Newest review: Ads are everywhere now in this app. I think it has come time to delete. Old review: I get pop ups in this app telling me who to support politically. The latest one is for Ukraine. Why can’t these app developers stay in their lane and stay out of politics?? At the minimum, develop a good app, which this app is not. Missed notifications, ads everywhere, the community is full of liars and cheats. The latest trend seems to be people posting high quality items for incredibly low prices, but you have to contact them by email. Obvious scams but OfferUp doesn’t seem to be doing anything about it.",1
2851,"A good selling application with a couple inconveniences: Pros:
It’s easy to list items, and the automatic shipping/payment system is great.

Not having an expiration period for posts is nice too. 

Cons:
Having a renewal system like Facebook Marketplace would be good to bump your items toward the top periodically.

On occasion, some messages (incoming and outgoing) are dropped, or I’m never notified of a new message when I open the OfferUp app. I’ve missed a potential buyer that way a few months ago.

The biggest problem I’ve found is with shipping not being available sometimes (not related to the item category or too low listing price). I don’t know what triggers the shipping option to disable. Is it keywords in the title, the description, or the fact of pasting in text from another source?",4
2852,"Cool app, cheap customers: I’ve only had a few real sales but most of the time I’m just posting “free” stuff I need to get rid of because most of OU customers want everything for free. Even if it’s listed for sale with a firm price, you get bombarded with messages asking for it either free or 80 percent off the listing price. It’s ridiculous and a waste of my time. Also there are A LOT of scammers. SO many scammers sending messages wasting your time. They need to figure out how to filter someone or have everyone authenticated.",3
2853,"No way to cancel order.: The seller asked if he could cancel my order because he wants to sell it for a higher amount which I said fine to cancelling the order but there is no way for him to do so now I have to wait 3 days for the order to auto cancel which is ridiculous.
What’s even more ridiculous is that there is no way to contact customer service to get help with the situation. I’ve “requested help” but have just kept getting an automated response. I really don’t like that I can not cancel or request cancellation of an order that has not been shipped out which is something that Mercari lets you do.",1
2854,"Offer Up Review: The fees for selling are outstanding. Offer up should be proud. They charge excessive fees like another selling platform we are all familiar with. Don’t get me wrong, offer up is one of my most used apps, but geez….give people a break. Only place that doesn’t gobble up any profits would be FB. All offer up would have to do is drop selling fees just a little and I believe it would overtake rhymes with “feebay”. I’m just tired of selling an object for example, let’s say $80. By the time I get paid I’m looking at maybe $64.",3
2855,Waste of Time & Energy: Since this app added the premium option I never get replies…like ever…to anything…I upgraded to premium for one billing cycle to see if it made a difference and it didn’t not. I still have never gotten a reply to anything since the premium option became a thing. Even worse it keeps telling me I have messages in my inbox making me think someone has replied but it is ends up being the search notifications not messages and that is just annoying! Deleting the app today. They really failed on this one. Why would anyone use an app they don’t get replies on for months.,1
2856,"Bad marketing for sellers: First of all, I pay $20 a month to sell one item, not multiples one item and ioffer keeps sending me ads to buy things when I’m just here to sell an item but they keep messaging  me about other peoples stuff not progress on my item or even suggestions on better ways to market just ads for everyone else’s stuff if I want to buy someone else’s stuff I will buy someone else’s stuff or look into an item I want to buy but I am just here to sell an item that I am paying $20 a month for advertising. Please stop sending me ads and focus on helping me sell my item please thank you, Steve",1
2857,"They need to let you edit your post: They will unilaterally take down your post, not tell you why exactly, but the kicker is they won’t let you edit it to make the change they want. Why? This has been a thing that Craigslist allows before there was ever a mobile app on an iPhone. I wrote a pretty extensive post selling multiple items, I make one mistake and they nuke it. If there’s a simple issue let me change it so I don’t have to rewrite the whole thing. I’m just going to put my gear up on Craigslist and I’ll use the template because Craigslist doesn’t nuke the entire post if it’s not up to specifications!",1
2858,"No help, slow processing times: I won’t be using offer up anymore due to two reasons one shipping with them is alright it’s convenient but once a item gets delivered expect to wait far longer than any other app to get your funds. I would recommend taking your business and items to sell to eBay and maybe Craigslist. Offer up support is no help ether they already take and process their own cut of your sale before yours they have no problem doing that but can’t help us the people who sell on their site and app we make their app without us they don’t have anything. Don’t use offer up .",1
2859,"No support, no refund.: I paid for an item, and the seller decided he didn’t charge enough for shipping, so he just sent me a message that he was relisting the item, but I had already been charged. I contacted the seller, but he said there was nothing he could do on his end. I have reported the seller, and sent multiple messages to customer support, and haven’t heard anything. This was my first, and definitely will be my last, transaction through this app. I can’t even give the seller a negative review, because he hasn’t shipped the item. Whatever you do, don’t pay through the app, because their “3 day refund” policy is bull.",1
2860,New user: We have a warehouse to clear out and this is my first time using a selling app. I tried offer up first and had a completely easy experience posting my items adding pictures and receiving communications. I tried craigslist the following day and while I also like being able to post there it was not nearly as user-friendly.,5
2861,"After a week. Still all fake items and accounts: Says it all.  Every item that i saw was some fake posted xbox or playstation. Many other cars and bikes etc.  All fake. Internet pictures from google that people try to sell.   Yet the accounts all have no sales and are fake themselves.   In tiny towns around the country to make them seem real.  If a person can afford to sell $15,000 worth of computer parts.  I dont think that person would be living in a town of 300 people and use a name like
Mia khalifa.  -_-    Every item i reported is still active.  No admin or moderation of all the fake products and fake accounts.",1
2862,"DON’T USE THIS APP: The litany of complaints you’re seeing are all true. This app is a complete scam now (it was fine a couple of years ago). OfferUp pulled the same move many others are complaining about: they terminated my account for NO REASON in the middle of the sale. I now won’t be able to collect the money I am owed after sending out the item already. I contacted customer service but based on others’ experiences I doubt they will respond. 
DO NOT USE THIS APP. I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and everyone who has had a similar experience should do the same. This company should be shut down.",1
2863,Flaky sellers no customer support: Sellers are flaky. Made an offer on several items and buyer agrees on price and to meet. Comes time to meet and seller flakes or says they already sold item. If you sold the item don’t tell a customer you are going to sell! Let them know the item is sold or you already have someone interested. Customer supports does nothing when reporting these issues. I used to love this app but buyers beware of all these flaky sellers. Oh and you also can’t leave a review on some of these sellers unless they sell to you making the system rigged. Some sellers have 5 stars ratings when they deserve 2 stars at most,1
2864,New app is very slow. Beware.: OfferUp redesigned the app and it runs poorly on older iPhones. I don’t think this app was tested on older phones. I don’t buy a new phone every year and the app has gotten almost unusable. I did a Google search and other people have this problem so I know it’s not just me. Now it’s faster to post listings in Chrome instead of the OfferUp app. Running iOS 12.5.4 on iPhone 6.,5
2865,Account Deactivated -Creepy App: My account was deactivated for an unknown reason. Hacked?  Tried to contact them to figure out what agreement I violated. Sold three items quickly and bought one item then everything went south when I messaged someone with interest in a car. No reply to my message waited 24 hours and sent a second message in case the first wasn’t delivered?  Maybe they complained? Have zero idea why being a 50 something woman posting a few extra things was a negative experience. Can’t get anyone to reply. Ick want my information and account deleted not deactivated!  Terrible end to a good beginning.,1
2866,Need to make changes.: Offer up use to be great. I use to be able to sell a lot of things on here and would also look for stuff my self. But since there is so many fake users and people are always trying to scam someone for money is horrible. They need to filter out all the fake fraud and let the people that want to sell and buy do so but offer up as sure lost it’s touch. They need to make changes or people like let will delete the app and not use it again. Thanks for the short time using it bit I will be getting rid of this app do to the fact that there is to much fraud. Bye offer up. Never agin.,1
2867,Review: Offer up is great for selling items however for buying items I find that 60% of the time nobody responds to your messages about purchasing an item also it’s become like an auction on popular items and it goes to the highest bidder for instance the last auction was AC units people would post for a price not return any messages then re-post for a way higher price then say whoever bids the most by a certain time gets the item so if you have all day to wait and want to get soaked for money it’s great,3
2868,"The app is great: But it can be a little better if they make it a little bit user friendlier. 
The Saved or favorites button should be in the Main page on the main menu at the bottom bar. And once accessed the favorites should appear in a grid just like everything does in the main screen. It would be great too if there was a search bar to search within our favorites.",5
2869,"Terrible UI, and unfriendly implementation decisions: I have never in my life had more trouble swiping back and forth between pages/cards. It seems to have gotten better in the last release, but still incredibly hanky. It's almost worse in a way, because it gives false hope that swiping will work.

Ads are intrusive and obnoxious, and promoted ads, items, and things that ship when you're interested in a local region are all really irritating. 

Uncommon items show listings that are months or even years old... Let's be real here, folks.",2
2870,"Wish they had a better support team...: Been using this app for years and ran into an issue this week with a subscription. Found it unheard of that a Company this big could not answer a simple support question and concern without sending me the same generated response through email for 2 days straight. In the end told me to contact Apple and it wasn’t their issue. 100% their issue and you’ve lost a potential paying customer... asked for a call, asked for more clarification and got nothing. Step your game up OfferUp. Super disappointed in you",2
2871,"What?: This app is terrible. LetGo was perfect and had a clean interface. This app is loaded with ads and links to eBay and other sites. The listings are out of order even after clicking only current listings. It’s hard to navigate and is just terrible. Hopefully improvements are made and my rating will change. As for right now, this app leaves much to be desired.",5
2872,"Nice app , no customer service!: I’ve used this app several times without issues for the most part. I am currently having crashing problems right now and there is no way to get in touch with a solution. I’ve shut down my phone and restarted the app several times. Very annoying! Also, I can’t seem to figure out how to purge the photos on my account. At least chat support would be nice. Over all, a good and easy concept. I will rate higher if I can get these items figured out.",3
2873,"Not worth using: I was happy with letgo, I did not use Offer-up ever (before the merger), the platform was cumbersome to use and not good at listing items for sale with positive results for sellers.

It’s worth knowing that when you list an item for sale, Offer up sells against you.  It is observed that someone who is interested in an item you list for sale, OfferUp populates items from their advertisers to compete with your listing making it difficult for sellers “to sell” their items.

For example, if you are selling a used high end blender and another user is interested and clicks on your item-they become bombarded with advertisements for blenders at Walmart that undercut your listing price without regard to quality comparisons, thus making it more challenging for sellers.

I went back to selling on Craigslist - and shame on letgo-for selling out a superior selling/buying platform to the much more inferior/user unfriendly/ advertising heavy “OfferUp”

I do not recommend this app.",1
2874,Still can’t send pics in chat. Smh #fail: Pretty good app but could be a five star app only if you could send pics in the chat. Every time I go to by something I usually have to ask them for more pics and it’s a shame they can’t send them on the app. I have to give them my phone number and have them text me the pics. I’d prefer to keep all dealings in the app as much as I could. It’s much safer that was then having to give everyone on here your phone number. Please add the send pictures in messages function ASAP. Safer for us. Better for you.,3
2875,"Good way to sell locally: Mostly it works fine, I like the fact that you can check some basic info on your bidder/buyer and see if they are verified. Functionality on creating new ads is not very intuitive and could be improved, lime adding a “create new” button. I would ad a feature where you can edit photos so as to include text, comments, arrows etc. I would also allow a reply to be deleted if not yet delivered to other party in case you make a mistake.",4
2876,Great!: I love everything about this app and it’s perfect except the fact that you get banned from sending messages if you give out your phone number. I would like to see a camera feature implemented into the messaging system because sometimes you just can’t explain a part you need as need to send pictures (if you are looking for car parts) definitely a five start app because I use this solely for car parts and such. Thanks for the wonderful app!,4
2877,"DO NOT GET THIS APP FULL OF SCAMMERS: I’m deleting this app.  It’s full of scammers.  As soon as you list something for sale you will receive a message from a bogus person acting like they want to purchase your item.  They will ask for your cell number so they can verify you are legit.  It’s a huge scam.  I turn them in every time and OfferUp does nothing to stop them.  I’ve switched to a real selling platforms that do a much better job of policing their members.  Beware of profiles of potential buyers if they have no photo, just opened an account  and are not verified.  You can also tell by the broken English that is used when they communicate.",1
2878,"Bring back Letgo: I don’t know how there could be so many positive reviews for this app. Since merging Letgo into OfferUp all I can say is OfferUp ruined a great app and a great marketplace to sell local items. If I want to purchase items on eBay I will go to eBay to find the item.
Letgo created an easy place to buy and sell items locally with a little protection from scammers and scary people. OfferUp is a joke filled with nothing I want to buy. All the favorites I was looking at on Letgo are gone and none of the postings that others had are coming over to OfferUp. Do the math OfferUp nobody who used Letgo are using OfferUp you messed up a good thing. 

Do us all a favor and turn Letgo back on and leave it alone an out of date non updated Letgo app would be 100 times better than this joke you have created.

Are you owned by Zuckerburg and we just don’t know it? At this rate most people will sign up for Facebook marketplace because real people actually sell things there, so it must be a marketing ploy to drive up Facebook. Nice work!",1
2879,"OfferUp+letgo = let down.: I highly prefer the letgo platform. I avoided OfferUp specifically because I dislike the interface so much. When I downloaded the “new” merged app it was exactly like OfferUp...... what a huge disappointment. I was hoping the merge would look more  like letgo; specifically the filtering options, the layout of the home screen, the messaging function, the user-friendliness...well, basically everything. It would be great if this is just a glitch and this isn’t actually the “new” app...But if not, hopefully there are some changes coming very soon. On the other hand, my disinclination for the “new” app may save me some money, so I guess it’s not a total loss...",1
2880,"Message typing: I really enjoy having the Offer up on my IPad, and i am not sure if its for everybody, but the typing of the message to the seller disappears from the screen and some option bar starts hover over the text of the message as soon as i starts to type. It’s very frustrating! And how easily it sends the message is also annoying fact. If that can be changed, I would be such a happy Ofupper! Thanks!",5
2881,"Real people quality sales: I’ve been with offer up about one year and I found so much quality items on here for great prices. It’s  easy, fast and really good people just getting rid of stuff other good people need/want. I sold a few items including a car here and on this day today I found my second dream car just in time for my birthday. Thanks creators of offer up. You created a great platform at our finger tips.

DELONE RANGER 2020",5
2882,"Excellent and fast response!: The sellers responds fast, prompt with shipping, but they can improve on the accuracy of their description of their products that they are selling. Ex. One seller is selling a sewing machine/embroidery machine, according to her descriptions. Then when you ask when more detailed questions and thinking about buying the seller states the embroidery part is sold separate from the sewing machine. I suggest that the sellers include important details about their products.",5
2883,"Customer service is terrible: I have been using offer you for over a 2 years and recently had my account removed. I don’t know why my account has been removed, I have been trying to reach out to offerup support for over a month now and it seems impossible, I had a 5 star review from everyone I sold to and bought from. I got and email saying ur account has been removed and decision won’t be overturned. So I have made a lot of good sales and now banned for life for a unknown reason. What is this offerup. What kind of platform decides to band someone for life without giving them a warning and not even providing a reason for the account has been removed.",1
2884,Great app...can be even greater if...: This app is awesome but would be even better if there was an edit function on the boards where you could move multiple listings to other boards or remove multiple listings at once. It takes so long to delete items from your board since you have to do it one by one and after each one it takes you all the way back to the top. Please :),5
2885,"Notifications ??: I like the app, it’s easy to look at and use. However, They need to improve their notifications within the app. It’s almost impossible to connect with people since you hardly ever get a response and if you do they are apologizing for not seeing the notification, which you also didn’t see until like 2 days later because you didn’t see the notification. Besides that it’s a really good way to get 2nd hand things at a pretty good price.",4
2886,"Scam city: I have had this app work for a number of small items, but know that this app is chocked full of scammers. I would NOT sell very expensive items on here. My dad was taken for $1800 over his lawn mower. I still receive fraudulent messages all day long over his lawn mower. I would just steer clear and not involve the elderly or the technically unsavvy. OfferUp can only go so far in trying to make you whole again if something goes wrong.

In this reviewers opinion they don’t do any real due diligence on the people who sign up for this, it’s way too easy for people to make dummy accounts and send messages. Bots everywhere.",2
2887,"Not For the Boog Bois: OfferUp has been wonderful in selling nonessentials, but unfortunately their site is not 2nd Amendment friendly in any way. They don’t allow posts of BB guns, air soft guns, magazines or ammo. Now BB guns and air soft guns not being allowed is hilarious. But magazines and ammo being labeled as “dangerous items” is not. This site will go out of their way to ban you if you try to sell these “dangerous items”, but the real kicker is they will ban you without warning. I didn’t receive a warning of being banned until after they decided to do it. This in turn does not make them a seller friendly site of what essentials people need during a pandemic.",2
2888,"Super easy! And responsive team...: OfferUp comes through in a lot of ways... and IMO is best of its kind!

This app simplifies the listing process for sellers — and ever since they introduced the easy shipping, it’s in another league. Way easier and less pricey than eBay, and much safer than Craigslist. Customer service is also responsive — the one time I had an issue, the team got right on it till it was resolved.

To everyone at OfferUp... Keep up the great work!",5
2889,"Waste of time: This app made me realize people are miserable and have no life. 98% of the people that contacted me would schedule meetups, and no show or offer to buy and you never hear from them again. I stopped using the app because I realize that it was more of an annoyance than helpful. Even though Craigslist and Letgo have less contacts at least when someone does contact you most of the time it is to purchase. And trying to delete your account is an option. They just deactivate, which is basically just logging out, because you just log back in. Offerup is full of tracking and I do not trust an app that refuses to delete my account.",1
2890,Love it and recommend it!: This app is so easy to use and my go to when I want to get rid of something. I’ve tried other apps like Poshmark and they are just too complicated for my liking. And it takes forever to sell one item. Using offer up I sold something in the same day in an hour! I recommend it to all my friends or family looking to get rid of their items or just to make extra cash.,5
2891,"App stopped working: Hi! I love this app and it is def my go to when i wanna find something quickly and not pay a-lot for it. I hate going to yard sales and looking on craigslist for small items. However, I don't know if its the new IOS update or the new app update, but my app no longer works. It wont refresh and keeps telling me to log in my account(which I already am). I deleted the app and re-downloaded and it still doesn't work. Can you fix this or is it just my phone?",4
2892,"Advertising new products: The only thing I would like to see change is all the advertising of new products. This app should be just for buying used stuff not  stores products!.
And for some reason when you publish a product a bunch of people textbyou asking you questions already in the advertising, I wonder if those messages are fake just to make you feel people are interested?.",5
2893,"My Help To You: Offer Up has nice viewing of buyers, but if there was one thing to take away it would be the easy message sending. 99% of the people using quick messaging are the trolls. These folks have almost no intention of buying. 
The actual buyers often don’t use quick messaging, because they have questions that you don’t have on quick messages. 
If you want me to explain it to you call. 👍🏻",5
2894,"Greatest App Since IG: This app has changed my life in so many ways. I no longer have to deal with clutter and unwanted items in my garage or house and not to mention the great deals I find. I’ve saved and made so much money on OfferUp that Im thinking about quitting my day job and committing to buying and selling on OfferUp full time, not really but it could be done. I’d recommend this app to anyone trying to make a quick buck or just trying to find a good deal.",5
2895,"Horrible: I love the app I have used it for almost 6 years . But they don’t have a customer service  number and they haven’t replied to any of my emails or reports. I was supposed to buy a watch from a verified buyer as the app said they wanted me to cash app them and they sent me a fake tracking number I notified offer up to have the user taken down to save other people from being scammed but instead they never even responded the person keeps posting things they don’t have and their scamming people . This site doesn’t even try to reach out or help the users when there is an issue . If you see a user named Eric from Morganton, N.C. don’t buy anything from him.",1
2896,"Banned without any notification: I have been using this app since it was launched 2015 I guess. Had over 500 stars. However my account banned without any reasonable explanation. I asked a little question if I am not obeying the rules how I got 500 five stars. 

OfferUp team is just ignoring the sellers who send email and try to scam or selling guns through the application and ridiculously focusing the stock photos.

 Common be professional. If you keep going  to inserts lots of ads among the local listings and not to listen real users , you will be definitely disappearing in the market.
 The guys who develop the application can not be aware of the real requirements as much as the users with 500 stars

Unfortunately you removed my account instead of listening my very valuable feedback",5
2897,"About to delete: I use this app a lot but now every time I send a message to someone I get no response, I have made a new account to test it out and even responded to a post my dad has posted so I could see if my messages are going out and they don’t. My dad never got the message and it’s just wasting space on my phone now, I’d like to continue using the app but this has been going on for a long time now and I haven’t done anything that should have gotten me banned, please fix your app and maybe I will give it another shot but wasting my time looking for something and wanting to buy it but can’t because people can’t read my messages it gets annoying.",1
2898,What’s happening?: Ok so I was reading the reviews and I noticed there was a couple that are describing my exact situation. So I’ve been a loyal user and I have many followers and 5 star ratings but I began to notice that every time I would post something I wouldn’t get views or any messages and I would say that’s not possible. I use offer up as my job that’s how I make my money and I’ve been broke because offer up has been acting up and this is totally not cool ! I decided to create a new account since I NEED money and the same thing is happening. I’ve contacted the support team multiple times and I haven’t gotten a reply. I would always recommend this app but not anymore.,1
2899,"Pointless: I’m now on day 3 of not being able to post anything for sale. 
I’ve deleted the app, reinstalled it, and it still did not help. 
After I go through all the pages of getting my item ready to list and then click post it just sits there with the circle loading saying “post” over and over and over again.  It doesn’t stop. So I close down the app, reopen it and still it didn’t post. 
What gives?! Seriously frustrated bc I’ve been using this app a lot lately and under normal circumstances would give it 5 stars, but if I can’t post listings then it’s basically pointless for me to have it. I’m trying to make money not spend. Sorry.....",1
2900,"Great app: Well designed app. However, when I mark something “Sold”, it gave me the option of rating the Buyer or stating that I sold it somewhere other than OfferUp. The only Buyer listed was the only person who had inquired about the item, but I sold it to another Buyer of another item and we had texted about viewing this item as well. So, since I didn’t have the option of rating the real Buyer, I had to say I sold it elsewhere.",5
2901,"Removing items from Board: I love the app. It is user friendly and very easy to navigate. Would like to see the removal of items from boards be a little more convenient. Every time an item is deleted it defaults back to the top of the screen and if someone has a plethora of items it can be time consuming to delete.  Guess if not possible to find fix, someone should not be such a hoarder. ;) Thanks for a great shopping app!!!",5
2902,"Horrible customer service response!: I’ve been experiencing issues with the app....getting offers to post timely, having posts denied, posting new items with no views (all of a sudden) which was never an issue until recently.  It’s as though they don’t care about their customers!  I will be deleting my account if not handled/fixed timely and sharing with all on social media outlets Offer UP’s poor service!",5
2903,"It’s better than letgo: The interface is better and easier to got thru all the stuff that people want to sell but don’t want to sell. Why do people do that ? Anyhow it’s Better to me and i have to write a positive review only because they are going to put eBay out of business! Screw you eBay. 

Now, to who ever made this, create a currency that isn’t fictitious. And take over the world. You already took that first step. And as you were told along time ago, it isn’t how big of a step the first one is , it’s just talking the darn  thing. You started what is supposed to be and I came back to say thanks. From all the Ones humans have been lied to about for so long.  On a cellular level you can remember us and your future generations will too. 

It’ll make sense soon

2904,"Stay in your lane: This site started by people advertising their own personal products. Now you’ve included so much new stuff. The used items being sold had stories and personal connections to their favourite tool, bar item, motor cycle or jewellery! That’s what kept me looking for that special piece to put in my den or garage to add to my collections! It’s raining outside didn’t have anything to do! Lol",5
2905,Offer Up is a big disappointment.: I signed up and listed my motorcycle for sale.  After about being on the Offer App for about two months my account was banned for violating their community guidelines!  There was no specific reason why my account was banned???  I decided to delete the APP because I don’t need these types of headaches!  You would think if I did something wrong they would send me a message and give me a warning first so I could correct the problem.  However they just decided to ban me from the platform!!! No customer service or support at all.  I will not be joining this APP ever again!!!,1
2906,"THEY RUINED THIS APP: This app used to be great but I list items to sell on 3 apps & I’ve made thousands on the other 2 apps & ZERO on here! The format is awful for listing & editing your listings, very slow & always takes you back to the top so it makes it almost impossible to keep it up to date! I have ONLY scammers messaging me & no real buyers & on the other apps I’ve had maybe one scammer so obviously there’s something on here that causes them to continue. I do like how you get paid without having to do anything but I’ve only used that a few times many many years ago since nothing sells on here anymore.",1
2907,"Can’t close the ads: I understand that applications that don’t generate any direct revenue for the developers need advertising. But, is this OfferUp case? Anyhow… the advertisement is HORRIBLE. I can’t close the ads no matter how many times I tap the close button or how long I wait. The only way is to force close the app and reopening it. This ruins the experience for me. I used to infinitely scroll browse for random things that I may buy. Today I just look for specific things and quickly get frustrated with the ads and close the app. You guys can do better.",2
2908,"Other: Too many items that are for sale have no relevance to the area in which we reside.
Can items be categorized by geographic location? It seems that items I view  are miles away and shipping is involved  with no option to view unless you purchase that item. 
That does not suit me- or anyone else that views the  site. My viewing of “Let go” has dropped significantly because of this. 
Fix this please.",4
2909,"App is Effective, Interface is Navigable, but… Notifications: The app is great, and I have bought and sold on OfferUp. I have had a good experience every time. I have my notifications turned on so that if I receive a message from a potential buyer/seller, I receive their message right away. However, the app sends me recommendations of items, and it pops up as a notification. I wish I could turn those notifications off, while keep notifications from other people using the app.",3
2910,"Glitch galore and missing basic functionality: I thought I’d like this app but my entire interaction with the app has been frustrating.  On iPhone there is a glitch where it doesn't allow you to access albums on your phone. 

The fact you can not post an ad for an item from the web browser is absurd. Basic functionality. You’ve lost me as a customer and you will continue to lose people if you do not allow for this option. Especially if you force people to download the app and it glitches.",2
2911,"Convoluted shipping/ funky registration of sensitive data: Your system of shipping has nothing to do with reality. I will never ship through you EVER.
I have input my name address and SS# twice now. Where is the confirmation??  This is stuff that should be handled with respect and care. I truly believe in protecting the buyer, I get it .. but the legit people trying to sell are not being supported properly. Assigning incorrect postage, fees that should show up when setting up the posting?   Transparency is not great and there is now way to verify the receipt of the 1099 form in the account settings. Truly not good.",2
2912,"Read the recent reviews: The “team” at this app are abhorrent. You are better off using craigslist, eBay, or even Facebook marketplace. 
There’s no way to verify your shipping address until a sale is finalized and if you attempt to contact a seller on the messaging about this they will cancel your account, complete with a vague reason that never gets a clear answer. 
The seller listing fee’s and final sale fees are outrageous-  you’re better off with ebay, seriously.
No customer service, support, just robotic replies to any questions. Don’t believe me? Go on reddit, twitter, any open forum and read the actual user reviews.",1
2913,Terrible Company: Was sold a fake card. Filed the 2-day claim which they list as “buyer protected”. Never received an email from them stating that they needed further information. Literally NEVER RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THEM. Then I contact them asking what’s taking so long and they say my claim was denied because I never followed up with them based off an email that I never received. I asked their contact numbers to provide me proof of me being notified and not a single resource has been able to do so. They keep trying to dismiss me with “sorry” “your claims was denied”. This company should be in jail for this u ethical practice. Avoid them at all costs!,1
2914,"No notifications for messages?: If youre actually trying to sell products on this app, don’t bother. There are tons of notification options for newsletters? And not a single one for POTENTIAL BUYERS TRYING TO CONTACT ME FOR MY PRODUCT. Absolutely insane. If I don’t come on the app on a daily basis by my own volition, i literally cant see the messages from buyers? I’ve recieved multiple messages after i reply too late saying “No thanks, I just bought one from someone else.” It’s the only part of the app i really need- I don’t need recommended products, newsletters, or subscribing to sellers?

In the past I was able to choose photos from a specific photo album in iOS and that function no longer works. Tapping to choose an album does nothin. I don’t have time to stage another photo shoot of items I already have pics for. This is very frustrating as I haven’t been able to update or create new posts for almost 6 months. Scrolling back to the old photos from over 1 year ago through thousands of images is not an option. Yes, I capture a lot of photos and videos.",1
2916,Decent: It’s a good app that serves a purpose but there needs to be some kind of penalty for no shows. I had a couple cases where some agreed to buy it and said they would either be coming over shortly or a set time and no showed and wouldn’t respond after that. There should something when both parties agree to a price and time that it’s looked in to the app so when they no show it’s marked on their profile. Right now the only way to say something is if they actually buy it. I’m also tired of the harassing notifications that I get and there is no way to turn them off. I’m done with this app,1
2917,"Too many scam messages and marketing emails: The app is alright for selling things although most of the messages I received were scams. Beyond that I turned off every marketing email notification I could find and they still sent me emails and push notifications about my recent searches and random items and promotions. I then unsubscribed multiple times and still keep getting emails. I could forgive some of the scam messages since that’s hard to control, but you should really honor user’s decisions to opt out of emails and not spam them",2
2918,"Won’t let me into the app: I’m trying to enter one star, but the app won’t let me. I’ve used this app successfully before, but now, every time I try to enter it, the teddy bear icon shows up and says, Oops, we’re experiencing problems. Try back later. (For over a week?!?)
Then, when I try to post this review, it says I need a “nickname” and it says, “The nickname is taken. Enter another and try again.” 
It seems that evey nickname under the sun is already taken? Even the fictitious safe word I made up for my son being picked up after school by someone?? Am I in detention by OfferUp?",2
2919,Have fun getting banned for no reason!: A couple weeks ago my items stopped getting any views and nobody would respond to my messages. It turns out there is some sort of automated system that shadow bans you without warning. I wasted two weeks posting items and messaging people before I figured out what was going on. I tried contacting customer service and they didn’t respond. I have bought and sold over 60 items on offer up and have all great reviews. Not sure why they banned me :-/ super annoying as I was trying to turn this into a side hustle. Oh well… back to the other classified apps.,1
2920,"Fantastic local and national market: This app is fantastic because so many people use it. It takes out the middle man and the cost that comes with it. It also takes safety seriously, and when potential buyers try to convince you to go off-app to sell your stuff, they will send you a warning about potential scammers. Way better, and safer than Craigslist…in my opinion.",5
2921,Improvements required: App needs improvements to require sellers to offer shipping for small items as some people have no means of transportation to meet at a location to do the transaction. This would help benifit a lot of people primary those in the disabled community. Also when items arrive late and we pay for shipping we should get a partial refund on shipping due to the shipping carrier not delivering a item as on the granteed day. Also please allow your app to work in vpn envirments as some of us are required to use vpn by our isp to even use the internet.,2
2922,"Irritating: To scroll through each category having an idea of what I want something to look like and also to be functional. I’ll know it when I see it so I keep scrolling…wait…there it is! Yay!!! That is going to be perfect, gorgeous, even better than I anticipated. Msg to seller, is this still available? Waiting, waiting , waiting, and waiting….

I was making good sales meeting nice people and here they are removing me and NOT TELLING ME WHY when I reached out to them. They just said account will be removed for prohibited items.

I told them I sell clothes and nothing illegal about that. I take pictures of them and all are brand new.

They don’t listen to reason and don’t even explain themselves or give you a chance to know what you are allegedly doing wrong.

My advice is to STAY AWAY FROM OFFER UP AND SELL ELSEWHERE LIKE CRAIGSLIST. They are mean, nasty, and have NO LEGITIMATE REASON TO CLOSE PEOPLE’S ACCOUNTS RANDOMLY.

I will also leave a bad review with Yelp. I am warning people they are REALLY REALLY BAD AND WILL CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON.

SHAME ON OFFER UP NOT HELPING PEOPLE JUST CLOSING THEIR ACCOUNTS RANDOMLY!!!!

STAY AWAY FROM OFFER UP!! You will eventually get your account closed or some drama.",1
2924,It is ok..: People are abusing this app. There is a lot of trash posts. A lot of duplicates. Some scams if you know what they look like. A lot of old accounts with old posts. It is sort of hard to look for things when you can’t see the price. Searching for items is not very organized because you will find tires and car parts in a category that is only made to view vehicles. It is all random. I still use it because it is just there at your finger tips but I do not like using this app. I wish that could be a moderator to fix what I see.,2
2925,Deleted my account for nothing..: Um it was going well at first.. but one day I was trying to buy my mother some shoes for her birthday.. I brought them and talked to the seller and offer up put up a “review” which took 24 hours and some change I waited.. just to come back to a whole deleted account saying I Didn’t follow guidelines.. I haven’t done anything wrong but try to buy a pair of shoes like I always do so i was very very confused.. now I re downloaded the app and made a new account and nobody is responding because they can’t see my messages I’m not sure for what reason.. this app Is just all in all weird and it’s so upsetting.,1
2926,"Screen does not rotate on iPad: I like using the app on my iPad but the screen does not rotate and that is a big issue since i use my keyboard for input. My neck hurts trying to see the ads sideways. Just kidding, but seriously, this is not good and needs to be fixed asap. I also wish the prices showed without having to open each item. That would save so much time and would make shopping much easier. Fix those 2 issues and i will change my review to 5 stars. Thanks!",4
2927,"Used to be good.: Now it’s pretty much all scammers, and there is no way to change the settings so you don’t get “recommended from sellers” notifications which is totally pointless when the only notifications you NEED are to let you know of messages or people interested in buying. So you either get annoying useless pop ups or you have no idea if someone’s actually messaging you. Other resale apps are much better, as it seems OfferUp has been “working on” this issue now for over a year and no improvements made this far.",2
2928,"Scammers galore: I cannot find one legitimate person to purchase from on this app. Not one!!! 
Not to mention that it is full of ads from all of the sites where I would Google purchases from to begin with if I was looking for new items. It’s unfair, and completely inappropriate.
I’m beyond disappointed that let go has become this. I preferred let go much more to this. I had very positive experiences with that app, but with this one I have had no experiences, because everyone I keep trying to purchase from has tried to scam me on here. And the purchasers as well!
Everyone and anyone, beware! 
I will be removing my account entirely.",1
2929,Poor quality: I never leave reviews but this app is so bad. It is overrun by scammers who try and get your phone number as well as do deals outside of the app to scam people who aren’t as educated on this type of transaction. When I finally find someone who isn’t a scammer As I try to make an offer it keeps telling me it can’t scan my debit card even tho all the numbers that pop up are correct and matching those on my card with no way around it I just have to pass up the opportunity to buy because the app is so poorly run that you can’t even make a purchase. Fire offer up and bring back letgo.,1
2930,Disappointed: Really disappointed. I guess I created a acct a long time ago because when starting a acct it tells me i already have one. So I click forgot password and it does not send the email to reset. I even checked junk email and nothing. I waited all day and nothin. I try to go back on the app to see if there’s a contact number or email and nothing (couldn’t get that far on app without password) so I tried logging in through Facebook but there’s an error. Very frustrating and disappointed that leaves me no choice but to skip this app and move to another selling source that is better.,1
2931,"Lots of Spam- DO NOT give out your number: I get 3-5 phishing posts immediately after every post I create. I can’t believe OfferUp hasn’t come up with a better way to handle this. I’ve had some successful sales and I think it’s worth using, but you have to be VERY careful, and dont be too quick to answer potential buyers. Click on their profile and look for signs they are real people. And no need to ever give out your phone number, stick to the chat and provide a public meeting place to meet them rather than your personal address.",3
2932,"App could use some work: I actually like the app and use it often. Unfortunately when you set up an alert for an item you’re looking for, the alert comes in too late and the item is no longer available. Also the users don’t update their listing marking them sold. There should be an expiration time frame for the listing where the user selling has to renew the listing. A waste of time for those waiting on a reply to know if the item is available",3
2933,"The updated app with LetGo Merger is Terrible: OfferUp use to be pretty awesome. This new app is terrible, the amount of scams on the system have increased. The app is glitchy now. I tried selling a vehicle only to have my post removed multiple times because I didn’t pay the fee. I was ready and willing to pay the listing fee. I emailed support asking how to pay the fee and they sent me the same stupid canned response email that I was already getting about how I needed to pay a fee but nothing about how to actually do that. It’s a joke. A little more focus on a seamless app and better customer support could go a long way.",2
2934,"Love & Hate: It’s very tough for me to give OfferUp this rating but I really think that they deserve it. The app notifications are totally broken, there are a lot of things for sale not on OfferUp which can be annoying, and there are plenty of scammers. I’m not talking about like reselling but there are many OfferUp users who intend to scam and steal. This needs to be fixed... badly. Also message notifications seem like they would be an easy fix for it being a messaging platform.

On the other hand I have used the platform to sell a few things and it has been good for that. I like the rating system as well.",2
2935,"GREAT APP. Focus on scams: This app is great. I bought two cars, I bought a couple of hardware tools, I bought bikes for my kids, and many other things. I just think they need to focus more on security and the certain scams that go on on the app such as people only offering delivery and listing $10,000 cars for $2000. They ask for transfer money or contact them directly through private emails and not through the app, which is a scam. Be careful people. Don’t send gift cards or money transfers outside the app.",4
2936,"The time thieves: It was better on the older version before this one when it allowed you to hold down on the item and it would temporarily appear with about 70% of the item info and if you were interested you would apply more pressure on screen and it would take you to the complete item screen with this new version  they went back like 2 versions to were you have to click on each item and see the whole item info,to much time is lost with this veryi guess they do this show thier  adds are seen more by forcing us to spend more time on the app",2
2937,"Security risks: The app is great for the most part. However, multiple, obvious scams are out there every day. Offer up does not do enough to stop these scams and in turn put their users in unsafe and sometimes deadly situations. They can say it was that other app but since offer up has taken over that other app the scams have at least doubled on the app. I would think offer up would want to stop these dangerous scammers from posting but they seem very unconcerned when I questioned them about it. Be safe people, offer up isn’t watching out for you, they are most likely culprits in the scams as well.",2
2938,Hold up my order: I like offer up but when I order something to be delivered they always hold up my order for two or three days and I really don’t like that. Ok m already concerned about some products sight in seen and then they add extra stress by not processing my purchase until two or three days later.... I always use the same card I have never not paid there is no risk whatsoever. After this if I can’t pick up my purchase I won’t use offer up because they take to much time and they don’t warn you before hand . 🤨,3
2939,Offer up took over Letgo?: Basically letgo was more organized and user friendly. I am not hearing notifications from buyers. There are waaaayyyyy too many sponsored ads and you can’t tell the difference between them and a legitimate post. There are too many items being displayed from far away places. There are very very old postings displaying - a year old. This isn’t a fast way to buy or sell. This is more of a commercial platform than a marketplace for consumers to exchange items with themselves. If Offer up has acquired letgo they need to think about what made letgo such a great platform and adopt those characteristics. Frankly....just bring Let go back.....please!!,1
2940,Upgrade app please: Can you please upgrade the app so when you tap and chose and object of sale instead of tapping back(to go back to the items for sale) you can swipe down and it takes you back to the main page you were previously on ( the items for sale). Feel free to massage me back if I didn’t explain my self correctly.  This would make it much easier to maneuver the app with your thumb.,5
2941,"I really don’t like the combination of let go and offer up: I do not care for the combination of the two apps. I don’t care how offer up is set up. I don’t like how you have to click on items just to find out they have been posted 1-2 years ago. And I need to click on each item just to find out an item is an outrageous price that I’d never pay. I have found and bought many items off let go, I have looked numerous times on offer up for numerous items and have never had any luck finding what I’m looking for. Offer up isn’t even a choice for me anymore when I’m looking for privately sold or used items anymore. Waste of time.",1
2942,"This app is crap!: This app is a pile of dog poo! Like you can apply filters to set the distance, and it still shows things all the way across the country. Like Let go was an amazing platform. Offer up bought it and basically hit the delete button in it. What they should of done was take a look at how much better it was, and incorporated it in this this hunk of crap. Please improve this app! And quit putting notifications along side my messages. What a stupid way of doing things. Plus you could of took my profile from let go, and gave me all of my trusted history back. Now I have to start building my reputation all over again! Thanks a lot!",1
2943,Too Many Fake Postings + Scammers: There’s too many fake profiles on the app... Sometimes it feels like the app is basically catering to these scammers by not reporting them and letting them lurk around for no reason or maybe just to make people believe that there’s a lot of people using the app. In reality most people I know prefer either LetGo or Mercari... I used to like OfferUp a lot but 2020 is a whole different story. This app needs serious improvement in several areas of consumer interest. But I’ve still given it 3 Stars for my good experience in 2018 m while using the app.,3
2944,Perfect for my theatre troupe: This app has been absolutely perfect for my theatre troupe to find new furniture and props for our plays. It has been extremely easy to navigate and contact people on. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone or any group looking to buy or sell anything. There is such a diverse selection of things even in a small town like my own that you could find whatever it is you are looking for.,5
2945,"Offer up: Two months ago offer up was amazing!!! I was able to text anyone about anything. Now you have to join tru you. The problem with that is myself and a lot others can’t use OfferUp because we don’t have an ID. Now I can’t reply to a guy with a fix ramp
I really want to buy. So Offerup if you can change your change my review would be five stars!! Offer up is amazing when you wouldn’t  have to join tru you.",5
2946,Shipping a problem: I really like offer up for local sales but as far as shipping items offer of only considers the poundage not the dimensions nor the destination. Unfortunately many items cost over $10 and I have not been able to resolve the problem of how to ship to somebody when it cost over the amount of $10. Customer service does not get in touch with you to correct that situation.,5
2947,"USED TO BE GREAT: I used to LOVE this app! What USED TO make it so great, and stand out from the rest, was it defaulted to showing you items 10 miles away or closer. Now it defaults to 30 miles, so you see items in cities an hour away! I HATE IT because who wants to drive over 30 minutes for a $3-10 item?! It makes so much more sense for you to manually set the distance further, if it’s an item you’re willing to drive further for. Now fewer potential buyers are seeing your goods and we are missing out on sales when they notice the far location. This drastically increases the flake factor. PLEASE PUT THE DEFAULT BACK TO 10 MILES!",2
2948,"Helpful App: I enjoy buying / selling on here, especially because you can see other people’s rating so it gives you a sense of safety when you’re about to meet up with someone. As a business person, I have bought and sold several items easily! Just be careful who you meet up with, other than that, OfferUp is very useful. If you need to get rid of things you don’t use around the house, I would recommend OfferUp.",5
2949,Crashes can’t use with WiFi: Constantly crashes. Can’t use it on any of my devices with my internet connection. Don’t have this problem with any other app. Have to use valuable cellular data. Easy to list and search when I can get into the website. This has been ongoing problem for over a year. It would be nice if I could speak with someone in customer service. Guess they don’t care.,5
2950,"OFFERUP SHIPPING STOLE MY MONEY!: Previously I had always used Mercari as a selling platform, but I wanted something new so I turned to offer up. Within 10 minutes of posting an item, the buyer and I had agreed on a price, the payment went through and I got it ready to ship to her. I shipped the package two days before the deadline and the buyer received my package. Offer up then cancelled the transaction completely and never sent me my money when they indeed took it from the buyer! When I talked to supposed they told me that I would have to come to a resolution with the buyer!?! What kind of selling platform is this? You sell your things, ship them out, and the company keeps the money!",1
2951,"Nice APP: My family and I are moving out of California; but interstate moving is really expensive. So I was really fussy about what I am going to do with all my stuff here. Some guy today told me use this APP, so I tried a few hours ago. It seems that is really fast and efficient. It helped my stuff found their new home. I feel this APP is really very helpful for people like us to let some good stuff go to a right family and not wasted totally! Thanks!",5
2952,"They are starting to get greedy ads ads and more ads: So I’ve enjoyed offer up for a couple years now but like any company that gets big they are getting greedy. There use to be no ads, then a fair amount of ads, now there are multiple ads per scroll. I know Offer Up is not a charity but if I randomly look at a post I have to deal with 20+ ads on something I might not even be looking for. The more ads/greed the lower the rating... it’s only fair. Hey I can always go back to Craigslist (like I’m sure many will) if it gets too bad.",3
2953,Better Than Craigslist!: OfferUp is my most viewed app! It’s a safer Craigslist app that provides a little more security and trust in your sellers. I have also made some great connections with sellers who come across specifics that I’m interested in. I have referred this app too many people who said they would give it a try; and now they are just as addicted to the app as I am. This is not only a buyers and sellers app. This is a gateway for opportunity and the possibilities are limitless!,5
2954,Beautiful: I have bought a beautiful dinning room set off of offer up also two gorgeous bedroom chairs and a bar  also a Tiffany style ceiling light plus another Tiffany style ceiling light with fan just gorgeous now I’m looking for a queen size bedroom set offer up is the best site ever I truly recommend offer up before anyone goes out to the store and spends all that money and create bills look on offer up first  and also I have met some amazing people,5
2955,"Notifications Are Annoying! Please fix.: This is a great app for buying and selling, and have had nothing but success in that aspect, but it’s really annoying when I receive notifications on trending items that are selling in my area, I really don’t need you to tell what I should be buying this weekend...now I am also receiving promo ads in my inbox, please stop!!!! This is really annoying!!!! I had to turn off notifications for offer up, but now I’m missing notification messages from buyers and sellers. Please fix this experience.",3
2956,"Horrible support never resolve a thing: Apparently I’ve been banned from reading the reviews for posting a product more then a few times that’s a joke I’ve done business with many people on the app gotten 5 star reviews and all of sudden banned what a joke I use to love this app sold and purchased and now nothing big disappointment don’t waste ur time with this app look at all the negative reviews stating the same things smh they don’t respond to email unless u write reviews either smh recommend people use letgo instead way better customer service

Below it says to contact support it’s been a week since I contacted support and no response smh horrible service.",1
2957,"Back 2 the Future: OfferUp has tons of potential but the app feels like when craigslist first came out. The features / protection / shipping, etc. is nice no issues. It’s that aesthetically it’s ugly and a little annoying to navigate (ex- I have no options to filter / sort / search my own or anyone else’s listings). You just scroll for days, lose your spot? Start all over. I try to use Quick Save but just little annoying things that I wish you guys would clean up to make it more like Facebook marketplace or GOAT/Kixify other reseller type applications.",3
2958,"Good app, bad people: Overall, this is a good and easy app to use. However, the people that sell and buy on this app are so rude. People who show up with a different offer than originally stated, people who flake multiple days in a row, and people who are extremely non-communicative and treat you like a store by showing up whenever they feel like with no warning and then getting mad at you. I actually haven’t yet had one good experience on this app. It’s not necessarily the fault of the developers... but there must be some way to help regulate and educate seller/buyer courtesy.",3
2959,"Compromised Information: Recently, I got a text notification from OfferUp that someone has reported my account as a scam account, and I had to verify my email and password login. Now, I am getting emails about people offering to buy my Ford truck, which isn't on my account and nothing I have ever listed. I'm talking a good 20 emails suddenly. When I click the link to the listing, I receive a network error. Clearly, their security is compromised, and now I have to switch all my passwords. Their customer service is either non responsive or takes a month to get a non-helpful general response about how they ""don't see any issues"" with my account. Seriously troubling.",1
2960,"Good app with a few bumps: I give it a 5 Star rating because I've enjoyed selling, however, there are a few issues with the app performance.  Often the 'Rate Buyer' tab doesn't do anything... just gets stuck. Also, I've been told by Buyers that after a certain amount of time, they can't go in and rate me as a Seller. It should let you know somewhere you only have a certain amount of time to use the rating.",5
2961,"Love This App: We have used this app to sell items we have tried to sell in garage sales or CL. We have had better success rate with OfferUp. The only gripe I have is that when we try to buy, they took the local pickup option away. That was nice because it eliminated a lot of out of town options. Otherwise, great app and have recommended it to two friends already.",5
2962,"Feeezes: The pop up ads have made the OfferUp app almost impossible to use. The pop up ads makes the app freeze either before or after the ads. I am in a deep scroll through listings. I make an offer on a random item, then I go back to keep scrolling, the app freezes! I have to force close the app. In turn I lost my place while scrolling. 
So many duplicate postings from business. The app has lost its way by allowing this. We cant enjoy the app for its fundamental purpose. 
I had to turn to Facebook marketplace after all these issues.",2
2963,"Annoying advertisements: This is a great app. However, recently they added some very annoying popups. I don’t mind the popups, but sometimes they are too long. I am here to sell things and don’t have time to wade through all those kind of advertisements. I would have given 5stars, but this interrupts my work and searches. Also, all the Temu advertisements are taking over your app. You won’t see that on eBay or Poshmark.",4
2964,"Problems seeing all pics of post: I only gave 3 stars because. I was trying to write offerup why I can only see 1 pic of peoples post, the rest of their pics seem to be stuck at top of my phone screen, where I cannot push on selective pictures. Idk if it is because people are not posting them correctly or my phone, etc. But I cant seem to find a way to email etc, my question to offerup 
I sold a truck on here but had no problems seeing all the pictures I posted….??",3
2965,"Apps Gets In It's Own Way: From fullscreen ads with close buttons that cannot be clicked, showing posts from disabled user accounts, broken sorting mechanisms that fluff results worth the same posts over and over again (if you do recent first you'll likely see recent, then years ago, then recent-ish, to years ago), the app reloading itself when you navigate away from it for a few seconds, and keeping inactive user's posts indefinitely, the app is designed to look like there's a lot of usage but it's mostly dead postings looping over and over while hoping that you won't notice.",1
2966,"So many fake or old listings: There might be 1 out of 10 listings that will actually get a response. So many have oh I don’t chat send me an email at whatever. Obviously a scam. And then there’s all the listings that are over a month all that no one responds to. There should be some automated thing that if someone’s not responding after a week shut down the listing but I guess the developer feels that they just want a lot of listings so it looks like people are using them. New update added more ads when backing out of an item, some people of them are difficult to close. Getting worse not better.",1
2967,ITS GOOD WHEN ITS GOOD: Honestly there’s nothing bad or wrong about this app but in the selling world through it always be a challenge it seems to me with any selling app it all depends on what you’re selling if you’re selling something that’s in demand are always in demand he will do good but if you’re selling older items that are for a little knickknacks you could be holding onto those for years until you get a sale or never get a sale so just depends on what you’re selling. But all in all this is a great app!,3
2968,"Changes needed: Works to sell but the user base doesn't seem to be growing and Facebook marketplace or poshmark seem to be better. Lots of glitches with the app: you can mark sold elsewhere but it still asks about selling experience on the app, continues to show notifications when all are read and current issue- I'm travelling outside the US and have a new notification and it won't even allow me to open the app to read or respond; I understand we cannot sell if living outside the US but seriously? I can't open the app of not on US soil?!",2
2969,"App is junk, Letgo was so much better: They won’t purge ads, some listings go back 2 years.  Too much junk ads to sift through.  Absolute clutter with the one inch squares for pictures.  How can anyone see peoples ads?  I have a visual disability, you should be able to control the size of the ads.  Should default to your local area, instead the app defaults to your local area plus scammers who want to ship things to you. Absolute worst app ever.  Facebook marketplace is so much better alternative.  I’ve been asking them to purge ads older than a year with zero response from the developers.  A true time waster of an app.",1
2970,"Still receive push notifications even though disabled: Something I’ve always noticed with the app is I have purposely turned off all of the notifications settings through the actual app, not through the iPhone settings because I still want to receive notifications for messages. I still receive notifications for “New Items from Sellers You Follow” even though I’ve unchecked the box. I’ve updated the app so I’m not sure why it still happens.",3
2971,"TruYou and Customer Service: I’m new to this app as it was recommended by a friend. I am in the process of getting TruYou verified so that I can start posting my items for sale. I want potential customers to trust that I am a real person selling genuine items, that is why I decided to get TruYou verified. They said it would take up to 48 hours with an approval or denial, but most of the time verification only takes a few minutes. It has been 10 days since I submitted my info to get verified. I have reached out to customer service twice in that time period and I haven’t received any response. It’s frustrating at this point.",1
2972,"Full of scams, no support from OfferUp: Scammers thrive here. The app itself is full of bugs and sellers will use that knowledge to convince you to pay using an alternate method because they claim that OfferUps payment system is unreliable (which is very believable after a short time of using the app). Once you get scammed and try to report the seller, OfferUp will disable your own account without warning or explanation and they will leave the scammer’s account up. OfferUp will also disable your account while you have pending payments active to other sellers on the app, leaving no way for you to cancel an order and recover your money.",1
2973,Very good buy and sell: Be careful lots of obvious scam accounts on this website nobody sells an iPhone 12 Pro Max for 100 dollars because their son was born and you go to their profile with no selling history nothing and they have multiple items similar to this posted for extremely low price these are scammers they need to do a better job at getting rid of these accounts other then that it’s a good buy and sell website,4
2974,Free pays x10 what advertising will pay per volume: Ok App Offer up app trying to limit you with fees per post not realizing their is more money in volume and not in limitations to the account. Advertising would pay x10 with what they trying to charge you per posting add. They have bad marketing analyst. But thank you Offer Up for opportunity very happy with easy platform and easy uploading system.,5
2975,"Plagued with Spam ads: I’m not a big “reviewer” I usually just skip the “leave a review” pop up on every app. But maybe this could help the apps developers. Every other picture on RV’s or any vehicle listing is usually a vehicle posted for $600-$1500 with only one picture instructing the viewer to email them directly for info. I have reported multiple of them but they never get taken down. Don’t even know why I use the app but 1/3 posts are actually real. Also, many ads and listings are from 2 years+ on certain items. If the seller doesn’t respond or it’s passed a certain time frame they should be removed.",1
2976,Update seller item plz!: I’ve actually used your app to purchase a couple different items from sellers. However I would say there is a tremendous and I mean that with a T amount of sellers that are on here that no longer have the items but yet the post is still there. We’re talking 1 to 3 years out and of course these people do not respond however it makes the search for any items you’re looking for a much more challenging to know which ones are real or not.,3
2977,"Camera Section Is A Cesspool Of Scam Posts: There needs to be vigilant, active moderation of posts in the camera section. Furthermore, we need an option to be able to select posts by verified members only. Lastly, OfferUp needs to do a better job at identifying accounts that have been hacked. In its current state, OfferUp is unusable for sales and purchase of camera equipment. Which is a shame as I’ve been using OfferUo for a few years now. Until they make the necessary changes I will have to look elsewhere.",3
2978,"Great if you wanted a dating app….: I posted a few items, all of them clothes. Only got messages like “hey beautiful” or one message asking me how big my boobs were. I also posted these same things on Poshmark and have only gotten offers or questions about the amour of wear and tear on the actual clothes, which is a legitimate question for buying secondhand clothes. 

Seriously, the people on this app are creepy and I really suggest that you use another one to sell clothes especially. The people on this app make me never want to meet up with anyone who is actually interested in purchasing items for fear of my safety.",1
2979,"Kicked off for no reason: Have used this app extensively for a number of years. Preferred it to Craigslist. Just recently connecting with a couple sellers re: their lawnmowers. We are messaging back and forth like I have normally done. Next thing I know I can’t message them in the app. I keep getting a “something went wrong” error message. I thought maybe the app had a bug, so I switched over to my laptop. Tried to log in and was informed that I have been kicked off the platform for “violating community guidelines”. No explanation. No reason given. Anyone else have this problem? Tried reaching out to OfferUp. Crickets...",1
2980,Could be better: Notifications are awful. I never hear them nor do they show up and stay up long enough on the screen. I have them all on but when I open the app that’s when I’m notified of new interested buyers. It’s just too subtle and should give you the option to make bolder notifications. I’m missing out on money because of this .....,5
2981,"Posting/Messaging Issues !: Hello Offer Up Team, Ive been using this app since 2016. I haven’t had issues until now.... I tried posting a few items but I don’t get no views and the items do not show up on my profile page. I’m also having trouble with messaging other sellers. I don’t know what is the issue with my account or I believe it is the app. I updated it not long ago and it is still giving me issues. Please help me fix this. I do not want to lose my star ratings! I’d appreciate a response from a representative. I’ve tried emailing offer up support but I do not get a confirmation sent to my email.",1
2982,"Updates make app even slower: The developers have apparently decided to fix something that wasn’t broke.  Every operation in the app is now slow AF.  Images take forever to load, transitions between item detail screens and the main list take a long time, the image previews are now zoomed in so instead of quickly being able to swipe between images you have to click into the full screen image viewer to see full detail.  App is getting more and more annoying to use with every update.",3
2983,"Offer up is a great place to shop.: Offer up is great. My first purchase was a pickup truck that has ran great.
The seller (Clyde Clinton) was easy to work with and I would definitely buy from again. But buyer beware, There are scammers on there too! If you are asked to finish your transaction on eBay or another site...RUN!!!
It is more than likely a scam. But overall I have made several purchases and am very satisfied with the experience!",5
2984,"App is ok customer base is useless: I came to OfferUp when LetGo was bought by them. I had some success on LetGo selling things I had laying around. Since being moved to OfferUp I have had zero sales. I have 7 items listed. I’ve had numerous low ball offers. Low ball meaning about 25% of what I listed it for. I’ve had 4 no shows that wasted hours of my time and 2 people demanding I give them my phone number. 
One complaint about the company itself is that you can view your items on their website but not post from there. Gets tiring typing on the phone. 
So app is decent but useless due to bad clientele.",2
2985,"Wrongfully Locked my account, but a great app.: I have been using Let-go for years and when offer-up took them over it was an even greater experience. I loved using it until one day I went to check if a tablet I was selling had any inquiries. I could not sign in and still can not sign in. My account is not visible to my friends who helped check to see if it is active still. I had a five star rating, I had all of the verification and qualifications, and yet my account was seized for no reason. I’ve gone through the process of getting my account back to no avail, and I feel cheated.",2
2986,"TERRIBLE UPDATE: Ever since OfferUp merged with LetGo, it’s been terrible. The new updated app is garbage. I can no longer follow people. And the people that I had already been following, are now non existent. There’s no way to find them anymore. Same with my followers. Also, favoriting an item has gotten more tedious because I have to go to my settings just to figure out where my favorited items are. Also, I can no longer expand the map of the location of an item that I am interested in. People no longer have banners anymore and we can’t see the last time a person was online anymore. Please bring back your previous version. This update is garbage.",1
2987,"Overall a good app!: It’s a good app, The only thing though is that the sellers never reply? it’s probably a Me problem. It happens more than often. I’m assuming they don’t receive my message, because they’ll post or have recent post yet never reply to any messages so could there be done in the messaging spectrum something that shows you they’ve read your message ? So you won’t daydream about whatever their selling 😭",5
2988,"Terrible App...: I’ve enjoyed using OfferUp to sell/buy items. For some reason, my account was wrongfully removed for violation of Community Guidelines & Posting Rules. I was an active seller with positive feedback from the community. Why would I do anything that would result in my account getting removed? I’ve contacted OfferUp support via email to get a better explanation as to why my account was removed for violation of Community Guidelines & Posting Rules, but they wouldn’t give me any. This just shows you how much OfferUp doesn’t about the people using their platform. I was making money from selling my items on the app, how are you guys going to just take that away from me?",1
2989,"Terrible Customer Service: This app is good at what it does, but the people who run it couldn’t care less about the people who use there app. 
First off, if you decide to list your items for sell; be prepared to list your items every day so that people will even see your item, unless of course you throw money at OfferUp.
Second, you can’t list your contact info or address directly on any ads, so if you want to post something for free for curbside pickup you get flooded with messages which is really annoying.
Third, if you happen to post any of this contact info on an ad for sale, the people running it will censor the information and then ban your account so that you can’t send or receive messages, and then not tell you about it. They will then proceed to completely delete your account without disclosing any reason for said deletion. 

Long story short, this app is better for buyers than sellers, and their support team is garbage.",1
2990,"Too many game players: This app has the potential to be awesome, but there are so many people that play games that it is actually an exercise in futility. 
The only time you are allowed to leave feedback on someone is when an actual transaction takes place. The app desperately needs a way to report (and remove) those that send messages saying they want to purchase your item and then disappear, or worse, those that make an appointment to complete the transaction and never show up, nor do you ever hear from them.
 In all honesty, it’s easier to list things on ebay with either “local pick-up only” or shipping if you are willing.",1
2991,"OfferUp canceled my order after I shipped the product out: I had a very bad experience with OfferUp. USPS delayed in updating tracking info, which OfferUp canceled my order. Although I did send emails to them letting them know that I shipped it, it just need more time to be reflected on usps tracking. They did nothing until the order now has been cancelled, and usps now showing the product has been delivered. I email them again, but no response. Now I am even unable to see the transaction record in my account. Now, I lost my product as well as my money! Very unsatisfied. I hope letgo back. This shipping issue is stupid.",1
2992,"Place is filled with scammers.: There’s been many people joining and posting ridiculously cheap stuff that would usually cost more with the same story, “I’m giving it away because I got a new one, tell me why you need it and I’ll consider giving it to you”.  
There is alot of those going around either giving stuff away or selling an expensive item very cheap.",5
2993,"Very reliable app: Best app ever. I know it’s always trust worthy to contact and meet random people. But that’s the reason I like this app.
1) don’t have to share you contact
2) you can rate member as your experience
3) Member is have “Tru” verification
4) for extra precautions, you can meet member at secure place in public instead of meet at your own residence. Example: any gas station or shopping plaza. Because most of them having outside surveillance Camera",5
2994,App suddenly stopped working: I’ve been a loyal and consistent user of OfferUp since 2014 but for some reason my messages aren’t being delivered anymore. The problem began about a year ago and I can’t seem to fix it or get ahold of anyone that can help. No one responds to my emails asking for assistance with the issue. I guess I’ll just have to delete the app and use Facebook marketplace instead.,5
2995,Great App: This is a great way to sell unwanted items or to make a little cash on the side. One thing that would help this app is to add something to block certain sellers. I’ve recently been looking for a refrigerator for my garage and I thought OfferUp would be a great place to start. There is a group of 3 to 5 people that spam ads for a appliance store that make it impossible to actually find an individual that is selling a fridge. I looked at one of the seller’s profiles and he had almost 1400 pending ads. Super irritating. I started looking on Craigslist today.,3
2996,"App won’t work (Please help!): I have an iPhone X and OfferUp hasn’t been working for me for the past few months. I’ve repeatedly tried making new accounts and uninstalling and reinstalling but never works. Also, every time I post an item, I cannot get any views on my post. I cannot receive messages by another or send any messages. Offer up can you help me out here? This was by far my favorite selling app but ever since it hasn’t been working I can’t use it. I would like to give it a 5 star because I’ve sold my products on here but until my issue is resolved I cannot say I enjoy using this app because I’m not able to do anything.",1
2997,"Please fix this app: Too many users from 2-3 years ago that have over 1,000 posts that are duplicates of each other. Can you make a time limit so that posts will expire after 1 month of inactivity like Letgo has? It will clean up the page and make it easier to see new posts/items that are available in the area. Most appreciated!",5
2998,Bring back price previews!: I used to love this app until a recent update that removed the listed price in the picture before actually clicking it.  Now you actually have to click on the item you’re looking for just to see the price. Not sure if that’s just a tactic to get people to click on more peoples postings but honestly just made me stop using it because it just takes up way more time.,5
2999,"Legit for now: I have had great success with this app. I even took a chance and shipped my product without getting paid. OfferUp told me that the buyer needed time to make sure that the product was working correctly. This is all fine and good, but I could see how the shady people could just say it was broken and get it free. But for now it seems to be much classier and less shady that Craigslist. But you know how people be f$&@n s$&t up eventually.",5
