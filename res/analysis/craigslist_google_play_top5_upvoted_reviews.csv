It needs a dead space that's larger for scrolling while in an ad, and leave only the farthest edges for moving to next listing. Also zooming in and out is clunky, jumps you into other pictures too easily when you just want to look at the details of a single photo instead. It's just plain sloppy UI, needs some work.",quirky frustrating navigate go swipe leave see picture want look instead take next list instead many time need dead space that large scroll ad leave farthest edge move next listing also zoom clunky jump picture easily want look detail single photo instead plain sloppy i need work,[],912,,None

Before I downloaded the app, I was using Craigslist on the web. When you went into the cars and trucks section, your thumbnail or gallery would show the mileage on most vehicle. When you download the app the mileage is no longer visible unless you go into the ad. This happens both on the web and the app. Sent an inquiry to Craigslist with no response. That's the reason for the low score.",download change view format also web download use craigslist web go car truck section thumbnail gallery would show mileage vehicle download mileage longer visible unless go ad happen web send inquiry craigslist response that reason low score,[],898,,None

Could be more intuitive and feature rich but hey, you get what you pay for. Unlike many other ads it's not a downscaled version of the website-it actually adds capability, which is great.

Can't really ask for more.

Other apps in the past were so much better than this one. This one feels abandoned. It requires Google Play installed for some reason, and even then, doesn't show any results. Craigslist would've been better off buying one of the much better past apps, than developing this useless app.",craigslist get craigslist apes take play store year five u garbage instead apes past much good one one feel abandon require googly play instal reason even doesn't show result craigslist would've good buy one much good past apes develop useless,[],801,,None
