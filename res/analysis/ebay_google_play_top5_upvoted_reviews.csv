Install this app. and eBay on a mobile device is a snap. eBay is the best place for hard-to-find items, low prices, accurate search hits, guarantee you will get the item you ordered, or eBay will refund your money + all shipping costs you paid. You will get a free return label to put on the package you recieved, and you just send it back. If you received nothing, you just open a refund request.",give use multiple time per day year well browser interface install bay mobile device snap bay best place hardtofind item low price accurate search hit guarantee get item order bay refund money shipping cost pay get free return label put package received send back receive nothing open refund request,1128,,None

I like being able to save stuff but I wish there was a notepad feature in ebay so I could save hunting notes without tripping the discount feature. P.S. the tracking feature.

You cannot select multiple photos, only 1 at a time. Once that's loaded you have to go back and scroll through all your pics again.
