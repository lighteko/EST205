Everyone knows that size numbers and S, M, L mean nothing; without actual measurements I end up returning twice as many items. 2) They started charging a ""restocking fee"" for most items if you return them. These two policies make it difficult to love ThredUp. :(",use love thredup they've make two change make hard love 1 long include measurement item everyone know size number l mean nothing without actual measurement end return twice many item 2 start charge restock fee item return two policy make difficult love thredup,203,"Hi Deborah!

There are some amazing finds, but like any thrifting you may have to search for a while. I'd like to note, that sadly they don't carry men's clothes, which hopefully will change one day, as I love getting my fiance Hawaiian shirts, and I do find the best at thrift stores",love thrift originally get see saw lot ad instagram end loving make and purchase amazing find like drifting may search id like note sadly don't carry men clothes hopefully change one day love get finance hawaiian shirt find best thrift store,182,,None

I clicked on google pay and the order got placed to an incorrect address. When I emailed Thredup immediately after placing an order, they never replied, then they took my money and continued to ship it to the wrong address. Now I am attempting to block the shipment through fedex and am going to my bank to explain this was an unauthorized transaction.",order anything company place first order never give chance create modify ship address click googly pay order get place incorrect address email thredup immediately place order never reply take money continue ship wrong address attempt block shipment feel go bank explain unauthorized transaction,179,"Hi Jill.
