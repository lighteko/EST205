Prices are not displayed on search result thumbnails like Craigslist has, however. You have to go into each item individually to see the price. A lot of ads in search results, often not even relevant. Search results require a lot of sorting. I bought something from a seller who shipped the item and I have no way of rating them! No way to just block someone you have to report them too",like reputation system unlike craigslist help weed flake lowballed little price display search result thumbnail like craigslist however go item individually see price lot ad search result often even relevant search result require lot sort buy something seller ship item way rating way block someone report,911,"We are here to help, so please contact us at socialcare@offerup.com and we can take a look.",2024-01-30 17:33:44

It was a good app, and now it's full of spammers and scammers, sellers don't respond, and many listings have been left up there for years with no update or response. Selective enforcement of the TOS. Ads are everywhere, and many look just like a normal listing does. Used car dealerships flood the used car listings. It's a free-for-all.

For example, where is the edit button for my post? What if I want to add a photo to my post? There is no edit button. Plus, OfferUp is very, very slow to upload anything. I was done with my ad in less than 5 minutes on Craigslist. Whereas with OfferUp, I'm still waiting to see my post uploaded after an hour. Not user-friendly at all.",i great technology know basic offer unfriendly use ever example edit button post want add photo post edit button plus offer slow upload anything do ad less 5 minute craigslist whereas offer i still wait see post uploaded hour userfriendly,539,,None

Listing is also easy. 4 stars bc of the ""see more/see less"" function of the item description, you only see the first 3 lines. I think it should be deleted and just display the entire description like in Craigslist. Many times I've met with people just to waste time and have awkward moments bc they didn't read the entire description.",long time user good well put always recommend anyone search sort price distance category easily list also easy 4 star be see foresee less function item description see first 3 line think delete display entire description like craigslist many time give meet people waste time awkward moment be didn't read entire description,536,"Thanks a bunch for the rating!
