0,Fun place to shop “ EBay: I have been with EBay for several years now ! I have enjoyed it the whole time ! I shop on here because I can find what I want and not have to get out on the road to go find it ! Not only do you have the convenience from shopping at home  but a good chance it’s going to be cheaper ! Your not burning gas and your safer shopping from your own home ! I don’t have to walk down aisle after aisle either ! I just use my fingertip ! I just found an item here on EBay that I could not find anywhere ! I’ve made a few calls and was given different phone numbers and not one helped ! I got on EBay and found it ! Yea ... I was real surprised ! I admit I did contact them several times to see if it was the real pieces I needed ! They even sent measurements of the part and everything was exactly the same size ! I just purchased it and just so happens that this review popped up ! I had to do it because this last purchase was one that I thought would not happen after all the calling I have done and a lot of internet research ! I thought all that time looking for these parts that I was not going to have any luck ! I got on EBay and found it in about 5 minutes ! I purchased it and now I will wait for it to be delivered !,5
1,"listing templates on mobile?: I’ve been buying and selling on eBay a long time and love it, there’s one feature I wish they had for sellers though that I’m surprised they don’t - currently you can’t use a listing template for a new item on mobile, only desktop. I use templates for nearly everything to save a ton of time because my items are in the same category, same weight, same condition, and the base description is there. Currently I have to create a new listing from the template on desktop, save it as a draft, and then open the draft on my phone to upload the photos from my phone and finish the listing. I will say, switching between desktop and mobile when making a listing is pretty seamless, but if I could just list from a template on my phone I wouldn’t have to. Fingers crossed they implement this one day. Also as a buyer I hope for better keyword filtering options for saved searches, I get a lot of stuff I don’t want in my feed because of limited options..my searches end up being long strings of negative keywording that hits the character limit.

Small personal nitpicks though on a stellar app that I love and use daily…I enjoy most of the new features and updates..especially the new saved search layout option that populates new listing photos from all your saved searches on multiple scrollable rows, it makes quickly browsing new listings so much faster. Keep up the great work eBay!",4
2,"Upgrade your app: With many fads these days, opportunity is quick to pass by. Do not miss the opportunity to stay ahead of any competition. UPGRADE THE APP. Mobility is the path of the future. More and more people are starting to live on the go and the app is much easier to access while traveling. There are SO MANY features available on the website that are not available through the app. This costs the company tons of money by not adding many of the selling features. There are other things as well, such as the ability to send invoices, issue refunds, have better watch lists, having a better selling centers for eBay stores among others. You should also expand the ability save more drafts for a longer period of time as well as the ability to go further back on items sold by a seller. 2 months is ridiculous. Even the ability to go further back in terms of items bought would be smarter (2-3 years is great but 5-7 years would be much smarter). The search algorithms could also use some serious work. There have been numerous times where I was searching for items using key words in the titling and still have to search for 3-4 different terms to find items. You should also expand the “similar items” section and REALLY do some work on that. If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out. I work for a Fortune 500 company and spend much of my free time on the app. I can provide some useful insight. Thanks.",3
3,"Somehow I owe eBay $ they’re taking from my account when I list for “free”: I’ve been selling on eBay for about three months now in the beginning I was really excited because I love Thrifting and finding chosen treasures and helping other people find their treasures as a result! Being out of work, a big part of the motivation for me was also that I need some income. in the beginning, there was a learning curve as far as what I sell the item for versus what I get in my bank account and win. It claims that it’s a 13 to 15% fee depending on the items and I was charging the customer shipping and I only ever listed the items in a way that according to eBay, it was meant to be free. Over the course of the last month however, eBay has multiple times claimed that I am indebted to them somehow and taken money out of my bank account including overnight last night to the tune of three different debit transactions. I genuinely don’t understand why and they’re most certainly not paying me as much as they claim to have according to my sales year to date versus my bank account and I’m so defeated and frustrated by the whole system the second I find employment again I don’t know that I’ll buy or sell on eBay when interacting with others and they’ve asked me what I think of it I’ve been perfectly honest with them and told them that I eBay is robbing me. Unless you’re selling items daily, it most certainly is not amount of income that is in anyway sustainable.",2
4,"Problems inside the app....: I don’t like the new format. While building ads, I should be able to turn features off and never be asked those questions again, like allowing the seller to give me a half price offer, shipping the item for free, or if I want consider reducing the price over time. Though those options might be consider by some, they absolutely don’t work for me and it adds extra time and worry to building an eBay ad. I would like to see, easier access for creating sales, easier distribution of my sale flier (past, non- following buyers), and more apparent of the actual things I purchase. They need to remove “sell” and “selling” terms on the front page, as it makes it more confusing to navigate. Finally, though buyer protection is nice, there needs to be a better follow through investigation on return items. Many times the buyers circumvent my “no return” clause, with made up conditions just to make me look like a bad seller. Often times, the past buyer’s have confessed that they did not read my description; only the title. This gives me an unfair advantage to me because they didn’t do due diligence before that bought the item.

I am always willing to further express my on going concerns. I have been a seller for a few years and have experienced several changes. I need some cooperation from EBay in order for me to continue as the luster of being a seller is starting to fade fast. Please let me know,
Tom",3
5,"My review didn’t go through? Yeah, no.: Update : they fixed it finally.

The interface and “tree” of categories in the numerous settings pages are an absolute cluster of a mess. What a disgrace. As a seller I tried to sell something (after a while of inactivity) and it takes me to a page with a FAKE CONTINUE BUTTON to verify my identity. The other option said call customer service. Inspecting the page easily shows the button is even labeled as FAKE with no action. I call eBay customer service and they tell me to press continue. What a joke. After staying on the phone with me to verify everything they said wait 24 hours and try another browser. I’ve tried several different browsers and different branded devices. I verified all my information, made sure my names and address all matches EXACTLY, and my CC and bank. I had to copy and paste several links and follow a set of arbitrary instructions suggested by THE COMMUNITY to see settings that are NOT AVAILABLE WHILE VISUALLY NAVIGATING. Fix your menu navigation. Yes, i unlinked my PayPal. What a joke. When customer service is telling you to press continue on a fake button, it’s clear the techs have no idea what’s going on. I’m not the only one complaining about this exact issue. End rant",5
6,"No excuse!: There have been improvements, which is about time. But… How is it possible one still cannot sort watched items for each particular seller? Are you ever going to include that option in the sorting/filtering list? If I want to buy something, I like to know if there are other items from that seller I have saved in my watchlist with which I can combine to be shipped together. This is an extremely necessary option and grave oversight. WHEN??? As far as eBay itself, their customer service (if you get through the wild goose chase maze of useless help menus and happen to get as far as contacting someone) is awful. Good luck getting anything resolved. eBay’s “money back guarantee” is a complete false claim and sham. Agents have flat out LIED to me. Yep. They told me I would get a refund for a ring that was not as described (much damage) and later said they knew nothing about it, no refund. They implied the seller was a “valued member”, so they pretended their previous ruling did not exist. They also arbitrarily make decisions on buyer’s behalf without allowing you to object and provide additional information to support your case. Another beef is there is no way to rate a seller/purchase after certain amount of time. Well, sometimes an international purchase does not arrive for some months, and/or problems are not discovered until later. I rarely visit eBay anymore due to my disgust with my experience mentioned above.",2
7,"Getting signed out every time I leave the app, or my phone closes while on the app: I’m an eBay seller, and customer and I’m constantly using the app for purchases, and in all the ways I need to operate my store. I’m in and out of the app countless of times a day, however for the passed 8+ months I’ve been getting signed out CONSTANTLY. it doesn’t matter if I leave the app for 10 seconds to reply to a text, use my calculator, or google something, or even if I look away from my phone for 30 seconds and my phone locks I still get signed out. The problem doesn’t happen on my computer browser, and I’ve spent countless of hours on the phone with customers service but they claim I’m the only person that has made this claim. The only solution they’ve provided that even slightly worked has been deleting the app and reinstalling, but even IF that works it never works for more than a couple hours. I’m not sure what else I can do to try and solve this, but it’s pretty ridiculous that I fork over over 25% to EBay in fees from every sale I make (not including the other % that comes out of every sale because I have to promote every listing to get any real amount of views) yet it’s been 8+ months of being signed out COUNTLESS amounts of times a day, and spending COUNTLESS hours talking to customer service about the same thing over and over and over to still be dealing with this. Please get this fixed. Im not sure what else im supposed to do or say about this.",1
8,"A Better Shopping Experience: I’ve been with EBAY almost 20 years and I’ve never once had a bad buying or selling experience that caused me some sort of anxiety to the point I wanted to cancel my membership.  I can always trust that the reviews and ratings given to both parties are accurate in helping me to decide if they are a legitimate, honest and straight forward EBAY’ER before I do business with them.  A much larger online store booted me from making anymore consumer reviews through my buying profile because I was giving them too many good reviews.  They said it was because of the descriptive “review wording” I was using that caused some suspicion and perhaps I was favoring that company more so over the others.  Could you believe that!  Reviews are meant to critique both the buyer and sellers shopping experience so other consumers can evaluate them and decide for themselves if they want to do business with them or not.  Also, I don’t mind waiting a few extra days of shipping to receive my product through EBAY because I know it will be what I ordered to begin with, and If I have any issues, I can trust it will be handled in a professional and friendly manner without any hassle.  For me, I’m back to doing more of my shopping on EBAY.  It’ll be worth it.",5
9,"eBay is excellent: Love the eBay app .. and everything about eBay My favorite place to get the things I like Aloha .. Dean

The only problem is I’ve called and explained a bad review to eBay that wasn’t erased as I spent many hours on the phone with eBay after I even finally got the buyer he gives me an unfair review making it very difficult to sell other items now plus actually lost money and spent many hours at home trying to give this guy his refund and I hope you will erase it as he claims he Accidentally pushed purchase but then how could he accidentally go to checkout and pay .. then I get all the blame it’s very sad 

Also I’m trying to bid on several inexpensive items and my restrictions still haven’t been lifted as I explained to the eBay customer service on the phone I’ve been in and out of the hospital from a hip replacement surgery where I wasn’t allowed access to my iPhone or laptop as they said it could interfere with the medical equipment and when I was released the items were already won at auction but unable to pay and then I got the restrictions as you can see I’ve been a loyal customer buying hundreds of items and would appreciate the bidding restrictions lifted please … thank you kindly.. Dean",5
10,"eBay: eBay has been my go to site for years. I find the best price on what I’m looking for about 90% of the time. It may take longer to get the price if waiting for an auction to end but if It’s not something needed immediately it’s worth the wait. Make sure to read full description of the item so it’s in the condition you want. Do not rely solely on the fist page of a listing since some may have errors such as being listed as new but full description will say open box. New open box may be fine for personal use  but if you’re looking for gifts make sure it is new/never opened. If it’s not clearly stated don’t be afraid to ask the seller. Better to ask than go through the hassle of having to return the item. If a problem arises, with an item described wrong or receiving something not as pictured, eBay will work with you to get a full refund. People make mistakes, it will happen, be sure to follow guidelines for return. Do not just return an item without starting a return on eBay or getting confirmation from the seller and make sure to do it ASAP and include a packing list and return ID#. Once you get used to eBay and how it works you will find it’s a great shopping site.",5
11,"Don’t recommend them for selling anymore: I’ve been with eBay since 2008. Recently had an issue with a buyer that asked for a refund which I clearly stated it did not offer refunds all sales were final in the listing. Item was sent out packaged with double wall foam and bubble wrap as well as even more bubble wrap in the original box. He states I sent him a defective item yet stated he has the exact graphics card that is doing the exact same thing. Fact he has my card and his card doing the exact same thing equals either a driver issue or hardware incompatibility. I said look I’ll just refund you and send me the card back. But I was having so much anxiety from the whole situation and frustration I said keep the card keep the money and be done with it. After so many years with eBay I am finally going to put in a request to permanently close my account. eBay does nothing to protect its sellers and let’s you get ripped off. I’m out money and a graphics card. It is what it is though can’t let him get to me, just keep in mind buyers on eBay will do this to you, they will buy from you then don’t know what they are doing complain and get to keep your item and money. It’s just not worth it anymore to sell here. It’s been a good couple of years, that helped me offset paying for new computer builds selling my old hardware in original boxes and packaging. but if you plan to sell here keep in mind eBay will always screw the seller over.",1
12,"New image search “feature” ruins experience: Whoever designed the new “touch the screen to start an image search” “feature” has obviously never used the mobile app. This new “feature” ruins the browsing experience. I don’t even want to spend time on the app anymore...
You folks should use your own app more often; Most of us actual users do this: search for an item, then browse the long list of items that come up using our thumb by 1a) resting our thumb on the lower area of the screen until we’re done looking at the current set of items on the screen 2) then moving it up the screen to scroll and get the next set of items. Or 1b) even if we don’t rest our thumb for the entire time on the screen, there’s a delay from when we touch the screen to when we scroll (this delay is our brains processing information). 
Now if my thumb doesn’t IMMEDIATELY move upon touching the screen it causes the “image search” feature to pop up and it COMPLETELY ruins the experience and flow and enjoyment and everything that makes browsing eBay anything resembling good. 
I’m typically pretty accepting and understand that nothing is perfect and take the good and the bad with apps and other things. But this is just silly, anyone that uses the app can see how much this ruins the browsing experience. It really makes me not want to use it anymore...",3
13,"Copy cats: As an artist is very frustrating to see my ideas being reproduced over and over. Ebay does nothing about this. It would be nice if there was a setting where I can list my items so only certain buyers can see my items for sale. This would illuminate other artist from seeing my listings and duplicating the items that I’m painting on and profiting off of my creativity. This is very unfair and Ebay should step up and do something about this!!!
Seems like Ebay only cares about making money and if I stop listing on Ebay, you will see a severe drop in “Yorkie handpainted” listings because people can’t seem to come up with their own ideas! Do the research and see when I list something new and unique, the next week duplicate items pop up. Several other artist friends of mine have dropped off of eBay because of this complication. 
Again, the solution would be for me to be able to block other artists from seeing my listings. I could care less about Private listings, it needs to be where my listings are blocked from other artists that can see my listings in copy my ideas. 
Step up and do something about this or I will just need to say goodbye to Ebay.",5
14,"Good for buyers, bad for sellers: My site says NO RETURNS. But recently a buyer said that my item was not as described, eBay AUTOMATICALLY accepted the return, without letting me protect myself.  This was a jet black fur, which my 12 photos showed that the fur was indeed deep black, but the return was granted to the buyer who said the fur was brown. The eBay representative who looked at my 12 photos said that the photos showed that the fur was definitely Black. There was a rug on my floor in the photo which was brown, black, and beige, and you could clearly see that the black in the rug was the same as in the fur, and you could clearly see the brown color in the rug. There was photos too of this sweater on my off white sofa, and you could see that the fur was jet black. The Philippine representative told me that its an automatic return policy that eBay has if the buyer says not as described!  The Philippine rep also said it’s better for me that  I take back the item even if it’s buyers remorse, BUT THATS RIDICULOUS! 
Why should I pay the shipping both ways!  Why should I lose money! WHERE IS MY SELLER PROTECTION!!  
EBAYS NEW POLICY IS VERY BAD. EBAY BUYERS KNOW THIS AND ARE ABUSING THE SYSTEM. 
My seller asked me why I’m protesting her return.. as she put it “ no one else protested her return!”  She then continued to tell me that my sweater was the wrong color black!  At present my fur jacket is on the way back to me. 
WHY IS EBAYS ALLOWING BUYERS TO ABUSE THE SYSTEM!",3
15,"eBay screws over new sellers. Prioritize another platform!: Full of scammers and not made to support new sellers. I uploaded one product a day, for a month, only ever getting buy requests from scammers asking me to text them, which I would just ignore, only having replied to one or two to figure out if it was legit. When I finally made my first legitimate sale, eBay decided to suspend me indefinitely almost immediately because of “suspicious activity” on my account. I read all their rules of compliance and I don’t believe I did anything suspicious or harmful to the community to deserve a permanent ban. Customer service is near impossible to get a hold of. Had to resort to messaging them on Twitter and even then they wouldn’t tell me a reason as to why they banned me. It’s infuriating. They essentially have a platform full of scammers and choose to ban people who follow the rules and don’t list anything disingenuous. You can google search other people that have had the same thing happen to them. I’m not a unique case. Not only that but they waited until after I shipped my product before banning me and are withholding my funds for a month. It was sold Dec. 8th and they won’t pay out until Jan. 8th. Absolutely ridiculous. I’m not down a product, a platform and my profit because of their stupid decision. Small businesses beware and do not make eBay your primary selling platform. They’ll screw you over and will not care at all.",1
16,"Beware of scammers: Their are plenty of scammers on this app! I have been using eBay for a very long time now going on 4 years and throughout these years I’ve had items come damaged, bad seller communication, lost packages. Bu to after my last few encounters I’m going to stop using eBay. I won a bid and the items value is worth a a bit more but I got it at a great price. I was the only bidder and I kept asking the seller to ship my item first she says she’s out of town and will ship by the weekend. Never did only created a shipping label and when weeks had gone by I started to call multiple ups locations, all of them said the seller didn’t ship the item. So I opened a case and nothing ever came about it. The seller was not happy with how much she sold the item for and decided to play the blame game and blame it on ups. Then recently another seller I asked her multiple times did she have a item in stock and she says yes then when I bought the items she messages me a few days later to say she doesn’t have the item and sends out items I didn’t request anyways. Last but not least I bought shoes  in a ad and it showed a left and right shoe but was shocked when only a left shoe came in the mail and the seller wanted me to buy the right too! I think eBay needs way better management and to find better ways to resolve issues because I truly don’t understand how sellers get away with these things!",1
17,"App works great on iOS/iPadOS/macOS: **Update 28 September 2022**
It turns out the problem with the app was my setup. I have a 2nd external monitor on my m1 mac and that triggers macOS that I'm sharing since it's using the displayLink technology. For some reason it just dawned on me today and I unplugged that monitor and was able to login. It's by design of Apple. There was no way for eBay to handle this. So other than that the app is fantastic. I can quickly view my purchase history and search for products on all of my Apple devices.

Old review - Login doesn't work
The app logged me out after not using it for a few weeks and the login no longer works on an m1 mac. The screen turns white after a split second. I uninstalled the app and cleared all of the cache/settings that is left over and the same problem happens. seems to be only this view also. If I try to create a new account or try to login via another method those views do NOT turn all white. I don't understand how this got past SQA. app is now useless. It is a little clunky anyways on the m1 mac, but it's nice to have an app instead of going to a website. For now I'll stick with the website since I have no other choice.",5
18,"No Seller Protection & Unethical Policies: As a seller you are at high risk of getting scammed by buyers that want free items or forced unethical returns that come out of the sellers pocket for shipping. Buyers can lie on their return reason to force a favorable outcome for themselves within the automated return request system; they’ll expose themselves in their own messages and still get backed up by eBay. eBay will take dishonest buyers sides and refund them plus allow them to keep items. I had a manager admit to me that he could see a buyer had lied in a return case against me, but they sided with the buyer anyways because “it’s how the policy works.” eBay said my only protection was if I had a broken return item come in and wanted to fight for said rights in a complaint. Yeah, right. They also allow feedback extortion despite claiming otherwise. Then they won’t remove the feedback used as extortion on your account by buyers. And customer service will either flat out lie that they are taking care of an issue OR claim to have no power whatsoever to intervene in a dispute/speed up an appeal to an issue that needs immediate attention. They make you wait out their system which always finds a way to make the wrong decision and force you to swallow unfair rulings against your business. It’s unethical business practice. And you can’t find a U.S customer service rep to speak to for some help. It’s all out of the country “help” and out of touch.",1
19,"acc locked: my acc got locked and suspended for no reason whatsoever. I had literally just created it two days prior. I was trying to start selling things. And for my efforts i get acc ban without any explanation or recourse for me to undergo. Guess what im not making a new email adress just to get banned for no reason again. Ontop of this absurdity ebay and paypal have a monopoly where the seller is forced to use paypal or have to pay 30$ a month for a ""online marketplace"" acc or something. And when you are using paypal they take a tax from the money u make, ebay takes a tax and in the end you wait extra week to receive 50% of the earnings you made. Also Never sell more than 1 item at a time because ebay buyers are all scammers who request refunds on items you clearly have labeled ""NO REFUNDS""... Why does ebay allow a buyer to request refund and receive their money back even when a seller has set the option ""no refunds"". That defeats the purpose of having the option in the first place. So if you sell 2 things and 1 of them request refund when you already withdraw the money, ebay will take the money you made from the 2nd item and give them to the scammer buyer. Without question ebay returns the money to the buyer, therefore scamming the seller. I used to have a negative balance on paypal because ebay steals money from there for the buyers refund even if i have nothing on the account. Ebay is actually on the scammer side, and paypal is their method.",1
20,"REFRESH YOUR MEMORY: I just wanted to take minute and say, THANK YOU TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES AT EBAY!  If you look back on your first Ebay purchase, it was AWESOME, a new way to shop, but also sell.  Then another player got into the Online Seller, and yeah, I have purchased from that place, but like a good old friend, I find myself always opening my EBAY App, if for nothing more than to browse, however that usually ends in a purchase…….perhaps you shop in the BIGGEST BOX STORE CHAIN, and if you do, and are like me, buy things you don’t need because there is so much…..EBAY, SAME WAY!  I purchase so many things from EBay, things I wasn’t looking for, but things I always wanted, but could never find, AND, I DID NOT HAVE TO LEAVE MY HOME!!!  Unless you live under a rock, we are all aware of the ABSOLUTE LAWLESSNESS IN MANY CITIES, AND RAMPANT STEALING AND CREATING A VERY UNSAFE SITUATION FOR ONE TO BE IN, JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT INTO A STORE TO SHOP….I pray it ends and soon, but with EBAY, YOU NEVER HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN ONE OF THOSE DANGEROUS SITUATIONS!!!  So, if you are like me, if you have wandered, reintroduce yourself to OUR FIRST ONLINE SHOPPING FRIEND, AND SAY HELLO, AND TRY AND MAKE YOU PURCHASES FROM EBAY, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!

The sellers are hot held to a very high standard they both the buyers but more importantly by eBay! They have lived up and surpassed even the highest of expectations! you can actually trust you’re going to get the product, it will be as described and if you do you have a problem it will be immediately addressed by post to seller and eBay! 
eBay’s site as well as their app, offer a wide range of prices on items as well as the ability to make offers if the price is too high! The sellers respond quickly and if they don’t except your offer they make a counter offer. What could be more fair than that? In addition, the majority of sellers either offer free shipping or actual shipping costs! You do not find that on any other site! All of these discount sites that you see, try returning an item, or telling them you have a problem with an item. You get the runaround of your life because most of them are not in the United States.

“ Your account was suspended because it exhibits a risk to eBay and to its community.

From time to time, we find accounts that present a level of risk that is unacceptable and are, therefore, suspended.”
I literally posted 5 pokemon cards I was trying to sell from my childhood then five days later received a ban. The contact us didn’t have an email or phone number, it had a virtual agent which claimed the issue was likely a payment issue, but couldn’t put me in contact with a live agent. I finally gave up went on my computer to view the desktop version after 30 minutes finally found a phone number which I called and it said something like“this phone number is an error” before hanging up. I finally found a form for an email and filled it out, clicked the button to receive a copy of email (which I never did), but I finally got a response back with that message. 

Long story short, don’t waste your time with eBay. I’m lucky and my issue doesn’t involve me losing any money (just several hours of my time in an attempt to make a few extra bucks), but you could encounter an issue with actual money on the line and literally the worst customer service of all time.",1
23,"eBay used to be great: The app of fine. eBay has done a 180 since I started using them almost 20 years ago, but any chance I can to bash them I will. First, they are no longer a sellers marketplace, which is what made them great. I’ve had a buyer complain once and eBay took them at their word without even hearing my part or seeing my documentation to support my argument. This resulted in me not only losing my product but also me losing the sale purchase. Then I couldn’t even leave a negative review while this buyer lied completely (with evidence and didn’t send the merchandise back). So needless to say I’m still bitter and upset with their decision making and policies. Secondly their fees are ludicrous. How the heck are you do they get away with applying that same fee to the shipping? Not to mention it’s the over 13% fee they charge on both. I’d use them a lot more if it wasn’t so dang high. Third, why the heck am I being charged sales tax on a second hand item when I’m not even a business? Not to mention again, I was already taxed on it when I purchased it new. I know some of this is Uncle Sam, but I am not a business, I’m treating this like a garage sale for me. Lastly, ot takes forever to get paid, absolutely forever, and if you want ot faster, guess what, it’ll cost ya extra. All this being said, that’s why you don’t see quality used goods on here like you use too, and 90% of it is cheap Chinese crap.",1
24,"Stop with the updates! They're worse than ever: I have been selling on eBay for years. The last years using solely the Ebay app. I list approximately 200 items weekly. 
Firstly, stop with the updates. With every update the features seem to go downhill. It is becoming harder and harder to navigate. Placement of followed searches, watched items and even things you're selling are scattered all over the place. 
As far the as selling feature goes, the only improvement I could recommend is adding the second category option to an item being sold. That feature is only an option on a pc. 
It would be nice to be able to delete bought items. That used to be an option but not with the latest update. Ugh. I like a tidy bought and sold list. 
I love selling on eBay. The app is way simpler than the old style desktop way. eBay is the way I make ends meet and pay for my children's college. Don't think I don't appreciate the opportunity eBay gives me. Considering I pay over $18,000 in eBay fees a year perhaps you'll pay a little attention here.  PLEASE stop with these downhill updates. Are the tech people trying to find things to do? Why mess up something that was ok?",5
25,"Extremely disappointed: I have been a buyer for many years. I had never had a problem until today. I purchased an item from a seller in which description guaranteed it would fit my vehicle.  We take to the mechanic and he installs one, when installing 2nd part it does not fit. I contact seller and Ebay and Ebay tells me I can return one of the parts since I am backed up by Ebay guarantee. I return and seller contacts me very upset telling me that I lied about the parts. Which I never did. Then he gets the item I returned and threatened to report me and for me to send other item. I showed him the chat transcript where I ask agent if I can return one item because it did not fit and the other item was installed and we had already paid the mechanic, he replied “yes.” Seller still said I was lying. So he reported me and Ebay sided with seller and said I would never be protected by Ebay again. So if an item gets lost or a seller  does not want to give me a refund they can not do anything. I guess Ebay cares more about sellers commission than a customer. Oh and to top off, I told seller to give me partial refund and he tells me to give him 5 stars. Unbelievable!I have 2 ebay accounts in which I have requested deletion on one and when I get  refund I am requesting the other one. I am honestly upset that I will never purchase from Ebay again. Sad the way Ebay treated me. One loyal customer gone :(",1
26,"Automatically redirects from the web browser: The app itself is okay from what I got to try out. I made a purchase with it and everything worked great, and I like having the option to get notifications directly on my phone without having to keep checking the website all the time.

However, I ended up deleting the app soon afterwards because I also like to access the website from my phone's browser where I can use all the features of desktop mode. Well, I was browsing on the website and it was working fine, but then when I tried to open a certain page, I was automatically redirected to the app. I don't remember now what it was I clicked on, possibly to see a seller's other items, but in any case, it had nothing whatsoever to do with the app. I went back to the browser, tried again, and was redirected again. The website refused to let me open the page in the browser until I finally removed the app altogether.

I suppose it's possible there's an option somewhere to stop it redirecting, but I didn't feel like wasting my time searching. When I'm using the website, it's because I want to use the website. When I want to use the app, I will open it myself. There are pros and cons to both, and I'm not interested in having an app that decides for me when I want to switch.",3
27,"Despise new PayPal integration et al.: There were always problems with this app, such as the wholly illogical feature of presenting items often bought together. But the new PayPal integration is horrid. Two reasons: 1) The single sign-on doesn’t stick. I am having to login each time I purchase. Multiple times on the same transaction. 2) From the Buy Now screen, the method of payment selected via PayPal no longer shows the last four of the account number and account type so you cannot be certain you have selected the right one in the separate, (and previous), PayPal screen. On the previously purchased screen, there are also unnecessary blue bars taking up a ton of space asking if you want to buy another like the thing to already purchased. eBay does a notoriously bad job at finding like items, so this is terribly useless. As long as users set up the details of the items for sale, this feature will never work properly. It is an illusion. Also it is not the place to buy in bulk. So stupid. I spend between $100-$500/month on eBay - or did until this week’s update. And have for at least a decade. Yeah, no. This has lost me as a customer once and for all. Maybe try use case analysis, next time, dear software developers...",4
28,"APP Review not EBAY Review: I’ve been a seller on eBay for many years, a review on the platform itself is a whole different thing. This is a review of the app. I think it’s very easy to use and helpful for both buyers and sellers. I feel the app gets rid of a lot of the extra features that get in the way on the website. However, I don’t like that as a seller the only feature is to view, edit, and list your items. There are a lot of other facets to being a seller that could make up an “Ebay Seller App” such as paying my bill, viewing my daily sales or monthly numbers, starting a promotion, etc. All of this aside, there are two actual flaws with the current Ebay app. When I click on my profile to view any new or previous feedback, the screen never loads. Also, when scrolling through my items the app loads the items in bunches. This is fine but I am never able to scroll through all of my items because after loading a few bunches as I’m scrolling it freezes and can’t load anymore items. Then I have to leave the page and go back to try to get further down the list of the items - but it’s never possible. Fix these two things and you’ll have 5 stars from me!",4
29,"Beware sellers eBay allows fraudulent claims: I recently had a buyer make me an offer. I excepted the offer an hour late. The buyer sent me a message saying she needed to cancel the order because her address was wrong. I told her to contact Ebay Ebay, then within a four hour time. Open the claim against me the seller that the item had not been received, the item ship date was not for five days. When I called Ebay and spoke with the team member and then spoke with a supervisor. They informed me that if I did not do anything about this case, they would put a ding against my account and remove the funds from me to buyer. I explain to them that this was a fraudulent case and should not have been opened that. If they looked at my keys, they could see the buyer sent me an offer. I excepted the offer she wrote me told me the address was wrong and there’s no possible way that I could have delivered this item to her in a four hour time period. They told me it didn’t matter that they opened the case for the buyer and it was wrong that they open the case that I needed to refund her her money. If I send the item out I will not be protected by Ebay’s protection program. This is not the first time that a buyer opened a fake case and eBay allowed it. Sellers beware of eBay they’re not on your side.
Also I should let you know I have been a seller for 24 years and it might be time to hang up my hat.",1
30,"EBAY IS HORRIBLE DO NOT USE THIS APP!: PLEASE READ BEFORE USING eBay APP!!!Okay where should i start, well let’s see i have been a eBay customer for almost a decade now and i have had my ups and downs but unfortunately i have reached my limit. Recently i ordered parts that never arrived but was said to have been delivered to an address that doesn’t exist. Obviously before the parts went out i noticed the discrepancy and immediately notified eBay, who took days to respond. By the time eBay responded. The response i got back from eBay was to contact the seller, the seller had already shipped said parts 😞. I then got the ball rolling with trying to either get a replacement or refund. When i say i immediately got on the ball for a refund or replacement i mean immediately. The seller stonewalled be and i made a request for eBay to step in but of course that was a mistake. Again eBay took weeks to respond to my request only to tell me the matter had been closed and i would not be receiving anything (refund or replacement). At this point the sellers on eBay are under not type of liability for selling you wrong, damaged, or generally bad parts or items and eBay who is supposed to act as a broker furthers this behavior by enabling the sellers behavior. eBay does nothing to protect its buyers. I for one will not be ordering anything else from this point on from eBay. PLEASE READ BEFORE USING eBay APP!!!",1
31,"My review on Sellers: I have been an eBay member since 2001. That’s a total of 18 years. I think in the last three years the credibility of the eBay sellers has disintegrated. They lack credibility, integrity. My first 10 years maybe longer no matter what I purchased it was always exactly what they stated I warily ever had to return anything. I think maybe I returned two things in 10 to 15 years. Now it is just awful. The quality is bad it’s not as it described and what I find is that eBay doesn’t support the buyer when it comes to certain items. I don’t mind purchasing something if returns are not excepted, but when there is dishonesty and I purchased the item based on their truthfulness and I discovered that there is dishonesty involved regarding the product and I open a complaint and eBay supported the seller. The particular item I am talking about was a Kiehl moisturizer I purchased on eBay. I discovered  The item was expired. I did my homework before I opened up the complaint. I personally met with the Kiehl representative To educate myself on skin care and expiration dates before I even opened up a complaint. I doubt that you’re bored who makes these decisions Didn’t do the research I did. So my lack of trust with eBay supporting me as a buyer has disintegrated considerably just like the sellers you allow",3
32,"eBay allows deception: Many items have a description in their title and a DIFFERENT description in fine print on the description page that deceptive sellers use to deceive.  Also sometimes a photo falsely suggests strongly the size of an item (even though the actual dimensions are on the description page showing actual dimensions much smaller in metric but without a ruler or coin to suggest actual size for polite reference), KNOWING MOST WILL LOOK AT THE PHOTO AND BUY BECAUSE OF IT.  This on items they know are copies / counterfeits of the real product in standard size, like a hairbrush I bought which was actually so small I couldn’t hold it to brush with it without it flopping out of my hand over and over.  It’s as though they intentionally deceive because they know that NO ONE will return a $2-3 item.  Also my eBay app should hold my purchase history INDEFINITELY OR UNTIL >>>I<<< delete it, and not be deleted by the eBay system.  If I purchase lots of things it’s very easy to forget or lose track of an item ALREADY PAID FOR THAT I NEVER GOT.  ESPECIALLY if eBay deletes my purchase history.  It’s MY RECORD.  DON’T DELETE IT FOR ME!!!  Allow me that option.  😡 in light of what I’ve said, choose carefully and you may do well.  There are some very good deals on eBay if you have good judgement and the time for all the hassles too.  JD",3
33,Thieves: If I could give a negative hundred stars I would do so. Long story short I received a gift card for my birthday. I had it in my account that has been active for a few years now. The next morning I looked and my $100 was just gone. When I called eBay about it they basically said too bad so sad! Someone has used it and bought something and it went to an account that had just been opened and then immediately closes after the transaction. I’m sorry but if they can flag me for a blurry picture then why couldn’t they catch this when it was going on in my account and obviously wasn’t my normal activity pattern. NOW EVERYBODY PAY ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANT PART HERE. eBay is not holding themselves accountable for any money that can and will eventually be stolen from your account. They say they stand behind purchases but could care less if someone literally steals your money from your account. So take that in consideration when you deal with this company that obviously could care less about the customers or sellers on here because they probably as far as I’m concerned just as guilty and in on the whole scam! Thanks eBay for everything you’ve done which is nothing but steal my only birthday present I have gotten in the last three years!! Thieves you should be ashamed of yourself and in speaking to the owner here no wonder you have millions!,1
34,"SELLERS BEWARE!!!!: I’ve been selling for over 4 years on eBay and the scammers are getting worse and worse to deal with!! I’ve just had 6 scams in ONE WEEK!! The good old let me keep the item I just bought and get my money back scam!!! This is running rampant on eBay! I’m a seller for over 10 years on other sites poshmark, Mercari and started selling on eBay and I do not have this problem on the other sites it’s absolutely horrifying that ppl can buy something and keep it and still get their money back!!!??? eBay does not protect sellers AT ALL!!! Even if you have clear as day pictures of what your item looks like they can still say there is something wrong and request a refund. But the scam I’m being bombarded with is the 1/2 REFUND SCAM! It’s where the customer claims there is something wrong with the item and they do not want to return it they want to KEEP IT but they want ME the seller to PAY THEM 1/2 their money back and shipping costs they incurred!!!!!??????? HOW IS THIS LEAGAL EBAY!!!???? Oh and there is also the EMPTY BOX SCAM!! Let’s not forget that gem! I feel so defeated I’m about to close up shop. I have a ton of great followers and customers on Poshmark and Mercari but wanted to give EBay a try but it’s caused me so much stress it’s not even worth it! I wish eBay would protect sellers as much as they protect buyers. If you are a new seller on eBay just be aware of these scams.",1
35,"Sketchy sellers and scammers: I have Been shopping on eBay long time, this is actually my second account. I must have been inactive in the last one too long or something. But anyway I am getting scammed and,  it’s getting increasingly frightening and frustrating. There is a seller with 99 cent items starting out as a bid. If you win several items. He throws a few in a box and I’m Not getting the appropriate items. and I’m paying shipping for each individual item. One item I kept sending a message until I got the jacket. And another jacket was missing. I now have purchased enough to leave some serious negative feedback, which I never do. Now I have purchased another coat. There is no evidence of that sell/purchase through one bid I thought rare too. He did respond and said would mail it but I have no way of seeing my purchase anywhere. I can’t leave any feedback on this seller. I have sent him a message and waiting for a response. But I have feeling I need to open a case because I did screenshot the sale right away because it kept disappearing and reappearing, pretty shady business. I feel these sellers on these platforms are becoming more aggressive scammers. I’ve even had one stalking me and sending me terrible messages I didn’t respond to. I will open a case on this vest as I have the number for the sale. Thank you Deborah",1
36,"First steps: This recounts my first purchase on eBay, so the learning curve is near vertical. A bit confusing. Five days after purchase, I get an e-mail from the vendor asking what size. My question is: how did the purchase order get completed without that little detail? The advert I answered didn’t ask for a size so I assumed “one size fits all.” Just got an email that the merchandise shipped. Now I get to learn the tracking system. IMO the on line biz modelers need to lock a technical writer into a room with an IT coder and make the process more user friendly. Not my first unhappy experience. I placed a “notify me” order on a product that is out of stock and now I get spammed almost daily “are you still interested” and when I get to the order process, I am told it is still out of stock. Time is money, people. The online seller who comes closest to getting it right will get my patronage. If I get the product I ordered, I will be happy. Curious that E-bay is asking for this evaluation on the same day the product shipped and long before it could have arrived. Turn the screws on the tech writer, he should know better and turn up the heat on the coder because he should do better.",4
37,"EBay needs to update app: Most app features work well but they continue to fail to address the needs and suggestions if sellers. Too many circular help options. The mail reason for my low rating is eBay still has NOT fixed old purchases being “stuck” in the list of purchases. When trying to remove very old purchases (so to increase # of watched items) it says unavailable or just doesn’t let you delete them or the just reappear. Why doesn’t the developer FIX THIS???? There’s so many complaints about this going back several years!
Related: why is there such slow limit of the number of watched items one can have? That makes no sense. In fact, I can guarantee eBay is losing money by not fixing this problem. If I could watch more items, I know I would be able to watch them and buy more. But if my list is “full” I simply forget about the items that I might have bought. 
Seriously, you guys need to step up your app or sellers and buyers (like myself) are going to leave this app. I know I’ve about had it with eBay’s lack of interest in helping its sellers. You guys purposely don’t make it easy to get help or to get improvements made. Take heed of the feedback and make changes or you’ll become the next “tumblr” and die a slow death.",3
38,"I feel like I’ve been robbed by eBay: My middle school English teacher introduced me to Ebay in the early 2000s. I’ve sold on the app on and off and purchased many items over the years. It was my favorite place to shop and always felt safe with all transactions until now. I purchased a ski suit overseas for $150, sender sent it and apparently the mail man misread my address and sent it back to seller. I notified seller and asked to let me know when received so that we can try again. I contacted seller 3 weeks later and seller hadn’t received it and asked me if it had a tracking number. I replied by saying it the USPS no longer tracks packages once they’re sent back. Seller stop replying after that. I asked seller for a refund, never heard from said seller. I opened a case and eBay a few days later eBay’s closed the case saying exactly this words “We’re Sorry you had a problem with your purchase. However, this item isn’t covered by the eBay Monday Back Guarantee. After reviewing all the details of this case, we determined that you won’t receive a refund. I feel like I’ve been robbed by eBay, seller stopped replying to my messages and eBay still sided with seller. I’ve never experienced this before and lost $150. How is that even right? I won’t buy on this app anymore, eBay it’s becoming just like the other dishonest apps out there.",1
39,"AN ACTUAL,NOT FAKE REVIEW!!: So, let me start this off by saying i am not happy with eBay whatsoever. This website and app is the biggest scam to ever be made. Now let my make this clear, if you are BUYING from eBay. No problem, have fun scamming people and having eBay help you scam them because of their ""selling agreement"". BUT, if you are selling or trying to sell off of this website you are in for a ""fun"" ride. If your intent is to sell you will be shown just how easy it is for people to scam you. Here's what I mean buy this. I have sold over 20 things over eBay and 15 of those 20 things have all been the same. Even though I put in the settings that ""I DON'T DO REFUNDS"" the people buying from me where able to schedule a refund for my product claiming ""that I had missing pieces or parts"" even when I was selling something such as a cup... anyways because of this and how eBay is a buyer first type of company EBAY themselves were able to go into the PayPal and send the buyer BACK the money WHEN HE HADN'T EVEN SHIPPED MY PRODUCT BACK. So in this case he had MY product and had his $200 back... it has been over a month and I have lost over $2000 due to this ongoing scam to eBay and their ""buyers"". I also haven't received my product back ever. So, if you are going to use this app to buy. Have fun, if you are going to use this app to sell. Good luck because you are going to loose a lot of money.",1
40,"Useful but needs some improvements: It is very good for basic searches and checking of items for sale and ones buying or watching. Like the way it lets you enlarge the images of the items and the ease w which you can leave feedback.  However there are several features I would like to see incorporated in future editions.  

There is no way in this program to pay for multiple purchases from one seller. It only allows you to pay for items one at a time. Also, as a seller there is no way to invoice multiple sales.  

The search system could be improved. Presently you have to reset the search filters with each search. I would like it to remember the previous search I did.  I like to find out prices realized on items to help in pricing and I sell items mainly in one category. On the laptop version, when I am searching for a batch of items, I set the parameters once - for the category and for completed and it keeps those parameters during the entire setting. However the iPad version reverts back to the program filters after each individual search.",5
41,"Price range bait and switch: First of all it’s messed up that you can’t contact eBay customer support via email and are only provided a phone number. My complaint is about how sellers have side skirted the lowest price plus shipping filter. It used to be that you could press lowest price plus shipping, and the results would be the items with the lowest prices. Now when you click lowest price plus shipping, it shows you an item with a really low price, say $.74, but when you click the item and go to its page it has a price range of $.74 to say $15. You are usually provided a few options to enter for the product and when you put in the information relevant to the item you are searching for, 9 times out of 10 the price becomes $15 instead of $.74 with the $.74 item being a worthless accessory or something not even wanted. This is annoying to no end and completely makes useless the lowest price plus shipping filter. This along with having to scroll through miles of pages of the same stock photo from the same seller of a product where each page has a price difference of a penny or a different color option or something. Individual sellers flooding the search results with jillions of pages their own stuff so nobody else’s product gets seen through the crowded mess. If nobody at ebay is fixing this, that means you must be complicit. Boooo!",1

If you list with EBay, be prepared to defend your price every day!! They go as far as changing my acceptable bids daily without a word to me about it. Becoming a scam!! Here’s how to destroy a billion dollar business in one fell swoop. I have used EBay for close to 20 years, and have sold and bought almost equally. In my experience, I’ve never had a problem. Recently, I listed about 30 pieces of jewelry, and I have had nothing but trouble...not with the sales, but with EBay wanting to give my items away!! Every day I have to go to my listings, and see what EBay has done to my listings. They keep dropping the price of what offer I will accept. Every day. It’s almost like EBay is working for the buyers, and are working to get the best deal for them! I’m paying for the listings, so seems the price should my decision, not theirs!!

It won't let me pay for my items one at a time and then sometimes it's reverse.  I have enjoyed eBay for over 10 years now and had 100% and no item strikes.  But thanks to the issues and errors that pop up on the screens my experience has been horrible.  Also 5 years ago I had some items that I sold.  I got very sick and was in the hospital for almost three weeks. I did miss sending the items although I made communication with buyers the moment I was conscious and explained what had happened.  That was just a few items some of the people wanted the item still and some didn't but that was 5 years ago. Why am I being punished and not allowed to sell 5 years later?

44,"eBay: I will always Love eBay, even if I get mad at them, which is hardly ever. They used to stand up for us customers when we needed to be given a refund, now they don’t do it much any more. They make it really almost impossible to contact them if we need their help in any matter. Other then that EBay is the top most best place online to go shopping at. I love they have used items , most ever used item is like totally new. And they have everything new if that’s what you are looking for. All their prices are so good, not crazy expensive and not crazy cheap. Their prices are simply perfect. I am moving, the mail system at my new location is very safe . People can not steal the packages we get in the postal. So, with that change I will have not one complaint about EBay at all. In the past most every signal package I received in the mail people would steal it. So really it’s not the sellers or my fault or EBay’s my packages go missing.

They are so rude with customers I never knew that. eBay puts some number of rubbish, idiot, and dump animals other side of the phone. They even dont know how to talk to customers. Sometimes it acceptable if it happen with one person. I call a parson, just he “said how can i help you”. I dont know with whom im talking. I explained my issue, instead of answering me he just said, you can login ur app and you can see the update. So idiotic answer. I know I can see the update. But I wanted to know the exact status. Coz I paid for express delivery. If they are not able to ship on time i need return the money for express service. Which I paid. Then he cut the call. 

Again I called another person pickup the call. Again he said how can I help you. I said, it is eBay customer service? He said yes. I asked may I know your name? He Said John.  I explained my issue, he asked which card i used, i told i forgot which card i use. I need the order update. He could find it using order number, email address, user id, etc. but he didnt . his sounds literally yelling to me. Kind of annoyed on me. Then he also cut the call.

46,"KEEPS BANNING ME! SELLERS BEWARE!: So I am one of the most trusted sellers and am often more considerate and less greedy than other sellers. However, last year, I sold a gameboy game system. The buyer made a false claim, to get their money back, which put my paypal account in negative balance. Here is the problem, the buyer who purchased the item, used a fake pitch black image with a silver or greyish small square, which has been a common scam image that ebay and other sellers know about but yet they fail to even let the seller defend their case AT ALL and prove authenticity. They also fail to look at the exact images of what was sold, and review both sides of the story and just side with the buyer within seconds of the buyer submitting the fake image that does not show the actual item whatsoever. I have never had a problem selling things on ebay and always got good reviews. But the fact that Ebay banned me over one fake buyer, and false claim, is outrageous. Ebay will not even answer me whatsoever in regards to this matter, I am to the point that I am ready to file a lawsuit and take them to court. I have reported this to the better business bureau twice since then, and Ebay still has never responded. DO NOT USE EBAY!!!!!

They tried to convince me that it was delivered to the final destination this morning, but the app clear says it’s still at the eBay authentication site as of today August 3rd which is the day of final delivery. … This is extremely frustrating because I know that the seller activity is stellar and nearly all buyers gave their business very good ratings. However, this isn’t the fault of the seller moreover it’s the fault of eBay and their authenticity guarantee facilities. … eBay has been of no useful help and completely abrasive when I reached out to their customer service team through chat & phone call. eBay customer support dropped the call, argued that the parcel arrived to the final destination even though their website contradicts that, and refused any insight on the delay or what happened at the authentication facility. … One thing is for absolutely certain!

48,"The “Authentication system” is a joke!: The authentication system is super flawed. Was selling my LV purse that I bought with MY own hands from the LV store, and I received notification that authentication failed. All the notes I received from the authenticator was “Unable to confirm authenticity” with nothing else. Why unable to confirm? What’s wrong with it? No notes. Nothing. Now I got a “violation of Counterfeit item policy” when I know for a fact that my bag IS authentic. It’s not right nor fair that the authenticator was unable to authenticate (and I will add—""Unable to confirm authenticity"" means that they aren't saying it's fake but can't say with certainty that it's authentic) and I’m getting doxxed for “selling counterfeit item,” when that’s not even true. I swear on my mothers life my bag is REAL. Unless it was all a dream where I walked into the store and picked up the bag and purchased it! 
This could be avoided if the authenticator can actually DO THEIR JOB and authenticate the item, or communicate with us better why the items didn’t pass and not just leave a one line note. Don’t bother selling brand-name items on here. Even if you know 100% the item is real, because it’s 50/50 chance it’ll get returned back to you as they tell you “oops we don’t know how to tell if it’s real sorry. anyway we’re gonna say you violated our policy anyways”",1

Last week I sold an Ali yoga jacket that was in great shape. However, the buyer asked for a refund saying that the item condition wasn’t what was described. Fine, I give her a refund, following the eBay flows, where I click refund, and then thinking I would get my jacket back since it was nice, I then clicked send return label at the same time. 

I contacted the buyer saying I’m sorry things didn’t work out and to mail back my jacket whenever they get the chance. Apparently, eBay told her to throw out the jacket, even though I sent the return label at the exact same time as the refund. After being very angry with customer service, they just told me that I should have received the item back first before issuing the refund, and that it’s in the policy. I’m sorry I didn’t read 10 pages of policy to sell a $70 jacket. Very frustrating and I will never use eBay again and encourage this to everyone that may potentially be reading this. 

I will purposefully and loudly say: don’t use eBay. Facebook marketplace in the US and Vinted in Europe are so much better, and I’m sure these types of policies will be the ruin of eBay. Way to treat a 19-year customer.",1
50,"There ARE other options.: I’m not a big fan on leaving negative reviews but these are issues with the company as a whole rather than an individual. 1. The messaging system is broken. The interface is disorganized and old and there’s no good way to see your sent messages or recover older ones. 2. Non-transparent fees. Ever since ebay has switched away from PayPal charges seem random and the invoice is disorganized. 3. USPS. This isn’t a problem that eBay has much control over honestly, but there are several third party selling websites which make it far easier to deal with the USPS (for trading cards these include comc and Star stock) and for the last 2 months almost every standard eBay envelope I’ve sent has gone missing. 4. Customer Service. The first time I needed to use eBay customer service it wasn’t bad. I was able to reach an agent in 10 minutes who was able to help me through the problem I had at the time. This no longer seems to be the case, as it’s very difficult to actually talk with someone let alone them be able to give accurate help.

I’ve been screwed in several items, thousands of dollars. No help from eBay at all. Don’t be fooled by their falsely advertised protection plans because they don’t work at all and you won’t get a reply. One of my many issues was when I purchased an iPhone for near $400, it didn’t work at all, tried to get ahold of seller for weeks, eBay didn’t help, finally sent it back to get my money back and they didn’t not refund my money. I somehow over looked the customers return request day and sent it 1 or 2 days after they requested. So i revived zero money back and they kept my phone and eBay didn’t help at all. They just were rude, unprofessional and did not help at all. The new iPad Pro arrive and is broken, doesn’t event turn on. I can’t get any help or reply from eBay it the seller.",1
52,"ebay treats new customers like they are criminals: I started a new personal (not business) account. I sold and shipped an item that is en route. Then I attempted to purchase some tank tops. I have a PayPal account already and decided to link them. The item I sold was a women’s biker riding leather gear. Day 5, when I purchased some tank tops and the gear was in route to the buyer my account was suspended for fraud! I call and am asked where I obtained the things I was selling. My account was reinstated but now the item I sold and the funds still pending are no longer available. The tank tops I ordered have been canceled but the funds are gone from my PayPal account to that vendor with no receipt or proof of sale but an email saying it was cancelled, oh, and I am an accountant so I take screen shots. Why would I be accused of scam and fraud without a call or verification? I have excellent credit and never had a felony or anything!? I have decided I would rather pay more or do without than work with the gestapo. I will be donating the rest of my riding gear and decor I no longer want to goodwill. 2 stars for selling my leathers and making me jump through hoops as if I had to prove I’m legit, instead of verifying people like a normal business would! Unless you are a business ebay is not where you want to sell your personal items.",2
53,"Bad updates: I’ve been an eBay seller since 2011 over the years they have made lots of controversial changes to the platform and the community as whole believes most of them have been bad however, this latest changed to their selling has made the platform completely unfeasible. Before when you sold an item, you could snap a picture of a barcode or look up an item from other listings to find the information. And you could usually have an item listed in 30 seconds to five minutes. Now, you have to manually type in every detail and every aspect of every item you want to sell you taling an extra 10-30 minutes PER ITEM extra to find information on things that could’ve easily been found with the push of a button. This change is so fundamentally bad and so instrumental to selling that I’m going to have to move to an entirely different platform to continue selling. I am a resseller, I cannot resell items that change every time I list with this setup. I cannot operate my business if I need to take, extra time and resources just to look items up to make sure I am in the right categories and targeting the right group of people who want to buy the item all the people who are on the eBay selling team should be fired. This is absolutely ridiculous.",1
54,"Beware: Ever since they dropped PayPal, they have become a nightmare to deal with. They play with your money, jerk you around, tell lie After lie, keep telling you your funds will be sent in two days, the two days passes and the cycle starts over and over. Worst support staff I’ve ever dealt with that can only read prompts and scripted responses. Asking them any questions short circuits their brains into shut down mode. 
I was a loyal customer and seller for 16 years but as of now I have closed my account and will never use them again. What they’re doing is criminal, negligent, and borderline wire fraud. They need to be investigated, and mailed to the wall for what they’re with people’s money. It’s so sad to see what eBay’s become. It’s time to call it quits eBay. You’re done. You’ve reached that point of becoming a beached whale. You can’t function, and the end is fast approaching, all due to the greedy decision to cut PayPal out of a small percentage of transactional fees. Most cards and banks that has zero problems in any other selling platform, wrong work with eBay, and their grand solution is to demand that sellers go open multiple checking accounts instead of eBay fixing their faulty software. Good riddance, you’re now a bad memory that I’ll gladly share my experiences with whomever will listen, to warn away from you.",1
55,"Account Restricted and Suspension: I have recently created an eBay account because I wanted to sell a Godzilla Playset, simple as that.  Two days later, I have gotten my account suspended indefinitely for an unknown reason. I called to reinstate my account, first operator was trying to figure out what was going on and I told him who I was and what I was trying to do and then he saw that my account was restricted for some weird reason and decided to be rude about it and not let me know what was the exact reason. I literally just started my account and they told me that my account is concerning. That is all. And he told me to have a good day and wouldn’t even answer my question. I called back a minute later and a lady answered the phone and told me that my account is suspended indefinitely and I asked her why and she literally cannot answer my question to protect eBay about their “policies” and not find a way around their policies. I myself was not trying to find a way around any stupid policies. I just wanted to sell my Playset and buy a Spider-Man figure cause I’m a nerd like that and now I can’t do crap cause they can’t and won’t unsuspend my account for a stupid reason. eBay is trash and always will be trash, especially their customer service. How are you going to suspend me and not even tell me the exact reason why.",1
56,"Expand Number of Watched Items You Can Have!: 1. Great app for the most part but for the life of Brian PLEASE expand the number of watched items you can have!  On many, MANY occasions I’ve had to add items I want to watch to my cart because I’m out of space in my watched items list.  Then, I run into technical problems there too (see below).  Why on earth would you want to limit the number of items someone might wish to purchase!  Often, especially now with new features, sellers have the option of offering you a lower price.  But if it’s not in your watched item list or cart you won’t be notified.  You’re costing sales with this unwarranted limit that other apps like Poshmark don’t have!  Please CHANGE THIS.

2.  When editing (removing OR viewing) items in your cart (which I have to use for excess watched items), when you view or delete an item you are taken back to the top of the page.  Very annoying to have to scroll down to find your place each and every time.  You should be able to return to the same place in this list after deleting or moving an item.  Please CHANGE THIS.",4
57,"BEWARE BEFORE USING: These people will ruin your credit on their account and could care less about their customers. It is April and I’ve been trying to pay my $14 balance (which was incurred from family children posting and myself deleting them because they were not real) since December. I’ve heard every excuse in the book: wait for two weeks, it’s a technical issue that is being fixed so give it two weeks, we’ve escalated it, we’ve escalated it higher up the ladder, we will send you a special email to pay (never got sent), try this link to pay, and then finally (after spending hours with customer service) they tell me to call Global Collections. I’ve tried to add my card and bank account, my mothers card and bank account, my fathers card and bank account, and my brothers card and bank account. I’ve tried on Apple products, Samsung products, laptops, iPads, surfaces, and desktop computers. Customer service is the most useless thing I have ever dealt with. eBay cares less about their customers (been using them 20 years, 4 years on this account). If you want a headache for half a year ending in them telling you to call a collection agency after you’ve spent all this time trying to pay them, then I would definitely recommend eBay. What a nightmare.",1
58,"Problems: As a frequent eBay buyer, don’t like: 1) Seller out of the blue offers you a discount, but the buyer then doesn’t have options to reject or counter. Needs to be less seller-centric. 2) I would like to have buyer-personal settings that occur when I do a search, rather than eBay default setting. I seldom will use eBay’s ‘Best Match’ algorithm, it almost never meets my desires so I waste my time un-setting searches. Aggravating. 3) Sellers need an auto prompt when weeks pass and they have an untenable high price on things, which is never sell. 4) Sellers about 50-50 of the time don’t accurately describe used items. They need to have more caution via e-training. Maybe they’re trying to take advantage of novice buyers. 5) Very dissatisfied with seed packets coming out of China. Fraud might be going on. 6) Despite occurrences, when sellers send me the wrong item and they tell me to return it...have never seen it work correctly. Something is wrong with the process. 7) Foreign sellers tend to be sloppy in their products—if they say 30x40mm jewelry fittings, it may be 31x41mm and not fit 30x40mm added cabochons as would US fittings.",4
59,"App lacks features, ebay takes your $$: I’ve been using ebay since its early days for over 20 yrs.  You used to be able to make a profit when you sold your good, almost new or new items from your own closet or home.  Now ebay charges you so many fees, including shipping fees, that it’s impossible to get your money back on items you’ve bought but don’t need.  Ebay also almost always sides with the buyer on disputes, even when the buyer intentionally damages an item in order to return it. When i add it all up, I’m probably losing money, so I’m shutting it down as a seller and going to a competitor.  I still have lots of items I’m trying to get rid of in my home, but ebay is just too painful to deal with now.  As for the App, it’s not bad, but it does not include all the features you need as a seller or buyer.  You cannot do a dispute, manage your account very well, or find information.  That’s a problem with ebay in general.  They do not make it easy for you to get answers.  It’s intentional so you give up and don’t bother.  If you want to browse for items and purchase, it’s fine.  But the negatives for ebay far outweigh the positives. Plus the support is overseas and there is at times language barriers and they read off of scripts.  It’s time to go.",2
60,"The eBay app is . . .: Very dangerous! The app is so convenient and easy to use that I find myself for hours looking through things for sale and I love it. Anytime that I have ever had to speak with the eBay representative they have been extremely professional and 100% attentive and really wants to get involved with solving your problem, explaining the rules so that maybe you don’t experience that issue again, and they will also reach out to the seller if the seller is the one that’s wrong and explain to them why they are. I love the app and I love to work with the representatives. I do you not feel anxiety that I need to call the eBay customer service reps and I’m like “oh great it’s going to be a problem”, it is the exact opposite. Again like I said the reps are so professional and extremely helpful I love to get to work with them. I do not like having an issue with the seller but I absolutely love to work with eBay’s customer service reps. So if you have a little bit of time check out the eBay app and you just might find yourself doing the same as me, and staying on it all day long.",5
61,"STOP THESE SCAMMERS! Fix glitches!: OMG eBay please fix the glitch of items showing up as ‘unpaid!’ Every time a refund is issued! I have a ton of unpaid items showing on my account. I called CS and they were not able to help either.
also, PLEASE give us ‘BUYERS’ more options! There are so many scammers on eBay. Ow! For example, I made the mistake of making a purchase from a phantom seller who is taking money from people but not sending the goods! I can’t do ANYTHING until the expected shipping date expires & then you make us wait some more before we are refunded! Give us an option that reads ‘seller never shipped’ “item paid for no seller response ‘ Also, please give us more then one hour to cancel an order! Most of the time these sellers have their settings to automatically generate shipping status when in reality they haven’t shipped at all! 
There needs to be more protection for your consumers. Reporting an item doesn’t give us a lot of options & then you limit how much we can write making it almost impossible to fully explain! How do I report a scammer? I can’t! Get it?",5
62,"Ebay employees don’t use it?: Although some core features work well, The Ebay mobile phone app is clunky, has incomplete features, does not follow the same layout as a computer interface. Newly posted items for sale are buried by default, have to sort each time for Ended Latest.  Every time you create a listing your forced to close 2 pop ups regarding automatic price lowering. No option to block in future. Every item for Sale says “Buy it Now” also says “Live until sold or cancelled” which is redundant. Every item for Sale just has “Shipping” next to it, instead of any reference to “Free” “Flat” or “Calculated” so before adjusting any price you commonly have to go into each one, open shipping section, review, back, then adjust price. No way to select specific notifications, rather they all come or none. App is covered with google ad results. Even when your looking at your own Orders, eBay thinks a Seller may be interested to see some Google Ad Results. This type of garbage makes it clear that eBay is just trying to milk out as much money as possible on the short term despite the negative impact in the long term. Recommend you have eBay employees sell a few dozen items from mobile app and they will see what deal with. Thanks for reading! Hope to see some changes make this app smoother!",1
63,"do not sell here: Great for buyers maybe, but sellers beware. Very little selling protection and they always side with buyers even if they are fraudulent and scamming you. Horrible website and app with horrible people running it who just don’t give a darn about the sellers and their reputation and only if they get the money. I sell for a living and have never had a worse experience than eBay. I was drawn here for being able to sell higher priced items and the lower fee than others take but learned it’s not worth it. I sold a very high end coat for $600 days before Christmas that came with original tags and all proof of authenticity. Buyer decided to open a return case for it being unauthentic within 5 minutes of opening it. I purchase items from the stores myself and KNOW it is not fake. I do not accept returns either but eBay forced me to without even listening to me or letting me talk to somebody. Buyer purchased just to wear on vacation and return and I can’t do anything about it and lost my christmas money and item until she decides she is ready to ship it back. DO NOT SELL HERE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! Customer service is non existent unless you take the time to call and even then they don’t do anything. Depop, Poshmark, TheRealReal, or literally anything but eBay is the better option. They will at least try and help.",1
64,"New to this: As my title states Iam new to eBay. I give you a rating of 3 stars at this point considering you ask me at my present experience. So I can only hope there will be a follow up questionnaire after further dealings. I've purchased two products so far that have made it to or past the shipping stage. The first, greatly impressed me with accuracy of description and shipping speed. The second, was a pair of shorts. I bid and waited and won. I then receive a message about the product stating it is not as posted and isn't even the same color. I responded saying I was not interested in the color they wanted to give me, that I'm willing to work with them but that particular color I didnt want. I then receive a shipping notification that the shorts have been shipped. I then send multiple messages to seller saying I didn't want the color they offered me, that I wanted what was pictured. They have not responded. So I've yet to leave a review as I see I'm not even able to do until I've been a member for 5 days. So, I leave and stand by my rating of 3 stars since I've had a mixed experience. I hope to hear from you in hopes you can resolve my issue since your app doesn't allow new members to review.",3
65,"Money back guarantee is a joke!: Tried to buy an above ground swimming pool on eBay for $950. The seller never send the item, but he offered a tracking number shows the item is delivered. The details said the item was 5.4 lbs which is impossible for what I tried to buy. It’s obviously a scammer. I tried every step eBay want me to do (which was hard and took long time), and they denied my refund request because “the seller offered the tracking information and the item was shipped”. I tried to call the customer service but never found the number (the number shows on google was scammer again!). I tried to appeal the decision, however it’s very hard to find the right spot. I tried to call local UPS office to get evidence that the tracking number offered didn’t deliver to my house, it’s lucky my friend know some guy in UPS and they said they have a lot issues with eBay now. It’s not a random case, but eBay didn’t take any efforts to solve the problem. I did a lot online shopping, and I have solved a lot different problems. It’s very easy to find out it’s a scammer and eBay did nothing to protect your money. It took me long time to get my money back. Even a small website could do way better than eBay. Will never shop on eBay again!!!",1
66,"3/10: Unless you tend on only buying items on eBay, don’t bother selling. You can only list up to 5 items a month, or earn $465 a MONTH. Which is less than what rent costs in a one room apartment. So if you have something to sell on eBay and it’s worth more than $500, don’t bother. You’ll have to request for higher selling limits and that requires you to have an actual business outside of eBay. Address included. Which is stupid and pathetic. These limits are horrible and outrageous. I sold two things on that app before i got an email saying my account was suspended INDEFINITELY for no reason. 

A few years ago, I didn’t like eBay because I couldn’t sell much and the algorithm was messed up. But now, it’s even worse. You can get your account taken as a seller if one buyer reports you just because they don’t like you. And the selling limits are so pathetic and limited, you have no room to breathe. They advertise it as user friendly but then put so many obstacles for you to jump over in the process and expect you to do so. The selling limits need to change. And the limiting of posts? There’s no point to do that. Especially around Christmas when people are buying your items. If you’ve got more to sell, don’t bother with eBay.",2
67,"Seller fees haven’t gotten ridiculous: If you sell, be prepared for crazy fees. It’s getting difficult for a small seller to make any money. There’s a commission on the final value of your item 10% and up depending on category, there’s a commission on the any shipping the buyer pays (yes, they charge a fee on something that costs the seller) there’s a payment processing fee + a one time item fee of some sort. Then Uncle Sam wants his 20+ %. That means if you manage to sell an item and profit, you have to find something and raise the price about 40-50% (and still keep the price  way below retail or it won’t sell) just to break even and higher if you want to be profit.  

Sellers used to get your money as soon as a buyer paid when they used PayPal. Now you have to wait for a payment to process, then wait for it to transfer to your bank and all this costs more than before. Eventually, people are just going to give up trying to sell. They are going to price themselves right out of the market. Corporate greed.",5
68,"Sellers - Limited Accesibility on App: I love everything about selling through the eBay app, except a few major flaws that need to be addressed before I would give the app anything close to a 5 star rating. While I am able to create/revise listings with single variations through the app directly, there is no option to create/revise multiple variation listings through the app itself. I only sell through multiple variation listings, as creating listings for item variations individually would be way too time consuming and costly. But multi-variation listings is only accessible through a  computer’s web browser, (note: I have tried using my iPhones safari web browser to create/revise listings that feature multiple variations, but my efforts here have been unsuccessful due to issues loading the classic desktop webpage in my iOS mobile browser). Another major issue is communication with my buyers-when I reply to their questions from the eBay app on my phone, it doesn’t register my responses as ‘answers’ to the buyers questions, despite the fact that I have answered them. As a result, my eBay seller hub thinks that I have countless unanswered questions from buyers, yet I have answered every last one. If these two issues were addressed, I would most definitely change this review to 5 stars!",1
69,"Nah. Finally just got rid of it.: This app has really gone down hill. It's making me log in every single time I use it. It's driving me crazy because I used it a lot. I deleted it, restarted my phone, reinstalled it, and it's still making me log in every single time. Also, sorting results by price no longer shows *all* of the results like it used to, so I'm not seeing everything that's listed within my price range. It's getting harder and harder to find really specific things, when it used to be so easy. Sorry, eBay, but I'm not going outside my budget to buy things for more than they are worth so y'all can make more money. The cherry is how poorly they treat sellers these days. It's become insanely easy for buyers to scam people. They can say the item they bought is broken or not as described, and eBay will refund them with no proof required, and will just pull the money right out of your account, so you're out the item, the profit, and the shipping costs. Oh, one more thing, their shipping calculator is wildly off. I LOVED ebay for decades, but its glory days are over. It's nothing but a pain to use now. If I need to use eBay, I'll do it in my browser, and I won't be doing much of that either.",2
70,"Awful update: This update is horrific. The developers obviously do not try to sell things via the app to test it. You can’t see what the buyer paid for shipping. You have to click through a million extra settings that are unnecessary. It prompts every time you list an item to see if you want automatic lowered pricing and never stops. You can’t delete a shipping method and let the other replace it. You have to delete the second one and then replace the first one with the second method. It automatically adds the “or best offer” option unless you manually shut it off each time you list. It automatically adds sentences to the description which is potentially misleading if you offer more than one shipping method. The sold tab design is focused around “leaving feedback” for the buyer, which might be the reason they overlooked the glitch that shows “you pay” shipping instead of what the buyer actually paid. There are also huge white gap spaces that take up half of the design. My favorite part: When you got to upload photos, it takes you to the oldest photos at the top of your camera roll FRIST! You have scroll through every photo to get to the one you just took of your item!! Makes sense!! The older version wasn’t perfect, but it was much more speedy and practical.",1
71,"Horrible: This app has been ruined . They shifted focus from being user-friendly to having massive ads right on the home screen. Its way harder to access information and list items for sale than previous versions. On the old version I could see up to 7 listings on my screen at a time. Now I can see maybe 3 listings per page at most due to the oversized pictures I am forced to look at. And the prices were listed to the far right of the listing to make finding the price simple. Now the item's price is in the middle of the listing's description in a font smaller than the number of ""stars"" the item received. The old version was superior in every way but eBay ""retired"" my app for no apparent reason. I guess the version I was using didn't have enough ads. There is no way to customize what shows up on your home screen, I sell way more than I buy so it would be nice to be able to see sold items on the home screen rather than watched items. The worst part by far though is that while you are creating a listing, the bottom navigation bar disappears making it extremely difficult to compare your listing's price with other ebay listings before finalizing it. This unnecessary inconvenience will absolutely hinder the amount of items I decide to list on Ebay.",1

73,Worst customer service to date: I had a seller charge me 40$ in shipping when it only costed him 10$ to ship all the items in one package (before purchase I did try to do a combined invoice but the buyer simply would not combine them even though he packaged all my items in one box) since it was labeled as a TCG item eBay only gives you three days to file a report. I filed a report on the third day and they said to send a message (a formal message they wrote up for me) to the seller and to give him three more business days to respond. After those three days go by I contact customer service again and they said “too bad it’s passed the 3 days you have to file a report!” I told them I have the chat log from the first customer service agent of me filing the report on the third day and they basically said that the first agent never properly opened a report. So eventually they said they’d put in a request and to wait 2 weeks. I waited two weeks and nothing happened so I contacted support AGAIN and they basically said “nope we aren’t helping you at all!” Honestly worst customer service I have ever experienced ever since then I can’t bring myself to purchase anything cause I could just be screwed over again thanks eBay you’ve been no help.,1
74,"Terrible Terrible!!!!: I have been a seller for over 10 years, sold many items throughout the years. First, EBay has never stood up for the seller! Anytime I’ve had an issue, or had a case, EBay has always sided with the buyer! Who do you think makes you money???? The seller is the reason you make money! This is why everyone is going to Facebook to sale their item lol. Second, I had to create a new account because of some lost information and EBay is unable to see that I have sold in the last without issues, but EBay still hold the money I’ve earned by selling an item. Ridiculous!!!! I am waiting for my funds to be released and once this happens, I plan on listing anything I have for sale on FB!!!! The only time I plan on using EBay is for Purchases!!! When you go out of business because no one wants to list anything on your website, I will purchase my items with a much smarter business. You are fortunate you were one of the first online stores, because this is the only reason EBay was successful in the beginning! Now there are more options and unfortunately many of your employees will be out of a job because of terrible decisions by upper management! You bit the hand that feeds you and soon if not already, you will see how it affects your bottom line!",1
75,"Changed My Life: I started selling on eBay in March this year when the pandemic hit. I was out of work and confined to home. I have been a collector all my life and I decided to begin photographing some of my collection and posting it on eBay. I found that people were excited to buy my items and I learned to write better listings and take better pictures of my items. I set goals of how many items I could list per day and what my monthly goals would be. I was excited by the process of selling, packing and shipping my items. I have learned so much about seller buyer relationships. I take pride in receiving positive feedback from my buyers. I look forward every time my phone dings when I’ve made a sale. The folks at the post office have become my friends during the past year as well as some of my customers. In spite of the pandemic and the loss of employment I have been able to earn an income as well as communicate with people all over the world. EBay has made a big difference in my life this year.",5
76,"So so sad: I sure wish EBay had some better case judges ! They have allowed a con artist to   Rob me of hundreds of dollars! It was avoidable but who ever was reading the case messages were very foolish and perhaps they didn't read them at all ! This one buyer opened 3 cases , two were won by the buyer and one case was never settled and is still open after 6 months ! The seller sent a box of garbage instead of the item that was to be returned, eBay wanted me to get a police report and start a big legal battle, but after evaluating all the advice and wisdom they had been feeding be I decided not to presume the legal case because I felt ebay was full of bad advice and they were just saying what ever the had to to satisfy me enough to get me off the phone! I’m just going to sell what I’ve got to sell and close my account! Shame on eBay !!!! It’s a good thing until you have a problem and need assistance or  help and I have a excellent record and feed back but that’s didn't seem to help , who ever read the complaint and response did not have the experience needed to judge the case , and I would have liked to discuss it verbally, it is such a large loss that it still hurts me to think of it !

77,"Great platform until it comes to counterfeit: Don’t get me wrong I love eBay. I like saving money, talking to people and getting a good bargain. Even better I like to sell on eBay and make money. But one thing that doesn’t sit right with me is shoes on here. I’m not anyway new to the sneaker game but when it comes to fakes I didn’t know how well they’ve become. I bought a pair of Yeezy 500s in December right when they were trying to roll out their authentic check. But I was under the impression that eBay would cover you if they ended up being not real. Which I was wrong took me a while to check them myself and I filed a return with PayPal which they gave me a short window to send them a tracking number. I contacted eBay several times trying to at least ask what I could do and the answer is pretty much nothing. I overpaid probably $130 for a low quality shoe and the seller receives no punishment. I can’t leave a review to warn other buyers and this guy makes a ton of profit for selling fakes. All and all eBays a good marketplace for used goods and honest sellers. But don’t get burnt like I did.",4
78,"Bad update: - now I cannot see when my fixed listings expire 
- the above was done on purpose in tandem with the hidden and automatic “good till cancelled” item re-listing, meaning that when re-listing from app previously expired fixed item with 30-day duration, the app will re-list same item/auction at a “good till cancelled” duration instead without giving the option to opt for 30-days and changing it without asking from the previous 30-day duration to “good till cancelled.” Then the app lists your fixed items without showing you when they expire; it’s a downgrade for the sellers, not an update; eBay sellers get another hidden boot
- what’s with the unanswered message alerts throughout? So if scammers send you all sorts of crappy messages (that eBay advises to ignore), the ignored and unanswered messages will always be annoyingly displayed and reminded?

79,"Sellers Beware: I was going to use Ebay to sell some stuff I have lying around, but after recent experiences by a family member I’m gonna look for an alternative. Ebay, while great for buyers, is absolutely terrible for sellers. Beyond terrible, I’d say, as Ebay essentially treats sellers like employees. Doesn’t matter what your policies are, Ebay’s policies override everything. And Ebay’s policies heavily favor the buyer to an absurd level. For instance, if a buyer wants to return an item, it doesn’t matter what condition the item arrived in or what the seller’s policies are, Ebay will start the return process. Ebay won’t even give the seller an option to challenge the return request, there’s not even an option to deny, the seller’s only options are: Full Refund, or, Partial Refund. Even if you, as the seller, only issue a partial refund, if the buyer complains enough, Ebay will issue a full refund without even so much as consulting with the seller. So unless you’re a business looking for a way to sell your wares without having to create a dedicated storefront, probably look elsewhere. Ebay’s terrible policies would even be rough on some businesses, I’d say. Avoid using Ebay, use something else instead. 

Except Facebook marketplace, screw Zucc don’t give him a dime.",1
80,"Sellers treated terrible: I’ve been a member for 16 years and sold on and off, I understand their policy on holding funds but it’s absolutely ridiculous.  People sell precious items that mean a lot to them because they are in a hard spot only to have the money held for days or weeks when your ratings are above average, 100 plus feedback all positive with zero negative reviews, customer service is terrible you can only call, no chat, no email which is very inconvenient especially when the reps are hard to understand due to being foreign which I have no problem with but facts are facts.  They expect you to ship with your own money not the funds from the sale.  And if the post office loses your package, even if it’s made it to the destination post office don’t expect the buyer to get up and go to the post office, they just file a claim and you refund.  I appreciate the commitment to the buyer but I suggest a different marketplace if you want to sell and actually get your money when you should.",5
81,"Love eBay but something is going on with watched items…: I love this app and love eBay. But I have noticed lately that it will put items in my watch list or if I watch an item and take it off it will appear and disappear off and on. For example I looked up Lancer skin care. A little while later a seller offered  a discount on a Mitsubishi Lancer bumper which popped up on my iPad.  This item appeared on my watch list. Why??? I have no use for this and was not watching this item and didn’t click on this item. I feel bad for the seller that is wanting to sell this item so bad that with in 30 min of me typing in Lancer skin care I was offered a discount on a car bumper. Something is not right and not sure how this even happened. This has happened with other items. Items that I deleted weeks ago suddenly appearing again. Or getting offers on items I don’t want. And also when I  place a bid for an item it doesn’t let me know that the sale ended, or that I won etc… Please fix this!!",5
82,"eBay is crap: I ordered two items. One got delivered, and the other did not. The tracking number states it was delivered to my parcel locker when it was not there. I contacted eBay, and they said they would not refund me because the tracking number showed “proof” that it was delivered. The things I ordered were two screen protectors for my vehicle and needed one on each side and were sold as separate items. I received one of them, and it was delivered to the apartment mail staff as it is too big to fit in my locker, while the one that I never got stated it was delivered to my locker, yet there was no key, and the staff themselves said they didn’t have anything. The seller was no help, so I contacted eBay, and they said, “The seller provided proof that the tracking number stated it was delivered to your address, so you will not be issued a refund.” How is that proof it was delivered?? The item was $25, and eBay is not willing to give that back to the customer. I lost complete respect for eBay. 
The two tracking numbers also have different delivery notifications; the one I received states “delivered by the post office,” while the one I did not receive states “delivered to parcel locker.”

I will never use eBay again. Please be aware when purchasing from them.",1
83,"The Really Great Shopping Mall‼️: You can get lost but even if you do you will find something else that you never would have thought of before!! I especially like that most sellers are from the USA!! Therefore shipping will not be 5 times the price of the item you want to buy. And also the time frame for shipping is quick! Even if I’m just looking I still have a good time & I can get redirected to something I might end up buying or learning something completely new to me. I want to put in a kind remark about the sellers as they are the heart & soul of EBay! I have met the most lovely & kind people from my shopping experiences. They send thank you notes, some have sent me a surprise gift with my orders & that just kills me!! I have been able to maintain friendships with 3 different people which simply amazes me & also makes me very happy!! If you haven’t had a really good look at EBay you should take a half hour & see what you can find!!
I highly recommend this app!!
Thank you to everyone at EBay ♥️",5
84,"Improvements and issues: Some things that could be improved is not locking so many features for new sellers I took a long period away from selling and after I came back the feature to require immediate payment wasn’t available to me, which causes issues when people buy your items but never pay and then you have to wait 4 days to relist when it all could’ve been avoided by having that feature freely available and not having it is punishing new sellers by increasing the chance they have a bad buyer experience. That’s just one thing that could be improved I have more but it’s not worth the time to write a novel

Secondly a feature the app could use is a way of reprinting labels after you leave the print label screen you can do this on eBay if your on PC, but as of now on the app you can only print the label once after your item sells and if you exit the screen and go back to your eBay there’s no option to reprint label when you go to your item.",5
85,"Permanently Banned For trying to buy a video card: In the current market the only place to buy a video card reliably is on eBay. I created a new account to buy a video card for my new build. I found a card I wanted and at a price I could swallow with out too much heart burn. I placed a bid in the card and the seller blocked my account because it was a brand new account and he feared bots or trolls understandably. I reach out to the seller and assured him I’m just wanting to compete my computer build the only way I know how, buying a video card on eBay. I reversed the block and said he understood. In between him unblocking me I found another card around the same price and ending ~12 hours earlier. I placed a bid and was quickly out bid by a large margin. I went back to the original card and placed a bid. Very shortly after that I get an email from eBay stating my account has been permanently suspended because is suspicious activity. A quick chat relayed nothing more than yup you have a lifetime ban. No reason behind it other than I had suspicious activity. I guess creating an account and trying to buy / win an auction for a video card on the only market place that keeps them in stock is suspicious. Poor business practices if you ask me.",1
86,"The first and last experience with this company: On July 16th, I made a hefty purchase on eBay, splurging on three items worth around $1,000. The first package arrived at lightning speed within just three days - no complaints there! However, things took a turn when it came to the second, most expensive parcel. The seller went radio silent for a whole week before casually mentioning that they refunded the money. The kicker? It's been five days since eBay deducted the cash, and there's still no sign of my hard-earned dollars coming back. They keep pointing to their rules, which feels like a never-ending runaround. The customer service reps were not much help either; it seemed like they were just reading from scripts. Each time I tried to explain my situation, the chat session would abruptly end, and a new rep would pop up, leaving me feeling like I was stuck in a customer service maze. This has been a total letdown and left me with no choice but to give them a measly 1-star rating. Suffice it to say, this will be my first and last encounter with this company.",4
87,"Great Shopping Made Easy!: I LOVE eBay! I've been a member as a buyer for almost 20 years, and I've had many, many pleasant experiences! 
I don't live anywhere near major shopping centers, and I have medical issues that prevent me from getting out sometimes, so eBay is a great asset to my life! I can browse at my own pace and convenience, and I can find everything that I want and need for my entire family and pets in one place! The items offered are of great quality and super prices, depending on what you want and need. I've bought everything ranging from clothing, jewelry, home decor, pet items to even vehicle parts! I do a lot of shopping for my 3 year old grandson and I'm able to purchase an entire wardrobe for him with just a few clicks! He lives 150 miles away, so I have the packages sent straight to him, and he's so excited to receive his ""surprises"" in the mail. He loves watching for the mailman whenever he's expecting packages from eBay!

Thank you to eBay and members for helping make my shopping experience virtually stress free!!

88,"Horrible Selling app. You’re way better off using Facebook or something else: There’s many reasons why eBay is a horrible app to sell on. We can start off with their ridiculous fees that take a good chunk off the top of whatever you sell. Or perhaps we can go with the fact that sellers have very little protection on this app. For instance, I sold sealed packs of sports cards and the buyer claimed they were ‘resealed’. Not a problem just ship them back and I’ll issue a refund... No big deal right?? Wrong. What I received in return were the cards from these packs that the customer had opened and what I assumed he cherry-picked through and took whatever he wanted. Once I contacted eBay support about the issue they were very unhelpful and didn’t even understand what I was saying as they are obviously foreigners, from some call center, that don’t know English very well. So now I’m out of 400 dollars as I was forced to issue a refund though PayPal, with no recourse to solve the issue. On top of all these problems.. eBay had the nerve to invoice me a bill for 76 dollars that I obviously did not wish to pay.. however it isn’t up to me as they just took it out of my bank account against my wish. Do not use this app... please just save yourself the trouble and sell elsewhere!",1
89,"mobile app keeps getting worse: Peak performance was >10 years ago. Updates since then have made platform worse. NON-mobile site has better functionality, although also worse than past versions. Frequent ads for similar items easily cause bidding mix-ups. Font size is microscopic & can’t be changed in settings (mobile). Can’t leave private notes on favorite seller list. Can’t block known problem sellers/buyers. Can’t leave feedback after certain problems with Sellers are resolved. Therefore, seller ratings are deceptively more positive than deserved. Can’t block problem sellers from your results. Very limited “completed items” timeframe. Paypal links are persistently glitchy. Too many notifications that can’t be turned off. Seller & location is towards bottom of listing. Unhelpful “Help” tab- very limited resources to resolve problems with site functionality. Serial searches always default back to unfiltered. “Privacy” disclosure says they share with other sites & apps: your ID, location, search, & purchase history. Nothing about opting out. Bottom line: I suspect the people who make changes to the site do not actually use the site themselves, or it wouldn’t keep getting worse.",1
90,"Going Down Hill Fast: They have sellers selling crap. They are showing photos of items that don’t match what you receive. 

When you put in a search for a pacific item item sometimes what show you things that don’t match what your looking for. Or what they show you photos of what you’re looking for so you purchase the item and when you receive it it’s not what you wanted. So you contact the seller and they will tell you that that’s what you ordered. They will tell you that you should have read the full description and you would’ve seen what it really was what you purchased. 

I think that when you put in a search or a item that’s all they should show you. The other thing they do is show you a price that looks great so you click on it you find that the cheap price they show you isn’t for the item you want. That cheap price is for some stupid thing you really don’t want or need. The price for the item you want is 20 to 50% higher.",5
91,"Customer Service doesn’t provide service: I recently sold an electronic item that was fully functioning and not damaged and the buyer claimed that the battery died quickly. They wanted a partial refund for a $40 item that was used and 15 years old. When I declined the refund the app didn’t give any other option than to give them a return label at cost to me. I selected this to see what further options it would give, and that was it. I  called customer service to get it reversed and they said “not a problem, don’t do anything else and wait until a week from now and call us back and we will close it.” Before that day came eBay sent the label to the buyer anyway. I called customer service again. They said “No label was sent and that it was a computer generated message and not to worry.” Today I got an email saying that the buyer has shipped the item back. I called customer service AGAIN. They said I now have to prove that the item is good or not in the same condition it was in when I sold it. If you list something make sure you list it like a lawyer so no one can claim that it doesn’t “match the description.”  Other wise they will, with the help of customer service, screw your over!",1
92,"Good place to sell....but: I’ve been buying and selling on eBay for fifteen years or more. Great selection of items and good prices. Selling is most of the time great. 
My pet peeve is once in a while I may list something that I see dozens of listed. All of a sudden (5 minutes) my item gets pulled and I get put on notice for violation of listing policy. Ok I go and check and it is in violation.....
So I call and ask why are the sixty or so items just like mine that have been listed for weeks that o know of and are still listed? The Customer Support people are nice but, can’t answer that question.... all they can tell me is that mine is in violation. And the department that makes the decision on what’s good or not does not take calls. They say I can report any items I find and they will be looked at on a case by case basis. So I watch several so I can track them and spend almost an hour to report them...... guess what....they are still there days later. Just seems unfair. 
All in all I like EBAY and will continue to buy and sell here.",5
93,"Great app, been using eBay for years but…: I’ve been a member since I think 2006 more or less since the time PayPal had only been attached to this app only, and I’d say eBay has evolved tremendously but with that said it also had lost some useful features over time. I don’t use this app for selling much because of the shipping and maintenance fees but I do make frequent buys. 

I used to love the groups category they used to have, don’t remember how it was called but you could create numerous folders and save favorite items up for sale. And because I’m OCD freak I liked my stuff very well organized for crafting items, art, clothing, certain brands, toys, gifts…etc. They long has removed that folder feature but I think they’ve added the amount of items you can “watch” cuz my pages just keep expanding past 12… 

But I hate the new messenger update. Now you have to constantly get out of a message back/forth in order to read a new one while before you could just use up/down arrows which are gone this time round. I kept avoiding that change not agreeing to “try” new version after testing it out, but eventually they simply transferred me without my knowledge of that permanent change. 

Anyway I do like eBay but for buying only. I just wish more sellers would be forced to diligently describe most accurate precise and to the point item description with measurements color and details, rather then just name of the item which is also repeated in the title.",5
94,"ebay is a scam.: I had an extremely negative experience with eBay. Despite providing documentation, they did not support me as a seller. Instead of going after the scammers, they attacked me. Once my account was banned, there was no recourse. This has been the worst experience I've ever had. eBay seems to prioritize scammers over their sellers. Not only do they take a large portion of your earnings, but they also make it incredibly difficult to fight for your account's reinstatement. I strongly advise against using eBay. Their system is terrible, and their team is unhelpful. It feels like they care more about protecting scammers than their own users. I recommend taking your business and money elsewhere. eBay should be banned! The way they treat people is unacceptable. It takes over 60 days to receive your funds after your account is banned. Never trust this corporation. They do not have your best interests at heart. I am deeply disappointed in the way I was treated and led on, only to be unable to sell in the end. As a legitimate business owner, it's clear that eBay is not doing their job properly. It's frustrating that there is no way to contact a supervisor. This company deserves zero stars. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with.",1
95,"Love My Ebay: I know it sounds a little dramatic but the truth is Ebay has changed my life! I always believed I was capable of running my business on my own schedule but never had the confidence. The customers are really Ebay’s and I’ve sold on just about every sight- ebay is the BEST! That made it so easy. You list and ship! There are REAL actual people there to help you! Haven’t found that on any other sight! If the thorough help centers can’t answer an issue specifically, I never hung up with a CSR without the issues solved! I’m now ready to do this full time. I’ve had scammers they’ve shut right down. They taught me how to spot them. I’ve met the NICEST people in my customers. It’s built my confidence and changed how I handle finances. I take a lot of pride and integrity in my listings brand new or pre owned. Ebay has been there for and with me every step. I’m now a seasoned buyer for my items and if I need anything, I wouldn’t buy it anywhere but Ebay! Can’t wait for new mannequin! Thanks Ebay!

96,"Bad for sellers, bad for buyers, just bots: Ebay as a platform is a great concept, however ebay as a company has gone so far down below the standard. I’ll start off by saying, i have never listed anything on ebay, ever, period. but my account has been restricted due to a seller issue, on my end. so somehow, according to the automated software, someone who’s never sold anything, is red flagged, why? i’m not sure, it is because i only purchased things? i know there’s tons of people just like me who don’t sell, only purchase, and they’re still in the green. Anyways, fact of the matter is, the automated software is absolutely unbearable, you truly may not ever actually speak to a human being, the chat responses are all automated and never actually pertain the the issue at hand, aka a bot senses certain words and chooses a response based on that, where as an actually human has comprehension and can process a problem. attempting to call them also ends up in 90% automation, if you get to a real person, you are part of the lucky few. i’m not sad to part ways with ebay, as i know they take quite a chunk from sellers to line the boards pockets, i am sad i can’t support people who actually rely on this platform for a living.",1
97,"From a seller: I think it’s time to make a separate app for sellers. There are so many issues and updates are causing more. I can’t print shipping labels from the app if customer buys multiple items, purchases through the global shipping program, plus many more instances when the app fails to allow me to print shipping labels. When I go to view my available items scrolling is horrible. There’s just too much going on, it takes 5 mins to scroll to the bottom of 250 listings, freezes/lags the whole way there, plus it’s just horrible the way it’s listed. I love eBay, but your app is below par for sellers. Also I can’t control anything that has to do with promoted listings via the app. This is just one more example that proves how weak and limited your app is for sellers. Thank you if you took time to read this. eBay is a great company and I must say they are #1 in every single way when it comes to customer service. I never have problems with foreign accents, they are always kind, and every-time I have had an issue they had a solution, in a very pleasing way plus timely manner. Thanks for your time.

98,"Unnecessarily complicated browsing: I’m fortunate to have two working hands, but unfortunately my issues with my spine makes two handed browsing extremely uncomfortable, specifically when selecting and zooming in on photos. The app worked great a few years ago but now, for some bizarre reason, eBay developers have decided to add steps getting into and out of an item’s photos. It actually started working properly as it used to the other day but now when I was browsing I noticed the developers made yet another annoying change, so instead of just going about my business and bidding on items I find myself here complaining instead of running up bids for sellers and winning auctions. Here’s a tip, guys, when you’re viewing an item you can swipe left and right, so when you’re several photos in and you select that photo that’s the photo you should be able to double tap to zoom in on WITH ONE HAND, got it? What’s the use of sending a user to ANOTHER selection of various images when the selected photo should come up instead? Okay, rant over, and I’m gonna post this review and close out the app before I get even more excited.",2

101,"Don’t sell sneakers here: Sold an authentic pair of sneakers here with all defects listed and I was completely straight forward with the buyer. I listed them without a box since I had lost it in a move years ago, but I still had a receipt from Nike in my email for a little extra proof. Nonetheless, they failed the authenticity check simply because they were too worn, and didn’t have the box. All of which was mentioned in the description and the buyer completely agreed and knew what he was getting. Not only did they fail, but eBay proceeds to go ahead and take all their fees from me. So not only did they ruin a sale, but kept for $40 for themselves, for doing absolutely nothing. I’ll never sell anything on eBay again. Regardless if they’re sneakers or not, new or used. No chance I’ll list anything else. I’ve been looking at eBay reviews of the authenticators today, and it’s filled with stories of people buying brand new shoes from retail stores, selling, and the authenticators just can’t figure out how to do their job. I’m sure they catch a lot of fakes, but just by sending the bulk of pairs back and marking it as counterfeit is not how you authenticate. I’d give the app 0 stars if I could. Poor policy.",1
102,"Careful of eBay New sellers.: To all new sellers. If anything ever happens, scams, fake information and pretty much anyone and anything else that can and will take advantage of you on eBay I’m sorry this is to tell you that eBay won’t do anything to help you. eBay preaches about protecting users sellers/buyers I’m here to tell you that is not the case. eBay like other corporate companies are just in it for themselves and will just keep sending you in a circle making you talk to someone new every time so no one will be able to help or solve your problem. 1st phone call. 1st time selling. When I was scammed, eBay sounded sympathetic and lead me to believe that ebay was going to help me solve my problem so I just didn’t get taken advantage of and lose everything but that was not the case. Ebay did the same thing that most corporate companies do and blame the victim and everyone else but eBay even though their platform and eBay site along with protection and privacy issues is to blame allowing anyone to get scammed while allowing eBay to not have to take responsibility leaving the victims with nothing. So for all new sellers and buyers on eBay be careful on eBay, sad to say but don’t trust anyone, not even eBay the company that promotes safe buying and selling.",1
103,"Going downhill: I used to sell a lot on eBay. It was easy, eBay was reasonable. Now they’ve lost their minds.
Now they force buyers to accept offers, which is incredibly stupid. What is the point of listing a starting price for an item if you’re going to take offers? It would be like walking into a store with priced items but then being told that you could just make an offer on every item. What’s the point of posting prices? eBay is just hoping you sell every single thing because they’re going to make money no matter what. Who cares if you make only a nickel because you had to accept a ridiculously low offer? You care, but eBay doesn’t.
eBay is just greedy. This is a company that makes zillions of dollars and can afford to court buyers, but instead they’re turning people like me off.
It’s interesting that this app listing says “Your feedback is important to us.” That’s obviously not true. I don’t think I’m asking for anything unreasonable, just some basic common sense. But no one actually cares what real users think. The proof of that is that (1) no one will respond to this, and (2) eBay will not change anything suggested here, even though it makes perfect sense.",2
104,"Labeled my REAL item as Counterfeit with no explanation: I just wanted to warn fellow sellers about eBay’s terrible business tactics. 

eBay labeled my 2-year old Gucci belt bag as counterfeit and removed the listing. I asked both Charisse and Chadreen why it was removed and neither could explain. I provided item numbers, clear pictures, and purchasing information for the bag in the listing and to both agents. I just sold my other AUTHENTIC Gucci crossbody purse a few months ago on eBay with NO PROBLEM from eBay or the buyer who loved the purse and thanked me for actually selling a real purse. eBay has terrible customer service agents who can’t even explain the process of how something becomes labeled as counterfeit. I have deleted my account and warning others to also delete theirs. This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard of. 
 
If I was selling a fake bag, I’d mark it as such because obviously whoever purchased it would take it to a store to verify it’s authenticity! If they were told it was fake then they could open a claim against me via eBay and PayPal so why would I even risk that? Terrible, terrible business policies and customer service from eBay.

I always put 12 ounces or for the really small items I put less. Now I am finding that many of my items are way less than 12 ounces and I did not know because I did not list them at that weight.  I continually get charged for the underpaid shipping labels. Why is this happening over and over?  Now I have to go through all of my items again! And make sure they are at the weight that I had put them at. Is something wrong with your system? Plus at the beginning all of my views got wiped out. I saw on you tube that this was an issue with eBay and your software and it was supposed to be fixed but it never was. I never got my views back.

106,"Cart/watchlist management needs work: I liberally throw several items in my cart as I browse. When I'm ready to checkout, I'll review the cart items and usually remove a few to finalize my decisions. Recently I was unable to add items to my cart because there were too many in there already. That's fair, let me remove some... 

Unfortunately this is not easy to do. It has been a long painstaking process that's probably prevented me from making purchases at this point. Each item needs to be manually removed one by one, with a loading screen between each removal. I do not have the patience for that. There's a ""Pay only this seller"" option, please add another option in this context menu to ""Remove all items from this seller."" If not, then at least add an option to remove ALL items from the cart. It should not be a frustrating process to do this. 

It's the same kind of thing with the watchlist. What if I want to keep an eye on more than 100 items? I only started adding to the cart like I described earlier because I ran out of space on my watchlist.",3
107,"Forced app update LOOP: Apr 2022 - back to 1 star - The eBay app forced update loop makes the app unusable (as in you cannot get past the prompt forcing you to update even after you update the app).

 mar2020-ebay finally fixed this bug below!! 5* rating now (it did take them nearly 2 years though) The eBay apps do not allow you to select and copy text from a listings - for example from the title. This is very annoying as often you need to look up specs on an item and there’s no way to copy any text from the listing. also you can’t click on orders from your order history.

I love that unlike other similar online competition such as TopHatter, they REALLY stand by protecting folks and aren't about ripping folks off. As other similar companies (clearing my throat) who truly only care about profit. You can actually talk to a CSR on Ebay. Communication is always available and timely. Your REALLY protected by their policies and if you use PayPal, you have double coverage. Great full for both of these companies. A Faithful User! Thank-You Ebay Teamsters.",5
109,"New update makes the app for brand new phones only, forces you to install so it’s unusable: With the recent update you cannot use the app if you don’t have a brand new phone. It will force you to update to this unusable version even if you rollback to the previous version, it won’t let you keep that version long. The semi recent removal of negative reviews for buyers is incredibly unfair, bc buyers can still abuse the review system in their favor. They told me to just report the buyer, and so I did, but nothing happened and she doesn’t get dinged whatsoever, but it is okay for this person to waste my time/money on a very time sensitive listing that she held hostage for a week which caused its value to decrease. No matter what I say in her review, it still shows “100% positive and amazing buyer” on her profile. The app is also extremely buggy and the browser version constantly deletes info I put in, only to reload the page and delete everything I just entered. That’s been happening for many months and when you save something in the draft section, it deletes most of the info I have put in, besides the description, which wastes so much time and is infuriating.",2
110,"So disappointing...: I have been a long time “eBay-er” and have been frustrated ever since they took away the ability for the user to have a custom start page focusing on the items the customer (e.g. me) want most to look at.  It was very easy to see when there were new items (and how many) from saved sellers and searches. Now that information is multiple clicks away — hiding under all the advertising pushed on you by eBay. I have never bought woman’s shoes, baby clothes, or oriental rugs and yet I am constantly barraged by ads for those things as well as many other items of no interest to me. It’s almost as if they don’t want me to find the items I’m interested in...doesn’t that mean fewer sales...which means less profit for them?

Given the reported bugs from sellers trying to list items — I won’t be using the app to create auctions either. So much for convenience. 

With the iOS 11 update I had no choice but to give up the much older eBay app that worked as I wanted it to and use this app that works more like adware. So disappointing...",4
111,"Intentionally Vague Opt-Out Settings: The app works fine. The newest update has a weird bold font. So, we can all look forward to feeling like we are using our grandparent’s phone for the foreseeable future. Also I’m not sure why we need to scroll down and then click See All for our saved searches. Just let us keep scrolling. -I’m sure this has something to do with how the data loads, but come on...

The one star rating is for their intentionally vague Opt-Out for third party advertising data collection. It has half a dozen categories (the expandable to see a bunch of smaller elements). The page tells you what the data collected is then has a toggle switch that says Yes/No. But it doesn’t say if I am answering “yes, collect and distribute this data” or “yes, opt out”. This needs to be easier to understand.

Then, they provide links to each of their third parties (hundreds, if not thousands) where you can opt out individually. Except about half force you to go to their individual website to opt out. NONE OF THESE LINKS ARE ACTIVE for me. eBay says that we need to do this individually because of the their contracts. eBay is the heavy hitter in these negotiations. If they wanted to protect their customer in these contracts, they’d be able to.",1
112,eBay app review: I have used this app for a while now and due to the small changes over the past couple years overall I am giving this 5 star rating total. I love being able to type in any question in the help category which makes it simple to answer questions and if I can’t figure it out there the eBay phone number where I call or if it’s a while wait ebay calls me back is very convenient so I don’t have to wait on the phone. I will continue to sell and purchase many many items over the next years to come. I’m very greatful to have close to 70 perfect feedbacks total since 2019 and near 60 perfect feedback out of all of those if that’s how it works 100 percent. After using the sight it’s pretty simple and anyone should catch on too understanding the basics of this eBay app. My last phone conversations were very helpful from the last few people that helped me. I use the eBay app from my I phone 8 and I love the way the eBay app works. Thanks eBay and I’ll continue my love for eBay,4
113,"AMAZING: My boyfriend and I have been selling on Ebay for a few months now and we absolutely love it ! We have made great money and have had some amazing conversations with our awesome buyers. This experience has been life changing for me, because I deal with anxiety and social anxiety among a few other things, so being able to work at my own pace & space while also making people happy with their purchases is just so surreal. We became top sellers recently and we are overwhelmed with this opportunity and support from all of our buyers. The customer service has been so helpful & I want to give a shout out to one customer service rep in particular..John. He was so helpful, so kind and honestly speaking to him was the best experience I’ve had (ever) while taking to a customer service rep. He deserves a raise !! 🤗 Ebay-thank you for changing our lives, we are more than proud to be selling on such an amazing platform. Happy doesn’t even begin to describe it !",5
114,"Seller performance: The app was super great from the beginning but now, you guys are just dragging me down. My seller performance has been below standard for months & I have improved a lot like you said and you guys still won’t do anything about it. I’ve called so many times to ask what you guys can do to help me and you guys keep on repeating yourselves and I can getting mad and upset about it. All I want is for to my account to go back to above average performance! That’s all I’m asking for and I have done all of your requirements so where’s my reward??!!! This is not fair at all!!! I want to go back to being a great seller and making lots of money with my listings. Now you guys are just putting a limit on every little thing that I do!! Why?? Why??? I used to look up to you guys. I still want to use eBay like a machine. Please make my account back to normal. That’s all I’ve ever wanted these past months. Please!!! Please!!!!! Just let me sell more stuff!!!!!!!!!",5
115,Amazing!!!! But one thing: I love eBay! It is my favorite online store to go to and shop. It has literally anything you need or want there! But there is one problem that I think they should look into and that is the package tracking from international sellers... I cant tell you how many time I have ordered out side of US and the tracking tells me when it will arrive and when that day arrives it never comes.... eventually it does arrive but I really rely on the package tracking.... one other thing is that about 2 mounths ago I ordered from and international seller and about a mounth later I got a notification saying that it had delivered but it had never arrived on my door step or mailbox....  there was no way somebody stole the package because the notification was new... we emailed the seller and it looked like the package was still in China. It never arrived. So if you guys could fix the package tracking from international buyers that would be awesome!,5
116,"Would give 0 stars if I could: I’ve been buying stuff from eBay for maybe a year-a year and half now. I had 100 percent positive buyer feedback and thought it was time for me to try to start selling because I had some items to get rid of and I needed a little extra money. I ship my first few items and everything goes well. The customers pay for the times, and soon enough, payday is almost here. But then I accidentally put 0.2 and 0.4 for my bank micro transactions to confirm instead of 0.02 and 0.04 and so I have to call customer support to reset it. The girl says everything looks good and I should receive new micro transactions in two days. But lo and behold, 5 minutes later I am permanently banned for reasons they don’t tell me, and I will not be receiving my money. eBay is a terrible platform and I recommend that you consider a different place to sell from if you don’t want to get scammed out of your money. So disheartening for a new seller. And don’t even try to call customer support to work it out. As soon as you get banned, their live support is all of a sudden “unavailable at the time.” But it’s actually all the time. Just completely unbelievable",1
117,"App is good, but could be better: Overall, the app is user-friendly and gets the job done. However, there are several features available on the website, but not the app that they need to add. For example: You can send an offer to a seller using the app just like you can on the actually website, but you cannot pull an offer back on the app like you can on the site, assuming of course the offer hadn’t been accepted yet (if the offer is accepted then that’s a whole other situation). That is a HUGE flaw IMO because if you send an offer, then something comes up that would make you want to rescind it (maybe a cheaper offer was accepted or you realized an issue with the product after hitting send), you cannot rescind it using the app and have to now go online to do so. The website does not work well on phones, so you really need to get to a computer to rescind it at that point, and that isn’t always easy. In summary, any critical features like that should be made available on both the app and website; not just one or the other.",3
118,"Return policy is a joke: The return policy is insane. Buyers can screw and scam with reckless abandon and return for any reason (real or conjured up) under the sun. No more consequences than getting booted and having to create a new account and start over. Even when proof is submitted a seller is getting screwed (video and pics of shipped items) it’s all about protecting the buyers....and sellers are the ones paying the fees/ebays income!! I’ve been lucky so far but so many I know haven’t been. But, eBay is the biggest and most widespread selling platform in the world so it’s a risk one has to take. Customer service has been helpful when I’ve called. Platform is easy to use and set up. Very user friendly. Love eBay except for the return policy and sometimes excessive fees. Changing that return policy and protecting sellers from scammers would make eBay the undisputed king. Just have an eBay rep making a rational, informed decision on a return and that would fix it.",5
119,"Ebay customer service is quite bad: I’ve never taken the time To write a formal review on any business but after reading someone’s bad experience about you make customer service I needed to add mine. For the last eight months, anytime I’ve had to contact them with buyer issues it has been an utter nightmare. I literally have spent hours on the phone, transferred so many times each call.  They simply want you to take returns every time a buyer wants. A buyer can claim any reason, story, lie, excuse. Doesn’t matter.  You really have no choice and EBay absolutely will not assist.  Your funds get taken out of your account whenever a buyer opens a return claim.  And, even an authentic Chanel handbag. I spent hours on the phone thinking surely, they have my back on authenticity given my years on EBay and great rating. Nope. Very inconvenient to process returns.  I realized that I simply need to plan on funds on hold and double time to sell due to no consequence whatsoever to a buyer with remorse.  Beware.  So frustrating!",5
120,"eBay is great at not paying: I have been selling on eBay for over 10 years. I have never had anything less than a 100 score. Recently, I’ve been selling it a product that I purchase bulk via Alibaba. My financial account of eBay was over $8000. I was enjoying winning. Then, all of a sudden eBay decides to restrict my account with a MC011. A permanent restriction, I find out after 90 days of proving my identity and proving where I purchased the product from. After researching, I find out that eBay has been withholding many sellers payouts. Trying to contact customer support is to no avail. I can only respond and inquire about my account through an email that is not accessible through the app, nor responding through my Gmail account. This is the most difficult process that eBay can make it for me. I can tell that this racket has been going on for many years by the number of complaints when Google searching this situation.",5
121,"Slow decline into irrelevance: eBay changed the way you leave feedback, and now negative feedback on a seller is not possible. Now you are only given the option to review ""the item"" and issues with sellers are ignored. You also can't post the feedback unless it is a lengthy paragraph, which is meant to deter you from helping others. This website has been completely overrun by chinese sellers in the past 10 years which often sell low quality garbage and will send you the wrong item over and over. eBay will slowly become a waste of time and another version of temu except 20x the price, unless they allow users to take control and leave the feedback these low quality sellers deserve. They won't do that, though, because of their shareholders. They even incorporated a horrible useless ai ""suggested outfits"" advertisement which is so lame and pointless I don't even need to say anything about it. No one will ever use that, especially since it has no ability to suggest the vinyage clothing eBay is known for. eBay's slow sad death is frustrating to watch, the shareholders should remove the people responsible for these changes or it will die off.",1
122,"Scam Artists: How EBay ruined my passive income job: Recently eBay decided to permanently suspend my account-without reason of course. When I spoke to multiple customer “support agents” (after multiple hours waiting) they each literally said, word for word, “as part of the user agreement we have no obligation to provide any specific reason as to why your suspension was put into place, because this would allow members to circumvent the problem”.
 So let me summarize this. I had the BEST quarter of my eBay career selling on the platform the last 2 months (prior to ban), out of no where EBay suspends my account (no negative comments, not even negative feedback, NOTHING remotely bad happened involving myself, my eBay, or my customers from eBay). First-they refuse to provide reasoning. Second- they GUARANTEE to permanently suspend ANY future accounts linked to me person (again for NO REASON). I will never be using this app ever again, and I suggest all sellers move away before you have $$$$ locked up like I do because these communists decided I made too much profit, so they’d rather just take my ability to practice capitalism away! Thanks for nothing eBay! You are genuinely the scum of American capitalism!",1
123,eBay will hold your funds for 30 days: Been selling on eBay for over 10 years but never had a total sale over 1000 dollars.. have come close a few times but never crossed that mark. I recently sold two items to one buyer to bought both items. The total just so happened to be over 1000 dollars and I am now subject to a 30 day hold that is being extended because of a bank holiday so really I won’t see the funds for 32 days at a minimum. I tried reasoning with support saying if I sold these two items separately I wouldn’t be subject to this hold. I have pristine feedback as a seller and the buyer even received the packed on the second day after purchase… the support person thanked me for being a “good eBay citizen for following their best practices” but to no avail could they move up the hold. Their manager would not entertain it either. Why not make me put a credit card on file for them to charge for 30 days if there’s an issue but at least I can get my funds…? Suffice to say this is the last time I will be buying or selling on eBay. They just made a few bucks in interest off my funds being on hold on top of all the fees they deducted immediately.,1
124,"eBay 2022: A bad place to sell: In case you haven’t heard, eBay is now a terrible place to sell anything. There is no seller protection remaining. They seem to have accepted that as long as they give the buyers free reign to abuse common policy, they will still collect their grossly inflated fees; and that there will always be more sellers to replace those who make the appropriate decision to exit their outdated selling system. They even charge you their percentage of fees on the state taxes collected by your account! No refunds of tax monies collected should you receive a refund as a buyer... absolutely corrupt! No store or government agency would dare corrupt these financial safe-grounds. Absurd systematic abuse. $20 fee to seller if you lose any dispute with a buyer (which you always will, ask ANY seller). Read the fine print. These $1 card sellers don’t even know there is a non-refundable 30 cent charged per item sold before fees are even calculated on the total sale plus tax and shipping! Suckers! All of the above is true and undisputed fact. Oh and you also have to wait up to 4 days for your funds, which are now all funneled through eBay instead of the convenient PayPal system of the past. Have fun selling - not!",1
125,"No way other way to get this message to you: I am absolutely beside myself as to why on earth there is absolutely no way for anyone to contact the developer to say that there are certain parts of your filtering system that make no freaking sense! Case in point, in men’s activewear under the category for shorts and pants under the filter section 4 size all you offer is waist size in inches i.e. 30, 32, 34, 36,… Are you crazy? People buy activewear like basketball shorts in the sizes that manufacturers make them i.e. small, medium, large, extra-large, extra extra large! Basketball shorts don’t even come in sizes by inches you idiots I don’t know why you changed it he used to just be the regular S, M, L, XL, XXL, as choices for size but somewhere along the line some genius decided to change it to inches and that makes no freaking sense and it doesn’t even matter because none of the stupid things in the category are even manufactured that way or labeled that way but why do I have no one to tell? 
No way to contact anybody on the app to say hey you’re screwed this up you idiot you need to fix it why is this the only resource that I have to tell you that you are ignorant? You idiots!",1
126,"Used to be an awesome app.: Admittedly you have more items for sale than most likely any other site on the www.  However you used to include filtering options that allowed you to narrow search results down to very specific items.  Seems now you only have a few filter options within your search criteria and then it’s a lot of other BS.  Nobody who is looking for something specific wants to have to wade through literally a million offers in order to find what they want.  Now you are only allowed to filter in the product category to a very general list, then your filter options you give at the top of the listings to further filter out unwanted stuff, they don’t work.  I just did a search and normally in that category was able to use the filters to narrow the search results down to roughly 400 sale offers but on your new system was only able to narrow the results down to 3.99 million!  I can see how some of the new options are good, however if you can’t narrow your search down to anything less than 3.99 million no one is going to waste their time with you anymore they will just buy from a regular website!",2
127,"Most anything goes!: Many years ago,. eBay was (always) very interesting specifically on the types of things you could purchase that you could not normally find in your own town or city

Fast forward to today The process is now so much easier the photographs are spot on and the customer base do you have selling items are great. I will tell you that I tend to buy more things from eBay that I would be going into a brick and mortar store.

And of course, Paypal also helpful especially for large ticket items that you may not have exactly have cash for .  I really searching on a topic and seeing what offered 💜

So I will  using eBay for-small. Toys,jewelry ,anything. The only thing I have concerned with is that I have tried on a few occasions to buy clasps for find jewelry sometimes with diamonds sometimes not but every time I put the gold gym class just for jewelry repair and never and never comes back it seems like there must be many of them out there because you have so many things for other items so I’m hoping that I could get that kind of information at some point because I make jewelry on the side

I have  spread the word to my other associates about eBay many of the music some people don’t but when they see certain things that I wear or bring in I know it’s from you it’s very nice thank you for your questions today I hope you can take this information and make make eBay a better place and is even now",5
128,"No longer what it once was: The eBay I once knew and used years ago is now gone! eBay is now one of the worst sites to purchase/buy anything on. Zero customer service as no one any longer comprehends English (all out sourced). Beyond fraudulent transactions/activity with an unimaginable amount of counterfeit items. Horrible rude/nasty and dishonest sellers. Feedback is totally un-fair (sellers can’t leave negative any longer) etc. Ridiculous holds on PayPal funds for two to three weeks for a $5.00 item! All cases are now automated outcomes (ridiculous). Suspensions and not covered by eBay money back guarantees are a scam! Buyers open cases for exactly that “not as described” but yet buyers are no longer covered for opening “too many” in my particular case, I’ve never opened one up and I have zero money back guarantee and have no clue why. But sellers are continually allowed to keep selling not as described items and nothing happens to them! I could go on and on but basically ebay is now one of the worst sites to shop and sell on and I no longer deal your crappy site, I’ve moved on as there are several better buying and selling platforms out there. You’re not the only one anymore! Us consumers DO HAVE A CHOICE TO LEAVE YOURS.",1
129,"Not all I’d hoped for: I have had to call Ebay repeatedly for issues with this app. It doesn’t keep up in real time with either my selling or the things I have purchased. It can take minutes to hours for things to update in my app unless I manually restart it. If I list an item through the app it does not show up as listed in my menu even though it is live on the classic site and the only way to fix the problem is to turn off my phone and turn it back on! I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it several times but the problems persist. I have the new iPhone 8 and have talked to apple and my carrier and they assure me that this is an Ebay issue. I even had my phone REPLACED to try and fix the errors! It is a handy app if you want to place a bid but even when you call for help they tell you that you must go to the classic site for any assistance. Now I just use it for alerts. I also don’t like that you cannot contact a seller through the app and must log into the classic site to do this! If they want you to use the classic site even on your phone, why even have an app??? I have called and called to try and get things fixed so maybe writing a review will have some effect!",1
130,"Totally misleading listings for yarn: You MUST address this issue! Most yarn listing titles go for example, like this:

Amazing Brand yarn lot. Wool, acrylic, mohair, silk, cashmere, angora. 

They include several types of fiber hoping that whatever I search for, say cashmere, their listing will pop up. 

Reading the full description you find the yarn is just ONE of these fibers or a mix. And the lot? No, no, the price is by the unit (skein, ball, hank, etc.)

I want TRUTH IN YARN LISTINGS!!! Tell me the ACTUAL fiber content and how it’s priced and sold. 

The HOURS I’ve spent searching for something specific but needed a to sift through descriptions is egregious. 

Also, no more descriptions that are limited to “Four skeins of yarn. From a smoke free home.”

Are they so lazy they can’t read the ball band? And if there is no ball band, say you don’t have any information. Another popular excuse is that the yarn comes from an estate sale. 

This is hardly only a Chinese seller problem. It’s rampant on eBay. If you know nothing about what you’re selling, find someone who does. 

Also, the pricing has become OUTRAGEOUS. Seriously, I can’t figure this one out. Shocking how many photos clearly show a price tag that is a third or quarter the price they’re selling it for. Probably not selling it!

I’m sick of this and so are all my friends. We are more and more buying directly from manufacturers and retailers when they offer sales. 

You are losing business over this.",5
131,"New layout is extremely buggy…: Update: Investigate? Tell you more…? I just explained everything. There’s nothing really more to say. You potentially cost me selling items when the app doesn’t work and the photos I upload of the item aren’t in order and/or are deleted for absolutely no reason. Or also when the ad settings themselves aren’t correct. Read some of these reviews. Seriously. This app is trash and your customer service, is absolute nonsense. So unless you want to refund my seller fees on the ads that have been affected due to this (which I know you’ll never do) then there’s nothing more to say.

The new layout is very buggy. Especially when selling an item and setting up the sales ad. After saving your parameters, photos, etc. they like to delete themselves all on their own. For example, photos. I add photos for my product and later go back to change a few or rearrange them and they end up deleted, duplicated or all out of the order I had them in. Never had this issue before. The newest update made for iOS 11 is just BAD. So full of bugs everywhere. Fix the issues or take it back to how it used to be, which worked perfectly and was much more simplified.",1
132,"Where’s the customer service?: I’n going to try and make this short. I made an account last year. Everything that was purchased from my account, I shipped. A couple months passed by and I was deployed. A few months after that I got a chance to log in. I noticed my account had been suspended because of an invoice I apparently had for three dollars and some change. I called some number I found on the Internet that was for their customer service. They told me I had to talk to their collection agency. The agency told me I had to talk to eBay because I wasn’t in their system. eBay refers me back to them. There I was in a never ending circle. Fast forward a few months and here I am today trying to make a new account and it gets suspended indefinitely. I email them because trying to get to someone on the phone is impossible. And I get the same automated email response back THREE times. One star is doing eBay a favor.",5
133,"Search function terrible: Ebay has totally dropped the ball on the search function on the Ipad.  The major problems:  
1.  The search engine frequently inserts filters that cannot be removed except by stupid manipulations.  When listings are done with abbreviated data they are frequently eliminated.  I understand the auto insertion of the filters but not allowing their deletion is nonsensical.  I always have add the term “-widget” to eliminate the filter and display all the relevant results.
2.  Cannot sort by highest price; only highest price plus shipping.  This gives screwy results when listings don’t have fixed shipping cost listed or are for pickup only.
3.  Doesn’t allow to filter by only items with existing bids.  My best source for finding “deals”.
The old ipad ebay software allowed all of this and was then improved? by the current version.  I had the old one on an Ipad until Ebay quit allowing it to function.  My purchases and interest in Ebay have declined significantly since then.",4
134,"Changes in eBay and with buyers: Changes with eBay over a few years have not been good for the small sellers. One big one was way back when feedback for buyers went away. Also when people could return for any reason. Especially when sellers pay the shipping - on most of my items it runs $15 & $20. Before an few returns it could be absorbed. But now people return on a whim, they just want to try it on etc. EBay is not a good place for small sellers. 
Buyers have also changed quite a bit. People don’t want to pay a reasonable price. It’s all about offering 25 - 50% under the listed price ( putting it way below my cost). Then when you agree to a rock bottom price they return the item. Maybe you need a option that says at the discounted price the sale is final. Something to protect the seller. 
I went from having a good ebay experience to just trying to dump my inventory and get out. I miss the good old days of buying and selling.  It was good while it lasted……",4
135,"Do not sell: I agree with everyone else. I have been selling shoes for a while, and I am used to insane fees, but not the way eBay does it. For starters, shoe platforms at least have the decency to tell you how much you will walk away with before the sale. With eBay you get to do all the calculating yourself, and let me tell, there are a lot of numbers to deal with. The fees are insane for one thing, I just sold Air Tags at a 13% fee +. $0.30. Also thought I’d mentioned they added promotion which sounds great since you can get more sales. The problem is now no items get no views and you have to promote half the time to sell. No biggie? Well they take a % of the sale for it. That’s right. More than 13%. If you want to sell, use their recommended amount, which is usually over 4-5%, or go higher to actually have a chance. Then you pay for your label. Take that into account. If you paid for their shipping take that into account. Literally ridiculous. Will be on the lookout for better platforms, hopefully Mercari is different. At the end of the day though, I learned a lesson, so I am grateful I had this eBay experience so I can never sell on it going forward.",1
136,"Won’t disclose reasons for account suspension: I started an ebay account to sell my old Lego collection and things were going well. Until out of nowhere I got an email that said I had been permanently banned from ebay. First, I spent hours trying to figure out why I was suspended, and second of all, I tried to figure out how I could get my account back (which is hard to do if you don’t even know what you’ve done wrong). Eventually I used my mom’s account to call ebay customer service (I was banned from my own account, and if I wasn’t signed in to an account I would only get an unhelpful robot recording). The person was of course nice and as helpful as he could be, but said the company would not allow me to know why I was banned, and that I was indeed banned for life. My rating overall is that the app is great, but you could get unlucky like me and get banned for I’m assuming some small reason on page 1,000 of the terms and conditions, but I’ll never know. (btw Im not complaining about the customer service person, he was extremely nice, just that the fact they won’t even tell you what you did wrong was extremely annoying and seems unfair to me)",1
137,"Solid app. Convenient. Few cons: For basic eBay shopping and buying, the app is as good (or in a few instances better) compared to using the website. There is obvious convenience and it doesn’t sacrifice any basic features so for common buyers, there’s likely no downside. Having push notifications for price drops, offers, msgs, sold listings, etc is convenient for buyers & sellers & they don’t overload/nag you or abuse them for advertising.

As a seller, there are some back office dashboard functions you may prefer unchanged and only a few limitations. Most recently, I received my seller invoice of fees owed for January & needed a detailed breakdown of all transactions & their respective fees. I was a little annoyed that you’re told to use a computer to access that info. There are probably a few other rare examples of app limitations like that for sellers and users going beyond the average shopper. If not for that, I would’ve easily given 5 stars. It functions properly, is straightforward, makes some things easier and sacrifices almost nothing.",4
138,"More and more disappointment: Let me start with the fact that I’m an A+++ rated buyer that makes multiple daily purchases and have done so many years. I do most of my buying on the app because on my iPad it moves much faster, until it forgets that you’ve made a last minute bid to find out it’s not there at all. Most recently I made a purchase that billed my credit card (verified) but eBay still shows it in my cart unpaid. After waiting on hold for 15 minutes I speak to a lovely woman from a different country (because there’s no left here in the United States to work the phone)who tells me “I can’t help you. I don’t see anything and we don’t have control over that function”. Miss this is the sole purpose of my call and I can see that eBay has no issues making multiple $1.00 charges for “ verification”. Looks like more flea markets and yard sales for me. eBay needs to clean things up! eBay is starting to cost me even more money. I hope this helps.",5
139,"The shopping experience continues to deteriorate: Ebay and the developers of the app focus on ads and marketing to the shopper, the functionality of the app is suffering immensely. You want me to shop and sell, correct? The curated items rarely apply to my taste. Let me curate myself and fix the filters.  The app is cumbersome to navigate with unnecessary steps, drop down menus such as show less, show more. Filters have gotten worse. now often don’t show option such as sleeveless or color for example in many of my searches. My Ebay requires to many steps to navigate. Deleting items from my recent searches doesn’t function many times and won’t delete items I am not interested in. Navigating this app simply eats up much of the time that normally would be dedicated to shopping.  The old app was simpler, cleaner, more intuitive, produced the items I searched for. Now I have to wade through products that don’t apply to my search, and I tire of searching altogether.",5
140,"improved but still some of my listings won’t show up: despite many huge improvements my listings that I’m paying you a fortune to promote— some of then still will not show up in search results at ALL for no reason! And these are items well listed properly that I’m promoting even ones At about 9-10%. Please check why these items would be glitching? Test a bunch of my listings to see why because it’s immensely frustrating. I’ve called ebay before about this issue, we tested those items and indeed they WERE GLITCHING for jo reason. Several of my itens are doing it and not showing up when key words in my title are searched so PLEASE check then. I’ll call ebay again and try to figure it out 
Otherwise thank you for the HUGE improvements including new text style messaging and that now we can add like 22 photos!! Omg a revolutionary change!! It’s made all the difference for me!!! THANK YOU A MILLION for that!!!",5
141,"Clean yet impossible to navigate: Edit: after many improvements the app became mostly usable....only now it’s super unreliable. Listings show in my watch list which have ended and have no messaging until I click them and some listings fail to show in my watch list on my phone but show on desktop. These basic failings are unacceptable. Someone dropped the ball. 

The new eBay app is impossible. Yes it is impossible. I don't even use it anymore...and I have a high tolerance for pain. From one UI designer to another: hang up he gloves, put her out to pasture, this design may not even be conducive to iteration, it's one of the most frustrating experiences in an app I have ever had. It would be hard to sum up the issues in one review but I think it boils down to navigation and intuitiveness...I often have zero idea of where I am in the app or even how to get back to where I was...just attempting to search for something is a paradox...I stare at the screen begging for something to be clear...I click around and repeat the same mistakes because nothing is intuitive. The old app was slightly dated but at least it was useable. Please start over and focus on usability first, fancy weird navigation second.",1
142,"Burn the sellers, indulge the buyer: This site is not worth selling on anymore. There’s absolutely zero seller protection even if you’ve been with them for over a decade. If a buyer wants a return, they’re allowed to say anything they want with no input from the seller whatsoever. No contribution from the seller in whether what they’re saying is correct. It’s an automatic return even when the reasoning is absolutely false. And when they flat out lie the seller pays for the shipping both ways. You would think that a 16 year reputation with 100% feedback would have more merit than someone with a feedback of 3 but it flat out doesn’t. The buyers word is more respected than a seller with a lengthy reputation. Sellers are treated like absolute garbage. Great news for the buyer though! If you don’t like your item you’re entitled to make up whatever you want, fake a return, leave whatever negative feedback you feel, and get your way all in the same breath no matter if it’s true or not! So buyers you can’t lose! Feel free to say whatever you like in order to gain what you want. Good luck, but you won’t need it because it’s that easy. For sellers, go to Poshmark. They’ll protect you there",1
143,"Review of experience while using it: I know we aren’t all perfect; but been having problems with sellers being truthful about there items and especially for me; being able to say they can ship to APO addresses. I can understand if they can’t but then there are some who decline my purchase after seeing I have an APO address. 
The communication from sellers I’ve been wanting to get in contact is also been a problem, especially when it’s answering questions on a bidding auction and takes them 24 or more hours to respond or last minute when the auction closes. I be happy if ebay could have sellers be more vigilant with answering questions for buyers like myself. 
Otherwise, would also wish that ebay could have a 24hr rep to answer questions for myself being in different parts of the world so if I need them I can get answers quickly. 
On the good side, I appreciate the service ebay does to help me and being easy to buy minus at points when problems arise.",4
144,"Dependable, easy shopping ..: Fast, easy, secure, dependable shopping .. It is a fast, relaxing, secure way to shop, and dependable as well .. There is one thing about shopping this way, that I am sometimes troubled about, and that is a seller having two seller/buyer accounts, and they bid against themselves to drive the bid up, or not to let it go for a bid lower than they wanted to let it go for .. I have had the feeling that this has happened to me a number of times, but don’t know how to prove it, and the hassle of that wouldn’t be worth the trouble .. But I do, truly enjoy shopping on eBay, that is a safe and secure place to look for things, at the comfort of wherever, or whatever I’m doing, and get a fast, and easy reply to any inquiries, and purchases .. Thank you for this great way to shop ..EBay is a great place to find things your looking for fast .. The shopping experience is comfortable and easy to work with ..",5
145,"They won’t get rid of fraudulent sellers.: Over the past couple of months, I have reported sellers for either selling something that isn’t what it says it is, The item is something only a blind person would use, and they’re taking advantage of blind people by misrepresenting the item, or for selling counterfeit items. The sellers are still there, selling the same things. On top of that, the latest update doesn’t allow you to leave feedback for each item, if they were in the same order. The feedback is important, because though one thing may have been described properly, another item in the same order may not have been. A friend of mine hasn’t updated her app yet, and was able to leave feedback for each item, so I know it’s just the latest version. This hurts sellers and buyers alike and should be fixed immediately. Some of this may not be app related, but it might make you think twice before downloading this app and buying on eBay until they fix all of these issues.",3
146,"Buyer Usability Diminished: As a buyer and seller on eBay for over 15 years, I’ve used countless iterations of the app as well as eBay’s classic website. The latest version in use for the past month or two has made selling easy and efficient—though browsing on the site as a buyer has now been made more difficult through reduced ability to refine searches via category refinements.

Example: if I search or browse for a Blazer, I used to be able to refine my search by: color, material, brand. Now, the app has eliminated the ability to refine a search through the use of those categories, though sellers can still use said categories in their listings. This is the case for search items *across the board* for the whole app.

Why, in short, allow sellers to list a series of item refinements that are not available for buyers to refine their searches?  Why make it harder for buyers to find specific features of items they’re looking for?",5
147,Surprisingly easy to find deals. But as a seller support will F&$@ you: eBay....oh ebay. You would think you have to worry about scammers or bad sellers but nope. In my 6+ years as a buyer then seller the biggest issue will be support. As a seller support only gets ten times worse as I have lost more money with terrible eBay support then with scammers or bad sellers on this app. They have no legitimate system in place and love to act as they do and as a consultant I have quite the experience so believe me when I say their rules and policies are in place to secure more buyers so they can get their cut. Simple as that. For the seller they will screw you ten ways and say your welcome when their done. You seen it before but I’ll say it again. eBay does not care for the people that make their app what it is today and they probably never will as long as the money keeps rolling in. I’m so sincere in my review I have even hired an app developer just to begin laying the foundation of my own marketplace app. Nothing special or too different from others except for a great support team and less fees considering 5% just to undercut. Cause ebay is robbing sellers with the 10% selling to not even provide adequate support in return.,1
148,"Title: eBay review: While eBay remains a great place to shop, it has been increasingly difficult to remain a Seller on eBay.
I have been a Seller on eBay for over seven years now and I can tell you I cringe every time I get an email from eBay announcing a policy change, as they are never good news for the Seller. Every change increases eBay’s profit margin and decreases the Seller margins. Now many times eBay/Pay Pal fee % exceeds my profit margin. Greed will spell the end of eBay and it will be a Netflix moment, not a slow decline. 
Another serious issue is the change from determining who is right to assuming the Buyer is always right. This has resulted in. 50% increase in our returns with the vast majority of cases being nothing wrong with the item, the buyer either changed their mind, or purchased multiple units, keeping the one they like the best and returning all the others. This is very time consuming and expensive for the seller.
I would hope the someone in eBay actually reads this and takes some action.
Regards, Bruce Majka",4
149,"Needs revision: I sell a few small items most months on eBay. I am frustrated by the automatic re-list ( and re-list fees) that eBay has instituted. Many of my items are small and repeated re-lists eat up the total sale price quickly.  Previous to this new policy, I would not er-list items that were not selling.
   You also should be aware that eBay now charges the same percentage of sellers fee for your SHIPPING as it does for the SELLING price of the item. They explained to me  that I am charged that fee to be fair to any buyers who may be overcharged on shipping by dishonest sellers. Really? Am I to believe the “overcharged” buyer is getting a rebate somewhere?     My shipping fee is set by eBay based on the size & weight of my item.  Yes, I actually weigh and measure when I list. I find that my actual cost to ship is often MORE than the eBay estimate so I eat the extra charge. I was told to add shipping into my sellers fee and offer free shipping—-in that case they still charge the listing fee based on the total, thus I am still paying a fee for the shipping. This is a hidden fee that SHOULD BE CORRECTED.",3
150,"LOVE!: I really can’t say enough great things about eBay. I began selling some personal items, as my husband & are cleaning out our closets & attic. Our children are both heading to college in the next year and we thought it was time to downsize all our things. The thing was, we had some really wonderful & collectible items, we didn’t want to just donate, trash, or sell via a yard sale. This led us to eBay. We have fallen in love with company. It’s a wonderful platform to reach people from all over the country & world. Although, making money has been great, knowing so many of our items are being purchased by others who will also appreciate and love the items, many of which you can no longer buy because they are out of production. It’s been an amazing adventure, nice side income, and easy platform to use! Once you sell your first item, I have no doubt, you will be excited and continue selling & buying!!",5
151,"Coins and ebay: Ebay should not let people sell uncertified Coins as almost all of them are either cleaned or way less quality than they are made out to be by deceptive sellers  I have bought more than 20 uncertified Coins from different sellers over the last 3 years and when I send them into Ngc or Pcgs every single one is not nearly the grade that the seller said it was and those were the best ones  almost every one was either cleaned or altered thereby making the Coins value almost nothing  every single purchase I made was a complete loss of whatever I spent on the coin or coins  ebay does nothing at all to help the buyer as I did remove the coins from the holder that the seller sent the coin to me in so they wouldn’t take the coin back
Ebay only cares about one thing - ebay and making money for ebay  if they cared about the people out there getting taken they would get rid of these sellers but because of the amount that these dealers sell they turn a blind eye and count the money they are making",4
152,"Feedback pages never load: When I go to check feedback for a seller, or my own feedback page, it only loads maybe 30% of the time. Most the time it will sit totally blank with the loading icon until it times out. I have tried restarting app to no avail. 

There was also a pretty big glitch with an item I had listed for sale (an lp record) To customers, the title and specs were that of a completely different record than what I had originally listed and pictured. A record I had never sold before or even looked up. But when I clicked the link to my own item, there it was, a totally different item title than what I had listed, but my pictures and description remained the same. Even in my selling tab, the title looked correct, just when clicked on showed the incorrect information. so customers were very confused as to why the title of record contradicted the photos and description. I had to completely delete and remake the listing.

Most of the time I have no issues with the app. The feedback timeout glitch is getting pretty annoying though.",3

And they were unable to get it authenticated in the window of time to file a claim for reasons that don’t need to be shared. But when we realized that they were scammed eBay said they couldn’t do anything bc it was out of the window. Which I completely understand having that rule for most items, however, when they spent that much money on one item and eBay just told us that they can’t do anything I get upset. And also they are frequent buyers and have given eBay consistent business for years and becuase of this policy they were told that the seller just kept the money because it was out of the window. The customer service individual I talked to was nice enough, alarm bells just went off when they didn’t care that the seller just gets to keep this once again substantial amount of money and they are just screwed over. Complete lack of care about customer loyalty. Thousands of dollars and years of business they have eBay, and they were basically told to F off.",1
154,"Fees: So the fees have gotten out of control. I mean 15% you get on shoes??  I have been with you guys since 2001 and I don’t sell that much with you anymore because of the insanely high fees!?

I mean the creator is a Billionaire! How much more does he need?  Is little folks who made him a Billionaire are suffering. I’m happy for him that he created eBay but man I’m just a guy trying to make a little bit of money just to get by but with the high fees I have to use offer up, Facebook and other places that don’t charge so much.  I want to use eBay so much more to reach so many more people but the super high fees have really stopped me.

155,"What’s up with the Bids and offers page??: What happened to the Bids and Offers page on the newest updated app? (April 2022)
The old version wasn’t great, but when I click on the page now it says “You don’t have any bids or offers”?????
The older version I actually didn’t like because it would list every single offer that every single Seller had sent me for every single item I had recently “watched”. Which was ALOT of offers to sort through. And the offers would stay there until the item sold, longggggg after the offer had expired. There was no ability to “sort” the offers so you could look at only the offers you had made yourself, no ability to “weed out” the expired offers, instead they would all be jumbled up in no particular order. It would make sense to have the most recent offers at the top, but that didn’t happen either. 
I was REALLY hoping the “offers” page would have been fixed on this newest update, but instead ALL the offers have completely disappeared??????",3
156,"False advertising: eBay is full of incompetent employees who sit around, do nothing, but give out false, misleading, information out to people who have been a loyal user for several years. They lie, they don’t return phone calls, they put you on hold for longer than an hour expecting you to wait? They do not process requests, or say they will but never come through on what they say, again misleading information. Carolina is one of them. Fey is another. Their supervisors are liars as well and do not take care of your issue when they say it will be taken care of. They record conversations and take down notes yet you are having to explain yourself over and over again with employee after employee who by the way you can’t always understand because of their heavy accent. It’s annoying to use their app, to speak to their employees and deal with fees that they charge and refuse to pay you back when they say they will but actually don’t and expect you to write a good survey on them. Like even if they are automatic, do not send them out without resolving the persons issue first otherwise you’ll get a bad review of course!",1
157,Returns and resolution: I am absolutely disgusted and dissatisfied with custom service! I have been both a buyer and seller for 13 years and have had no issues until now. I sell only authentic brand names. I most recently sold a Burberry shirt. I I received payment and sent the shirt overnight. I then received an email stating that the shirt was not authentic which is not true and insulting! My policy I do not take returns. The buyer contacted you and you put a freeze on MY money in PayPal . I then called and was told by your customer service representative that if the buyer did nothing after 30 days my funds would be released. 30 days pass and I call again... then am told you’re going to offer the buyer to return and you would send out return label. I never received the item because apparently you have an address that I have not lived at for 8 years! I called AGAIN and then your representative ask me to contact where I lived 8 years ago and try to get the lost item. This is absurd!!! I don’t want my shirt back in fear of damages and want an immediate release if my funds back to PayPal.  You are trying to help the buyer yet I am now missing my money and a shirt worth twice what I sold it for!,1
158,MAKE A BETTER APP FOR THE PEOPLE: It’s very annoying when selling an item if buyer doesn’t agree with seller price and you agree to negotiate a different amount through the application the seller doesn’t even have the ability to send an invoice to the buyer I even went on your classic website through my iPhone and still didn’t have the option available so ultimately had to call up to eBay customer service and have them do it for me. It’s very annoying to not have the ability to do something so simple also as far as functions on the app versus the website you can’t even see your outstanding balance in the menu screen or any of the drop downs so another faulty feature. Ultimately it shouldn’t be that hard to give your phone app the same features as what’s offered on the classic website. I’ve been using eBay for many years and it seems as though there is always some reoccurring issue or glitch that is a problem. Get it together app developers you’re a multibillion dollar company I think you should have a functional app that’s user-friendly and offers all options that are on the website. It'd be nice to see a change sooner than later,1
159,"Still disappointed: Update: Still not a fan of the app as it is. Would much rather have the old version back. And now, it keeps randomly crashing on me as I try to search and select color/size options in listings. Just keeps getting worse. 😞

I have really tried to ""adapt"" to this latest update, hoping I would come to appreciate it with time and use - but I still hate it! Instead of one click at the bottom of the screen to get to my Watch List, Search, etc... it now takes at least 2. And I can no longer toggle between the screens to compare because it refreshes each time I change a screen! Additionally bidding is no longer as user friendly as it doesn't give minimum bid, and the Current Bid/Time Remaining are almost hidden in fine print at the top of the screen. I also greatly miss the little icons on my purchases that quickly let me know if an item had been shipped, if I needed to still leave feedback, etc.... And now my ended items seem to be disappearing without my removing them; there's a reason I haven't removed it and I don't care how long it's been. 
I'm trying to think of an improvement made in the update, but am at a loss. 😣",1
160,eBay is so improved over the years! Reliable and safe: 90 people have hesitations about purchasing things on eBay but there’s fire protection against everything and I’ve really almost never had a problem wearing it couldn’t be resolved between me and the seller. Yes sometimes things don’t come the way you want and or get broken and shipping or whatever but I usually have no problems working this out personally between me and the seller. If you look and see how many things they’ve sold you can tell if they actually are good at selling and/or are a person who uses eBay to actually make money versus somebody that’s trying to get rid of one or two things and never use eBay. It can’t be good because sometimes somebody needs to start somewhere and with Barbara Tection you should get what you’re trying to buy or eBay will guarantee it. Good luck and enjoy. Many treasures are found here.,5
161,"20yr live for eBay: I stated buying in eBay many years ago for designer clothing for less & everything I would want that would cost more for retail. I started selling & it was great because I was a seasonal worker & world out well for me when I didn’t work to sell. I rarely sell in EBay now, now there are so many platforms that I do so well in but find it very hard to sell not matter how cheap I make my items but have done really well it’s hit or miss. As for shopping it’s definitely my first goto place to buy everything ai need first before any other site. I enjoy eBay and think they have the best customer service out of any platform out there they treat the seller & the buyer very fairly and something I appreciate the most. Thanks EBay for being my favorite platform even if I don’t sell as much. It may be that I do not have the following I do on other platforms & just need to build that back up.",5
162,"Changing for the worse!: I’ve been a eBay seller and buyer for a very long time. Currently, I’m not that happy with the service. The changes/updates to me are for the worse! As a seller, I have noticed  many things that I don’t like. I also realize that eBay is a business and it’s in business to make money. eBay now changes your listing to what they believe it should be for them to make money on the sale. They’ve changed my fixed price listings to include accepting offers, reduced my listing price even though I chose the option not too and relisted my item even after I let it expire. The worse was they, upon the bidders’ request, cancelled a bid from the high bidder/only bidder after changing their mind within the last few hours of the listing. The reason for the cancellation was not in my opinion in accordance with eBay guidelines but it was approved. These are just a few dislikes. I assume some type of artificial intelligence is managing and making these changes. Just know that you have to constantly be on alert to their changes to your listings.",3
163,"Really Bad !! Where did the “newest listings” sort feature in refine search go?: As 15 year full time eBayers (sellers and buyers), you have over the past few months practically ruined the eBay app for regular sellers. I am sure somebody there is reading all the complaints!  Are you?? You have made it so hard to list ads with the app, taken away much used and needed features. Now with this update you have eliminated the choice of selecting “newest listings” when refining your search. That is it!!! I have spoken to a dozen long time eBay sellers today - they are abandoning using the eBay app. Today my partner and I with our multiple eBay stores are also quitting the app. It is beyond belief that you don’t have ebay sellers in the app design team. When you put up dozens of new ads a day - and you are trying to get quickly  right back to an ad after it is launched, without the “newest listings” refine choice, you have really made it impossible for mainstream eBay sellers. It’s a really sad for eBay sellers. Lest you forget it is established eBay sellers that put things up that provide the large array of items that attract buyers.",2
164,"Great in finding unusual items!: I’ve come to count on eBay for finding items that may be out of print or items that were around when I was growing up!  And i’m always browsing clarinet accessories and Pickleball paddles!  I needed a magazine that I read in June 1990; eBay delivered!  A camera was stolen from my car; eBay had the exact replacement at half the cost!  If I want to try a clarinet mouthpiece I can usually find a used one in good condition. I love browsing the daily deals and I like that I often have a choice between brand new if i’m buying a gift or used if i’m buying for myself. It is good to compare to other shopping sites though; some sellers are pretty proud of their goods and charge more than some stores. Also keep an eye on shipping - it isn’t necessarily a good deal if you get that widget for $1 if you have to spend $20 on shipping!  But overall, this is a great app and I use it often.  Now back to searching for another great find!",5
165,"Not bad, but could be better.: Coding definately needs work. I sold something and then canceled the order on buyer but the eBay still counted that money as things sold and added that amount to this month total???? I cancelled the order so item wasn’t sold! Other ridiculous thing is that i got charged $1 for posting the item and the item i posted didn’t sell and prolly will not sell. I really hate eBay for not taking out their 10% fee right away too. I sold $1700 rolex and already spent the money and then month later they wanted $230 as the 10% when I already had no money in my bank, sending me into the negative overdraft balance that I got charged fees for on top of it because their not authorized transaction. So the $230 turned into a little over $270...i know that my fault for not having the money, buy yall could of taken your stupid 10% right away while money was on the table, not a month later after i spend it.",5
166,"eBay does not make it easy: I’ve been selling for a little while now, and it seems like when an issue arises on the app or among clients, it’s pretty much up to you as the seller to fix it and take responsibility even when eBay itself truly is at fault. It is impossible to easily contact another human regarding anything actually helpful.
The app isn’t completely horrendous, as you do have the ability to sell quite efficiently (despite a few bugs), as long as you don’t run into any problems. But if you do, you’re pretty much screwed. 
I’ve had 100% positive reviews up until now, and a buyer left an untruthful negative review the other day after an accident on my part that I immediately apologized for.  I ended up attempting to explain the situation to eBay, however they quickly replied with a bland email saying that they are unable to remove the review. 
Because of this I am now 0.5% away from qualifying for authorization, and probably won’t get it unless I make a new account and start fresh. I’ve been looking for solutions for days, but I was counting on eBay; and they let me down hard. Very disappointed.",1
167,"Superb but..: Everything is perfect.. Except when eBay takes down my listings. I have called 5 times and each time they say to describe my items exactly. Thats what I have been doing! The system just takes my items down without actually looking at my listing! I lost money because of this! Its really frustrating when someone tells me what to do, I do it, but then eBay takes it down. In circles we go! I was told that this case would be escalated, it was not. I was told mutliple times to relist my items without fear of them taking it down. They were taken down. It is hurting my business, my seller reputation, and is losing me a lot of time! Please actually commit to what you say you will do. I have been doing my part. I work very hard on this and my efforts make customers happy. However with this problem, my work gets deleted and I have to start from scratch. Not to mention it makes dealing with customers way harder. I have been with eBay iver a decade. I love everything about it except for this. And this is a big deal. Not just for me but for dozens of other sellers who have the same issue!",2
168,"Good until they began blackmailing me: I loved eBay for over a year. I bought from it frequently and I think it’s a really good service. Problem arrived when I decided I wanted to sell an item. I hadn’t sold anything up till then and according to eBay, my first sold item would have no extra charges and fees to pay to eBay so I would keep everything. ‘Win’ I thought. Eventually my item sold and I forgot all about it. And then I got an email. eBay was requesting almost $100 from me saying I owed them. Never told me what for, but I thought it may be a scam so I removed my automatic card payment from eBay and continued on. Then my account got restricted. I contacted ebays support but they were no help and didn’t even tell me what they were charging me for. I assumed it was their “fee” for selling an item and I tried to explain to them that I shouldn’t need to pay this fee and I couldn’t as I needed to money to fix my car but nothing. I had also purchased an item right before they locked my account and while my payment went through, the item isn’t being shipped because my account is locked so that $40ish is now in limbo and there isn’t anything I can do.",1

I tried looking to see if I can take my card out, didn’t work. Because I never saved my card on eBay for future purchases anyway. I tried buying the 2 items separately, didn’t work. I also checked to see if the items I was buying accepted credit cards and they do. And now people are telling me I have to make a whole new account and use a different card to buy these things.

170,"EBay through the years: I’ve been both a seller and a buyer on eBay for over twenty years and love it. As a buyer there is a great selection of items new and preowned to select from plus you can judge by the sellers feedback rating how reliable they are. Also eBay has a buyer protection program too. 
As a seller eBay has been a great venue to sell almost any new or pre owned item because of the huge audience it reaches and the reliable way eBay gets you paid. The only drawback is that eBay is constantly “upgrading” their seller apps and it seems just as you get used to the change here comes a new change. Especially in the shipping part. And as usual with “ upgrades” they get more complicated. Why can’t they leave what is working well alone!
Other than that eBay’s easy to use and they offer lots of help when you need it. That’s why I’ve stuck with eBay all these years.",5

They said they have been seeing these scams a lot more lately. Meanwhile, I had already started dispute resolution with eBay. Seller only communicated once, after sale, then silence. Only entered tracking after myself filing for dispute. And since tracking said it was delivered, eBay denied any refunds. 
Then I turned to PayPal.  They initially denied my claim, so I called them. They re-opened case and called post office. Long story short, post office told them, what they told me. So they are now refunding me. Thank goodness for PayPal. 
FYI paypal told me most of the dispute claims are automated. So if tracking says delivered around your area, it’s automatically denied. 
And in conclusion, I’m not going through this hassle again. There’s been too many times I’ve had to file a dispute. I have since deleted/deactivated my eBay account.",1
172,"Cannot set filters to a specific brand anymore: I’ve contacted customer service via phone and email and the reply was not a reply I would’ve sent anyone, phone customer service is horrible esp in regards to the app and most of the time I’ve ended up getting someone who sounds like they are immature or offended because I don’t agree with what they tell me and I ask for a supervisor then theirs the whining because I’m not going to sit on the phone and coddle anyone and try to preserve their feelings.  Just because it’s not right smack in their faces when they try to see what’s happening on a computer or using their phone app doesn’t mean it’s not happening for one or more customers.  After almost a month of reporting the issue to them it’s still going on.  When I go to categories, choose something like dresses, then I choose view all because it only lists popular brands on the top and a few sizes, it doesn’t let me choose any specific brand, or any of the other filters that used to be there to narrow things down such as size type length occasion etc.  well I don’t want to scroll through over 400,000 results to find the dresses I’m looking for.",1
173,"Frustrated!: I use the eBay mobile app on a daily basis, and for the most part it works great.  However, recently , it was tweeted and in my opinion it took a few steps backwards.  
Before the most recent update, When I would ship, I could enter the tracking info and the item would disappear from sold tab, and show as shipped.  Now it lingers even after the tracking number is added.  This is fine if your only shipping a thing or two.  But when you ship large quantities, it reeks havoc for the seller.  Trying to weed through all my items needing to be shipped, those that need me to add a tracking number and those that already have a tracking number.  It is very frustrating, to say the least.   Also, I don't need red lettering telling me when I have to ship my items by.  Most of the time its wrong.  Im an adult and I am aware of my responsibilities without you flashing red  words warning I’m late when I’m not.",5
174,Review: As far as eBay goes I love shopping on eBay!! But as a seller it’s hard sometimes because it’s a buyer’s market when it comes to eBay customer service. What I mean by that is eBay does not back the sellers like I wish they did it’s very hard to get them to understand and I hate the fact that everything I have to call eBay to solve A problem more than once I always get different person with a different answer. There’s been many times eBays taken the buyer’s side when they should have clearly taken mine and I have now ship to items to people and they complain about something that I clearly stated in the description and eBay felt the need to refund the buyer every dollar and LET THEM KEEP MY ITEM!!! That’s very aggravating especially when I run a very honest business an I’m willing to go the extra mile to make sure my customers are 1000% happy. Other then there high fees and customer service I really do enjoy eBay. Thanks LEGALSTEALS423 come shop with us!! A Family owned business. We would greatly appreciate your business!,3
175,"The app is good overall, but has a major flaw for sellers: I have been an eBay member since 2009. Often only making purchases here and there. However, lately I have been selling things. Not a lot, but I’ve sold 20 items this month. The app is great for listing items, making offers, and it’s easy to keep track of everything. The issue I have is printing labels once an item is sold. I CANNOT PRINT/PAY FOR A LABEL. It tells me “invalid state” every time and there’s is no address issue. Then when I log on to eBay on my desktop/laptop computer and follow the exact same process it opens PayPal and I can pay for and print/save the label. I have the Paypal app on my phone...the two apps do not work together. Not being able to buy labels via the IOS app makes it to where the app isn’t full circle for sellers. If you make a sell...you HAVE to log on to a desktop to compete the transaction, which is inconvenient. If you do not have a PC or Mac you will not be able to complete the transaction easily. Hopefully they fix this in the near future.",3
176,"First time sellers be ready to wait: I’ve been purchasing on eBay for years. For the first time I’ve decided to list something with eBay. Both items were high dollar and after having some struggles with listing and ebays (in my opinion exorbitant fees). I went to list the first of my two items. 

Upon hitting the list button for my second item I got a notification that a “Seller limit” was exceeded and I would not be able to list my second item until 30 days after my first item sold... I called only to be told the same things by both employee and manager. 

This will be my first and last item listing with eBay and I (among others) will make a concerted effort to use other platforms to sell items. I understand eBay is concerned about fraud and the like but for someone living in the United States and having to input everything but the names of my first born children you’d think they would make a smidge of an effort on the customers behalf. Nope. Not eBay. They got big enough to not give a crap about the people that make them money. Use another platform. There are others.",2
177,"It makes some things easier, others impossible: I’ve been using this app for years. It works great for checking on listings, and doing searches using bar codes for items I might sell. It’s convenient to find a similar item, use the “sell one like this” prompt and upload pictures and do basic listings. There are some details in the listings that are better done on a desktop and often I’ll go back and update later. The one annoying glitch is if I go back into a listing and lower the price and the best offer accept price it generally won’t work. I get a message telling me the offer accept price has to be lower than the buy it now price, which it is, but the program can’t seem to see that. I do wish this would get fixed because it’s been doing this for a very long time. I can’t change the auto accept price in the app. I don’t know what this feature can’t be implemented. Also can’t add shipping discounts.",4
178,"What in the world: I’m a huge fan of how eBay used too be. This is a major concern. Why when I send an offer, I have to set which payment I want to do before I’m allowed to send the offer? Why do I have to pick and select a card so it can automatically pay it if the seller accepts it. Why did it change from the old eBay where I was allowed to send an offer. And I wait for it to get accepted THEN pay with whatever card I choose. This seems very intrusive from eBay. I should have the right to wait for the seller to accept than pick what card I want to use. What’s the point of winning a bid and have the 4 day grace to pay when they don’t allow that on offers anymore. eBay you used too be 5 stars. I find this new change highly disgusting that I’m not allowed to send an offer if I don’t pre pick a card to use as payment. I miss the old eBay. Developers please change it back to how it was a couple of weeks ago. This feels like a massive breach. Please go back so I can give the rating a 5 stars. You were perfect a month ago. This is insanity",2
179,"Love this app - needs improvements: I want to start on a positive note, by saying how much I really appreciate the versatility of this app-to be able to use it on an iPhone revolutionizes the ease of my posting listings eBay. 
Things that need improvement:
1. I can’t utilize my camera in real time to take pictures of items as I want to make listings. I have to go into the camera and take pictures of them on the phone, and then go access my photo library. This is an a critical flaw but it would be nice to have that fixed.
2. I cannot print a label to my Dymo label maker for shipping from this app on my iPhone. I have to go onto my computer to do that, and it would be amazing and the most amazing improvement that the app developers could make.
3. Lately I’ve been having a problem making listings, where the app does not allow me to choose a shipping option via the app. Again I have to go onto my computer to do that and it’s really annoying and slows up my productivity.",4
180,"Beautiful app: On the date of march 30, 2019 I stumbled into this app. And since then I can confidently say my life has been changed for 3 reasons.
          The first reason is the pricing and I mean gosh darn that prices are good! I found an antique grandfather clock for only $100! I looked on other apps like Reddit and Facebook and nothing beats these prices.
          The next reason is the accessibility. For a 76 year old grandmother like me. It’s hard to understand these newfangled devices. But eBay makes it so easy! I can search what I want and it will magically come to my phone screen and I love it! 
          The last reason is the wonderful people on this app. In my previous years I posted some videos to this little app called instagram and people were so mean to me and they called me some very unkind words but on this app people respect me! That is why I love this app so much! Thank you for your time",5
181,"It’s getting there, still some items to improve: Overall the app is reliable and fairly fast.

Here are the items that need some love.

it’s still difficult to find existing support ticket you have open. Trying to find the live chat for eBay help is really difficult.

The seller complaint process via return process does not work. Cannot open a complaint without return, zero follow up except automated return shipment reminders. Needs improvement as you cannot open, track or follow up on seller complaints with eBay.

When you look through your previous purchases and leave feedback, it then scrolls all the way to the top so you have to scroll through all the listing again to find the next one that needs feedback. 

Also filter by “leave feedback” or search within past purchases is a missing feature.

No bulk feedback option, if you buy dozens of the same type of item it is extremely time consuming to leave feedback for each one, especially with the previously mentioned scrolling to the top issue.

You cannot use any banking features to initiate transfers to your account from the app. Have to use a browser to access.

My US account has some remnants of being a UK account for a few years and it’s possible that it affects the parts of the app that don’t work for me.",5
182,"Great app with the best search filters EVER!: I’ve been using the eBay app for many years and love to see the continuous updates and additions. The detailed search filters are so useful! I would only add one suggestion: that when we search by image, we also be able to select *at least* the category, and then limit by color, size, etc. For example, when I upload a photo of the shirt I’m looking for, I get a zillion results of shirts with similar patterns, but the one I’m looking for is blue\L, and I’m seeing a rainbow of colors in all sizes that aren’t actually the same pattern. I know the same shirt exists on eBay, but for some reason the image search isn’t showing me those results first. I scroll through dozens and then hundreds and still don’t find it. Then I crop my photo to show only the pattern, and the search only returns results of fabric swatches or other types of items, and not shirts. eBay, please take this into consideration! Thanks.",4
183,"Half working app with no tech support: I am forced to use this app because I have one hand, and it is much easier to take pictures with. That being said: the UPC scanner only works about 50% of the time, you cannot add a restocking fee for returns (they only added the return option on the app) Why can you not ADD pictures AFTER you receive bids without cancelling the listing! (Charging you, of course! And when you call to have them credit your account 'we have to wait until the invoice finalizes!') You can only leave feedback for one transaction at a time and, it doesn't save favorites, so you either leave the same comment twenty times over or cramp your hand typing. It often gets stuck loading and you have to either back out or reload and pray that your progress was saved, and their online support is largely a user community board!  Still a lot of problems with the app, and their phone support. There was a glitch that caused listings to not get the Top Rated Seller discount, but that’s apparently my fault. I lost out on at least $50! Bring up your tech support to join us!",2
184,Horrible app: They won’t give refunds but give one to the person you’re selling to even though you shipped and they take the money and don’t give back the fee they took so you end up having to pay extra and you pay more money than what you got. You pay the full price that the guy paid even though you didn’t get it all. The people ship a while after you message them to get a refund and won’t answer you. I asked for a refund so I could buy another item from them because I bought the wrong thing and they would’ve made more money because the other thing was more but they shipped and ignored the messages. And they also don’t make the person read descriptions or look at picture so they give their money back and make you pay shipping for a return. When you said no refunds and they got what was pictured and described,5
185,"Good - but could be better: I enjoy this app - I buy a lot of stuff on eBay and spend too many hours scrolling. I do think there are some features that could improve the experience. Most importantly I want to be able to hide listings in my search results I don’t want to see for numerous reasons. Sometimes I have just seen that item before and don’t want to see it again in subsequent searches. Or more importantly, a seller is misrepresenting a listing. If I am searching for a certain item/brand/color/size, etc. - I don’t want to see your listing if that’s not what I’m looking for. I feel like it is spamming my search results and I will never buy that item you are trying to sell even if it is great. Anyway developers - a quick swipe to hide it, or highlight the listing if it has already been viewed. The more time I spend scrolling through junk listings, the less time I spend actually finding what I want therefore buying. This is a win-win for everyone involved.",3
186,"Mis-managed payments hurting sellers: Have used eBay for 20 years and instant payment through PayPal has been the gold standard. Now eBay decided to be their own payment processor, ending their relationship with PayPal. This means instant payments are gone; it takes up to two business days for eBay to process the payment, then up to another four business days to transfer to your bank (over a week total at times).. meanwhile sellers are expected to ship immediately, using their own funds to cover shipping. 

Additionally, eBay now has direct access to your chosen bank account, and in the terms of service may debit your account to cover any fees they feel you haven’t paid, or refund buyers (which eBay has a nasty habit of doing as they haven’t protected sellers in years), which could cause your account to be over drafted.

As these changes are forced on small sellers it will definitely reduce the number of items on the marketplace, replacing the buyer-to-buyer experience with one that’s just the normal big box stores selling at a different place. It’s very hard to recommend selling on eBay now.",1
187,"Terrible Customer Support!!: It took 10 sessions with customer support to finally get to a point where I just gave up trying with them. I tried returning a $34 pair of boots I had purchased as a guest. Because I purchased as a guest, the return email wouldn’t show me the return shipping info. After 5 attempts with customer chat, I finally got a return address. I shipped the item and provided tracking details immediately to an eBay representative in chat. Two days later I got an email from eBay saying they never got the tracking info and wouldn’t be honoring the refund. Now I didn’t have the boots or refund and was out $17 for return shipping. To make matters worse, I just got a call from UPS saying the address provided (by an eBay representative in customer support) was incorrect and they were returned. Now I have to spend another $17 to ship to the correct address, which eBay won’t give me, just to get my return reimbursement and still have paid $34 for something I now don’t even own. eBay won’t even try to help with the situation. Complete waste of time. I won’t be using eBay again, and I strongly recommend others not use it either.",1
188,"Never has the sellers back: Been with eBay since 2006 and my account has always been in good standings. I’ve lost a lot of money due to eBay siding with crooked buyers. Last one was when a buyer return an iPhone I sold him back to me iCloud locked. Because it showed delivered, eBay refunded him and now I have an expensive paperweight. Just a month ago my account was suspended for a week because a buyer was interested in an item and sent me his phone number to call him. I never requested this info nor did I call him but my account was suspended because of the possibility I would complete the transaction outside eBay. As a result of the suspension, I had cars listed which I paid over $200 in fees in which potential buyers could not contact me. The fees were never refunded and my cars only had a day of exposure when the suspension occurred. Then the listings finally ended 6 days later but eBay never made it right to me. I can go on and on about how many times I’ve been burned over the years with eBay and how much money they made off me but that’s for another time and place but what I mentioned earlier is what happened within the past month.",1
189,"Fair but sloppy.: I have enjoyed using this app, as the benefit of mobility is of great importance to me. Keeping the last two out of five stars out for this app is because of two important features being askew.
 First the worse of the two. The app hangs up and has to be quit out of and reloaded, very frustrating and time consuming when trying to list from a mobile device. Causes some anxiety when describing an item and you have to restart it right in the middle of it. Somewhat frustrating when doing searches and research. 
 The other failure the app has is a rather common problem regarding desktop (classic) view. While there has been some improvements made, selecting a desktop view within the app is inconsistent at best. You load up the classic and after usually navigating one time the app takes you back to its default view. 
These are tolerable to a degree but still the app isn't always as consistent as I would expect from such a large and profitable company. 
Just the input from Enchanted Attic. Thanks for looking.",3
190,"Exorbitant fees and poor customer service: I’ve been an eBay buyer and seller since 2002. The app has made some good and bad changes, but doesn’t come close to a streamlined experience as a web browser. 5% was a decent listing fee. Now they want 10% of everything, including 10% of your shipping costs. I lost a case on a $1500 record player I bought, when the item was clearly not as described. I accepted a return on a $3500 piece of audio equipment, even though the item was as described, and was scammed by eBay out of my selling fees, even though the eBay rep told me I would get them back, and other eBay reps confirmed those notes. eBay promotes eBay bucks, but doesn’t notify you that they are available until one week before they expire. Ten years ago, if you called in they would grant them back for 30 days. Now the customer rep tells you they will call back and never does. eBay puts profit before their customers, both buyers and sellers. Now it’s 2021, and eBay requires permission debit your checking account to get paid as a seller. eBay is about as scummy corporate as you can get.",1
191,"DagNabbitRabbitᎣ 🐰 Sprint IPhone X: I Love Ebay‼️. If you follow a few practical proven methods of careful reviews of your seller, the person whom is listing the product that you have found so irresistible and just can’t wait to plunk down your PayPal ID on——you will have a very positive experience. 
  1)Read their FeedBack
 2) look at many, many other sellers descriptions and prices first. 
3) look at all their pictures carefully. 
 4) ask questions.  Don’t be afraid that you’ll sound dumb or silly.  There is nothing worse than paying good money for an item only to find out later that what you thought you bought was somehow different than what actually came in the mail. 
5) And most importantly if you happen to receive an item that is not up to par, Please, please, give the seller a chance to rectify the problem. 
 No one wins when a new Ebay user posts a nasty Negative Feedback that is unwarranted.  
  Most Ebay sellers will be very happy to accept a return and post a refund or another item.  
 But always read the return policy before you hit that Buy it Now, or Bid button 
  I have been a very happy Ebay camper since Ebay first began and have enjoyed well over 98% Positive results.  
  Can anyone say that for purchases they’ve made at any brick and mortar stores in the past 19 years 
  Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved 🐰",5
192,eBay is full of scams and they welcome it.: I been using eBay since 2011 and started good Since then it has all been down hill. First as a seller they will quote you on a price of shipping but then when it comes time to ship the price is 500% more. For example my items get shipped as first class letter.  eBay tells me before listing of the auction I can ship for .55 with their discount but when it came time to ship they tell me it’s $2.84.  eBay customer service is the worst I’ve ever dealt with. They have no idea how the US post office works and they fed me every excuse in the book.  They told me that “ I should have known”.  Can’t call their corporate office either cause you need an ext# or you get hung up on. Another quick on is   I turned off auto realist and of course realist anyways and I got charged for all of them. Oo and when eBay says call back and we will give you a credit make sure you have that in writing cause if you don’t and you do call back they will tell you no cause you don’t have that in writing.  That’s just 2 and there are dozens of scams on this website I just don’t have the time to write them all on this review.,1
193,"Unable to purchase item from the app: I’m not much of a reviewer for things like this so I’ll keep it short-ish. I haven’t used eBay for long like some of these veterans or other long time users. And I don’t really have any complaints other than this one. So for whatever reason I can’t buy something while on your app. Which is strange cause coming from Samsung I was able to use it no problem. But now coming into Apple again I’m now unable to? I don’t know if this on the company’s part or Apple’s part but this seems like an inconvenience to an extent. Cause if I try to buy using the app it tells me to go the website and add it to my watch list. That wasn’t a requirement before so.... not sure what that’s all about. 

If this could be fixed or something that would be great. As I don’t want to go to the site and try to buy something I was just looking at only for it to take me back to the app and present me with the same message. When I did as it asked.",4
194,"Please consider.: I’ve been with EBAY for a while, as we all know many got hoy deals are found here all the time, however lately and with much frequency seems as if EBAY may be loosing many deals and buisness due to many other platforms that are coming up with the same buy and sell trend MO. As we may anticipate as with many start ups the service at first and for a while and until it becomes strongly popular the service is offered free, where as afterwards once highly popular fees start being charged,  I know some people try to wave selling transactions over EBAY due to fees  which indirectly and directly affects buyers since the deals are no longer poste in eBay but instead with other platforms leaving many pros and cons to deal with afterwards.    E-bay. I’am sure you guys re but is there a way for you guys to work on buyers/sellers retention and more incentives to bring back to eBay the good deals.",5
195,"CUSTOMERS REQUEST INVOICE: I have been selling on eBay for over 2 years now and business has really picked up and I am happy about that, one thing that frustrates me almost daily lately is when customers want to purchase more than one item, I am ALWAYS willing to combine shipping. I tell them to place items in cart and request an invoice and customers tell me that it is not an option so I tested it myself and they were correct! On a computer you can put multiple items in your cart and request an invoice, but on a smart phone using the app it clearly is NOT AN OPTION. Very very frustrating for myself and customers and I know for a fact I lost out on what would have been nice potential Sales because of this and I truly wish ebay would update their app and make this an option for them. Please let me know if ebay will make this available in their app so I can advise my customers.

196,"Thanks EBay!: I have been a seller and buyer of products on EBay for almost 2 decades. The experience is five stars solid. I’m sure that I’ve made hundreds of transactions. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve had an issue with a seller (usually new at it). Every time EBay has stepped in and resolved the problem to my satisfaction. 
EBay is a source of instant gratification. You can find anything, no matter how old or brand new. Think of any random toy from your childhood, for example. You WILL find it on EBay. 
Sellers strive for the highest rating, meaning once the transaction is complete, they move very quickly to ship. Read the fine lines, though, and where your purchase is coming from. Some things are from overseas, and will take time. 
EBay is absolutely a healthy obsession. With high standards set in place, there is practically never a bad experience.",5
197,"Great Ap but please I have a suggestion.: EBay can you please read and consider this.  I don’t know another platform to make the suggestion. This is for Sellers after we list an  item, y’all are making us answer 2 additional questions trying to upsell. I understand the importance of promoting our listings but after we listed the item we don’t need to be asked do we want to promote this item and do we want to do easy pricing can you please stop making us answer these questions after we list every single item. I know all about these new futures and we have an opportunity to already do it during the listing and you can ask is once or twice but it’s after every single listing.  We  know you are trying to increase sales but it adds a lot of extra button pushing After we’ve already spent 10 minutes listing the items we could’ve selected it then. Please make this change, no reason to ask us after every single item.",4
198,"DO NOT USE AS A SELLER: I’d give it 0 stars if I could. The entire interface is extremely difficult to navigate. It’s not intuitive or user-friendly AT ALL. The messaging component is one of the worst I’ve seen in an app. It make NO SENSE as to why the messaging is so confusing. I do not understand why they can make the messaging look like a text conversation where all the messages are in one page. But instead eBay decides to make the most confusing lay out ever. This has led to multiple mistakes because I couldn’t see which user ordered what and what specific requests they had. I ended up having to write everything down in a notebook because I couldn’t not keep track of anything through eBay. Their entire app looks like it is still from the late 2000s early 2010s. I mean come on, it’s 2020! This is the worst app for selling and has caused many emotional breakdowns because of how bad the service was and how bad I felt for my customers. I will never ever recommend this company to anyone looking to start a business or a side hustle because it’s just ridiculous how confusing and hard it is to navigate or understand anything.",1
199,"Did someone get fired from DMV and make eBay website?: In general, eBays interface on this app and the website feels worse than the DMV website, it’s like it was designed by people who didn’t make it in government... functionality is different everywhere, different ways to access similar features described in different ways. Sellers have different items on different pages. Seller fees are not clearly explained anywhere and are non existent on the app. If you only use the app you would have no idea how much you are being charged. Different selling features unavailable in app. I have 24 items listed on my seller dashboard but only 11 show up on my storefront. Why do you have to type in sales tax state by state yourself? Shouldn’t eBay just have that information for you so you don’t have to research it as a seller paying $27 a month for basic selling account? The eBay model is getting outdated anyway, it encourages career selling of poor quality goods but they miss out on all the value of casual sellers. They need to rethink a lot, maybe hire new people. Everything looks the same as it did when I was in high school during Y2K",1

The ease of making in account and becoming a seller and it does not cost me a single dollar to sign up or sell or even ship it all comes from the available funds. I would highly recommend that if you have been hesitant it is now time to give it a try! The customer service team is highly knowledgeable and some of the best customer service representatives I've ever dealt with in my life. eBay is truly an incredible company creating opportunity for all of us. thank you eBay!

201,"I love eBay BUT: I’m a seller on eBay, and I really enjoy this hussle. There are many things that eBay can do to the EBay smartphone app. For one, there should be a “ship by x/x/x” this is available on the desktop website but as a busy seller who’s always on the go it would be much more convenient if I can just see everything from my eBay app. Also, there is this huge bug that drives me crazy and causes me to lose ink. If you sell a unit and the weight is placed over 1lb in the listing (and it isn’t actually 1lb, this happen when you list as sell one just like this so previous seller placed it) anyway if this is the case eBay won’t let you print a First class label in bulk shipping. You have to print the label individually and you waste one side of adhesive label because it prints the directions. I hate this the most. I list a good amount so I can’t go back to every ad and Change the weight to 15 ounces it makes no sense last year eBay didn’t have this problem it’s weird",4

I have an excellent camera on my phone and editing app to take some great pictures. But seems eBay updated their app I can take them right from the listing. It’s also easier to fill in itemSpecifics, like color, model year, series etc. I sell mostly die cast and there’s a lot of details for each car to fill out if you don’t find a completed listings. I only wish they would change updating how you enter prices, how much to list it for, if you’ll except offers and what a mini price is, and shipping. All the ways to enter a price are different. If those could be the same input system that would be awesome. Oh and being able to access your templets for a listening world be cool to.

My experience with other companies have NOT been as good as with eBay. Also by paying with PayPal I can sleep at night knowing is secure to pay my purchases on eBay. Also the insurance provided by eBay for my purchase satisfaction is a excellent  benefit and peace of mind. Every single purchase made have been accurate on the price given for shipping and taxes, never an “extra charge”, adjustment or “error” on any of my orders. Thanks! Keep up the good work eBay! 👍🏻",5
204,Account suspension: They suspended my account twice. No warning at all. The reason for my first suspension was not anywhere on the articles so the articles don’t help at all. I was able to talk to an agent on call but it took a while because the call never went thru even while changing my call settings. After shipping an item I got suspended again. Tried to have eBay call me but it never showed up as an option again. Don’t know why if I was able to get a call first time? Articles still no help. They listed things that don’t apply to me. Sending an email does nothing except give me the same message as when my account was first suspended. After a while I was logged out and was only able to see my account thru online website. I’m still not able to get my account reinstated. I can’t get my $27 and this is my first and only sale. I just signed up in June. Unless I know the reason I’d say they ban you for no reason. I don’t care that I’m banned anymore I just want my money. Fix your customer service please.,2
205,"Authenticity Guarantee is Awful!!!: I listed a pair of sneakers that sold and I shipped out without worries of them passing the authenticity guarantee checkpoint. A few days later i received an email that they did not pass inspection for “not matching the description” when they do perfectly match the description except the fact i listed them as “new with defects” and because i tried them on once eBay wants them listed as used. Instead of contacting the buyer and asking if this was okay with them that they have VERY minor wear and are in perfect condition, they refunded the buyer and sent them back to me and now i am out a sale which i needed the money from. eBay should implement contacting the buyer with what they issues they found were and asking the buyer if they would like to proceed with the sale as I’m sure my buyer would have chosen to proceed being that they matched the description i wrote when they bought the shoe perfectly and i disclosed i had worn them once. I now have to go through the process of re-listing with eBay’s “correct” description and hoping they get purchased again.",1
206,"Disappointing: There are certain frustrations with the app, such as displaying new results for saved searches, that do not save my preferences and I have to constantly select it. I have been frustrated with how difficult it is to find a way to contact their customer service! Also, as a loyal eBay customer, I am extremely disappointed with a recent experience with both a seller and with eBay itself. After receiving a faulty product and attempting to contact the seller first more than once with zero reply, I finally reached out to eBay’s customer service. I spoke with four different representatives at different times, three of which informed me I would be receiving a refund from eBay - still never happened and never even got an email from them like I was informed I would. Ultimately, as it was past 30 days, I never was able to receive any type of refund or reply from the seller and couldn’t even leave a negative review at that point. Unbelievable. Sellers are protected and don’t need to be held true, and nothing at all was done as compensation to me. Total waste of money.",1
207,"Home of the Scammers: I’m a full time reseller on many different apps and tried eBay for the first time. After listing just a few items I was immediately scammed in the first 5 minutes. Every single item was “bought” for full price, but for some reason eBay makes it an option to not pay up front. So of course I received message after message asking for more details to be texted or emailed outside of eBay, the typical scammer crap. I sent a help request to eBay and received no answer at all. I had to wait the four days to cancel the orders since they didn’t pay, then I relisted each item and once again, the same thing happened. Instantly. Full price sales. No payment. I couldn’t find any option to require immediate payment, after searching on the app as well as the computer. It’s wasted my time as well as stole the opportunity for my items to be sold by a real, interested person. There should be no option for people to buy things without paying, sellers need more protection. I’m never using eBay for anything again, what a waste of time.",1
208,"A long time sellers thoughts: I’ve been selling on eBay for 21 years. I am dedicated and I’m sure I’ve made a great deal of money for eBay. My gripe is that there are customers that manipulate the system and wear clothing or shoes, destroying them and then wanting a free return. eBay is 100% okay with customers doing this. A customer will make demands and 9 out of 10 times eBay sides with the customer. As a seller I do not matter much to them. Most customers are good but some cost sellers like me $$$. They will destroy a high dollar pair of shoes, lie and say they came that way and demand that I pay for them to ship them back. I am out all my money plus the cost to ship them back plus the shoes are ruined and have to be thrown away. I recommend trying other options besides eBay. See what else is out there if you want to sell items. Maybe find a company that backs trustworthy sellers.",5
209,"eBay app for iPhone 6 Plus: Awful!!!! Makes me want to hit my phone with a hammer to knock some sense into it. Look at the eBay app for Galaxy 5S - it's high contrast!!!! -  yet our app is well - GREY ON GREY! LISTING ITEMS ON MY NEW GIANT iPhone 6 Plus IS MAKING ME BLIND!!!! While on the Galaxy 5S when you start to type your description you get a nice high contrast blue background , but here it's grey on grey! AND WE CAN'T ZOOM FOR TAKING PHOTOS!!! And why do I have to click one button just so that I can click another just so that I can see completed listings! Everybody wants to see completed listings. Make it a primary function for crying out loud! Not a hidden one! I really think someone needs to be fired - or maybe a whole group of people need to be fired for creating this abominable eBay app for IPhone !!!!! BOLD ITALIC AND UNDERLINE features stay on or stay off depending on the apps whims. Doesn’t anyone test the app? It’s ridiculous",5
210,"Decent but many issues: While I love the many capabilities of the eBay app it isn’t without its many problems.  For instance, on one hand it it is generally more responsive than the website especially for live bid updates.  That said, numerous times while simply waiting for an auction countdown and last minute bidding the App will under the covers change your bid amount to more than you enter if max bid increases while you are entering your amount.  So, you get confirmation and enter desired amount but actual amount could be much higher than you desired on the server under the covers. Also, the app has shown numerous times that I won an item while viewing a bid auction and even sends a notification despite having lost to a last second bid.  Similarly, I have also received lost bid notifications when I actually won but with an unsolicited last second bid I did not place with my phone locked letting my legitimate max bid ride. This has happened multiple times in the last few months.",3
211,"Freedom on the use of credit cards on : “ make an offer “ or bids: My opinion is that before you charge a credit card when I’m in the middle of a “ make an offer “ or a bid, if or when I win the bid, that, you should ask or find a way to ask me which method of payment is “ok” to purchase other then having the freedom to charge cause I might have other methods of paying and not want to use the regular way which I’ve been paying, for example I have gift cards to use which I can still use but for some reason EBay jumps the gun and a charge is already in place and I’m left with a gift card I could’ve used instead of paying regular credit card, I hope someone is reading this in the hopes that some thing should be done to contain certain freedoms that EBay is trying to establish which sounds like a catch 22 to me, thanks.",5
212,"Ebay app updates: This is the worst update in last 10 years!!!! 
Try waiting for next update you DO NOT WANT this one if you’re a seller! When relisting duration choice comes up only about 25% of the time so need to back out and go back in. Taking me 3 to 5 attempts to relist exact same item. It also defaults to accepting offers and starts off with 50% as the default. This is NOT RELISTING the same item might as well just sell similar item as both take much longer to list anything. I see sellers going through this and buyers complaining about cancelled orders due to sellers listing too cheap then not honoring the sales due to Ebay! mistakes not the seller themselves. Ebay is pitting buyers against sellers and vise versa surely affecting sellers ratings. ALSO, on the sellers for selling items the ending times only show minutes and seconds when there could be days left!!!! Again, worst update in 10 years!!!! (EBAY) PLEASE REVISE THIS UPDATE ASAP!!!!!

213,"Terrible Customer Service - Complete Lack of Customer Centricity: I’ve used eBay for years. Each time I sold a product, I received 100% positive feedback. I never had to go through eBay for anything because I had no issues. Then I sold a pair of headphones that were in perfectly working condition. After having them for 3 WEEKS, the buyer said they wouldn’t charge and requested a refund. I contested the refund because I knew the headphones were in perfect condition. eBay support told me this was no big deal and to just request proof of a faulty product from the buyer. The buyer never provided proof and they STILL sided with the buyer. Here I am now, 4 months later, and I still haven’t received the headphones back. The money has been returned and I don’t have a product. Where I’m from, that’s called theft. I called eBay to resolve this issue and spoke with Justin. He showed no remorse and told me there was nothing eBay could do to correct the issue. I’ve deleted the app, I will no longer use eBay, and I will only do business with providers who value their customers. There is no place for this sort of lack of customer centricity in 2017.",1
214,"Beware selling now: I sell items I no longer use on eBay. I only sell items a few times a year.  I have a 14 day return policy set for my items to prevent people from damaging items and then trying to return it since I’m not a general retailer with margin for loss. I recently sold a wheel on eBay that I had verified by a local shop was in good condition and had some visible scuffs. The buyer took over 30 days to later file a claim that the wheel was damaged. That was outside my return window, but eBay did not allow me any option to deny the claim despite the policy on my listing. eBay apparently overrides that policy with their own policy of allowing returns for any reason. It’s now very dangerous as a small seller to sell on eBay and risk being out money for shipping, return shipping or losing the item. I would not use EBay any longer as a small seller.",5
215,"Authoritative cooperate app: Had started a new eBay account for my small business, selling things on eBay. After a week of it doing better than I could have guessed, eBay bans my account due to “suspicious activity”. So I call up try to get some answers on why it would be deemed that and they won’t answer a single question. Just keep referring to an email stating it was suspicious activity. Then proceed to HANG UP 3 times in a row. No explaining, no listening to me, no reasoning. My advice to anyone would be , don’t rely solely on this app for online sells because at any moment,  because you’re doing well in sells, or perhaps no reason at all, they will permanently ban your account with no explanation. And the fact customer service can just hang up at their will is quite literally mind blowing. Not once was I getting rude or vulgar, I simply just wanted an explanation as to why my account was suspicious. eBay isn’t safe from failure, with customer service like that and banning accounts unjustified, it only takes one other major player to come in and eBay will be a thing of the past.",1
216,"Nonexistent customer service, monopolistic fees: eBay is a terrible company that abuses its sellers in every way. The entire business model revolves around siding with buyers consistently in any issue. The standards they hold sellers to can be changed anytime and they can charge new fees anytime for things like mentioning contact information, telling people the name of your website. If you don’t meet their “top seller standArds” on the 20th of every month they charge an additional 5%. Their fees are almost 20% off of every trading card purchase once every fee is said and done. They absolutely destroy small businesses and their customer service is HORRRIBLE. I have found that I cannot contact anyone from eBay in any way unless I tag the company on Twitter and start talking about my problems. They LITERALLY eliminated their customer service lines, increased their fees, and hired a Twitter damage control team instead. Watch how an eBay employee will likely find time to reply to this comment and find out what my issue is but you cannot reach them in any way if you have a legitimate customer service issue.",1
217,Horrible customer service: I have been using eBay for many years and didn’t have anything bad to say until now so let’s get into it I ordered a couple car parts at the exact same time one particular seller waited days to ship the item. I contacted them to address my concerns could not even get a response until I posted seller feedback the lack of customer service from the seller is outright disgraceful. Keep in mind the other parts have already arrived before this even ships. Their justification for having the slowest shipping in the world is it’s coming from china well so does a lot of other things I order online yet it doesn’t take a month and it doesn’t sit there a week before they proceed with shipping. eBay should be ashamed of themselves for how they allow these type of sellers to use this platform and to make it even worse they purposely have no way to contact them directly you can get on the app and wait for a robot to say they can’t help and that you can not cancel the item. I’d love to hear eBay’s feedback to this review that is 100% accurate.,1
218,"App can be Manipulated IMHO: When using a cell device go to eBay by way of google.  
I was looking for Postal by image comics and tried several attempts but found only 2-sales. When I went there using google I found 20-sales or more. When you’re on your computer you don’t use an app which is why I find more of what I’m looking for.  Also, try googling the item or comic book your looking for if you can’t find it using the eBay search bar. The search bar can be manipulated. I remember when Fidget spinners came out. I’d be looking for men’s socks but I’d also see a few Fidget spinners before I got to the socks. 
Example: type eBay into google search bar. Then click on eBay dot com. Do your searches that way if your not finding what your looking for. 
Example #2: type the item your looking for into google & chances are there’s a few on eBay.",5
219,"Unfortunate Policy changes: Overall, this is a good app if you love eBay. However they underwent some policy changes that USED to protect buyers. I buy and sell on here, but ever since they changed to only 3 days for protection on items you buy, this has been a huge issue where I travel a lot for work. So when an item landed and I was away for business, when I returned and viewed the item only to find out it was heavily damaged and not the exact item that was pictured, the seller of course denied all this, rejecting my return, and when I asked eBay to step  in, because it was “day4” and not within the 3 days (mind you it was a Sunday so not even business days) they said there was nothing they could do. 

Be very careful when buying on here. I’ll be using alternative sites such as mercai, offer up, ebids etc moving forward. Happy this was not a big dollar purchase and that I can warn others before it’s too late!! 

eBay, you need to make appropriate, realistic changes to protect BOTH sellers and buyers. This is a bit unrealistic and unreasonable especially given the circumstances.",1

221,"Encounter a fraud, they won’t help!: Do not use eBay! I barely write reviews but this one is serious. If you are reading this review, please remember my advice, do not use eBay. I was a long time eBay user before today. Even though some of their rules and the high selling fee , I still used their service. I’ve earned my perfect 100% feedback through my account history with my quick payment on my buying account and perfect service on my selling account. But recently, I’ve encountered a fraudulent while selling something on their platform for only 60+ dollars. The buyer damaged the item and wanted me to partial refund them. How ridiculous is that! I immediately reported the issue with eBay, and no one responses my problem until the third email I sent to them which is about 5 days later. On the same day, the buyer opened a case against me on eBay, and guess what? Ebay made a final decision in a few minutes in the buyer’s favor? Is that crazy? They won’t respond to multiple messages from me but willing to support a fraud!!! So if you’re a honest person like me, do not use eBay. They will just rip you off!",1
222,"What did you do to this app???: Worst. Update. Ever!  I don’t know what you did about 2 mo ago (and I can’t pinpoint it because your update descriptions all read the SAME thing), but I save searches as I collect certain pieces, so want to be assured I don’t miss a new listing. These worked fine until about a month ago, now not working correctly. I go to my saved searches and it will have a number to the right of what is supposed to be newly listed items, only to find the message “no results found for x-item”, and then a list of results matching fewer words. I don’t mind the suggested items when I’m actually searching for something, but STOP WASTING MY TIME telling me I have saved search matches when I don’t!!!  Also watched items sometimes remove themselves after I’ve viewed them without me tapping the heart to remove them. I did not accidentally do this, it’s been happening ALOT the past two weeks or so. Thankfully you have “recently viewed” as an option so I can get them added back into my watch list, but again, this is WASTING MY TIME. Fix these things please!!!",1
223,"Scam and fraud: I liked to say that the bad out-ways the good I say this because the amount of people that can just open a claim for a bogus return is crazy and their nothing that can be done because eBay will always take buyer side if you are trying to sell your used or new items I recommend going to other apps because eBay doesn’t really care about the seller who sell on their platform I say this because once you sold a item you have to wait 2-3 and then for the money to hit your account you have to wait a week or we’ll over four days and you have to wait a few extra days for the buyer to be happy and satisfied because once they open the claim your earnings will be on hold until the issue gets resolved and in the end you end up waiting time taking the return and resisting it I wish I knew about this before I started to sell on this app because in the end eBay end up taking half of your profit every time you sell well as in other apps they barely take any money for
 Your sale or like a reasonable amount but eBay fees” are crazy",1
224,"Seller ratings to a specific item: I almost rated 3 stars but the eBay guarantee refund program is without a doubt, fair and efficient. Seller customer satisfaction ratings are very important to my purchase choices. However, I want too see feedback as it relates to the item I’m looking to buy. Example: I’m searching for a certain coffee maker and look at feedback ratings/comments for the seller of that item.  I’d like to be able to see the feedback ratings as it pertains to that particular item. I hate having to scroll and scroll through everything that seller has sold, often times many hundreds, to see a rating and comment for a specific item only. Can that be configured to make that possible? Also, why do sellers with hundreds of negative feedback ratings allowed to remain on eBay as a seller? Especially if th complaint is “I never received item”, “seller won’t respond”.",4
225,"Sellers Beware of Hidden Fees: I’ll be ending my years with eBay due to the fact that their selling fees are excessive and not made clear when you’re listing an item. A $6 listing fee is made very clear, but sellers beware because even though that’s all that it says, it’s most definitely not all they hit you with. I’ll be paying the part they pointed out to me as I was listing my couple of items, but I won’t be paying the hidden charges, so bye eBay. Dirty business. 
Buyers beware too- many chine knock offs and fakes as well as straight up scammers making accounts, selling a lot of cheap stuff to build up their reviews, then listing something VERY expensive that they are not even in possession of. EBay doesn't do anything about the reports of this. The scam listings stay up, even with proof that it is in fact a scam. EBay just doesn’t care about its buyers or sellers. They don’t care that Chinese scam artists are rampant there, and they do not protect us by removing listings that have been flagged for it. 
Be very careful when using this app. 
Or skip it all together and try out Mercari. Thts where I’m taking my buying and selling.",1
226,"Searching Problems!: I've been with eBay since the last millennia and have enjoyed access to many of the items available on the website. But the Search parameters have never approached IDEAL. SEARCHING still need to be more discriminating in the search criteria as well as identifying ENDED auctions as being SOLD or just timed out. I have made these concerns known via phone to eBay's tech-support but none have been addressed either on the website or in this app. This app exacerbates some of these problems by not clearly identify whether the ""ended"" auction was ""sold"" or that the time ran out. And now I can't even access that ended items in this app as it appears on their website. I understand growing pains, with these pains have nothing to do with growing, they’re just ignoring us, or they don’t care.
If an item ENDED, it can/might be relisted. If it’s SOLD, I should search for another and clear up my watch list. The app doesn’t help with this AT ALL! So, I’m forced to open a browser and verify if the item sold, or not. It too much work, and lazy programming on eBays part.",1
227,"Do not sell on ebay.: I have been with ebay for many years. I am meticulous with my shipping and items I sell. Yet, buyers love to buy and return items. When a buyer requests a refund, you cannot have ebay step in, even if you do not accept refunds, they will absolutely make you refund your item. They will take the money straight out of your paypal to do so. Sellers have to pay for their shipping back from the buyer to them, and accept any damages the buyer or shipping has had on your item. I am only on ebay still because my car is broken and I need the money really bad, and this is what I have to deal with. As soon as I have what I need I will be done with ebay, and I am sure that is how other sellers feel too. It is completely unfair to sellers. They take 10 percent out of what we make from sales, and their shipping rates aren’t always accurate and sometimes sellers end up paying out of pocket just for a label, let alone packing materials that can be very costly. Overall, use ebay only if you are buying. I have had too many headaches from dealing with ebays money back guarantee on behalf of the seller.",1

It doesn't seem to adjust for iPads. 4) After each look at a Saved search, you need to tap on the tiny gray arrow in the top left corner rather than in previous version you just tap on Search box and your list pops up for you to select next Favorite search. 5) that tiny gray arrow is so far left that if you have a iPad cover, you may have to push the iPad itself in further to tap the arrow.

Of course you can’t speak to anybody in charge of any thing at ebay. eBay acknowledged that the buyer received the item but that they reviewed my claim and that the decision they had come to was right and the case was closed.

233,"WORST WAY TO SELL: I recently sold some Pokémon cards on ebay and they arrived to the buyer who was great and he left positive feedback. I went to withdraw the funds and there was a hold on the funds which is already stupid because the buyer already left good feedback. After that, my account was restricted for NO REASON and it says I can’t access payouts until I verify details. I call the useless customer service who just tell me info I already know and are no help at all. Turns out ebay probably thinks my item is stolen because they are asking for receipts along with verifying details from when I bought the cards but I don’t have any as I opened them from many different packs that I purchased in store with cash over the years. For a site the claims to be a great marketplace for trading cards they really don’t know their stuff otherwise they would realize I would have to give them hundreds of receipts for the cards I bought.

234,"what a joke: Using eBay for almost 20 years:  

1.)  I am sick of seeing “sponsored” listings — totally irrelevant to my search — show up first.  (Btw I will NEVER buy a “sponsored” item.)  
 
2.)  If you don’t pay extra, your listing is low in search results — even if search terms are verbatim.  

3.)  How can I have 10+ “watching” an item with absolutely no “views”???  

4.)  Fees keep creeping up.  But only decreases in the app and services. 

5.)  Have a problem?  See an error?  Don’t depend on eBay to care or try to correct it.  Oh but you can go to the “community” to seek help.  But usually, those members are just as frustrated. 

6.)  Fake items are rampant.  But my completely legitimate item (purchased myself in Heidelberg, Germany) was not only ended but completely deleted so I lost pics and description (and told not to relist).  

7.)  Fake items are RAMPANT — so true it bears repeating.  eBay does NOTHING.  I’ve reported fakes.  I’ve watched.  Nothing.  

8.)  The apps — for iPhone and iPad — have so many errors and glitches.  I keep thinking/assuming/hoping they will be updated/corrected.  Instead, there just seem to be more.  

All this and much more — but I’ve wasted enough time.  And eBay definitely does not value your time.

236,"Sellers beware! Zero Seller protection: I sold an espresso machine on eBay that normally retails for over $600 that was brand new. The buyer was too dumb to read a manual and properly use the machine and decided to file a damage claim.

I have to pay for the shipping for item shipped to her and the return which is $60. I am now out the money for shipping and have used item. At least on the Mercari selling app they pay for the shipping for returns when they approve it. Do not use eBay unless you want to be penalized for dumb people’s lack of knowledge of using a product. When asked if I can prove the item was not damaged as the buyer claimed, what are the consequences of the buyer eBay just replied that they will limit the amount of things that they can buy. They will not refund your money lost on shipping or the use of your item. The buyer is NOT held accountable for a false claim. I am deleting all of my listing on eBay and selling only on Facebook from now on. eBay is a joke.",1
237,"eBay literally saves my life: Hi my name is Joe Popeko, and I am disabled it’s extremely hard for me to move my legs, arms, and my hands barely work. I can’t afford the prescriptions that literally save my life. eBay allows me to sell my stuff and things that my brother buys for me at thrift stores, yard sales etc. which means I am able to turn $5 into $10 and so forth. This allows me to afford my prescriptions. So I thank you eBay very very much. I am a born again Christian so I try to be as honest as I can on my posts, but also I bring up being born again, to tell eBay that they are in my prayers for the service they allow me to partake in. Again eBay thank you so much, I can’t express my appreciation. I Joe Popeko promise that ebay, and the fine folks that purchase from me will be in my prayers until the end of my days.

With appreciation and love

238,"App review: Overall my experience with eBay has been good but there are some things that need improvement. eBay somehow needs to verify that items for sale are actually available and in seller’s possession especially with new sellers and low quantity items. It also needs to very that the shipping address matches with buyer’s data before it accepts the tracking number to avoid scammers. (Ea.
Request a photo from seller with the shipping label and package after they processed at the postal service and let the computer do the address verification) 
My recent experience was not so pleasant for that reason. Seller sent a letter instead of the item but was dumb enough to leave my email address on the tracking system for FedEx so when I received the shipment photo from FedEx, I could tell it was not my house and I could also tell it was not the item due to the size of the package.",4
239,"Riddled with Scammers: As a buyer, the app works great. As a seller of items higher than $100, it’s awful. I have been trying to sell a $500+ item for a few weeks now. It “sold” about 8 times so far, some through bidding and some through accepted offers. The winning bidder has not once paid or responded to my messages, forcing me to relist the item. I have received many good offers, but when I accept them, the buyer messages saying something like “thank you for your lovely item please love text me at xxx-xxx-xxxx so we work out a payment thank you” then proceed to try to get me to pay outside of eBay, again forcing me to relist the item. It’s exhausting. 

eBay: Make it super easy to report buyers. I can’t find a way to report a buyer besides emailing eBay directly. Also, when reposting the item, add “that buyer is a scammer” to one of the three options. And please crack down on scammers. Especially new accounts with 0 reviews. I can’t stop them from bidding on my items, delegitimizing the auction.",2
240,"Ann C: I love eBay, great prices, easy ordering, and selling.  I love to bid on things and if I get it cheap that’s even better!! There’s a couple things I’d fix. eBay needs a website where customer can go and type what ms the problem and have Virtual assistant bc my questions aren’t found on ask the community..also shipping is taking too long on a lot of items. 
I’ve heard there’s a program that offers customers rewards, on there purchases but I’ve never seen it or heard about until recently. I don’t think you should have to have a eBay credit card anyone should be able to get it. 
When I sell my product on eBay they say to down load and print shipping label. My area will not do that. However eBay on most direct ship 3 days is 8 at USPS BUT eBay wanting 8.50 and tell me on saving on shipping but I’m not.
Also start a sampling program. Or testers. Give us something",5
241,"Recent updates have make the app worse: I have been using this app for years, always on iPads, and it always works as perfectly as it is supposed to.  I also always have the newest iPad.  Well, when the app switched to the new viewing style for active listings, it now lags SIGNIFICANTLY when you scroll to the bottom of your listings (I only have 125 listed items, not a lot), and then the app tends to crash, as well. This was not happening before the new listing view, and it is still happening even on the 2018 iPad Pro, something that can more than handle an app like eBay.  I honestly wish we could still use the previous iteration of the app, it was way better, but since we are stuck with this version, at least fix the bugs with it.  My app should not be slowing down and crashing just because I am scrolling to the bottom of my listings.",5
242,"Purchase history glitch: I know Ebay is constantly trying to make the app better, however whom ever thought it’d be a good idea to put years of purchase history chronological or otherwise should be relieved of their position. It’s an absolute hot mess and it interferes with current items not yet delivered.
In short EBAY IF IT AIN’T BROKE STOP MEDDLING, TRYING TO FIX IT, IT WORKED FINE BEFORE!! 1.) If you want to fix something work on being more fair to SELLERS who are at the mercy of dishonest BUYERS. Stop automatically siding with them.2.) Be more diligent about removing reported counterfeit coins being sold on eBay from zero to no feedback burner accounts. I.E. 1944 Steel wheat pennies. These people buy from China then sell on eBay with impunity. Thanks for your time.
Now for many users it is utter chaos, if I want to see years of purchases I’ll either open in traditional format or use my home computer. Fix this problem ASAP.",5
243,"Great app, great place to buy and sell: I wish all the sellers were as easy to work with, as effective and clear as the application is…lol.  Ebay has been providing great, fair services and an easy to use application…. They also do a better job of managing suppliers/sellers of products than Facebook and and many buy direct websites.  I appreciate that part above all else as when the auction closes, the auction item FREEZES…and if a seller isn’t honest, the auction listing and all of their comments are stored and in the order case file- and if anyone is deceiving buyers, ebay steps in and issues a fair settlement.  That is often an overlooked part of app reviews, but this being a storefront/marketplace, it’s essential that the seller backs up the products and services sold. So far, Ebay has been there for me everytime for the last 20 years.",5
244,"Need improvements for ad posting efficiency: I love Ebay and it supplies a steady second income but since they’ve updated the app it has had its quirks but overall pretty good. 

Lately it has been frustrating that it doesn’t learn or I can’t select the auto filled fields in the app. For instance, I usually do the same details for every listing, free shipping, no international shipping, require instant pay with PayPal, and buy it now. For me to post the item I have to change these fields every time, and every time it loads for every single change...one...at...a...time. Very frustrating! Instead you should let me select my go to listing style or let me select my changes and then update everything at once instead of one...at...a...time. 

I have the IPhone XS Max and I expect every app to run smooth and quickly but sometimes while thrifting with LTE service it takes FOREVER (up to a minute or so) to load my search results. Sometimes I have to just keep busy while it is loading my search results to find out if the item is a good buy. I love thrift stores but the less time I have to spend waiting for the results to load, the quicker I can get to the next store.  

Again I love this app and it is exactly the tool you need for a lucrative side hustle in the thrift game but it could use some improvements!",5
245,"Compression socks: Disappointed, not sure if it should be @ the app but definitely @ two sellers on this app. The sellers are on the app so yes also disappointed in app. I tried to purchase a couple items from two separate sellers. I went through the normal process. I picked my colors pick size, the app showed in stock. I went through payment process with debit card & everything was good so the only thing left to do was wait for arrival. Both times by two separate sellers I received message the next day apologizing but item not in stock. Now they are asking if I want another color of item which I don’t but feel I have no choice because payment has been already made. I feel like sellers know they are out of stock but they are not being honest with buyers. Since we already paid we nave no choice.",5
246,"Not Great: I called customer support to tell them stores aren't available on the app and 60% of users can't see the stores. Months go by new versions come out and no change. 

I often get server errors when trying to revise a listing. It doesn't save your changes and you get minutes if sitting there while it tries to upload. It's been failing for the last few days which is infuriating. I called support, they said they know, other users have that issue, and the app can't handle all the data and I should use a PC. I was literally told the app has problems and listing an item and revising it doesn't always work. I was livid. Why something so basic as selling doesn't work properly on all that's been out a few years. 

You won't get customer service agents that are American. There are probably better services out there. I recently downgraded my store due to their issues. They tried to charge me $199, but after someone took in account all the issues the charge was removed. I am building my own online store due to their incompetence and because their fees really add up!",1
247,"Impossible to make any money from: I used to sell tons of items on eBay and even made a small business out of it a couple years back. However ever since they have progressively begun to take away more and more money out of what you sell. I understand that they have to make money but its just straight up outrageous now. I have sold items on eBay for 50 bucks and after fees and shipping are over i end up barely making 10 dollars now! What really made me mad was here recently when I sold an extremely rare collectible and eBay took 150 dollars out of that sale. Again, i understand they have to make money but 150 dollars?!?! Thats frustrating and that makes it VERY hard to earn money from. eBay has turned into more of a yards sale platform where people sell things they just want out of their house and don’t care about money. If your looking to buy things eBay is fine. If your looking to sell things then go elsewhere where they won’t take tons of your money.",2
248,eBay is the Safest place online to Shop and Sell: I have been with eBay since 1999 as a buyer and seller. It’s amazing what you can find here. Back in the day you had to drive long distances and rummage through old barns to find a unique piece. Now you can do from the comfort of your home. The thrill of course is to bid on something you really want and hope others are sleeping so you can get it at an amazing price. I have been a Power Seller and regular seller on eBay since ‘99. As a seller I like to find something only few have so you can watch the buyers bid it up to a limit beyond your expectations. You sell the buyer they have been searching a lifetime for. I am connected to PayPal and the United States Postal Service so when a buyer pays it goes directly into my account after all fees are paid and the shipping label is printed. It doesn’t get much better than that! 😎,5
249,"Continues to allow auction of basic necessities: Unconscionable practices.
Although an alert at the front page of the eBay app says eBay has taken strps to prohibt price gouging and block certain items, I still see auctioning of basic necessities such as toilet paper,  disinfectant, medical face masks during the Coronvirus outbreak where third party resellers are hoarding by wiping out local store shelves in order to profit from online store eBay.  Lysol prices are pricing above $10 upwards of $200.  Local shoppers are unable to find these items or face inflated prices for necessities and/or have outbid someone for toilet paper.
If people are bidding on toilet paper into the hundred of dollars they obviously don’t have access to it.  Shut down accts of orice gougers for at least 3 months and automatically block anything that says lysol aerosol sanitizer with peifing and shipping over $10.  Some shipping is over $20 for one can of lysol.",4
250,"Watch out sellers!: This app will automatically choose settings for you when your not looking , like accepting offers , it accepts offers with no set dollar amount in mind, like free shipping , even after you have filled out the shipping information and chosen a shipper , then go back and look at the listing only to find it has chosen free shipping for you! If your a seller working to get a certain profit on items then use the web browser based old format (because in the new format some important information is missing completely on the page)for selling as it’s much more accurate than this apple app. Sellers have no more protection, buyers can , especially international buyers, can say your product is bad and return the item and when you receive the item back the item is not even what you sold them, they have just ripped you off and there is nothing you can do about it , eBay treats it as “it the cost of doing business” So it’s seller beware!",3
251,"Needs improvement: The fact that the rating for the app is so high, is a bit mind boggling. I use the eBay app everyday and to say I go one day without frustrations would be a lie. 

You can’t print international labels from the app, when I post new items, it takes days to show up on the eBay app. Items that I’ve sold disappear from the sold section after so long. When reposting items that have ended, the shipping option will go completely blank and will not let me select anything, I have to repeatedly close out the app until it will allow me to select one. There should be an option to view all printed labels. The app should be able to stand completely on its own and you should not have to use the computer. Yet, I find myself using the computer multiple times a week. 

Is the app easy to use? Absolutely. It’s very user friendly in some ways. If you are simply uploading items and printing domestic labels. It’s great! Does it need work? Definitely.",3
252,"No seller protection: I sold a very expensive Samsung phone. I called eBay to make sure I was doing everything right before I shipped the phone. They said I was good to continue and I would get my funds after the buyer received the phone. I shipped it that same day with 1-3 day USPS priority mail ( label printed from eBay). 3 days later I thought I got a notification for the completed delivery, but it turned out to be that eBay suspended the buyers account and deemed it as suspicious. At that time, eBay had cancelled the transaction, but my Samsung phone was to be delivered on that day. I called eBay and explained my situation, they were of no help to me and told me that they aren’t responsible for this...... so after that, I attempted a package interception, but it was unsuccessful and the phone was delivered to the suspicious buyer without any payment to me.

253,"eBay Inhibiting the sellers: Greetings everyone,

I’m pretty sure this is going to be censored. So, if it’s not, I hope Buyers, Sellers and eBay will think hard about this review. For years, I have been on eBay and have seen the deterioration of their customer service and support for their sellers. I have been in entanglements with this issue many times over the years. Now, just before it’s going to be 2018 things have gotten even worse. There is no support system for sellers any longer! The buyers can tear your reviews apart, leave you bad feedback that cannot be removed, do anything they want to do and eBay will not do anything about it. I bring this up is because most of the buyers are taking advantage of this! They get free items, they don’t pay for shipping returns. Then, after you have dealt with all their drama they will go back and leave you bad feedback and make your hard earned numbers go down. If this is ever posted, I hope some people pay attention and maybe eBay will supported their buyers again. Everyone knows, if you don’t have sellers you don’t have buyers. 

The Wisdom Store",1
254,"Plenty of lacking features but concise: Missing features :
1. Doesn't notify you when feedback is left for you. 

2. In-app camera feature is weak. Doesn't take clear photos. 

3. The app will notify you 24 hours before item you are watching is ending. That's nice, but I'd rather be notified 15 minutes before auction ends. *update* it now notifies you 15 min before auction end. 

4. Cannot change any of the notification's sounds. Get tired of hearing the same predictable sound for each and every notification. 

5. The app does a terrible job of selection ""more items like this"" at the bottom of a listing. For instance, it suggests size 7 shoes for ""more like this"", when I've been browsing size 9. (Same for bras. Uh hello, I only wear 1 size bra!) 

6. The app doesn't give you every available item up for sale when you search for a specific item. It purposely leaves out the lowest-priced items in favor of the sponsored or New listings. 

7. Some of the subheadings under descriptions are excessive and unnecessary. 

8. The app only retains a small window of time's transactions. For instance if you wanted to know how much shipping costs were for an item that was sold back in December, the app doesn't store that info much longer than a week or 2.

9. Cannot update profile info or photo on mobile app! Frustrating!
This seriously needs to be remedied!",4
255,"Ebay is a horrible company: Ebay has had a terrible history with scamming people. For example there is a youtuber called benoftheweek who was doing a auction for some acrylic nails used in a video. All the money was going to charity for the children of palestine and it ended at 72,500 usd! This would be amazing but, the person who bid that asked for him to cancel the order and you might think that that has nothing to do with ebay and that would be true if they didn’t have a policy that says “the highest bidder wins the auction and pays for the item. Remember, a bid is a binding contract. When you bid on item in an auction you’re committing to buy it if you win” so after that ebay said it could be relisted but after it was all the bids where gone and all the money that would have gone to charity went down the drain. After all that ebay suspended his account said he couldn’t “sell human remains” AND CHARGED HIM 2.50 usd 
You can help by subscribing to him or just watching the video as all the ad revenue is going to charity BOYCOTT EBAY TOO THEY HAVE DONE THIS TO MANY OTHERS THEY ARE A HORRIBLE COMPANY!",1

Are use my phone for eBay business every day at all hours of the day and this is costing me time energy, which are things that I cannot get back especially time.

And more importantly, it’s costing me money, not being able to upload look anything of that matter.

I think it is a high priority, especially since of the new relevant costs that are associated with sellers and the 21.8% that’s taken away from the sellers after they’ve sold an item prior to their money going into their bank.

I think the lease that can be done is this particular type of problem on the upside can be resolved, especially considering it’s $1 billion company with a Nothing please to support this air not happening or occurring at any time.

260,"Wide variety of fragrances: Over the years on EBay I have collected more than 400 different fragrances. For the most part I have had luck dealing with sellers, on occasion I would either win an auction or buy it out right directly from the seller and for some reason or another the seller would take my money and then not send me what I had purchased. Luckily Eb has a money back guarantee which I have had to employ to have the seller return my money.
I have also found that if you are seeking a certain fragrance that is either vaulted or discontinued EBay is the place that you would most likely find it for sale. Having said that you will also more than likely pay a premium for the opportunity to purchase said fragrance.
I wish everyone well who are interested in buying fragrances from EBay.

To be fair there are issues with the site that need fixing—this rating is therefore, likely, mutually inclusive.

Ebay claims to be concerned about “price gouging,” but when you try to report the issue—no
prompt exist.  EBay’s “help,” section claims such a handy prompt exists.  Very frustrating.  You see the system seems to be designed in such a way that eliminates the possibility of complaints through the implementation of presets.   Understandable.  Price gouging, since it is likely to lead to buyer remorse and more returns ... I digress. Downloaded the Ap (hoping) and still no luck.  It seems to me bidding is luck of the draw and could swing either way.   When an item is listed and overpriced, it relies on buyer ignorance.  In my humble opinion this type of greed, while rampant, defeats the purpose of a marketplace like Ebay.  Forgive me, but I digress.",2

I constantly have issues with my cart saying there was a problem and can’t access my cart. The biggest one is after so long of an item being purchased you can’t click on it to contact a seller and let them know your item still hasn’t came in. The purchase item turns gray and says unavailable and I’ve tried going into my account to get to those purchase items and still have not been able to contact a seller so then have to contact eBay themselves.

I still had to refund half which is absolutely insane considering all paperwork was there, and that is legal proof. The second one I sold four unopened nest cameras. The buyer took photos of the boxes opened with the merchandise, pulled out and claimed that I sold him empty boxes. I had ordered the cameras directly from Google, and had never opened them. The boxes clearly had cameras in them when I mailed them and the buyer is being completely dishonest.

270,"eBay a true Rock star!: “Always and anything” is the best way to describe my fruitful and very positive experiences with eBay over the past 23 years. There are so many things I could say about this Mega-bastion business of on-line shopping or selling. eBay backs up what they say and provide near limitless items for sale. 

eBay recognizes the frequent shoppers with a long history of purchases and has improved in so many areas over the years. For example, the customer support has improved and customer protections has expanded. The one -time small eBay has grown successful over the years with great feedback from customers. They care what I think. I wish other businesses would learn from eBay. They may be successful too! 

Thanks eBay for a great web site, caring people, and wonderful items for sell!",5
271,"Don’t EVER sell on Ebay: Please don’t sell on Ebay if you don’t want your money taken from you. They have so many scammers and most of them are probably working for the company also. My mom does her small business and it just trying to get by and yet she was sent a box to our house claiming it was from Ebay. When she called and questioned them about it they denied that they sent a box. Then her account started getting cases internationally, and she doesn’t even sell outside the US, she also had cases with fake customer ID numbers and it makes no sense why their attacking her. They’re making her go from phone call to phone call and telling her lies about her account and saying that in order to get her account closed she has to pay off the cases. She has never gotten a bad review from someone and she sells goo quality items that people love. Even when she tried to pay off the $60 for the fake cases the person at Ebay told her no which makes no sense. EBay’s customer service is really horrible and I am very disappointed.",1
272,"Mostly great but...: Please add a way to report bugs or problems with the app.  For example could you please get the expired offers OFF of the “active” bids and offers screen and into the “didn’t win” section instead?  I can barely tell what I am bidding on for all the expired stuff clogging the screen.  This is a relatively new glitch but a highly annoying one that I can’t figure out a way to report outside of this review which is really not the right format but it’s all I have.  (EDIT: thank you for fixing this bug but there is still no way to report any new ones that may arise.)
I have another feature request as well; the ability to flag sellers as someone you don’t want to do business with again.  This would not keep their items out of search results but would merely replace the “a seller you’ve bought from” notation on each items’ page with “a seller you’ve flagged.”  
Thanks!",4
273,"There are some shortcomings and issues: New issue found: when trying to revise an item, the app can have two different views of the page, compact, and expanded. The compact works fine, but the expanded view will not give control over offer settings, such as reject offers below “x” value. Consequently, I was unable to lower price of my item, and was given an error message saying something like “the accept price cannot be lower than reject price”. Also, when there are offers on my item, even though, they are all completed, the offer settings are locked in revise menu.

It’s been many updates, but, some issues are never addressed.
For example, the app seem to have hard time registering my responses to buyers. The “question to answer” will be sitting there until I go on my desktop computer and check it as answered. Why? Why is there not an option to do that through the app?

Another issue is probably concerning the platform itself, not just the app: if I list multiples of some product with separate shipping fee, then buyers are not charged individual shipping fees if they order more than one item. The thing is, those items do not fit in the same box, they don’t even fit in larger box, they need to be packed and shipped individually. Why is there not an option to turn off combined shipping?
Please fix it.",4
274,"How is this you can't cancel an order even though it was just placed it?: I placed an order late at night and I tried to cancel it right away because I didn't need the item anymore and my apt number was missing on my address. they sent a ""cancelation request"" to the seller even though I had placed the order a couple minutes before!!! Since when you gotta request an order cancellation when the item hasn't been shipped??? I tired to contact the seller and they didn't reply by that tine they hadn't sent the item off but they rejected my request. The item took 4 days to arrive in town just to be returned to the seller next day for insufficient address!! All that just for not having a order cancellation option? That's ridiculous. nobody does that but this app... All that process took two weeks. Never got the item and I literally just got my refund. What a waste of time! Keep in mind that any mistake is gonna be handled by the seller. eBay is not gonna be part of anything so your money will most likely be played with",1
275,Perfect app for a startup business: I have only been using this app for 2 days and I must say the experience I have been receiving it while using it is simply brilliant. recommended by my father who is a true professional friend and business partner have easily shown me the steps on how to profit and expand my business knowledge and to him no matter our decisions and desires we are all going forward with our business plan to grow and to make a difference in our lives and the way we live in our business life and our lives as we move to the next chapter in life we are going through the challenges of the journey of the future and we have to work together to achieve our goals and dreams of success and happiness we will continue to grow and live in a positive mindset and will continue to make the world a success in our future dreams of the future.🙏✊🙂,4
276,"My go to for any and everything!: What is not to like? Type what you are looking for...wait for just a few seconds and there you go...options from all over the world...or not if you so choose! That is the other wonderful thing...you have the choice to filter your search to suit your needs! Then you wait...and to be honest I have never had to wait more than just a few days...I have blinked and my items have arrived! In the slim chance anything has gone wrong EBay has always helped me out as well....
So, in a nutshell EBay is my go to for any and everything and between my husband who is on  the selling end of things and while I am more of the one who likes the buying end much better ;) 
We have been with EBay for about 20 years and so far we don’t plan on going anywhere and are looking forward to 20 more years!!",5
277,"New Ebay Update Is TERRIBLE!!!: For the past 20 minutes, I have been trying to process a return on this app, and I cant even DO IT!!! Every time I click on the “See Return Details” button in my messages, it says I have signed out (it takes me to a weird, new condensed form of a safari mobile version that does not even match the style of the app), and that I need to sign back in!!! After signing in, it takes me to a crappy homepage with NONE of my return part accessible, notifications or messages; only SUGGESTIONS to buy MORE STUFF. I tried to figure out that I have to go to My Ebay-Selling-Sold-(scroll to find item)-See Return Details…and then it leads me BACK TO THE SIGNED OUT PAGE AGAIN!!! ROUND AND ROUND WE GO!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡 THIS is just one of the MANY PROBLEMS with this app!!!! I wish I could list them all, but I don’t have the time; I am a professional app tester and they aren’t paying me to test their app.
Ebay: Instead of trying to get us to conform to your new payment policy, how about working on the DEVELOPMENT of your APP to make it EASY for the consumers?!?!?",1
278,"My experience about eBay and PayPal: It is always they have a problem it is either the system or it is eit  her day policy why because they are too big they can't do everything right they do not  judge everything right
Most off the time miss judgment 50% if you are a seller and you are not the shark and a cheater you definitely get hurt if you are a shark D will support you if you are a buyeryou will get cheat because most of seller cheater especially if you're from UK they always sell you Gold plated as a solid gold they sold me a CZ as a diamond eBay could do nothing for me I will purchase a solid gold and I saw it is it gold plated Ebay + did not do nothing for me The buyer purchased 47 items from me you ask me return and a refund I give him refund for 47 items he keep  11 item I spent 29 ours on your phone and over 50 email I didn't get nothing back Ebay not support me eBay support cheater Pay Pal didn't support me they could not even give me a proof I refund the buyer for 47 Items I lost $2000 I wish I could p.....on eBay system and PayPal system because all I receive shooting me ..........",1
279,"iPhone X is EATING MY LISTINGS MAJOR BUG REPORT: iPhone X deleting listing information like the delete key (if there were such a thing was stuck pressed down and it’s eating my listings my descriptions my price adjustments my buyer emails EVERYTHING) 

No amount of closing and re-opening the ebay app seems to be working once the bug starts it just locks in until literally a hard reset on the iPhone is performed that will get it to stop but then again like I mentioned it’s nearly mins into a freshly booted phone and rebooted app when it returns again and it’s relentless.

Tricky to screen grab it really it just quite suddenly begins to eat my listings or pricing fields or shipping info literally all text fields begin to delete whatever is or would be typed in any and all text fields while trying to manage existing or new listings.  It’s usually around 2-5 mine sometimes a bit longer but it seems like it’s definitely specific to my iPhone X as all my iOS devices including my iPhone 7+ and iPad Pro all running the same and latest iOS release yet it’s be iPhone X this continues happening with.",1
280,"Double charging!: I been a member of eBay for as long as I can remember. And would have given 5 stars! But they obviously have changed the way you pay. I just ordered one pack of guitar strings. After I thought I had paid, it told me I had not paid, and told me I had to pay! So I thought it didn’t go through or something? So I did as it said and the second time it confirmed that I had paid. Well what it did was order a second set of strings from the same seller! Charged me double tax, and double shipping! I mean it was only a 12 dollar purchase that now cost me $24. But it should have never happened! And now I can go through the hassle of returning the second set, or just keeping them! This kind of pisses me off! Thank God I didn’t but a guitar or something like that! Get it together EBay!",5
281,"VERY Poor seller protection!!!!: If you want to resale, go to places like Mercari Poshmark it Kidizen, do no go to Ebay cuz they basically has no seller protection. There are huge amounts of scammers on eBay, and if a buyer filed a case with seller, eBay will close the case on buyer’s favor just based on buyers words, no pictures or evidence required from buyer at all! 
And when you call eBay, they always say you can file a appeal, BUT, their APPEAL option never works, once you go to eBay resolution center, it doesn’t gives you an option to file it, there is no “appeal” button for you to click, or it will send you to PayPal resolution page, which tells you file an appeal from eBay.  There is no way to file it from eBay website at all, it is purposely designed this way.
So seller, if you are interested in resale, DO NOT GO TO EBAY!",5
282,"App refreshes too often, causing loss of progress: Almost every time I attempt to send a message to a buyer/seller, the app does its refresh cycle and I can lose my progress in the message. This occurs during searches and other stuff as well. Many, many features unavailable on mobile platforms that a physical PC is required to access. The app is almost useless for advanced buyers/sellers requiring efficiency. Too much focus on advertising “sponsored” listings. Some sellers may have (example) 10 items listed, but scrolling through their list seems like way more items as ebay shows the same items again and again (inadvertent duplicates). These flaws don’t seem to occur on the “desktop” version. Privacy is poor (all ebay platforms) which I found out during Christmas shopping when my wife was able to see my “previously viewed items” even though I was signed out after my session. Not a huge deal, but it spoiled the surprise.",3
283,"Great to buy selling however: This app is fantastic for consumers to purchase a wide array of items and I’ve had good experiences purchasing things myself. However, when it comes to selling nothing is more frustrating. Even though I meet the guidelines to have my payments sent directly to my paypal balance eBay still places holds on my money. I at the very least should receive the money I need to ship the items and then receive the rest when they receive their purchase. Instead I have to wait until I get my paycheck just to be able to send someone something they bought a week ago. And what’s even more frustrating is they stopped putting holds on my payments and then out of nowhere started to again with me doing nothing different. Whenever I try to contact customer service they give me a recording to go to their website and get hung up on. eBay please fix!!!",4
284,"Good App...but!: The app would be great, but the developers forgot who owns the products on eBay. I am smart enough to know if I want to accept offers or not and I do not need ebay’s guidance popping up on my listings. I especially hate choosing a firm price option, only to have it automatically listed to accept offers. If it were up to the app’s advice, all items would sell below cost for the seller, but I don’t see ebay taking a hit on there fees. Sellers should be able to turn off the apps advice and auto features once and never have to deal with it again. It is very time consuming to keep changing back changes the app makes automatically. I do not need a computer algorithm making my business decisions!

I have complained to support about eBay’s insistence on taking over a sellers right to merchandise a product as the seller sees fit. No results, so I have decided to un-list my items and find a more profitable and seller friendly forum on which to sell.",3
285,"Needs to Be More Fair to Sellers: Two things need to be changed.  
1.  Once bidding has closed on an item a buyer should not be able to ignore payment because they no longer want an item.  This is unfair to sellers and there should be a return to the old philosophy of eBay that, once an item is bid on, the bidder is responsible for purchase if they have the winning bid.  What is even worse is that, under the urrent system, when a bidder decides to not pay for the item, the seller has to relist the item and gets penalized by having a ‘free listing’ counted against them.  NOT FAIR!  I’ve had this happen 5 times since January 1st on approximately 20 items which is a 25% occurrence. 
2.  When setting up an item for bidding, it states that they will be relisted up 8 times automatically but several items require relisting more often than that. I have items that need to be relisted every week and, of course, I get penalized for this by having a ‘free listing’ counted against me.",2
286,eBay is a nightmare: I barely had my account open for a week and eBay permanently suspended my account claiming they would send me a message stating why. I received one message repeating my account was terminated and left no reason and no way to get in contact with eBay. Magically the “chat” and “call back” options disappeared from my account. I had to log into someone else’s account to access the “call back” feature. The first agent I spoke with was great but had to transfer the call to another department. The next agent was terrible. These companies take your money and don’t have the decency to hire proper customer service agents. The lady’s English comprehension was terrible and she kept repeating a scripted answer that had nothing to do with my question. I took a risk downloading this app after all the complaints I’ve heard about scammer buyers. I’m probably better off without them. They say rejection is God’s protection. Time to delete this and move on to another platform. Good luck if you choose to do business with this company.,1
287,"Well, okay.: Over the past 6 years, every time eBay updates their app, I like it less than the app they replace. That’s a sobering trend, and I’m only writing this because three times on the past day I’ve been nudged to write a review. 

Of course, now it I’d fr too late for me to recollect what previous versions of the app did, that this one doesn't... but eBay *must* keep records, Agile development (yuk!) or not. It’s their business and their customer sat, so do the work yourselves, guys. In short:

What I like: it works on my iPad and doesn’t crash often. If I scroll enough, it shows me things.

What I hate: it’s intrusive. It ‘“wants to suggest to me what items (based on data-morning my “interests”) I might want to buy”. But here’s some late-breaking news: you are not a retailer, eBay! If and when I want to buy something, I will. I do not want or need you to pigeonhole me.

Next, eBay does not police, or incent their sellers to post ACCURATE AND THRUTHFUL INFORMATION.

I buy a lot of used electronic laboratory and audio equipment. I encounter THOUSANDS of posts “powers on, pulled from a working environment”. That is useless to me. Does it work, or not? If no, why are the sellers asking far more than the junked equipment is worth?

I could go on, but won’t. The App is, well, okay. I use it because I have no alternative.",5
288,"So many fees: First, you list the item. Then, they take it down after a few days because they don’t think it’ll sell. So you go in and manually re-open the item. Then you select which type of shipping you want, assuming it’ll get taken out before you even get paid like on all other selling apps. Nope. Someone buys the item and you get paid immediately. Then you get a bill for shipping, but you have to choose (again) which shipping to use, then put your credit card in to pay for it (should have just taken it out of the payment). Ok so you’ve paid for shipping, and you ship your item. A few weeks later, you get a bill for a selling fee. It would’ve been nice if they just took it out of the original payment because guess what: there’s no way to pay the bill in the app! Now you have to log into the desktop version and pay that way. Overall, too much hassle and too many bills. Just use Mercari, a much better selling platform! eBay always has been trash so I don’t know why I expected anything different from this app.",1
289,"Good store, you have to keep merchants on their toes: E-bay takes a lot of concentration. While searching for good prices you must be aware of whether you’re moving over to a Chinese site that will take up to 30 days to deliver, or even never, you have to keep check on whether your product ever arrives. Warehouses full of products are sold as ‘stores’ and people buy the store from a Chinese outlet who then sells the product online for you and the person keeps the profit. Sometimes they will just keep your money, another scam to watch. Most annoying after you pay for any item it is marked ask shipped which means only that the seller went online and marked it shipped, totally bogus term. They can all produce a tracking number online, but it is never truly shipped until they hand it to the shipper. There are so many things to watch for that you MUST use PayPal to guarantee your purchase.",4
290,"Bought Breaks With Top Tier Break’s: I Started Collecting in 1974, I was 6, and got a pac for mowing the lawn. I have tried other breakers, but this one, not only has great products, latest Hobby Cases, I believe, He has better Mojo, than I do. A lifetime, Die hard Cubby fan, I had to try.
Wow, I got in, well, I kinda went all-in, and have never been happier with my breakers, he sleeves and top load or one touches, big, big, rare pulls. Watched him, first night, Pull, 2, 1/1’s.
I’m good, but not that good!! Lol
He is funny, Hansel’s the cards, like I would, packed them great, some got free postage, top loaded, some penny sleeved, did I mention, he’s a Bear’s fan!
Hey Rodgers, come to Chicago again!!
Fun, does a review of entire pull, it’s on vid, for friends, family, or Investor’s.
He has a “BearBowl” Every team bought get a chance at great free cards.
I won 2 Golden Tickets, which gave me 6 free team pulls on Break #10, give it a look.
 No matter what your Status, in the Wonderful World of Sportscard Collecting, Flipping,  Speculating, or, Investing, you will be pleasantly surprised, an HONEST, breaker, like Top Tier, will get my extra cash.
Received all cards, really quick, communicated, constantly, and they showed up, in Gradable condition.
I give them 5 Stars, 
And, I joined the Top Shelf a club, to Boot.",5
291,"Great but lacking some features: Look, by now we all know eBay is a site for buying and selling all over the world. And the web based site you get to on your internet browser (say on your PC) is pretty good and full of all the ads, previews, ""items picked just for you!"" as well as all the buttons and windows and areas to view the same information in different ways. And an app for those who no longer use a PC at all this app is great. (Although ironically there is still plenty you can't do from the app that you must go through the web based interface to use). 

I really want to be able to locate and ""contact"" people. Like, someone who made an offer which I declined. What if a week later I change my mind? It would be nice to reach out and offer to reconsider. 

 But for me, I just want an app that is clean, has all the buttons on the home page and is free of ads and the like. Maybe an ""eBay lite"" app is what I really want but I cringe every time I open this app because I am going to be inundated with all sorts of crap I don't want to see. 

Just give me a clean ""lite"" version and I will give it and eBay SIX stars.

UPDATE OCTOBER 2017

-New updates are quirky, and the most egregious is the postage computer. It is most often several dollars short, and occasionally, several times short (as in 200 and 300% off actual postage).  This eats into your profits. Simply say buyer pays postage and let their address be the guide. This needs fixed",2
292,PLEASE FIX !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The problem with this App is you can not have more than 270 items in your “Watching” items list. If you try to add more to your watching items list you will get an error message that says you have reached the max amount. I would greatly appreciate it if you can increase the amount of items that can be added to “Watching” items list in the App. If you can increase the amount of items that can be added to the Apps watching list I will redo my review with 5 star rating. I hope you can fix this I have been asking for years to fix this and it should be a simple database fix to make it work. I like bookmarking items that I’m interested in and I use the watching items for this as I purchase a lot with the eBay App. Please fix this I have been asking for years to fix this.,5
293,"Mixed feelings..: As a buyer eBay is awesome. As a seller eBay has been nothing but a headache for me. It’s a double edge sword because I do love it. But their customer service is abysmal. Absolutely terrible. The only time you’ll ever get anything done is by a phone call, And good luck. eBay has a glitch in their system where your bank account number gets switched off by 1 digit. I have screenshots of eBay reps confirming so. Because of this glitch, I had my money pending for 3 weeks. Over a thousand dollars worth..literally 1 day after updating my bank account with an eBay rep on the phone (only time you’ll ever get anything done) my account got suspended. And again...the same issue with customer service...I’m tired and frustrated..and I never write reviews..but this is too much. I hope someone important in eBay reads this...Absolutely callous customer support",4
294,"Seller’s Worst Nightmare: I had heard of eBay many times before getting an account. People often said it’s a great way to sell used items. I gave it a shot and sold a gaming PC which sold for about $700. EBay took at the beginning of the sale $35 for the listing fee. I thought $35 was a bit ridiculous but I was just glad the item sold. Then I got charged by PayPal. Another $10 just to take the money to my bank account. Then a few days later, eBay deducts $70 from my bank account. I have no idea why and find out this is part of their eBay invoice program. They take an additional 10% of whatever you make. That is an insane amount of money you are losing for this greedy company to take more of your money. If your selling a cheaper item you are gonna be left with practically nothing. I recommend trying other apps  similar to eBay such as Facebook marketplace or Craig’s list, or simply just selling your items to friends or family. Biggest rip off I’ve ever done and I will never use the app again. Completely disgusted by how greedy this company is.",1
295,"Adequate!: Been buying mainly old stamps and a few other non stamp items for a couple years! Can’t tell you how frustrating it is to buy something, wait weeks, only to find the seller has gotten a better price on some other site, and finally returns your money after you complain you haven’t received it. Bought a neck charm in August, said it wouldn’t arrive until December. December arrives, doesn’t come, complain, nothing happens! EBay deletes complaint because nothing has been said on complaint site. Can no longer complain anywhere I didn’t get it. Money finally reimbursed mid January! Five months of waiting for nothing. One purchase got “lost” in mail. Mailed from East Coast to Minnesota. Ended up somewhere in California? Got reimbursed and told when it returned to East Coast, I’d be informed. Never heard anything. It always the more expensive stamps that I never seem to get. Just get reimbursed with no notice! A few more purchases and I will be off EBay!",3

   It doesn’t serve my needs and forces me to get up and get my ipad. But now the iPad has the same app. I use the sellers hub mostly and this app does not support that.  Very disappointed since I am forced to use it. Better than nothing since I always have my phone with me but this is a flop in my mind. 
   Just tried to remind a buyer he has 30 days to return an item that he said he wanted to return. Although I went to the item and touched the link “contact buyer.” It did not do that. I wound up trying to send the message to myself because of a bug in the system. I deleted the app and am downloading it again but am getting my iPad in the meantime, but now I can’t because it’s now the very same app,  such a waste of time
   If I could give it a half a star I would",5
297,Instant pay: I do like EBay although there fees are starting to get a bit High. The one thing I hate. Is when you sell something it should be an instant purchase. Like 90% of the other sites. Holding a product for 4 days to see if a buyer will even purchase it can be very costly. Especially with no repercussions to the buyer. Just sorry don’t want it. Meanwhile you have to remove or hold from any other cross post. Decline offers from Buyers and pray they purchase. Sorry EBay but this isn’t right. I have a guy right now who sent offer then accepted my counter and told me he has no money. Sent me a “hey I have 4 days and I’m hoping I get some money in time to pay for it “ . Meanwhile I have 2 other buyers on another site wanting it. Just not right. You click accept it should be instant. So Nutz,5
298,I DON’T WANT YOUR APP EVER: Deleted my old review 2 x.  Super brave reporting every negative reviews and buying positive reviews.  I DON’T WANT YOUR APP!!!!!!! Two pop ups on MY browser it’s just stupid. I’ll block whatever ads I want when I’m a customer trying to spend money. You’re not rubbing a free site. You’re also not going to track me so cope. Although I rarely ever buy anything because the only people still selling on eBay are scammers because of the way you treat your legitimate sellers.  Someone also sent me stolen merchandise bought with a stolen credit card and I contacted eBay who called me a liar and didn’t care in the least that the person sent me goods directly shipped from an popular outside pet site that told me they do not drop ship at all and  the invoice had a name and address far away from the alleged seller.  That pet site had me give as much info as I could to their fraud department.   As a matter of fact the person is still doing it on eBay today from the same eBay account.  eBay don’t care as long as they get paid.,1
299,"eBay and it’s Interface is awful: 3 things:
1) I can’t review buyers who take the winning bid, then never pay. Further why does eBay exploit us as sellers the way they do and not remove buyers who waste peoples time and money. Just like many other popular market place apps, if I choose to buy something, it’s mine, the money needs to be moved to the disposition account and then transferred to the seller. This lack of enabling sellers and coddling delinquent buyers makes for a terrible marketplace. 
2) why am I taxed on the no kidding cost of shipping. I get it, if I charge 12 bucks and it’s only 8.00 for shipping, tac me on the 4 dollar profit, but don’t tax me on the 8 dollar service portion I am not providing this shipping service on. 
3). The transaction details after a sale/ship through eBay is very misleading. It appears that I made $23 dollars and eBay took $3.50 dollars but never shows me the shipping cost equated in that bottom line dollar amount that I actually paid (and possibly lost) out to eBay via their interface during the transaction.",1
300,"Great app, enjoy eBay: I really enjoy using the app, so many things to choose from and lots of great sellers. A safe place to purchase from with great backing by eBay. I just wish eBay sellers would use better shippers than the USPS. It’s the most unreliable service to date. Shipping is slow, tracking is useless and you never know where your packages are or when they will arrive. It’s stressful when you have expensive items that disappear from tracking and take a week or more to arrive. I’d like to see a switch to UPS or even fedEx for shipping. I’d rather pay a little more for shipping for the peace of mind of know where and when packages are arriving, and be on time. Post office 2 day shipping from California takes 7 days, and tracking is useless....poor service for eBay to rely on!",5
301,"eBay messages.: I love eBay. I like to communicate a lot with the sellers that have the items I’m interested in and I ask the questions I feel are pertinent to the item information. The difficulty I’m having is that I purchase lots of items and sometimes I have to go back through my messages to see if I had already asked a certain question about an item so I don’t ask the same question twice if they have already given me an answer. Sometimes I forget, and don’t want to bother the seller, so I have to scroll a long way back through the messages to find the seller I’m trying to contact. It would be really nice to be able to search the messages for the particular seller I’m looking for, instead of scrolling far down the message inbox. Thank you.",5
302,"Meh: eBay used to really have it figured out but not so much anymore. This is a great app if you want to buy something you really can’t find anywhere else. It’s definitely a buyer friendly setup but not so much for sellers. Is now nearly impossible to actually speak with anyone at eBay their customer support is comical and their FAQ section does nothing to resolve the new issues. Also if you were an active seller with a certain amount in sales at a given time they would give you your profits immediately, not anymore. Now that they don’t use PayPal you get your money 3-4 business days. So if you sold something because you needed the cash don’t hold your breath because not only are you gonna ship it on your own dime you’re going to wait until the rapture for your measly $37.",5
303,"Much Easier Than Going Online: I refer to this as eBay for Dummies.  I like it because it is great to use on my iPad.  I can push one button and go to watching, purchases, messages, outbid without hitting the My eBay and have to go though a large choice to find things. I prefer listing on it too. Pretty self explanatory.  I just wish I had the opportunity to set my settings to no offers, no global shipping, no promote without declining it every time.  I think it should be the other way around.  If you want to offer those options then choose them but don’t let Ebay automatically make the choice for me.  Every once in awhile the app will get a snag where you have delete, go to settings, turn all Ebay options up, reload app and start over again.  I haven’t had to do that but a few times in last 5 years.",5
304,"Is there any app that is DUMBER on the Internet?: I have only occasionally used eBay, but today I had a terrible time in purchasing items from the U.S. store (eventually successful) and the U.K. store (still trying to get the ever most basic of responses).  The IT team of eBay must have been fired about 2005 because everything on their website is so far behind what is considered normal in terms of online help and assistance these days, it is utterly pathetic.  I would kindly recommend that Jamie Iannone reach around very quickly and find out the issues at what has been a relatively good (though never excellent) company and get things together. In this day and age of technology, it really is not that difficult. 

In making a transatlantic purchase it proved impossible and it was only ever so slightly more difficult than the domestic purchase I attempted to complete. As far as I an see (after more than two dozen attempts) is that eBay is the Facebook of marketplaces and utterly useless.  It is so disappointing as it could have so easily been top of the heap.  What a lazy approach.",1
305,"Need to fix cart for removing items: Love eBay use it for 95% of everything I buy the only issue I have is removing items from my shopping cart u can only do one at a time and once u do remove an item it sends u all the way to the top so then I have to scroll all the way back down to where I was to remove another item I hope that u guys fix this cuz it takes way to long to remove items the way that it is now it wud be way easier if u cud pick multiple items to be removed as u scroll down then once ur done hit a delete button to remove all that u selected or at the very least don’t send me all the way to the top again once I do remove an item! Like I said love eBay will continue to use but this wud things a whole lot easier and hope u consider my suggestion thank u!
                                   Forever a customer,

306,"Better Search Refining options needed: I have many saved searches. I would like to see more swiping features to eliminate an auction from repeatedly showing back up even if price is reduced. There should be refining options for sports teams. An example, I have a search for Nike Therma Fit sweatshirts. I would like to eliminate any NFL, NBA, MLB except St Louis Cardinals. When I add an additiinal word in the search box, I would like to see the previous refinements remain. I repeatedly have to go back and add the same refinements after adding or removing an additional search term. One click update saved search would be great. Currently a user has to remember the saved search wording to get the app to update the saved search instead of creating a new saved search. When a counter offer is received, my previous offer amount should be provided to understand where the two parties are in price",4
307,"They keep updating but it only gets worse: The mobile app and iPad apps are not very seller friendly and remove many key features.  I know for a lot of every day people who sell use these two methods as their primary choice.  For example, cannot list multiple variation listings, cannot revised or edit multiple variation listing, free listing promotions are often not communicated via messages and the mobile site does not load full summary page where these offers are listed and enabled, buy it now is only offered in good til cancelled which can get you sneaky hidden fees, etc.  I would suggest keeping your sellers in mind, not just buyers. After all people need to sell for you to have buyers!
UPDATE
Changed from 2 stars to 1 because I also just noticed they changed listings to also automatically realist a listing “up to 8 times” where you can only modify this on a non mobile site. This is also something you have to open each listing to check or change vs using the mass update tool. JUST ANOTHER WAY THEY SCREW THEIR SELLERS TO TRY AND CHARGE ADDITIONAL FEES.",1
308,"Terrible selling experience: I made my eBay account just yesterday so I could sell some of my vinyl records that I don’t use anymore and are collecting dust and within a few hours my account was restricted! I verified all my info, my identity, my bank, and nothing helped at all. I was told to contact help and I did. I talked to an agent and they asked me a bunch of questions and then I was basically told sorry we can’t lift the restriction and when I asked to know the reason they told me it’s against their policy and I can’t know why. What a terrible experience! I am a legitimate seller just trying to get rid of part of my vinyl record collection and now I can’t do that! I wish I would have read the reviews before I decided to even try. It looks like I’m not the only one who has experienced this too. It’s just frustrating because there’s plenty of scammers that don’t have trouble selling or buying. What a joke. Hopefully there is another platform that I can use to sell my stuff. I don’t recommend eBay for new sellers AT ALL.",1
309,"The photo viewing is the stupidest thing they could have thought of: This “update” that eliminates convenient features and makes the user experience worse is SO Microsoft and makes me think that the same drunk toddler who made the recent updates of Windows 10 must’ve been consulted on this version of the EBay app.

Get your phone, then to any listing for an item and once it loads, swipe around some of the pictures. See something you need to zoom in on? just tap on the image again. You’d think it would make that image larger, right? No, it zooms further out and makes it SMALLER and takes you to a whole album view. Then you have to click again on the image to view it. What was once one click is now two! 

I’m aware that each picture is one of many in an album. When I click on a picture, I’m looking for a larger image. I don’t want to view the whole album in thumbnail form but if I did, I’d click the link to view the whole album. OH WAIT, you didn’t think to include that either…",1
310,Auction endings: I really like the concept of the app and everything I’ve bought multiple things off of here and even sold stuff to its pretty easy and a good way to make some extra cash but when I’m interested in an item and it’s an auction and there’s other people interested you get the one **** that bids at the last possible second and you have the highest bid and lose last second I think there should be a time at the end of a bid like everytime in the last 3 min of bidding it add a minute or just add more time for people to comeback and bid again so they don’t get beat by the person biding last second but other than that there are still a couple bots buying your items so make sure if they don’t pay don’t ship other than that it’s a really easy app to use really nice people trying to make you happy with your purchase and great products for the price,4
311,"Auto renewal is horrible: I do NOT understand why you have changed your practice for renewing an item. I have 50 avail to me a month with the occasional additional “free” listings...when I am able to make my own choices I list high and low end items.  They expire at the end of 30 days and then it USED to be MY DECISION if the item was relisted or not. Now, eBay is making that decision for me and I can’t stand it. I no longer want to list low cost items bc I can be 35 cent to death and eventually be in the red on an item bc eBay has taken it upon themselves to “make it easier on the seller”. All you’ve done it make me not want to list items. Prior to this change, I was listing prob 50 new items a month. This month I only listed a few. These are my items, my money, and should be MY choice if I want to relist something or not. All eBay is ultimately doing is stopping sellers from listing as many items as they usually would. It’s truly changed my whole dynamic for posting and not for the good. Please take that component off. Go back to letting us decide.",1
312,"Great concept, poor execution: I love this app. Let’s start that off. But there are issues. As a seller that relies heavily on my phone to make listings, It can slow me down. The app shuts off while I’m making a new listing quite a bit. There is a bit of a delay with certain things and some options aren’t available that should be. The photos portion works fairly well, so not many complaints with that. Also when I save a draft it freezes for a second and I usually have to press it twice to make it go through. I would also love a better way to search when determining pricing or when I’m sourcing. The barcode scanner is very good for items with barcodes though, I really like that feature. Just please make the app stop crashing please! I’d even be willing to beta test!

Also not getting notifications for sales on my phone and sometimes delayed, I’ll get a paypal notification before it even shows me what sold on eBay.",3
313,"EBay thoughts; no 800 number, no help, no support: While eBay has great access to all sorts of things, in the last couple of years the running of customer service seems to be void of any support. I have had numerous experiences where I could not reach anyone when things were lost or sellers were dishonest and never sent items I paid for. I lost my money on several purchases. So, I always worry now each time I buy things on eBay, so I advise buyers beware; contact the seller first if you want to buy things and don’t buy unless you are confident the seller is legit. It’s too bad but I do hope things change and that eBay will again consider putting human operators back on the payroll who will help to guarantee their purchases are really safe and appreciated by the corporation.",5
314,"Notifications need to be fixed ASAP: I had the very rare multiple order day today and not once did I get a notification that they happened. I was literally sitting next to my phone and using my iPad and nothing came in. I was finishing packaging up one order and put everything away when I opened up the app to check something and there was another order that had come in just four minutes before! No little happy cash register sound, (something that I happen to love hearing) no screen notification, nothing. I checked my settings, volume and everything was turned on and still no clue this had happened. I’m not someone who sells thousands of items and gets hundreds of orders a week, I’m someone who maybe gets a sale a week and am vigilant about next day shipping. But I can only ship when I know there is an order! Also…Please go back to using ""sold"" in the seller dashboard. ""Orders"" makes it look as if I have outstanding orders to fill! (Why change this at all, so ridiculous.)",1
315,MFA up the *ss. 30 minute login: I spent 30 min trying to prove myself to buy a $29 item with my saved address and credit card. Started with a puzzle piece challenge game. Passed. Needed a phone call to submit one-time PIN. Couldn’t get one on the mobile browser (unaware at time bc I clicked the link to ‘get phone call’ and was taken to PW reset). Fine.  Changed PW.

316,"FIX YOUR APP: If I could give zero starts I would. I rather use Mercari, I have been selling on mercari for years and is so EASY and SIMPLE I sell something the buyer pays for the shipping label & you just print it & take it to the postal service the buyer has 3 days to rate you & you get your funds as soon as you get rated or 3 days after item has been delivered. All selling fees are gonna be taken out of final payment they don’t take anything from your bank account unlike ebay where you have to pay for the shipping label from your own pocket (which the shipping prices are ridiculous) I don’t understand why ebay makes things so complicated. I also canceled an international order bc there was an issue with the buyer guess what? They still charged me the selling fees! Incredible. If you’re looking for an super EASY selling app to use try mercari. I will stop using eBay until they make it easier to sell. Also if you try contacting support good luck with that they seem like they aren’t getting paid totally unprofessional.",1
317,"Money back guarantee not always true: Love buying from eBay!! The only thing that I don’t like about eBay is that they don’t always honor their 30 day money back guarantee if item is not received, happened to me twice..
A couple times over the years a item would be delivered at my door or at my mailbox not in mailbox and wasn’t there when I went to get it. 
Obviously someone stole the package. I let seller now seller did not care then I put a claim in to eBay and I did not get another item nor did I get my money back so eBay didn’t honor money back guarantee. Money back guarantee is for people who don’t get there item. I did not get my item it was not placed in my hands nor did the door get opened and placed in someone else’s hands. it’s not right it’s not fair.... Shame on you eBay..",5
318,"eBay gives sellers all the power: I have been using eBay for years. For the most part, I haven’t had any issues but when I had a repeated issue with the same seller, I left poor feedback for that seller. The seller did offer a refund but that doesn’t excuse what the seller was doing...which was claiming items were sterling silver when they were not marked as sterling or 925 and there was no information offered as to whether the items were tested or any other information at all for that matter. This happened on 3 different items and when I contacted the seller, there was no explanation offered, just a refund. Because the seller offered a refund, EBay removed my negative feedback/comments and the seller has now blocked me from ordering items. Blocking me is fine because I wasn’t going to order from that seller again, but the fact that eBay bent over backwards to remove feedback and not hold the seller accountable for misrepresenting his items is unacceptable! Very disappointed!",2
319,"eBay is a scammer: I recently tried to sell something on eBay for the second time, and of course when I finally thought someone had purchased the item it was a scammer. They seem to be the only people using eBay these days. After 2 weeks of waiting for payment, eBay wants to charge me a 25 dollar service fee?! For what?! I can’t cancel the transaction, I can’t dispute the fee except, through my bank. I tried to contact eBay and resolve this reasonably but their only contact option is by phone?! I’m currently living in a remote area with only limited WiFi access so that’s not an option for me. So I can’t email them or even use the app to resolve this issue, since both the app and website won’t let me cancel the transaction without the buyer agreeing, even though they have yet to pay. I don’t have much money, so this 25 dollar fee is ridiculous. I will never attempt to use eBay again, there are so many better options for you to sell your goods. Stay clear of eBay folks unless you wanna be scammed by the buyer AND the company.",1
320,"Long time member & my review is from a “BUYERS” perspective: I’ve been an eBay user for just about 18 years or so...(?!?!?) I’ve had so many great experiences with the sellers on here (I’ve mostly been a buyer with the exception of selling just a few items) I really enjoy the way this is set up-so easy & convenient to use! Searching for a particular item is no problem at all, just type in key words & a broad search can be done-type in exact words and find the exact item you want.I like how the site gives me options with other sellers who might be selling a similar item or the same exact item-this way I can compare prices & get the best deal possible...The process of bidding, buying & paying are so well streamlined! Simply put-I’m going to continue to use this site for many more years! eBay is at the top of its game!",5
321,"Mostly like the app for selling...: But... some bugs remain. Frequently when I try to revise a listing the photos get messed up. Sometimes I want to feature a different photo to see if it helps to sell my item. For example I will swap photo 1 and 2. Then inevitably I end up with photo 2 moving into the photo 1 spot, but the same photo remains in the photo 2 spot, and the photo which had been in the #1 spot is gone. Please please fix this!!! 

Another bug... when you “sell a similar item” and get a prompt asking if you want to copy the photos, it copies them over regardless of how you respond. Annoying, yes, but it can be worked around- unlike my other issue above.

Aside from that I've been enjoying finding new homes (buyers) for things which I no longer need. Thanks, eBay. Keep up the good work on this app!!",5
322,"When will this stop: I have been using eBay since the early 2000 and I usually have a positive experience with eBay. Within the last 10 years I recently went from a buyer to a part-time seller to make a few bucks. But one thing I have noticed in the eBay world if you are selling a hot ticket item look out for all the scams, shill bidders, and fake accounts to buy your item then never get a single dollar.  Like right now, have a questionable buyer with a brand new account with a score of 1 and already coming up on the 48 hour mark with no payment on a hot item. Will I get paid there is a small percentage I won’t have to go through eBay for a none payment claim and have waisted 2 days it could have been picked up by real buyers. As we make not a cent. eBay weed out BS.",5
323,"Been an eBay seller since 2011: I have been selling on eBay since 2011. Yes, that long. I’ve seen it evolve and change a lot since then. What I see now is a scammers wasteland and no protection anymore for sellers. eBay has lost its touch. Today I removed all of my listing I had up for sale and moved elsewhere. There is absolutely no protection for sellers from scammers, or people trying to get things for free, it seems it is easy for these people to do this on ebay, because ebay will always side with the buyer, and screw over the seller. My last dozen orders have been from scammy buyers, which is big influx. This has never happened before. I no longer feel safe selling on eBay. I’ve never lost this much on eBay before, and I know there is nothing actually wrong with my items or listings, I’ve been doing this for a very long time and I’m still young. The hassle is no longer worth it. I’m getting items returned that aren’t what I sent or aren’t the condition I sent them in. I can’t afford this anymore. BYE EBAY",1
324,"Somehow Still Didn’t get my money back: I ordered from a seller. Turns out the person who I bought from no longer had it in stock and I’m thinking…why is it still up then?? I ask for a refund and they didn’t accept it but would send me on since I never received it. After they allowed to request a refund I didn’t hear from them since. I tried getting EBAY to step in but nothing worked. They kept telling me the case is still open and wait for seller to contact me. Turns out the seller completely deleted their account, everything. I tried to find customer service and magically everything was down. By the time they were up and running my case closed and I couldn’t even get my money. This app is CONFUSING, and I would’ve been able to get my money back if I couldve have found an agent or an assistant. Everytime I clicked on something it sent me to a new article even when I pressed on “Contact us.” Sick of this",2
325,"Not a great experience: Selling on eBay is difficult and very time consuming.  The platform is full of scam buyer accounts.  Zero accountability for buyers, huge fees and zero protection for sellers.  If you block a problem buyer, they just open 5 more accounts.  eBay will literally take your money and let the buyer keep the product.  You have zero control as a seller.  Definitely do not link you checking account and don’t use PayPal to receive payments.  It’s crazy what eBay is allowed to get away with, and it’s crazy to me that the platform still exist with 14% fees.  They even charge you that percentage on shipping and sales tax collected.  So eBay is technically profiting a few times for each sale and if you use PayPal even MORE fees!  By the time it’s all said and done at least with my experience selling old video games, I kept about 60% of the value collected.  There are game stores that are buying at those prices.  FB and Craigslist don’t even collect fees.  Baffling how eBay is still anything.  Lessons learned moving on.",1
326,"Kind of a joke: I can’t believe an app like eBay works so poorly. I use it primarily for selling, and it has so many issues I can’t believe they haven’t fixed! I get a message! I click it, says “Something must have gone wrong” (bid cancellation by a buyer, have to check my email to see what item it was on, the app message won’t load). If someone wins more than one auction, you can’t leave feedback. BUT, the app keeps asking me to leave feedback, and I get an error when I try, can’t clear the notification. Same with offers, if I don’t accept and time expires, there’s still a notice “you have an offer” that also errors out if you click it. Lasts until the entire auction ends. I have also had the app ask me to relist auctions that ended in a sale, so I’m listing things that I don’t have! Please figure it out eBay, I’m ready to give up! (And don’t use the iPhone app, use a desktop, eBay isn’t ready for phone app tech, which is sad). Thanks.",2
327,Ebay doesn’t protect you as seller!!!: Worst place to sell is ebay the fees they take out for everything are high and they don’t protect you as seller. A buyer could have buyers remorse and even though you don’t accept returns. The buyer can go ahead and claim you didn’t describe item as or pictures don’t match and suddenly you have to accept the return. Ebay doesn’t even let you as seller plead your case or explain that yes indeed the item is as described and pictures clearly show the item. Now you have to pay for the item to be returned. Let’s say your item made it to the buyer in perfect condition and now you hope that you get the same item you sent back to realize that it’s damaged and or it’s been replaced by a fake. Selling here is pointless. Don’t waste your time and stress out like I had to. It’s not worth it which how much money they make off of you as a seller but don’t protect you when it comes to defending yourself from buyers that corrupt the loopholes that are within Ebay. You’ll thank me later,1
328,"eBay was great now not so much: Wow eBay used to be fantastic. I was able
To buy sell
Without hassles, now they want everything to be done within their app and I’m sorry to say the infrastructure isn’t quite there yet. They want to take all the fees both PayPal and eBay and keep them for themselves. On top of older users unable to withdraw funds from their accounts.  
Also buyer protections have gone to far. The other week I had a buyer buy a used item he claimed item not as described I asked what was wrong as I am a meticulous seller and ensure everything is taken care of prior to shipping he said he won’t even test it because it looks disassembled I clarified the item was marked as used I took it apart to ensure no dust or debris was inside so the life of the product could be extended. I asked if he could please test the item as I purchased insurance, he did not and continued to claim item not as described forcing me to lose both ways in shipping. Absolute bull/s! 
I am done with eBay. I pulled all my sales and I cannot get any of my money out of the new system",1
329,"The app is wonderful: I absolutely love this app and the folks that work for eBays app support. I’ve had two issues I found in VoiceOver mode this year and both times when I submitted information to their customer service, it was fixed within one month. There are lots of apps out there that offer some level of VoiceOver accessibility, but the accessibility in this app is exceptional and where they stand apart from the rest of the voiceover accessible apps is eBay’s dedication to listening and fixing any bugs in the app. Each time I submit the feedback to their customer service, I will hear back from them usually within a day telling me that they were going to forward it on to their tech-support and will treat it as a  priority.  Again this is very impressive to me since most other companies don’t do this.",5
330,"1 Decade: Ive been using Ebay for about a decade now, and especially in the last 5-6yrs i’ve made hundreds of purchases and spent a good amount. i’ve pretty much never had an issue even with sellers, and the 3-4 times i have had issues ebay steps in almost immediately and sends a refund(roughly 400 purchases). I like the app so much because i can easily use key word for searches on hard to find items, you can also see the sellers ship location, which is primarily how i decide what to order. all of ebay’s filters work great. i wish everyone else would catch on. I’ve also sold 6 item in the last few years, it’s been really easy and the fees were pretty minor especially for a hobbyist like myself +their shipping discount. 10/10 would recommend",5
331,"Revision history unavailable on mobile version of website or in the app.: There is no way to see the revision history of a listing on a mobile device in the app or on the website. Even if you request the desktop version of the site it still omits this crucial metric. Without revision history it is much more difficult to estimate the amount of time something has been listed for on eBay. Generally there is currently no good way to judge the amount of time something has been for sale. For determining value using sales history over 90 day period of similar items, current number of watchers, price and number and kind of listing revisions, this can only be done on a desktop format device. This information being accessible on a mobile device would be extremely useful and I hope they consider adding this in future versions of the eBay app.",3
332,"Not bad: Lots of people trying to scam people on here. It seems that just like any other marketplace sort of thing like this, buyer beware. Do your research, ask questions to the seller about the product so it’s not a pictured surprise. I don’t understand why eBay doesn’t regulate this more… but I had a pretty good experience. What I was shown was as pictured. I buy art supplies so it’s easy to get scammed on here. For my first purchase I was pretty pleased though. Lessons learned as well. But I think its app and browser version are pretty easy technically to use. Searching things I’m finding tricky but I’m starting to figure out and use eBay vocab (i.e. ‘lot’). But, every time I search a slightly different way I get drastically different results. Maybe a better system of how things are listed? Idk it’s not my job to fix your company. That’s my review lol. Adios",4
333,"2nd Year EBay Seller: I love selling on EBay. It’s easy and fun, and a great way to make some extra money. But Ebay doesn’t have their sellers back. If it wasn’t for sellers than Ebay wouldn’t exist. So when a problem arises with a buyer, EBay should support the seller decision within reason than instead automatically taking the buyer word. Buyers can be wrong , but it doesn’t seem to matter in the least to EBay. Ebay should consider the financial consequences that this inflicts on its sellers. Since this past review EBay has gotten better at managing problem buyers. I still think this is a great way to make extra money and I love working on my EBay Premium Store. Maybe next time I am asked to give a review it will be 5 stars for EBay they are improving and I am very pleased with this change.",5
334,"The page changes of purchase history: After I updated the app...The changes in the app and on a browser of the purchase history page is horrible! I can’t get to anything other than the last few days.  I asked sellers to send invoices, the individual items purchased are mixed in with invoices items, individually ,  in a way I can’t see the invoices to pay them. The sight was much better before. Those invoices are also not in my cart so I can’t pay them from there!
The changes may work for someone only buy a few items but when you make 90 purchases in 2 days this purchase history page is useless! I have called Customer service 2 times over this. They finally sent me a link to get to my pages of purchase history. Now when I go to pay the 4 invoices I was only able to pay 2 because the other ones go to an unavailable action message page. So I’m unable to pay the invoice. Go back to the way it was this is frustrating and I’ve been buying and selling on eBay for years. FIX IT‼️‼️‼️",1
335,"Invoice charges: I used eBay to sell a few things i didn’t need and make some extra money. As far as my understanding goes, you’re charged an invoice when you sell things. I was charged a $20 invoice when i didn’t sell anything, so i contacted customer service. They canceled the invoice but wouldn’t put the money back on my card, they put it on my eBay account to go towards the next invoice. Okay, that’s fine i guess. I was charged another 3 invoices (all at least $12) when i didn’t sell anything. I don’t think that $20 went toward those invoices because i kept getting emails from PayPal about the money being withdrawn from my account. I emailed customer service twice about this and didn’t hear back either time. I tried removing my paypal information from my eBay account several times over a span of about 2 weeks. Every time i tried it said i couldn’t remove it because payments were being processed. Very disappointed with the way things were handled on eBay’s end and will not be using this app in the future.",1
336,"What an awful experience.: I’ve been using eBay for years and used to swear by it, until I came on as a seller. It’s been nothing but a headache. I particularly buy and sell luxury watches - supposedly a speciality for eBay. After a year of having a desirable watch listed $1500 below market- nothing. In fact, the watch did sell twice to scammers trying to get my personal info and now eBay wants to charge me an ad cost even though the buyers NEVER payed. Instead I got scammers trying to get personal info / mailing the watch and no help from eBay. 
Finally, I sell the watch. It’s a mess, they take a $550 commission on a $5k watch and the darn thing gets held up at one of their authenticity centers. The watch was as described, authentic, and has no damage but one of the freaking papers was wrong so now I’m stuck in this mess. 

I’m done, once the deal is through I will never use this app again. I’d have better luck getting robbed, at least in that case someone gets a freaking watch and I’d be where I’m at now. No money in hand.",1
337,"Bad user experience, blurry photo uploads: 1. Photos uploaded from my iPhone which look fine everywhere else, including when I upload them to my computer/Photoshop, look terrible- blurry and all my edits made in apple Photos are stripped. I’ve checked all the settings. This issue stretches back years and eBay shrugs and thinks it’s not their problem. This should be effortless regardless of the users end. 

 2. Who are your UX designers? Hidden info in pulldowns everywhere. Features like make an offer  randomly turn on sometimes. I find it so easy to make a mistake in this app and it’s so many clicks to list something. This also feeds into distrust. 

 3. “Recommended” prices and shipping are garbage. I’m selling something and have every descriptor in the title and photos yet eBay simply sees a couple words and conflates it with a totally different product. This is every item I sell. The shipping also completely wrong, god forbid you accidentally trust or mistakenly click the button. 

 4. Deceptive. Shipping prices by users and recommended by eBay are complete lies, smaller and lighter than the actual items. It’s outright fraud. Additionally, I can’t believe they get away with the hidden fees. No where it mentions what global shipping costs unless you click little info buttons. Imagine if a retailer didn’t give you a total for what your purchasing. It no different for a service.",2
338,"Hidden fees; Better off to use Facebook Market: Ebay does state that they charge seller fees, however I have found in 3 places that these are mentioned in small print under a very large print mention of “LIST FOR FREE”. In addition the fees are difficult to discern as the user has to go down a path of several too many links to find out where and what they are. Lastly, even if your items do not sell, you can still be charged for the listing.

Facebook Market, on the other hand, currently integrates easily used shipping options for making purchases and sales around the country. Currently there may be less product offerings, but it seems likely that it will catch up or surpass eBay eventually as people start to learn how much easier it is to use and sell on. Additionally, they do not charge listing fees.

Out of almost 2 million reviews, I doubt anyone will find this review, nor will it have any effect on eBay’s concern for this issue, I hope it may at least help someone else out there who may be new to selling on eBay.",1
339,Garbage!! 👎🏼🏃🏿‍♀️✋🏼: Don’t be like me an be so quick to think resolving a matter to get a refund is a cake walk everything will be smooth sailing (eBay money back guarantee) is definitely not all it’s cracked up to be. I requested a refund from a seller whom never shipped and didn’t have any tracking or delivery info even after marking the item shipped same day I bought it days later seller even confirmed through messages still hadn’t shipped to add insult to injury seller closed the request and denied my refund then became unresponsive and still haven’t shipped! 😡 Stupid eBay leave it up to sellers to approve or deny your refund request even though seller don’t ship!!! No way to directly contact support within app or elsewhere just keep taking you through the same loopy stupid things within app that gets you NOWHERE!! I want my refund or else it will be disputed with my credit card company!! This seller nor eBay is gonna keep my money for something their  shady seller never shipped! My advice to anyone use Posh or Mercari and get 💯 percent better service!,1
340,"Shipping: Too many sellers tell me that eBay does not allow them to use the “request total” option when ordering multiple items from one seller. An example would be when ordering a half yard of fabric the shipping is $4, but if you order 6 half yards the shipping total does not adjust and you can not request a different total so the shipping charges come to be $24 for 3 yards of fabric which is ludicrous. Then you have to contact the seller to make sure they will refund your shipping overages after payment goes through. It’s too complicated and a puts you in a position where you have to pay charges ahead of time . I don’t like dealing with it and am less likely to purchase those items. Make it easier for sellers to adjust their shipping.",5
341,One stop shop for everything!!!: I know I know  I’ve been a member for a very long time and I’ve never wrote a review. Well I guess it’s time for to write one... I love shopping on eBay I buy just about everything I need on here... I used to sell a lot but I don’t have the time anymore with 2 kids and work and other stuff going on... But to sell items on here I had a blast doing it and it was very easy.. I used to sell Star Wars toys so I would get into a role play of a use star ship salesman on the outer rim ... loved it... I love buying just as much... I meet all kinds of people... I recently bought a  Star Wars black series speeder bike a person and now we stay in contact and turns out he’s a great friend as well... not trying to be cheesy just telling to truth.. not only do you get great items on eBay you can get great friends!!!!,5
342,"Don’t buy anything in this app!: They don’t care about the buyer just about the seller, and their eBay Money Back Guarantee is fraud, not real at all... I’m and loyal and honored buyer in this app and I’ve bought a lot of items, phones, electronics, fragrances, everything... and always recommend it to friends but not anymore... I made a purchase of two items that I never received it and I opened a case about it because I wanted the Items and eBay just said “ After reviewing all the details of this case, we determined that you won't receive a refund” sh I wasn’t even asking for a refund I was just asking for help to be able to find my package but they closed my case and now I can’t do anything about it... it’s so unfair... I’m so disappointed!! And it’s more than $300 what they made me lost... I will never use this app again because no one solved me or helped me at all... don’t even have the option to appeal and I’ll let people know in social media and everywhere about this so no one else gets affected it.",1
343,"EBAY SCAMMED ME!!: I decided to sell something on eBay and then changed my mind.  eBay still charged me $200 for a service fee for a item I never sold. THEY LIED and marked the product as sold and then proceeded to charge my card $200 for the service. STAY AWAY FROM EBAY If you don’t want them pulling random money off your card. I’m in the middle of contacting my attorney to press charges against eBay for reporting false allegations/information to the irs. They reported that I sold a product over $600 to the IRS and that’s a lie. This has happened to MANY ppl before so this is NOT new. STAY AWAY FROM EBAY! They will take from you! 

I recommend selling on FACEBOOK MARKET or Craigslist to be honest. More safe and FREE. EBAY will charge you regardless if you actually sell the item or not. BE CARFUL they do shady business. STAY AWAY!",5
344,"Unnecessary Quagmire: I started selling on eBay around April and at first, it was fine. Around November when they switched from using PayPal for payouts to their direct system is when my experience became frustrating. Currently, I am unable to receive payouts to my bank account for some unexplained reason, so my money is on hold but I’m still charged for shipping labels and the monthly invoice in the same bank account. I don’t have an alternative back account except for a relative’s and when I try changing it, it won’t let me change the bank account and when I try getting help I just get looped through useless articles. Everything was fine using PayPal. Use another site for selling, hopefully, something that doesn’t ask for your bank account.",5
345,"1 Major Issue: After years of using the app I would figure they would eventually allow us to delete purchases from the “Purchases” section that have multiple items per order. Example: I ordered 4 books from a seller. The seller combines the shipping and payment is made. Items are received. After checking the books and leaving feedback I wish to delete the order for the 4 books, but the app doesn’t allow it. The app had never allowed me, for over 6 years, to do this simple task. I don’t understand why this never gets addressed in any update. My “Purchases” section is filled with past purchases that the app refuses to let me delete because the sale was a combined shipping order? Why isn’t this addressed at all? If it were, I’d give the app 5 stars. However, ignoring this minor issue year after year, update after update just seems lazy.",3
346,"Siding with Fraud: I sold a brand new, unopened, $2300 graphics card for $1750. eBay used to be the Wild West where they were starting to work on decent buyer protection. Apparently they took that too far. I did not accept returns, but the user opened the card up and then tried to link it with another card. He probably didn’t realize it must be linked with only the same type of card and then he decided to return it to me. The manufacturer still had the full warranty.

eBay forced me to take a return on the card at full value even though it was used and scratched around the link port. They did this during the week I was out of my home helping my wife with the birth of our son. The money had already been fully transferred to my bank account which I immediately used to pay off debt for the costs surrounding my sons birth (no insurance). They did not show me a policy explaining why they made such a decision. I’m done with them. I don’t accept returns on unopened items. This is why manufacturer warranties exist!",1
347,"Skips Messages and Limited Access: It skips messages in the eBay message center. It also won't allow you to respond to cases in the resolution center. Just when you think you've resolved the issue with your customer in a 5 minute nicely written paragraph it won't send and gets deleted . The error message says to try again later. This has been an on going issue for months. It happens on my iPad Air 2 and on my iPhone 7.  You also can't contact the buyer by clicking on his user name. Well the desktop version allows that. All these problems result in more unhappy customers. Life is tough for eBay sellers and this app just complicates it further. Do you understand how hard it is to communicate with eBay support. They barely speak English and after pleading your case good luck!  The representative most likely wont believe a word you say. Instead You'll get, "" I don't show any record here that you reached out to your buyer ""  .....man what a nightmare. This app is awful for sellers however it is quite useful if your just a buyer.",1
348,"Having an issue with adding and removing stuff in watch list!: Thought this was resolved many build ago but this persistent bug keeps returning every other build version released. Problem develops shortly after you get a pop up notification claiming to have maxed out your watch list! Even going back and deleting some items you end up with another error message popping up claiming you cannot delete an item. This is where things get strange, you go and close the app even close it in background and relaunch it the app return back to some what normal without this bug in the watch list. At first I thought it was a network bug, instead think it is the app not communicating with eBay correctly on first launch for the day.  This is the only issue and the app works 99% of the time.",4
349,"There are no worse deceivers on earth.: account name. IGM LLC don’t sell it from them. they trust your money. and then they block your account. as it happened to me. I registered a business account and put up goods for five thousand dollars, just under 4,900. sold it safely without any questions. paid a fee for the sale of a little more than seven hundred dollars, or rather, they took it themselves. in the end there should be a little more than four thousand dollars left. after which they withheld my funds for a month since it was a new account. I waited. Afterwards they completely blocked my account. and they don’t say anything why or for what. I can’t take the money. since the account is blocked, they told me why we can’t tell you, why we can’t tell you, they said that your money will be sent to the state, that’s where you have to prove that you are its owner. if anything I sold a professional bike for $4,900. What should I do ? who knows the answer. Help?
There is no feedback or help in resolving the issue.",1
350,"Why?  Seriously, why?!?: Every time eBay updates their app, they make it worse. It seems like eBay designers change the app, just to say they did something. Personally, as a seller, it was at its best 7-8 years ago, when you could edit your html, get instant access to relisting, see your full size pics, and get instant previews without ever having to go into the website, except to ship. Now, you can’t rely on eBay to see if your item needs to be relisted, no html in the app and twice the steps to do it on the website, you have to enter a sale page and then go to the item page, so twice the work to do what wasn’t broken before, still can’t reliably do everything on your listing in either the app or the website, so you STILL need both. If it was easy to switch platforms I would’ve left eBay years ago. Sellers, stay away from eBay!",3
351,One problem: One thing that I don’t like out of a few about eBay is that on your site people ask for the most ridiculous high price four items that I personally think that should not be high priced especially when they say very hard to find items and the items are not hard to fine. But most of all is when they ask for a high price they have the nerve to ask for shipping which sometimes is also a high price you would think when they place a price on this shipping would be included I don’t see why I should have to pay $120 for something plus $20-$50 shipping and handling. A lot of the times the total that price I could go out and buy in the store for that and have it right then and there instead of waiting for it to come in the mail. That’s all thank you,4
352,"Wonderful- eBay seller since 1997.: I have been using eBay since its infancy days where you could leave yourself your own positive feedback LOL. To watch the changes from those early days up until this new updated app is just truly astounding. It’s amazing to see how far Collectibles and what not have gone in terms of value since eBay his early days. The app is intuitive, easy to use, make selling and purchasing a snap.

My only wish is that when you select for Auction Type listings – I wish you could sort for highest number of bids first. That option is present for the website version of eBay but MISSING for the app version of eBay.

Thank you again for one of the best apps available on cell phones today! This is coming from a user who has been on the Internet since the early 90s LOL!!",5
353,"Selling: Selling has changed since the last time I sold. This new setup has less options, was unable to find option that I would pay shipping and handling. Had already taken and checked out pictures I had taken of my item to sell, but only 5 pictures came up, none of them were the ones I had previously taken and checked to make sure the item looked it’s best. Ended up having to take pictures, not quite as professional as the pictures I had already taken.
BUYING; I recently bought a trilogy set, blu ray which didn’t describe it as not being able to play in American players. Out of the 3, only 1 played. Contacted seller who stated they were rated for other countries. Have not heard anything else from him and ordered another set, which I checked would play in US.",5
354,"eBay is a wonderful service and a terrific easy to use app: I always feel safe selling on eBay and when I buy on eBay I feel the same that I am protected. I've really enjoyed selling items over the years from things I have bought that I didn't need that were brand new two things that I had in the house I did not need anymore, but could be useful to someone else. eBay should also be applauded for its efforts at recycling. What I mean is that it's such a great way to redistribute unneeded items to people that need them instead of things that may end up sitting around and eventually go into the dump. It's also a great way for the citizens effected by the recent hurricanes to get items that are not available in stores in their area. I am grateful for eBay both as a buyer and a seller. Thank you!",5
355,"Thank You eBay: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This platform is the one and only for all your buying and selling needs. No matter what your looking for. eBay can and will help you achieve it. 

Buyers can instantly find just about anything for an unbeatable price. 

Sellers have so many great tools and options to customize their store to their liking. The eBay platform is unbeatable in their ability to help the average person achieve a high level of success in whatever their goal is. 

The options and tools an eBay store gives are a necessity to my business's success. Their interface is very user friendly and easy to use. A store is definitely worth the affordable price. These tools have helped me to change my side gig into a successful business. If you want the same? I highly recommend looking into opening a store to utilize all their amazing tools. 

 My eBay store has saved me so much headache, time, and money giving me freedom and piece of mind. 

I promise you that there’s no other site or platform online that even comes close to what ebay offers. Thank you eBay for all that you have done for me and my business.

356,"Need feature so we can do tax exempt sales.: We need option to add reseller permit so we can purchase from any seller with tax exempt permit. We should not have to establish tax exempt with each seller out there. EBay should be able to provide tax exempt info during checkout. This is must feature we are dealing with eBay not an individual. EBay should take this to consideration having this feature. 
Yes of course work out bad sellers at the same time. 

First why do we need to see ads in this app, I am here to shop why are integrating ads in it. That's just ridiculous way to do business it's like you are running ads campaign. 
2nd What's wrong with eBay 
They should get 2nd opinion before rolling it out.
Horrible it suppose to get better but with eBay is the other way around. Makes it harder and harder 
You used to it here comes the update totally crap we don't time to learn it from scratch again and again.
UI is terrible lack of features wow is the developer that person needs big slap what they thinking come on.
Why have paypal involve in this. I didn't get it. 
First eBay fees and then PayPal fees. It's simply not fair for sellers. 

I see same item 1 seller is charging 5 bucks for shipping and another seller is charging $25 bucks makes no sense to me be practical.
Lot of time manufacture don't even cover under warranty because it was bought on eBay 
Someone needs to look into it. Lot to say but no time.",2
357,"Search is Broken: I’ve been using eBay since the mid 2000s and I’m sad to say I’m going to stop using it and use alternative websites. It used to be a great place to find anything, literally. Over the last five years the search function has been changing. It shows me things that are completely unrelated to what I searched for and hides things I would actually like to see. The search is no longer based on the exact words you use, and seems to use some kind of natural language processing. It’s like it’s trying to predict what you’re searching for instead of actually using the words you use. 

*looks at the camera*
 
EBay, you can’t fix user error. If someone enters a wrong word or misspells something, suggesting words makes sense. Not allowing someone to look for EXACTLY what they searched for only discourages people from using your platform. As a seller I wouldn’t want to list anything because I don’t trust your service to show my products when people search for them.",1
358,You are not my Business and you do not represent me: I believe I’ve been selling on eBay for approximately 15 years and unlike some sellers I never sell anything new unless it’s a product that for whatever reason I didn’t use. I tried to describe the object as best as I can but as many pictures as I can. In every case this is an auction and it is not a retail store will you get to take things back. Each of my auctions are clearly marked no refund however your crybaby mentality has now started with the buyer on several items that did not deserve to be refunded and the buyer never sent the product back to me text her losing my money thanks for losing my shipping and for that reason you’re not the company that you used to be.

What originally was a 48 hour hold on my money to confirm this buyer got what he paid for turned into 170 days. there’s no option for appeal and no option to even know what I did wrong. With my account being permanently locked, the buyer issued a return request before even receiving the package. eBay, so concerned about business being conducted a certain way that they are making it impossible to conduct business in the first place. After everything is said and done I have $650 sitting in the account that’s locked while I wait 170 days hoping to get my money.

Specifically with fraudulent jewelry sellers listing 5ct diamonds for $129- you know this is huge problem on your site and I am sure it’s difficult to reduce the number of fraudulent listings - it would be a proactive approach for frequent eBay buyers that are otherwise turned away by huge swaths of fake items when searching common key words.",5

On the 2nd order, I didn't receive the item on time and the seller instantly was like do u want a refund wasn't trying to solve the issue. I told them yeah (I want a refund)because it was a gift and it wasn't here in time and I placed the order way ahead of time... Oh and this last one that just happened today. I have been trying to message the seller for a tracking number and it was saying that the person wasn't registered for the site. Now if that's the case the person should not gave been able to take my money in the 1st place... But I was scammed. Despite I'm getting the money back get rid of all fake accounts.

It's always worked and I've always enjoyed it. The periodic changes are bothersome. Right now I'm happy with it. Updating the above, I still like it and still have the same reservations. And once again. But they’ve added what I think of as targeted advertising...good effort but not very sophisticated, but then how could it be.

Not worth a minute of my time. 
      eBay; When people work hard at trying your service being charged for it as well, don’t abuse they’re trust and kindness by giving false information and changing the rules according to your personal preferences because “you can” I understand you have the upper hand and I fully respect that but the respect isn’t reciprocated .

370,"Just not worth it anymore: eBay used to be a great way to get rid of old stuff.  Not anymore.  If you list an item with a reserve price they basically charge 23% in fees then an additional 10% every time your item doesn’t sell and they relist your item again and again without your consent to do so.  Not realizing this I actually lost money because it got relisted several times.  Also the discount on shipping is a fallacy, you can get just as good rates in some cases better printing the label off the shippers website.  With Facebook marketplace, offer up, and heck even Craigslist you can pretty much sell whatever with zero fees and you can set up shipping through Facebook and offer up for only a 3% fee… ✌️ out eBay, you were once a great pioneer in selling online but like most companies your greed has pushed out another longtime user.

371,"eBay - A great market place for Sellers & Buyers!: Why pay more for items when they can be found for less on eBay? I’m a long-time eBay buyer and have learned that buying on eBay through PayPal is a safe, discounted way to purchase items. 

Buyers should know, however, about of eBay’s wonderful  buyer protection policy! This allows you, the buyer,  to return any item bought at the seller’s expense, if items do not match the sellers’ descriptions on eBay! 

Sharp negotiating skills are important too when buyers allow sellers to make an offer for items or put them up for auction. Either way, ebay is a terrific marketplace as long as buyers are willing to ask sellers precise info (ie. measurements for apparel) and take their time to carefully read the seller’s descriptions!",5
372,"New messaging is nice but buggy making it unusable: Old ebay messaging is the worst. I’m surprised it wasn’t modernized earlier. Today saw the button to try the new messaging. Was excited to see it looking reasonable. But quickly got disappointed by its bugs and had to switch back. 
1. While I’m typing in a message, all of a sudden it would just remove my latest part of the message. And I had to type in same thing multiple times. Maybe when I start typing it tries to save a draft, but then I continue to type in and then it “decides” to revert to the previously saved state? Silly and this makes this feature unusable. Do ebay engineers and PMs not testing their product?
2. I had message thread with somebody opened on my screen. And that person just sent me another message. Instead of it appearing among the other messages, the app showed me push notification about new message. I have exactly this thread already opened and active on my screen. 🤦",1
373,"Problematic for sellers: I've been selling on ebay for a few months now, and the app is definitely NOT the way to do it. Which is really disappointing, since I am without a computer at the moment. The problems are insidious too. For example, the app keeps changing the weight and size of my packages, which makes the customer's shipping charges incorrect. So then I have to cancel the shipping label and redo it, which is another thing that can't be done through the app. Some things seem to work fine - uploading photos, creating the description, and pricing. But everything to do with shipping is a huge hassle. Luckily, the ebay support people have been very helpful. I honestly think it is the best phone support I've ever encountered, which I guess is necessary considering how byzantine the experience of selling on ebay is. Not for the faint of heart.

I've decided to remove another star, because it seems with every update, the app gets more and more unusable as a way to list products. It's solely the browser for me.",1

376,"App is fine. This is eBay review: This app works just fine. I have a serious issue with how eBay auctions are being handled. I have tried bidding on items that I ultimately found are also listed on another sellers page as well. They start the bid low and then as soon as someone bids on it, they go in from their other account and increase the max bid up to the price it is listed for on their other selling page. So they are forcing prices to be what they want them to be instead of allowing people to bid and win auctions. Very frustrating. 

Also, there is no way for them to hold sellers accountable. And a transaction has to be 30 days past before any assistance can be had. This is crazy. I am surprised that eBay is still afloat given that they payout their sellers before items even ship. I am curious how much loss they have taken because of this.",3
377,"Service: Customer service is totally disappointing. No good avenue for buyers to deal with poor sellers. As a long time ebay customer I am finding it more and more difficult to utilized eBay. No way to resolve issues quickly and efficiently, especially with those issues are related to eBay and it’s policies making it nearly impossible to communicate and resolve issues caused by eBay’s platform. Beyond upsetting. Although I still use eBay, it is out last resort when looking for things. It so also the reason we haven’t sold on eBay in many many years not so we have plans to in the future. The disrespect we have received when dealing with or trying to resolve issues with eBay is beyond degrading. All the best!

One unhappy customer",5
378,"eBay app: eBay app is essential in finding products (any  products) for individual needs, gifts for family and friends, or splurge and order something you’ve always wanted. The products come from coast to coast and internationally. I have gotten products from Russia, Great Britain, Germany, as well as other places. If you are unhappy, get a wrong size, color or the particular products do not fit your specific needs, just return . Most vendors will send a return label and you are set to go. Shipping is free in most cases and eBay will help you in any way feasible to make sure you are happy with your order result. When you do order make sure you read the description of the products included with your order. The app is free. Enjoy your shopping.",5
379,"Not a complete app: eBay likes to pretend like this is a mobile app. It’s not. I cannot upload the pictures they now require of my drivers license. Didn’t need that for the 17 years I’ve been using eBay now, but okay, fair is fair. I can’t even upload photos due to the shoddy coding of this app. You’re requiring me to do something, and holding payments, and your terrible coding won’t even let me do that. I’m not near my computer and now eBay has put everything on hold. I now have to go to a computer, transfer pictures from my phone over to that computer and probably upload to the ACTUAL COMPLETE desktop version, rather than this subpar mobile app that won’t even let you as a seller post that you’re on vacation. Easy fixes guys. Rather than doing good work over the last year, you’ve made your service unusable. Can’t even get payouts through PayPal anymore. 17 years of loyalty and you guys can’t even figure out how to pay me or receive a drivers license photo. Nice.",1
380,"I love eBay so much but…: Okay so I didn’t kno where or how to find the right place for me to bring up this specific problem up so here I am. 
Recently eBay released a new update and in this update it had an AMAZING new feature- that feature was a “Find similar items” button that would show up on the bottom left of a listings pictures (and you could use it for every picture within that listing it was so clever and made finding more of a rare type item and similar ones easier) and within the past day ? 1/2 day maybe? It’s now gone and I am so bummed! I’ve tried everything to make sure I didn’t somehow turn this feature off or anything like that but yea it’s gone , so I guess my question is what happened ?",5
381,"Pretty good but not fully functional: I like the eBay app.  It makes a lot of things easy.  Selling is pretty easy.  Snap pic on phone and start listing.  

A new issue in that all items go out with a Best Offer option that you can only remove on the web browser version.  That’s frustrating!!!

Some of the settings are not available for restricting buyers and such.  But, over all pretty easy.

I cannot access the seller account information like fees and pay account do I still have to use the desktop version in addition to the app. Same issue on the mobile browser.  Even if you pick classic site, you can’t do seller account maintenance.

 
Buying, the biggest lack of feature has been the request total button that is on the classic site.  When buying multiple items from the same seller, using the shopping cart, a buyer can commit to buying all the items but ask for a combined shipping invoice.  Normally, this saves the buyer a few bucks.  It can be substantial if you buy several items and pay the individual shipping fees.  Then, the seller sends in one box.  He is not obligated to combine shipping and he just made out on the overpayment.

I think you will like the app.  I have found a few things I could use in the feature set though.",4
382,"Problems with Ebay and Ebay AP: The three things i hate the most about the ebay mobile ap: searches always default to prioritizing best match even after i change settings to highest prices firs, it never saves anything and always have to change that on every search. The other stupid thing is the bid two dollars more buttons they show on the mobile ap when your items are about to close if you are selling stuff it means your items only go up $2 at the end of the auction and if your bidding last minute its never enough to actually win the item. And i dont know what ebay did to their search optimization but i can’t make the stuff i want to buy show up anymore. Ebay wont show it to me unless i use some convoluted way of searching. So yeah what good is the ap if ebay only shows you the sponsored crap made in CHINA? YES EBAY ITS REALLY PAST TIME TO FIX THE AP AND THE SEARCH ENGINE YOUR NEW ALGORITHMS DONT WORK!",3
383,Ancient Platform: I’ve used Ebay for years and years. And one thing I’ve noticed throughout all those years. It’s the same platform. There have been no significant enhancements to the platform for as long as I can remember. Just one example; show me all the purchases I’ve made since 2010. Show me all my sales for the last 5 years.  It just can’t do it. And that’s ridiculous. Another thing I’ve noticed is. The payout system is awful now. It used to be ok. When you had paypal. No longer.  I typically have to wait to get a payout. You guys have got a great opportunity. An opportunity to have one of the premier e-commerce auction sites on the planet. But it’s like you’re all asleep. Slowly your sellers were starting to trickle away and move to alternative platforms. My guess is this has already started to happen. Act now. Don’t hesitate. Spend the money to make a truly exceptional e-commerce platform.  It’s not 2003 anymore.,2
384,"Love it: I have been using eBay for a few years now and I am very pleased with my purchases through the years. The sellers except once have been great and the one time there was an issue eBay helped me to get my refund. I enjoy searching items and I have received items exactly as described. If any issues the sellers work with me to resolve them. I will continue to use eBay and I recommend others to start or continue. I enjoy the fun of searching items and finding bargains many times even better than I can buy in the store locally and I’m helping a business, individual, etc… Thank you sellers and thank you eBay for the opportunity to buy with so many options. I absolutely love being part of the eBay community! 😃",5
385,"Scammers all over the app: This is the most frustrating experience I’ve ever had with anything in my life. I was trying to sell an item and within an hour I was contacted by over 7 scammers. I didn’t get an offer from a single genuine buyer. Luckily I realized the scams before it was too late but I almost lost over a $1,000 worth of items. eBay seriously needs to crack down on these schemes before even more people get scammed out of their possessions. I am very new to selling items over the internet but after 8 hours of using this app, I’m over trying to ever sell anything online again. I hope eBay cracks down on these accounts so that people who don’t know any better not only loses their possessions, but their money as well.",5
386,I’m done with eBay: I always have problems with eBay there is never a good run with them. I am surprised they even have 4.8 stars when they deserve negative zero. I spent so much money on this over thousands of dollars and they can’t even help me with people who don’t give me my full refund for returning a item that wasn’t the item I wanted or they would have a item that is missing parts and still not give me the full amount I paid for. This last package never came In the mail and I never had that happen until I felt with a random seller who only had a few stuff for sell. I thought I hit the jackpot I even ordered some extra items that go with it. After a couple of years shopping on eBay I realized I don’t get the service I deserve or anyone deserves. It’s a mess right now and until I hear from my other friends who shop on here that it’s changed I’m not ever spending my money on this app ever again. Thanks for robbing me eBay. Thanks for having fraud sellers. 👎🏾,1
387,I found it!! On EBay as always 😍❤️👍🏽: I have been a LONG TIME member of eBay and I have both sold and bought from here many times over. I tend to find everything and most anything I have been looking for right here from the comfort of my couch. eBay has buyer protection and let me add I also started a PayPal account bc of eBay and that also offers me comfort of buying items w/o fear of giving private information out. eBay has given me many opportunities to gain the things I wouldn’t have found any place else. Buying antiques and new items any day of the week. Their customer service is also incredible as I have never had any issues with ignorance or long wait times etc. Even after all this time eBay is still by far my favorite place to shop!!! Thanks eBay!!! 😍😁👍🏽❤️,5
388,"Used to be focused on the seller: This app (and Ebay itself) used to be clean and easy to use, it was equally balanced to the seller and buyer experience.  Clearly, Ebay has decided they have enough sellers or will always have sellers.  They don’t really serve sellers any more. Now the app pushes extra purchases and requires manually bypassing  multiple extra and costly push options every time you list or revise an item. Given that I already pay an average 13% commission for every sale, I feel the seller deserves a cleaner experience with no hard push to spend more or attempts to force Auction or Best Offer to be used. The entire Ebay environment now is advantaged toward the buyer and focused on maxing Ebay commissions, not the seller’s interests. The listing process keeps adding unnecessary extra steps and is getting clunkier with every new update.  I use as many other selling options as I can now before listing something on Ebay. Still use Ebay but to a lesser extent and will drop them completely when something better comes along.",1
389,"Payment error daily -stressful and really dissapointed.: I like Ebay because it quicks and easy buying, bidding, fun and lot of stuff i really love.
But payment is a nightmare for me. 
Sometime payment can be make and some time it cant. 
I am really nervous when i do the auction, because once i win, Ebay get me stuck on the payment even through Papal or Credit Card (confirm both options are really healthy credit). 
I have sent many message to the sellers for appologise due to the late payment or event cant make payment. It s too bad experience for me since i show respect to the sellers by buying their product with quick payment, and also respect my decision on auction.
Then everything is stuck. I called Ebay many time just like begging them to let me pay, i wasted lot of time talking to Ebay and end up for nothing. They said they see nothing wrong and dont know what to do. 
Then after like 24 hours, i can make payment for 2, 3 items and then it stuck again.
Ebay Service - if you read this, please help me to solve this situation, it s really bad for me since  there are things i want to buy, i want to pay, i want to keep relationship with sellers. 
If you know the feeling: you have money in your pocket, items you won in front of your face, sellers is there waiting for money, and you keep stuck begging for Ebay to let you pay. Then shpuldni rate a 1 star instead of 2.",2
390,Bad Update: The new app is terrible! In place of simplicity and ease of use they have decided to make it pretty and busy. Everything takes longer to do so don’t think you can get started easy. It is tedious and unnecessary how they wiped out the spare and appropriate version to provide one that you only like to look at but is miserable to use. I don’t know what they were thinking at all. The developers just had too much time that they stretched out nearly every single feature. It’s been done by people who never use it. They don’t know what people want. There is nothing new that helps. I have no idea who they got to do this but it will keep you from reaching your potential because there is simply no way to do anything fast even relisting which should be a flash or merely seconds. To relist one item on the app is forever scrolling searching. The poor features are also impossible to bypass. It’s just maddening. They asked no busy sellers what to do. They have literally never used the app to list and make a living.,1
391,"After 5.18.2 update Still Same Bug(s)!? Please fix ASAP!: eBay, since the last 5.18.2 update there are still bug(s) & things you missed folks!!!!: 

1.)Again........................... many many weeks/months and you still haven’t fixed the correct order or proper chronological sorted order based on from start or end date & time......of ENDED AUCTIONS?!?! CAN I GET MY SAVED ENDED AUCTIONS ALSO IN PROPER CHRONOLOGICAL SORTED ORDER PLEASE AS THEY USED TO BE! Why are simple things so hard??!! These Ended auctions are still all over the place and yes, we do keep & track our ended watched items and would like them to be in proper order as they used to be months back!! PLEASE FIX ASAP AS WHATS THE POINT OF TRACKING AUCTIONS IN ORDER WHEN THE SORT ORDER IS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND OUT OF ORDER!?!

Otherwise, some decent improvements that still need lots of work & tweaking !!!",5
392,Incredibly frustrating: Your app has closed on me too many times to count. When listing you better not leave the app or else it will close right away and wipe out everything you done. Even if i don’t back out of the app for a split second it will crash and then wipe out my entire description that i spend half an hour typing out. Never had the urge to throw my ipad after dealing with this. Huge time waster doing things multiple times to have it not pay out in the end. Would have been more productive to not list at all with the amount of time put into some items. Not sure if this was the newest update but for the love of god make a feature to save your progress if something goes wrong.,5
393,"More convenient to post listings than a laptop, but too hard to resist items: Have mixed feeling about the EBay app, but I think that it has more downfalls than pluses over using a EBay on a laptop. I like that it’s easy to take pictures of the items you want to list with your phone and post listings from the app, but then when the listings expire there is no way to bulk relist like there is on the website. Instead, there should be a way to select multiple unsold items and relist them all at the same time instead of having to go to each unsold item individually on the app (which is very time consuming). Also, I think there should be an easier way to ask for feedback from buyers such as a “Request Feedback” button or EBay should automatically ask buyers for a Feedback when the item is delivered. It’s too hard to maintain a Top Seller Rating when EBay makes it so difficult for sellers to ask for feedback and people that may not use EBay regularly don’t know how to leave it.",1
394,Constant spam and harassment: Everyday eBay harasses me with credit cards offers and spam notifications that are completely redundant. I have every notification turned off but there is no getting around the harassment of spam that eBay forced upon me. This makes my experience with app very unpleasant and I am debating on if it’s worth having the application on my phone anymore. On top of eBay spam I left negative feedback for a seller who is breaking eBay’s policies by giving false descriptions of their items and now the seller is repeatedly messaging me at all hours of the night. This app isn’t worth it. On top of all of that eBay promotes Chinese scammers selling counterfeit items. Chinese sellers wouldn’t be shipping American made products from China… this shall be reported to the federal authorities. Then they’re going to stop accepting AMEX due to greed and let’s not even speak of how it’s fine to sell Chinese counterfeit products but it’s not ok to sell many other items due to eBay policies.,1
395,"Theres alot of scams / no seller protection: Ebay lets buyers scam sellers by automatically issuing refunds for returns that have not arrived back to seller. A buyer can send a return back but before it makes it back to the seller, the buyer can file a claim with ebay and ebay will automatically issue a refund. Some buyers will send empty boxes or a different lower value item but the seller wont be able to know, thats IF and a big IF the item even gets delivered. Some buyers actually edit / modify seller address to render the item “undeliverable” due to wrong or non existent address just so the post office can return item back to the buyers while eBay sends them an automatic refund. So they get their money back and the item. Also good luck getting in touch with Ebay customer service. They dont have a phone number so everything is email. By the time they answer, the buyer has the money back and the item and they will disappear, leaving you at a loss and ebay ignoring your appeals.",1
396,"EBay ; the best that ever been.: Well EBay is the best website for buying and selling, hope it can address small issues like; sellers starting with 100% positive feedback,when they should start earning points until they get to a hundred. Besides that everything it’s alright. I highly recommend these guys. LED. Address your sellers they’re shipping way too late. 3 days is more than enough. Some of them are taking 5+ days and you are protecting them. Not fair. I just to think EBAY WAS GREAT. BUT NO. Cause not even an option to cancel a bid is provided. No check mark to see if a message has been seen. The prices for S&H from overseas is way too much; sometimes is greater than the price of the item itself. eBay has establish an automated way to resolve problems which is a complete failure. Check your options guys they must favor the seller and the customers as well. After all you guys get money from both of us. Bye.",2
397,"Several Kinks, but a Work In Progress!: I’ve been using the app for several months, but have also experienced several problems.  Some were severe enough to contact eBay on and others I’ve learned to live with.  Areas such as Best Offer options, default Shipping issues, selling Similar Items, etc have been consistently problematic, but eBay seems to have listened to complaints and made some improvements, though still not perfect!  My biggest gripe is that I shouldn’t have to access a Desktop for listings/adjustments when the app isn’t working.  The app should at a minimum mirror the most critical desktop features and in some cases be more superior.  Gave it 4 stars because by far it’s still one of the best and most powerful platforms out there, but it’s certainly still lacking at least 20% of the time.",4
398,"Cannot be Relied On: EBAY’s iPhone app works. Most of the time. I always use an updated version and the phone I use is iPhone 11s . The app usually works but it simply does not include some features which are only accessible on the PC through the browser. Your advanced user panel for example isn’t available. 

It also freezes and requires to close it snd open it all over again quite open. Usually this happens in two situations. When you are swiping through an item’s photos, or when you are scrolling down to see search results. It just freezes randomly and doesn’t respond.

That is very VERY serious if sometimes you are waiting for an auction to make bids on. As most people know many auctions are bid on by its closing. Often with it seconds. If the app crashed you won’t always have enough time to restart everytning.",3
399,"Great if you’re buying, total trash if you’re selling: Don’t even waste your time trying to use this app if you’re selling anything that isn’t already in the system - it has no purpose beyond being a torture device. I’ve uploaded photos three times, and nothing. I’ve tried to add details with the drop down menus, and half did not work. I tried to add shipping info, and it kept saying the shipping service didn’t exist. I could not even enter a starting price for my auction item. I wrote in a lengthy description that is now somewhere in eBay purgatory since “save for later” on this app apparently means “haha you blundering fool.” It is shocking how horrible this app is considering the year we live in and the caliber of company this is, not to mention that it literally depends on people selling things through its platform. Buying is a breeze, but I’m going to my desktop for selling, which by the way, is practically barbaric in this age of mobile technology innovation.",2
400,"My only wish at this point: I have contacted EBay customer representatives regarding of updating my phone # in the profile and after Tests and passing and succeed at least couple different time with the while to take my request seriously as what it feels too , but sadly none has returned with solution about my inquiry I mentioned above , my phone number has changed and  each time I am trying to update my new phone number is not working that way either because that old number in the profile has been canceled and the new the recent one I have is active !

401,I don’t know what has happened to eBay?: Whatever since 2020 the app does not work like it used to you change bank accounts they make you wait 48 hours to get your money and then they find fault with your account that’s not even there just so they can close your account and hold your money for 72 days wow up to 90 days they don’t care about their customers anymore because I have not done anything to anybody in my eBay store ever I was always very fast when I sold stuff and very fast when I bought stuff I always treated people with dignity the same way I wanted to be treated and they completely disrespected me lied to me and closed my account for no reason I will never ever ever tell anybody to go to eBay again ever,5
402,"eBay not responding: I bought a ps5 on my computer for $300. It came around a week and a half early. Or that’s what the tracking said. It never came to my house and I contacted eBay, they opened the case they put 0 effort and then closed the case. I requested a reopen and once again they did nothing. I then did some digging and found something that would win me the case instantly if they would actually open it again. It’s been about a month since I actually ordered it. And they have not reopened it and I requested a 3rd reopen about 2 weeks ago. The evidence I found is follows. The tracking info on eBay and UPS both said it was sent to my house. I was confused so I called ups since eBay was twiddling they’re thumbs. When me and the woman on the line were going through the info, she told me it was never sent to my house, but someone else’s. To this day eBay has yet to reopen and I doubt they will thanks eBay, love the support for those who are killing your app.",1
403,"E-bay is Great: I live about 80 miles from a shopping center or actually city. E-bay has made my life much easier. I have access to anything I want at the touch of my fingers. I don’t have to drive anywhere. I can pay the prices I chose to pay. I have such a large variety to chose from. I can even return items without a hassle.
       Size has never been easy for me. I’m large and oftentimes stores don’t carry the size I need.  E-bay finds the size I want and separates my size from other sizes, that way I don’t fall in love with something which will never fit me. The only size I pick from in the one I chose.
       I also like how the merchandise changes from day to day. I can even get notified when something new in my size is up for sale. I can even specify the brands I like.   If I want something brand new I can request that also.
       It always amazes me how fast my items arrive, and I don’t even have to take a day off of work to travel to town and shop. 
       I’m never scared of the money exchange. PayPal is awesome and it’s guaranteed.  I’ve been using e-bay for many years and I never lost my money or didn’t receive my merchandise.

I ask the buyer what is the matter!  sends me a photo of the broken cable, which can be easily replaced with another one: “I offered him a partial refund of $ 15.” I watch this on the next day, and the case is closed!  The ebay idiot decided that $ 15 should be thrown off to me, and the buyer should be given a completely serviceable product for $ 250 and returned $ 235 from above, for the fact that I did not have time to answer!  although before the platform intervened in the dispute, the buyer wrote to me!  I agree to $ 15!  okay!  I think this is a mistake!  I am writing to the support service and what do you think?

405,"Does anyone actually test the app before go live?: I have been a long time eBay buyer. 

Some things make me wonder whether programmers actually test the app prior to release. Examples:

- who decided to restrict the size option? I’ve narrowed the scope to the lowest level and can no longer filter by size. 

- like items should be of the same size, right? 

- customer support online is terrible. I recently had a seller file a claim against me for nonpayment. I had remitted payment immediAtely. My view showed the transaction paid, but in PayPal, the payment had not been accepted by the seller (likely a setup issue on their part, which I advised them of). They were 1. Able to open a claim, 2. Their payment status showed unpaid because they had not accepted the payment in PayPal. And because I had already remitted payment, I could not respond to the claim which prompted me to remit payment again, which was impossible. So, I was stuck in the circular hell of eBay customer support, with the seller inept and unwilling to cancel the transaction. These things turn off high volume buyers like myself.   

I really wish there was a vehicle to provide this type of feedback that eBay looked into and took action on.",5
406,Great app but eBay is sneaky!!!: eBay sends me coupons so I would spend more and they pop up and don’t leave the screen. They even sent me coupons through my email... well as soon as I bought something the coupons disappeared! I had to go searching through my email to find the coupon. Very sneaky eBay to have the coupon disappear so I would pay full price and I bet older people fall for this. EBay’s app is still great. It warns you for something you are watching and sends you emails about buying and selling stuff. You will get more coupons if you don’t buy as much my brother who buys a lot through eBay gets no coupons while me who usually never buys through eBay gets a ton of coupons so check google for eBay coupons or have two accounts on eBay one to receive coupons and one to buy stuff.,4
407,"Great for Shoppers, Bad for sellers: eBay and PayPal take a huge portion of the money you will “make” as a seller 
PayPal takes roughly 5% right off the bat 
So if you sell something for $10 you will only have $9.50 
eBay will charge you a month later, roughly 10% of the sale price on average so now your sale is down to $8.50 
Often the “calculated shipping” cost and the cost in the store will be different so if you mail things the old fashioned way (in person at the post office, paying for shipping there) you may end up paying an extra $1 or 2 for shipping 
Assuming that doesn’t happen and you end up with the $8.50 on your $10 sale there’s a catch 
People who buy on eBay can be cheats and liars and use ebays policy against you and eBay will ALWAYS SIDE WITH THE BUYER 
ALWAYS 
ALWAYS 
ALWAYS 
I was just scammed by a “buyer” who sent back a box of comic books I sold him and kept the ones he wanted but returned the rest
He then called and complained to eBay that I WAS A SCAM and eBay took his side with out even contacting me 
They just took his side and took the money out of my bank 
OUT OF MY CHILDRENS MOUTHS 
I don’t have any children but eBay doesn’t know that 
I have used eBay for 10 years but I’m done now, year after year I sell 50+ items and pay eBay hundreds of dollars and they don’t ever have my back 
I quit eBay and give them an over all 1 star experience 
They are a bad boyfriend and I don’t want to be in this relationship anymore 
Thank u, next",1
408,"Shipping labels won’t print: I use this app all the time to view/buy/list items to sell and I usually never have any problems with it, but the shipping labels NEVER print when I am using the app. I finally had to go dust off my old laptop in order to print labels and then the labels printed just fine. So there has to be some kind of disconnect between the app and the website because they print fine on the website, but I ALWAYS have troubles when I try doing it from within the app. Eventually, I will not be able to rely on my old laptop to print labels. It would be a lot easier for me to just stop using eBay altogether at that point.

Or they could just fix whatever the problem is with the app... Certainly I CAN’T be the only one having this issue.",5
409,"Upgrade not an upgrade: Using this on my iPad to list items for sale used to be a convenience. Now it’s sheer annoyance with the latest version. First, when I list a new item, I’m unable to select a shipping service using the app. Interface doesn’t offer a way to do it. Have to save the listing and go to my computer to finish the shipping specs. The in-app camera is useless. It is impossible even to focus on the item. Have to take a photo using the regular camera and then toggle to the app to upload the photos. And the app is now programmed to do some things automatically, like list your item as an auction and best offer requiring you to change it for everything you list, if you are not a fan of auctions or best offers. And then there are the constant “invitations” to pay to promote your item. eBay really should ask more SELLERS what would make it easier to list items, and test their apps better before rolling out upgrades.",2
410,"horrible and inconvenient: I got eBay so I could get a digital camera. I’ve always wanted one and searched on the app for only two days, found multiple great cameras, but couldn’t contact the seller because it claimed I did not verify myself when I did multiple times then as I’m about to buy a camera after days of looking for the perfect one my account gets permanently, suspended for absolutely no reason. y’all try so hard to terminate bots and always end up kicking your REAL customers. I’m not able to appeal my account at all when I want to talk to customer service they just take me to a robot (ironically) and it says the same thing over and over again and doesn’t help. if I could give this app 0 stars I definitely would. Hopefully I can make a new account without it doing exact same thing to me. This app is super glitchy as soon as I made it it didn’t even allow me to contact any sellers or save items or them in my cart, just horrible.",1
411,"Can’t stop items from auto-relisting: Saw I was getting charged $0.35 for every auto re-listed item over the 250 items in the middle of the month. Went to the sellers hub and turned off all auto re-listing for this month and it said there were 48 eligible items. Of the other 202 items another 25+ auto re-listed later, even after turning off auto re-list. Had to go through and cancel all the listings manually that carried over from months ago. It should send a notification or just stop automatically re-listing items once the monthly limit is reached.

On top of that there a ton of buyers who win auctions with multiple other bidders that are non-paying accounts. They have a clear history of not paying, but no one can leave negative feedback for buyers. The only thing you can do is cancel the listing and redo the week long auction and possibly get no bids. Anytime I have a decent auction a non-buyer swoops in and you just lose out.",1

Shipping rates have gone up so much that I lose more money every year and it’s not as fun as it used to be while supplementing my income. eBay needs to listen more to their customers and having their call centers transferred and redirected to the Philippines where they are the most offensive, inconsiderate and heartless people that I’ve ever had to deal with on the phone. I am transgendered female and I have documented the abuse in how they have addressed me, treated me and wasted my time only to laugh at me and threaten me with actions against my account. This company can be better they just choose to be cheap so they can make the MOST money possible from their sellers. I wish eBay could go back to their old ways. Mercari is like what eBay used to be in my opinion.",3
413,"Tired of the game of Russian roulette each update: Every single update, I find myself crossing my fingers and hoping they didn’t take more features away or “fix” something that wasn’t broken. 

Finally, the last update has ruined it for me. I have a seller I purchase from regularly, and each night they run about 500 items up on a bid. Watch, bid, repeat until the night is over. Lately I’ve noticed I’m not seeing as many items per night as past nights, so I did some dicking around, and found that it WILL NOT show all the items he has listed, unless I repeatedly pull down to refresh the page, could work in a few, but has taken closer to 25-30 refreshes to get all the items (that I know of) to show up. Also, I have the seller and search saved, but for some reason, I have to click on the search, back out, and click on it again for the “ending soonest” to be applied.",2
414,"TERRIBLE Honestly the toughest app to be a at home seller: The amount of support you get from eBay is non existent. The buyer could just say an item is broken, not have any proof of it being broken just because they didn’t read a description correctly and would like to return. They don’t have a team, like mercari, to go over situations like these and the seller just has to be out of money to buy a shipping label to bring back your item which wasn’t broken in the first place. The guy had the audacity to offer 20 bucks for the listing when it was originally agreed upon to be 70. 

For a shady and haphazard buyer, this app is great for you as the seller takes all the risk and you take none! So buy away. Five stars for buyers. 0 stars for sellers. There are a crazy amount of scammers on here so why don’t y’all join the fun. 

For a person trying to make room in his house, this app is terrible to be a seller on. You have much much better spreading out your listings over numerous apps then trying to sell on eBay.",1
415,"Ok- Could be better: Pretty Good app, easy to use, one thing that would be nice is to be able to delete items on saved list without the full page refresh - or at least to delete by checking off multiple ones if needed before this happens... options for  multiple saved lists would be nice as well for categorization

Also if you try to leave anything less than a 5 star review you can’t submit it to give a place feedback - you get a message that says to resolve it with the owner first but even if you do you still get blocked from leaving an accurate description of the item or service you received

Same issue for over 2 years - when is this gonna get improved?",5
416,"Fees and Feedback.: eBay in general is a well put together machine. However, when you have a listing end that ends with no bids you should not get charged a fee or at least not an excessive fee. This happened to me when I tried to sell a set of cookie jars. It ended with no bids. I chowed not to re-list and I was charged nearly $20!  

Additionally, what is the point in not allowing negative feedback? It’s very misleading when deciding whether to buy or sell to/from an individual when all eBay allows is positive feedback. I’ve been burned on this selling to someone. They supposedly had 100% positive, they bought a 4000 dollar item and refused to pay. From what they said to me, I do believe they’ve done this multiple times in the past but there’s no way of telling. And… I was not allowed to leave negative feedback on their end for the transaction.",3
417,"Recent search list disappears!: Meh. I’ve been using the app for years. Just seems like it gets less and less shopper friendly with each iteration. Latest issue I have is that the app *continuously* wipes nearly all my recent search history...and I like to search my fav items several times a day when I’m on the hunt for something. Net effect has been to save me money since I’m too lazy and/or pressed for time to go through the hassle of retyping, filtering and sorting a half-dozen+ searches several times a day. So while I find that new glitch really annoying, I do wind up shopping and spending much less than I had been or intended to. Upside for my wallet; downside for ebay.

Edit: I’m dropping a star bc the glitch I mentioned above is REALLY annoying the daylights out of me. What is the purpose of the app constantly wiping my recent search history list? Perhaps it’s not a glitch but intentional...that’s even worse for it makes NO sense. Fix this please.",2
418,"This is a bad redesign: Tuesday, October 30, 2018
Recently Reviewed List does not work. You clear out items and it comes back. Seemed to work a month back, maybes just caught their database in a good day. 

If you cannot prune the list, what's the point. If you view it by accident or just curious and have no intention to buy, it's on the list and it becomes nothing more than a wasteland.

Looks like eBay did an underlying fix to whatever object the app calls. Deleting items from the recently viewed list now stays deleted. 

Still have some other quibbles. Need to write those down.

Recently Viewed List is broken. I clear it out and it still comes back. There is now even more from views I have made after clearing the list. 

What's the point if you have to scroll through a list of past views. If I have bought the item or am no longer interested, I don't want to see it. 

Not to mention I get notifications for a viewed item I don't want. 
--

The Recently Viewed List is broken. You are given the option to clear your history and under that tab, it works. From the home page your viewing history is still there, that is a BUG!, not a feature or a convenience for the user.

This is a bad redesign. Takes extra clicks to navigate. Certainly not more intuitive than the last version, worse. 

Who the hell do they have on the usability team. Must not be humans.",1
419,"List and sell…or rent: I wish you didn't pay fees on sales tax, none of which goes to the seller since eBay remits it to their state. The fee structure is so complex and always changing, especially with seller status. But they provide the platform, you provide the grin-and-bear-it! 
               
Returns are ridiculous, though. I offer 14-day returns, and have to ship within 2 days of purchase (my choice, you can choose up to a few days). Buyer has almost a full month to ship a return once started, though, tying money up and delaying the time I could have re-listed. Plus, I feel like most buyers are just renting my items…the returns have skyrocketed, and you MUST accept them (either by “choice” or you’re forced).  It’s gotten to the point where eBay cashes me out weekly, and I just hold the money in savings because right before my 14-day window is up, it’s almost guaranteed the buyer will open a return.",2

421,eBay: eBay is most enjoyed after a good day of work. eBay has offered many buyers the opportunity to cut out another rooming day that’s looking for and expecting a good product. I end up picking up something that regularly would take gas and countless forgetful drives. Your times that wast my time has to be better than average because your items have recently been delivered broken but I would say it is the mail ladybug that is or was responsible for the last destruction I received Last but not least I enjoy eBay keep up the good work. How can we know fire that mail ladybug and independently deliver better skipping this problem. I am thinking hard about this I honestly think this is a big problem that must be thought about more until it is solved.,5
422,"Frustrating changes: EBAY is really great but recently there have been changes. One of the changes that just makes me frustrated and angry is that eBay automatically changes my listings to “or best offer” when I specifically listed items not entertaining any offers. 
This is also frustrating to buyers when they make offers.
Another recent eBay feature I have noticed is the “buy it now” Price must be a certain percentage over the starting bid amount.  This is very frustrating when you really want to sell an item but the “buy it now” Price can end up being ridiculously high, scaring away immediate buyers.
Other than these two issues I am pleased with Ebay and the customer service.",5
423,"Failing!: Had my fist problem after many years of using this app, purchased something and the vendor got my address incorrect, i when back and forward with the vendor even after we came down to the conclusion that they had my shipping address all wrong they still did not want to offer a refund or replacement, I contacted eBay and explain everything they denied help, had to go ahead and and reported it again and the had to really review everything in the phone with me saw there really was a problem and it wasn’t on my end they offered a full refund because I had to order again from a different vendor, it’s been a month and no refund I guess there’s really no commitment for customers?",5
424,"Great for Buyers, Poor for Sellers: SELLING: Needs repair. Once I post a listing, it doesn’t immediately show up in my listings even though it’s live. Also I can’t search my current listings for specific item consistently. For example say I have red shorts size 33 for sale. In the app in the selling tab, If I search my current listings for red 33 it won’t always find them even when that’s the words I have in the title. This can cause damage to sellers. If I don’t find the listing, then end up reposting it , I can accidentally sell the item twice which means I have to cancel an order which adversely affects my seller rating. Also eBay doesn’t keep selling records longer than 90 days, so when I search for things I’ve sold, it’s limited 
For an internet icon like eBay to have such a poor app is very disappointing. Multiple updates have been made but as of September 2018, the problem remains unfixed.

Most importantly, for me (being visually-impaired) is that this app is absolutely stellar for people using voiceover it is easily one of the most accessible apps I’ve ever used. And well you, the reader, may not have the same impediment, this attention to detail in the app makes for a better experience for all. I highly applaud the efforts of eBay to be inclusive. as for other features, the app works well. It’s smooth, runs very well on an iPad, and sees useful updates when necessary. Overall, I’m impressed.",5

During that period ebay tried to charge my card and was unsuccessful.  Had they tried charging the card again, probably the next day, it would have gone through.  Now my account is suspended and I’ve tried paying the bill online, but I keep getting error messages saying the account is suspended!  eBay should still have my correct card info, if they want to be paid!

428,1998: This company is like Southwest airlines are completely using all the old software. I had a bank verified was waiting for over a month that I sold some tickets which is completely ridiculous that they make you wait a month they get paid after I sold my tickets and they made money off me. They make you wait a month to get paid my bank was verified and everything for a whole month. I was counting on the money and it never came. It’s been six weeks. It says on their website they sent it finally two weeks later I get a notification saying they can’t verify my bank which is there old system. My bank is just fine. This is a complete joke of a company. So I verified my other bank and their system. Can’t verify my account number from my old bank. Complete Ridiculous.   eBay is a complete joke. A complete joke they should be ashamed of the way their system works and operates and how screws people like me over,1
429,I’m addicted to this site.: I can’t help Myself. Buying and selling just hearing its ping go off makes Me all excited. I’m a hardcore eBay junkie like ppl get addicted to gambling this is MY guilty lil pleasure and I even know most of the buying and selling rules by heart just from running into different situations on here. I must spend 6-8hrs a day on here MINIMUM BARE MINIMUM just planning on what I wanna buy and looking for deals price matching and bargaining and bidding. I’ll autobid especially if I can tell the other person/ppl are auto bidding cuz the last one in gets final dibs! Haha! I prolly spend way too much time on here but hey at least I get something for my money and at a major discount too. I could just be losing all our rent gambling or drinking. I have a set amount I can use and I rarely go above it. Rarely. Lol.,5
430,"Ideas!: The eBay app has mostly been simple, easy, and straight forward to use. There’s a few things that I think could help (me personally)- notifications would be great if they had an added date/time stamp of when it was received. Sometimes it’s difficult to know what happened when, when tracing back on communication or actions taken on an auction. Also, I know it’s a historical thing that eBay has a very limited space for reviews, but it’s be even better if there was space for more text. 

Also- defining the difference between an eBay seller review vs product review. I think many people don’t understand the difference. So when someone’s shopping- if a product has poor reviews that’s actually meant for a specific seller, it kind of makes selling the item a bit more difficult.",4
431,"How to report app bugs: I’m sorry I’m having to write this in the review section, as I cannot  locate where to go to report app bugs in the app itself. As of a few weeks ago, the app iOS version has been glitching in the home screen where it shows the “Paid -Ship Now” and “New Offers” notifications. The issue/bug is the “NEW OFFERS” count, it is not accurate, seems as if some old count is frozen into it, new offers appear and disappear/update accordingly, but the previous old/frozen count remains. We’ve gone through and deleted then re-installed the app, checked on various counts and iOS phone devices, and the error is the same on all. The “frozen” count is different for different eBay accounts but the error is the same. Please advise.",5
432,"We met a liar And his protector: Please pay attention to the seller!  There was a scammer, but after he got our mobile phone, he told us that the mobile phone could not be opened and wanted to refund the money.

The buyer not only got the free mobile phone but also took the money back for the mobile phone, so he has a free Apple 11 pro!!! eBay is very friendly to buyers, no matter what  Whether the buyer is lying or does not have sufficient evidence, eBay will agree to the buyer's request.  So we are giving free mobile phones to scammers.  If someone acts like this scammer, you can certainly get a free mobile phone or computer, because eBay is always friendly to you.  So sellers always suffer.  We were cheated by the buyer for the first time, saying that the watch had been opened, but when we took it back there was no problem. This is the second time.  We are very disappointed with ebey.  Hope you all be careful...",1
433,Buyers never pay for auction: I have been selling for a few months now and always get offers for free action listings. I decided to give it a try and listed some items and was very happy that people were bidding. I listed more items everyday and very happy that my items will sell. It’s been days and not a single buyer has paid for a single item out of like 10-15 listings. On top of that I am being changed a fee because my “items sold” this is complete bs! Buyers should make a partial deposit before they bid so no one is messing around and bidding randomly! I have to go open 15 no paid case and it’s annoying. At this rate newer sellers will go to apps like mercari where it’s much simple to list from mobile and sell items. ridiculous!,5
434,"Be aware of Fraud and Scams: Ebay has cut down on a lot of customer services and the site may be swimming with frauds. Lots of sellers inside and outside of US with millions of great reviews turn out to have bought them or got them from high frequency and low value items but they scam customers on low frequency but high value items. That’s their game. We were frauded on an IPhone purchase (advertised as new but Apple says everything inside is fake). When you request refund, there’s no category as fraud. So categorically, they are avoiding fraud investigations. Items with defects and items that can be verified to be complete fraud should be treated differently. And nothing can be done after 10 days after seller issue any refund they like plus they took the evidence. If you have a life and didn’t follow up closely, you are screwed. It is a huge burden on customers alone. Report fraud to FTC if ebay doesn’t do anything.",2
435,"Selling Update HORRIBLE: I’ve been selling using the ebay app for two years and the recent change to the listing format is abysmal. They took away the option to choose a store category, for new listings it automatically lists as Good til Cancelled and there is no option to change it to 30 days. When I relist or sell similar it DELETES MY SHIPPING INFORMATION requiring me to get my item out of inventory and reweigh it. It also automatically turns “accept best offers” OFF. If I start a listing on the desktop and make it mobile friendly, when I edit the description in the app it “removes my formatting” and my listing is no longer mobile friendly, requiring me to go BACK to my desktop and list from there. When I list it asks me EVERY SINGLE TIME to turn on easy pricing which is annoying. If I wanted to turn it on, I would do so. 
Ebay, if your goal is to make selling more difficult so we sell on different platforms instead of ebay, then Bravo. Otherwise, please return the old listing format on the app.",1
436,"Trying to sell car: I have listed and reposted a car for sale. It’s a classic Z28 and I have dealt with so many swindlers and flakes that it has changed my opinion as it pertains to EBay. I used to think that when people bid on a car they had to pay. That is not the case. The car has gone past the reserve in two separate occasions and both people didn’t pay for the car. It’s doesn’t have anything to do with the car. There is no accountability with eBay and until they make changes I don’t feel comfortable listing anything of real value. Not to mention they charged me for the sell of the car and I now have to sit on the phone with some guy in India to only be told that I should repost the item, I’m sure. I would not have left a review except they kept sending me a request to rate them. I am going to post the car locally. I also talked to another guy I noticed selling from my area and he had the same complaint. This is one unhappy customer. Here’s hoping they make some changes.",1
437,"eBay took $300+ from me as a seller.: If you want to start selling on eBay, I DO NOT recommend. The reason for this is because if any buyer submits a ‘payment dispute’ you’ve already lost your money. But in MY case i lost my money and my item. You see, if a buyer submits a payment dispute, then that means they want a full refund and they’re supposed to send the item back. For me the buyer never sent my item back, causing me to lose a $200+ watch as well as eBay deducting $100 for losing the dispute. So i practically lost $300+ from ONE payment dispute, that’s pretty much all of the money I’ve made off of eBay. And eBay did NOTHING about it. And i also couldn’t do anything about it because apparently, “the customer is always right”. 
So all I'm trying to say is, DO NOT attempt to sell on eBay. One dispute and all your money might be gone. Imagine if this one item was a lot more expensive. More money lost from the item, and way more money lost for losing the dispute.",1

I have not gotten any response, no reply, or no treadmill after I purchased it through my PayPal account. I should have at least gotten a reply of some type. Tomorrow if I don’t hear anything, I am seeking a refund through PayPal for a purchase that was not received or delivered. Every time I order items from EBay, I always got a notification of when the product was shipped or when it was delivered but this time I have gotten nothing as though they didn’t collect the money but I know they did because PayPal sends me a email after each payment. I am very disappointed with EBay.",1
439,Account suspended: My account got suspended after two days. I put up some shoes and miscellaneous items I had no use for. They suspended my account overnight. So I reached out to eBay for answers. Customer service was horrible. They couldn’t specify why they violated my account. The rep told me that it had something do do with community guidelines. I asked her to be specific and she said that she had given me all the information she was going to give me and she was going to terminate the call. I was selling electrical switches and collectible items. Nothing lewd or adult in nature. Nor any type of items that would be deemed to be offensive to anyone. It’s a disappointment to see this happen. I stopped selling on eBay years back due to the higher fees. I decided to give them a shot. I’d rather sell on OfferUp and pay for promotion fees to get it seem more. eBay. If you’re going to violate someone account you should be specific. You let me down. I’m not coming back this time.,1
440,"Honest Sellers: I’ve ordered at least 20 items from eBay sellers over the past few years. Every item came as described, but one. I called the seller to complain about the size of the item appearing to be much larger. She said, “no worries, I can remake that art piece the size you need and get it out to you ASAP. I was surprised at how cordial she was. I asked about any additional cost. She declined. You see my cat of 17 years died unexpectedly and then was heartbroken. I was searing for a cutout of a Turkish Angora cat to put on her grave marker. Well, I have one now, and forever. Who would have even imagined an item such as that would exist? As usual, it does on EBay and don’t worry, I’ve never known such kindness and honest sellers, anywhere else.

441,"Terrible for small sellers: If you are a new seller or just trying to sell a specific item you have, do not use eBay. I had a PS5 I wanted to sell and decided to list it on eBay. First, I repeatedly had scam accounts purchase my item with no intention of paying and were only phishing for my personal information. I tried to resolve this issue with eBay and they had no way to report or protect myself from these scam accounts. Second, eBay states you don’t have to pay any seller fees until you hit the threshold they set for a certain amount of items sold or until you make a set profit. This was the first item I have ever sold on eBay and I was nowhere near either of the thresholds and I had to pay an ungodly amount of selling fees. In the end I had to waste a lot of time and energy to basically end up losing money on the item that I sold. Please only sell here if you plan on doing a lot of it because eBay does not cater to small sellers at all.",1
442,"Great app, if you’re not a seller: But if you are selling, be prepared to receive your payment 2 or 3 weeks after the buyer receives their item. Not only that, just because eBay sent out your funds on a specific date, you have to wait another 3 business days to RECEIVE your money! Y’all is freaking terrible. Like if you’re going to sell anything ladies and gentlemen, use offer up or Craigslist list and meet the person is a private place. Your money is a guaranteed transaction and you don’t have to wait almost 3 weeks to get paid for sold something. 
But if it’s a good app if you’re buying. Just make sure the seller will ship your item the same day or the day after. Each seller has been quick in shipping my items quickly. But I can’t get over how bad the seller program is on here. Something needs to change. Can’t one star the app. The buyer propose of this app works.",2
443,"Authenticity not guaranteed: eBay is touting this “authenticity guarantee” and here is my experience with it. So far, two purchases I have made were supposed to come with this guarantee.
 One never got sent through the certification process and it was a package of booster boxes. When I tried to get refunded, seller only offered partial refund. eBay did nothing to help me get my money back and even deleted the negative review I had left the seller. Never got my money back and lost out on $2500+. 
Another purchase I had made was supposed to also come with an authenticity guarantee. It went to get certified and when I received the package it came with a piece of paper from eBay saying “not eligible for authentication, thanks for understanding.” No, I do not understand why you said these cards would all be authenticated, but then sent to me and never even be checked. 

eBay is trying to push this false comfort to buyers, but they aren’t holding their end of the deal.",1
444,"Finding Fun at EBay: I find it fun to have something that maybe someone else would use/enjoy and post it on EBay as auction. I guess what the postage would be and list it for that price and also note free shipping in USA. 
Then to wait and see. Some things never get bought so I just donate it, if I break even-that is fine...if there is a little bidding war maybe I get a little more...that’s ok....and if I lose money as postage was more than I expected...that is cool too!
EBay has made it easy and fun to list things. I can even donate a percentage of the sales to a charity of my choice right thru EBay. 
Along the way, I have learned lessons about listing, postage etc so it challenges me and enriches my life experience....
So I am just enjoying the sport of selling....and buying....on EBay.",5
445,"“Shop Owners Store”: I’ve been doing business on EBay for almost 20 years. You’ve changed the way a buyer can view  a seller’s other items. Before it was a straight forward list that one could prioritize as to your choice-“ending soonest”, “most expensive”, etc. Now, one must go through the items multiple times in order to see the “next” items,  peppered here and there throughout the list. It’s a manipulative trick designed to make one view items over and over before one sees ALL the items on the list. I frequently see a great buy, which encourages me to look for other well priced items from that seller. I’ve made many purchases from looking through the sellers other items. I avoid doing that anymore. It’s a cheap trick, EBay. Long time buyers like myself can spot it easily. Shame on you.",4
446,"eBay seller: I’m giving this a harsh rating and review because I’m sick of some of the basic issues that they have not fixed. Not because of bugs, but because of a lack of common sense.  

1). When I’m scouting for items to sell I check sold prices on eBay first and list by items sold and highest first.  Every single time I run a search - and I’ve easily run thousands of them by now - I have to reset my sort filters to sold and highest price first.  

Years ago they allowed these search preferences to be saved but it is no longer the case and I’m sick of it. It wastes my time and battery life. 

2). What the heck is going on with randomly inserting unsold sponsored listings into the sold sort? If I’m quickly trying to look for $100 items at the top of the list I have no interest in seeing the unsold $4.79 item at the top of the list. This makes no sense.  It was not sold so it should not be categorized as a sold item. I don’t care if someone paid an extra $.10 to put it at the top of the list. 

eBay, we all love you, sort of, but sometimes I literally want to throw my phone across the room.  And when I have to call 4 times to get an issue fixed, we are both losing money. 

Is this a seller’s app? If so, make it seller friendly!  If you need a beta tester who has some common sense, contact me - apparently you are lacking in that department.",2
447,"Great but a few developer suggestions: There’s so much to love about this app. Especially the saved search where it emails/texts you when something meeting your search is posted. 

I use it constantly, so I do have a couple of wish list improvements for the developers related to search. 

Pretty please, when filtering by Brand, I have two requests that would make my life sooo much easier. 

First, when I’ve already selected a significant number of other filters for women’s clothes for example, the brands shown should only be the brands left after all that filtering, but instead, it shows all the brands. That’s too much to go through. It takes forever to go through that crazy long list. 

Second, there should be an option either to simply “remove” certain brands OR to “select all” but then be able to untick just a few of them (I’m talking about “unlisted” or certain brands where they have a gazillion duplicate listings). 

I can only imagine this would improve sales by helping users find what they’re looking for instead of wading through a ton of somewhat “spammy duplicate” listings and giving up because there is just an overwhelming amount of results that aren’t really what we’re looking for. 

Thank you!!",4
448,"I LOVE eBAY!!!! Very great for buying and selling stuff: I don't normally write reviews, but since eBay has made me money when I needed it the most, I'll write one. eBay is one of the easiest, most fastest ways to make fast money. All you have to do is link an existing PayPal or make a PayPal account to link to your eBay and Start listing and selling. It's really that easy. The APP is very easy and fast to use and to list stuff. The only thing I think this APP could use is a cleaning due to it closing out sometimes. Other than that I give it 5 stars because it really gets you some income if you need. It could become your full time addiction/job, lol oh and I buying on the APP is also very fast and easy. 
I recommend eBay to EVERYONE that loves to buy stuff and it needs a way of income.",5
449,"My purchase satisfaction: I love EBay, it’s a place that has almost everything I ever want and search for when I needed.  The way they service and protect their customer is never a complaint.  When I have a problem with my purchase they always stay in touch to keep track with my issues and resolve them very quickly. It’s the most quality place to do business regardless you’re a buyer or Sales.  EBay  customers services is super wonderful.  The only time you get scam because you don’t follow their rules.  If you follow EBay rules you will be very happy buyer or sales. Thank you EBay for make this website available and I hope EBay will be more successful every day so I can continue to support them and use this website to search for what I need.",5
450,"App says I’m the highest bidder... when I’m not: Unreliable for bidding. 
This app has frustrated me so much as a seller and a buyer, but nothing was worse than what it did when I was bidding on three auctions this week. I was keeping an eye on my bid page, and eBay continued to tell me I was the high bidder on all three auctions, right up until they ended... which CAN happen, except for one of them, it said ENDED, and showed me as the highest bidder, at least 15 minutes after the auction ended. So I was surprised when I couldn’t find the time under my purchases and I received no email urging me to pay for it. I went back to find the auction and see what happened, and I found I had been outbid! 

Any other problems with the app are just annoyances, but this is major functionality. For an auction site where the countdown is important, having it NOT update correctly (even when I ‘updated’ the page several times) means I have NO trust in this app. 
I will not use it for buying ever again if I can help it.",1
451,"Terrible: eBay is virtually the only selling platform available ~ so I am essentially stuck with it. That being said, they are TERRIBLE. If you have any problems whatsoever, the customer service is almost the worst EVER (Time Warner holds the title). Nevertheless, most times when you call in you are told you have a ""wait time"" and that they can ""call you back"" if you do not want to wait.  This NEVER occurs ~ I have requested call backs over one dozen times throughout several years, and have never once received the call back. The worst problem with eBay though, is when you do get through to customer service ~ it is ALWAYS a call center in Pakistan, or the Phillippines ~ somewhere where I can NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, and they have ZERO accountability in that they NEVER take notes, so if/when I do have to reach back out, I have to begin at ground zero with every call. The eBay customer service is almost the worst ever. If I could avoid using their service/product, I would immediately.",1
452,DO NOT BUY AS A GUEST IF YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT: Refunds will not be processed through EBay if you buy as a guest but have an account. You enter your email at checkout to get notifications of a purchase but when you click on the links provided by eBay that states you can view orders and refunds that were sent to the email provided at check out. It makes you sign in with the account information and it doesn’t pass to the account on file! eBay has no records of a purchase I made even though I was receiving notification to my email that the account is associated with. I tried to contact customer support but there’s no real people to talk to. It’s all AI and when asking for an agent it will have an auto reply of “no agents are currently available hours of availability are___”. Even within the hours of operation it will tell you that you can’t speak to a real person who can actually help. Very disappointed. Will not be using this site/app again.,1
453,"eBay is untrustworthy DON’T waste your time.: I’ve been an eBay user for 22 years. Buy some, sell some. eBay has changed over the years, and in it’s current state it is not to be trusted as a safe place to do business. eBay allows fraudulent buyers to take advantage of the return process and steal from sellers. And eBay will not do anything about it. They do NOT support their sellers. And sellers are customers of eBay. Without sellers there would be no eBay. eBay’s customer service team will not have your back and constantly repeat the same lines over and over again without resolving anything. eBay does not take responsibility for flaws in its system. Don’t trust that eBay will do the right thing. I would have been better off just throwing my used stuff in the trash instead of wasting my time trying to sell it on eBay and then getting scammed out of a sale. Thanks but no thanks eBay. I recommend buyers and sellers take their business elsewhere!!!",1
454,"Seller’s Worst Nightmare: Sold on eBay for the first time since they ditched PayPal. It was a nightmare! Never making this mistake again. First the seller fees on a $630 iPhone were almost $100. This is outrageous. They even charged me fees on the sales tax! That’s not even the worst part.

I was promised my payment after the phone confirmed delivered. Then, magically, my account was put on a 5 day hold for no reason! I contacted support, and “Jose” and “Angie” insisted that this was all normal and I just needed to wait. They refused to credit any fees for the hassle. Stonewalling and gaslighting the whole way. Will be cancelling my account and never selling on eBay again after this experience. What are the exorbitant fees for if I can’t even get paid on time?!

I had an offer on Facebook for $600 cash but refused to sell it because I’d already had my order confirmed on eBay. In response to my loyalty, eBay decided to withhold my Christmas money for days with no proper explanation. They are truly the grinch!",1
455,"Bring back ""wipe"" pictures feature for sell similar!: I make my living selling on eBay and I do it all on my IPhone. There are often new changes without any warning and they seem to be made without input from frequent users. For example, this week, there is no “search” feature for my own sold items. I cannot see if I have sold the item previously and use that template again. The app and EBay in general could do a better job of supporting long time sellers and store subscribers like myself by allowing lengthier “solds” comparison data, prepopulating frequently sold items and offer access to better customer service. It would also be nice to have a designation for small, US based businesses so that I could patronize them first.",5
456,"Love eBay!: I thoroughly enjoy using eBay.  It has allowed me to make some extra money by doing what I enjoy: selling vintage and fashion jewelry.  However, I have yet to understand the ever changing algorithms as there are times when my erstwhile consistent sales suddenly stop - dead cold! Although I do everything suggested: 30-day money back guarantee, free shipping on higher ticket items, one-day shipping on virtually everything, etc these sudden drops in sales are very puzzling and frustrating. Fortunately, they don't last forever and within a week or two, sales pick back up.  Everything else about eBay is perfect: easy to use, helpful with tips to maximize sales, and an overall great opportunity to bring in a little extra income.  Thank you, eBay!",5
457,"Won’t let me delete purchase history.: Getting very annoyed at the fact that i can not delete or “hide” my purchase history, neither on the app or on the full ebay site. Once i have received the item, left feedback, and received feedback, there is no need the keep the purchase history. Both the app and the full site will allow me to delete or “hide” them, but they literally come right back as if i did not just delete them! Not only that, but all of my past transactions have shown back up on the app and it will not even allow me to delete those! It just says “unavailable” and will mot even let me click on them to go to the original listings! Please fix this bug, or change whatever settings were changed that will not allow me to delete or hide these transactions in my purchase history. I have had this ebay account since 2010 and have 100% feedback with 720 successful transactions, but i am almost ready to just abandon it all. Please help me?!",1
458,"Getting outbid without knowing it? That’s eBay: I have had plenty of issues using this platform in the past, but a recent event has lead me to write this. I was watching and item and placed a bid with about 10 seconds to go. I watched the remaining time pass and no other bids were placed, I have a screenshot showing my bid being the only, winning, bid and  0 seconds to go, then the listing ends. After a couple seconds of the leading circle spinning I get a message saying I missed out on this one. I was astounded. After reaching out to customer support for an explanation and SHOWING THEM THE SCREENSHOT, I was told, and I quote, “eBay tracking bids to the millisecond… and you probably had bad connection.” So there it is folks. You can basically bid and win, and the listing can end, and if someone bids within a millisecond of the listing ending, they can outbid you and eBay will not notify you whatsoever. Have a good one.",2
459,"Outrageous fees: I use another newer auction site to sell, and the fees are a straightforward 3.5%
as compared to eBay’s 10% final value fee
and depending on what you are selling, it can be more. They also charge you a percentage of what you charge for shipping, and if you have a problem with a buyer, good luck...eBay will withdraw the funds from your bank account from the sale of a buyer has the slightest complaint.
“Oh, you didn’t state in your listing there was a small scratch on the back of your antique” And eBay support is frustrating and very time consuming. The auction site I use has the best support I’ve ever experienced, and you can talk to a live person by chat in less than 30 seconds. Try getting in touch with eBay support that quickly. Never happen. With the millions and millions of items being sold on eBay, they could cut their fees in half. Just imagine how much 10% of millions of items sold every week puts into the website CEOs pockets...they should be able to buy Mars by now.",1
460,"Piano sheet music books , rock: I’m writing a review on how easy the experience of buying on ebay has been for me.
I’ve usually bought piano sheet music books on various rock artists. A lot of times, piano sheet music is hard to find since the books tend to be made for guitar tab only. 
I find ebay supports my inquiries the most and I’ve even found a few music books that are considered very, very hard to find, yet I found them here on ebay.
Purchasing from various sellers has been easy and the purchases have arrived , usually, in a week or so time span. Only once did it take a bit longer, seeing that a very hard to find book was a Canadian seller. 
I continue to support ebay with purchases!",5
461,Stay away from eBay don’t lose your money like me: ebay is full of scammers ghost 👻 sellers fraudulent thief you buy you pay 💰 and your money is gone never receive the items your merchandise is gone never arrive you call the seller the seller send you a fake tracking number fake labels from UPS or Fedex or whatever and disappear you contact eBay a stupid machine answer you guide you through a website don’t resolve nothing 👉 Not customer support not customer help not human to speak about your issue on eBay just a machine a stupid machine repeating the same thing over and over ebay is a garbage website play you as dummies is full of scammers and thief sellers you are dishonest sellers a thief stay away for eBay Don’t lose your money like me I already be a victim twice of eBay seller who stole my money twice on eBay and ebay say 100% guarantee your money back that is a big lie you will lost your money that’s 100% guarantee if you use eBay platform to buy,1
462,"Good for quick listings with some minor annoyances: The eBay App is great for doing quick listings and intuitive to use, but some features are annoyingly limited for users who may want more options. 

Listing descriptions made on the app have an ugly, poorly formatted appearance when seen from a desktop browser, and font options are limited to “bold”. I have no idea why it automatically double spaces paragraph breaks or use a huge font that is entirely different from that being input during listings. 🥴

Strangely, changing the listing format to “Buy-it-Now” forces users to wait a few seconds before inputting a price, which is irritating. I’m also constantly having to change payments requirements to immediate.

Printing a label from the App doesn’t provide you with transaction information or a postage receipt, which is infuriatingly stupid considering you can get all of it through even the mobile site. If printing multiple labels, it’s pretty easy to get them confused. 

It’s still a very useful app especially for sellers who may not have a desktop or laptop computer, but it’d be great to see these issues addressed.",5
463,No Help Links: I can’t recommend their service in good conscience anymore. Their updated payment system is terrible and frankly feels like a scam to sit on money for a few extra days. Disbursements are only a few days a week. I just had my payouts frozen for a bogus reason by eBay with over a grand owed to me despite them successfully sending me 30 dollars literally two days ago. Now I have to reverify everything. I’m winding down my account I’ve had since 1998 as a result. Facebook has become a better and cheaper marketplace to do business on. They finally ruined a good thing via their own self destructive choices. It’s a shame. As a user of this product and others: you can do better. FAR BETTER.,5
464,"eBay is a scam! If a seller do not use this website.: All case disputes end up in buyers favor. Have had multiple items sold that I ended up paying the buyer for an item they bought from me. This crappy resolution center is a complete scam and anybody as a seller that fights back against a buyer who opens a dispute is almost guaranteed to lose. Deleting my account of 7 years this afternoon considering this has happened enough times and I have lost thousands of dollars due to eBay’s lack of seller protection. Most recent issue was when I refunded a buyer on a partial return of an item, they still opened a case and the case was closed in the buyers favor causing me to literally have to pay the buyer more than I sold the item for. Oh and wait that’s without eBay’s $20 fee on dispute resolutions that they charge no matter what out of the buyers pocket. There’s a reason this e-commerce company has not taken off like others… super sketchy and extremely biased. CAUTION!!",1
465,"Great app needs some features tho: Honestly this app is really good. It’s easy to use and very intuitive. However, I’ve given it a 3-star rating because eBay needs to add some communication preference editing features. I was getting emails out of control; because while I could update the notifications I received in app, it only gives you the options to update push notifications. Lots of apps make it possible to update email notifications too, so I don’t understand why this app can’t. I finally was able to fix my email notifications, but it was not an easy or natural process (you have to go to the website directly, and god forbid you have 2-factor auth on, I was going thru a vicious loop for a while). This is probably my only real complaint and if they fix it I would gladly update my rating to 5-star",3
466,Great app with major glitches: Its baffling that there is no “add to cart” or “buy it now” button on a seller from whom you have bought in the past. This is especially annoying since the reason you would want to keep the same seller is if you had a good transaction in the past. There is also no option to empty cart unless u login onto the main website on a browser. Worse still is trying to find out on the app about a transaction where the seller is no longer listed on ebay. Trying to click on these transactions takes you to a completely irrelevant page and only way to find any info again is to login on desktop website. Small glitches which become increasingly infuriating over time,5
467,"Garbage App: I recently made my first and only purchase as a guest on the website.  After my purchase, the website asked for a password, if I wanted to create an account.  Regrettably, I provided one thinking it would be easier to track my purchase. Shortly thereafter, I was notified my account was permanently disabled.  

I attempted to find a customer service number, but eBay values it’s customers so little, it does not have one, at least not one I could find.  I finally contacted a customer service rep by chat.  He informed me I had to provide proof of ownership for the products I listed to sell.  I informed him I had listed nothing for sale.  He then informed me I needed to provide proof of identity.  Why would a customer, who provided valid payment, need to provide proof of who they are?  

My transaction went through, and I will receive the item, but for inexplicable reasons, my account is permanently closed.  I will not do business with eBay again even if they reverse their ridiculous position.",1
468,"Poor Customer Service: I ordered 2 items as gifts for Christmas and only 1 item was delivered although both items were marked delivered on the same day at the same time and I was home to receive the items but only 1 was delivered. I opened a case with eBay being that I paid for the item and hadn’t received it and it was a Christmas gift. eBay customer service let me know that if I did not hear back from the seller (which I did not) to let them know and they would step in on January 1st. I did so and within minutes they sent me a reply that my case was CLOSED and that I would NOT be receiving a refund. So now I have paid a seller for an item I have never received and not only can I not get the item (a Christmas gift) but now I will not receive a refund either. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed in eBay’s customer service and although I have been a long time customer, I will not be ordering through eBay ever again. I refuse to be scammed out of my hard earned money.",1
469,"Good features but quite buggy: I list items on eBay from time to time and have for years. The app makes this process (sometimes) easier with the ability to take photos of items directly from a listing. However, very irritating bugs appear such as listing options resetting for no reason when resuming a draft in the app that was started on a PC. Namely, options like shipping information, whether or not to accept offers, and package dimensions will just change on their own with no consistent rhyme or reason. I go back often to see that all of the listings I made in the app have enabled offers, even though I manually turn them off when building the listing. This is very frustrating and time consuming, to the point I will avoid the app whenever possible. Fix this nonsense developers... it’s been this way for months/years.",3
470,"Women’s shoe size filter is gone - men’s filter still there: I LOVE EBAY.  Please fix this.  SHOE SIZE needs to be a FILTER.  Men can search for shoes and choose their size, but you removed my ability to do this for women’s shoes.  It used to be a filter, but it disappeared.  I am not going to scroll through thousands of shoes looking for the ones in my size.  People don’t always put shoe size in the description.  Fix this and my rating goes back to 5 stars.  I love eBay.  I rely on you for shoes.    Now I can’t shop for shoes without getting a headache.  I have photo proof of the crazy drop down menu if you need it.  I would email you, but you only take phone calls and I’m not doing that.  Access to your customer service is too restrictive.",5
471,"New update issues: The user interface prior to the update was fine, I am not sure why the developers felt the need to change it. More importantly, the option to toggle buyer restrictions on/off is no longer available in the preferences section of the app. This is crucial as it prevents buyers with a certain number of strikes or those outside of regions you ship to from buying. Adding to my frustration is the fact that when it was available I noticed that sometimes it would toggle itself off. This was no big deal because I checked it every time prior to listing. Now I have to get a computer out to check which means this app is no longer user friendly. 

I also want to note that when I create a buy it now listing I can input an auto decline price but not an auto accept price like before. This is less of an issue than the buyer preferences but still a minor annoyance. This is the second time I have had to write a negative review because of post update bugs.",1
472,eBay will not help you if a seller scams you: I recently bought 500 dollars worth of comic books from Websters vault live auction from Orlando comicon. I then paid 300 dollars for the seller to have the books graded for me. The seller sent me 2 books with a sticker on them saying free. After 3 months of messaging the seller with no response I filed a claim with eBay. Because the seller had a tracking number he got by sending the free books eBay denied my claim. I finally got someone to talk to me on the phone from eBay they saw messages that proved websters vault scammed me but they won’t do anything to help me get a refund or have him send my merchandise. I guess they are all for sellers scamming people as long as they get their share of the money.,5
473,"For a Mobile App-It is Fantastic: Of course there are features that I can only access on the pc. With that said, the mobile app is fantastic. I use this app daily and I use the pc to access the site, almost daily as well. eBay has upgraded several aspects of its site. The app and the traditional site are both much more user friendly and easier to navigate, for both buyers and sellers. Fee’s are higher but this is about the app, the fee’s are the same on the app than on the traditional site. The app is very nice to have, as you can see any and all activity on your account. I’m sure the app will get even better over time. I’m extremely pleased with the app. I do recommend it to everyone but some people are not really into the mobile app’s and stick with what they know. I am going to help teach my nephew how to use eBay for buying and selling.  
eBay has evolved and lately it is the best platform to sell and buy from.
Customer service is very helpful and they do excellent work!

474,"Keeps gettin’ worse: Bloated, invasive, data mining app.  PRIVACY NIGHTMARE!!: App has become bloat, choked with “features” yet lacks BASIC functionality. ePay’s default search features greatly disadvantage small sellers of used goods in favor of large, impersonal fixed-price PowerSellers of cheap foreign-made garbage. I want to be able to SET my default search order.

When I press the “buy it now” button for the item that I want to buy, I am asked if I want to purchase a buyer protection plan. When I decline it, the screen returns to the item page and does not allow me to complete the purchase despite having a linked PayPal account and being fully logged in. 

When I close out the app and attempt to complete the purchase again, I’m sent through the same circle of BS. EBay really needs to fix this. I’d hate to miss out on an auction due to this hang up.

I also have a near perfect on time shipping rating and haven’t had any issues with my account until recently. For some reason my account got flagged as a dropshipping account even though all I sell is sports cards from my personal collection. They’re claiming my account was involved in dropshipping dating back to 2020 and now they’ve limited my monthly listings to 10 items and $500 total value. I’m in the middle of clearing out space for storage and an limited to selling now with this restriction. Every time I call customer service, they give me the runaround and don’t do anything to help. It’s extremely frustrating considering I’ve done nothing but follow all of their guidelines during my time as a seller and all of my customers have left positive reviews. None of these major corps care about their sellers.",1
477,"Too many scam buyers: As a seller Ebay needs to account for items that that are cancelled because the buyer didn’t pay, instead of adding that dollar amount as sold items. I am getting several scam buyers that tell me to contact them by phone number to discuss payment options and questions and it’s been frustrating because I need to wait to relist 4 days. Sometimes I can tell who they are because they have similar user names but I can’t cancel their offer immediately because that gets points docked as a seller.

Also when relisting, I wish there was a quicker way by phone with having to go through the options of having smart price listing on or whatever it’s called, etc. for each item all over again and promote my listing. I just want the same options and I’ll reedit if needed.",3
478,"Not What it Used to Be: Ebay has become a haven for scammers and overseas sellers of low-quality garbage. If you are selling something in high demand like and iPhone, be prepared to deal with 20 scam artists messaging you every 5 minutes and another 20 bringing the auction down by using buyout with a zero feedback account in Guam. I literally hit my maximum allowed selling revenue for the month and couldn’t list anything because of scam artists constantly using buyout on my auction and trying to pay with a stolen paypal account.

If you are buying something, be prepared for it to take two months to arrive. When it does arrive it will be very low quality or not even the same exact item that you bid on. When you complain, the overseas seller will offer you 10% back or tell you to spend return shipping that costs 10x what you paid on the item.

The worst part is ebay pushing their agenda on your sales. They force you to sell certain ways or leave selling options off of the mobile version. For instance, if they want you to sell in auction format and you choose a buyout format instead, ebay will not give you the option on the mobile platform to demand payment as soon as the buyer uses the buyout fuction.

Overall, this mobile platform for ebay is torturous to use and heavy-handedly forces you to do what it wants. Even the web-based ebay site is overrun with scammers and cheap overseas junk.",1
479,"eBay themselves scammed me !!!: I’ve used eBay very frequently for 6 years and they’ve finally scammed me. I sold my first items, where firstly they make you go through PayPal. The 2 items I sold for $375, I only got $343 hit with fees for both. Additionally eBay wants me to pay another $66 in total fees. So for items I sold for $375 each I am only getting $300 each. On top of this eBay offered a shipping method for the buyer to purchase that was not viable. The item apparently can’t be tracked when they leave the country. The buyers in China are requesting a refund saying they never got the items 2 months later. eBay broke their own policy offering a method they knew would end in me being scammed and now want me to refund the buyer with out getting the item back in return. This is seriously disgusting on ebays behalf and I will never be using eBay again after 6 years of frequent buying. I suggest you do the same !!! eBay will scam you at some point!! Avoid eBay if you don’t want to be scammed !!",1
480,Instead of a single point: I am not going to be the first one to say eBay definitely met my expectations first off by being solid to advise someone on anything subject that a customer might want answered and how to solve something so that wasn’t a complication or problem that wasn’t solvable so aside from being careful to avoid issues I would like to say I also appreciate their delivery arrangement from a prompt response letting you know what’s going on all the way through this process which from my experiences with eBay to be what would identifies with those meanings that make up what a guarantee is supposed to mean and that’s having the means to fulfill those they make predictable so thank so much eBay!!,5
481,"Ebay Customer Service the worst it’s ever been: Takes months to get refunds on items that were shipped to a different state and that was tracked. You will have to Call and baby sit 5+ agents each week in order to get one to actually fill out the computer work correctly. Meanwhile the person that can’t figure out how to ship or do refunds is still online getting more and more bad reviews while eBay just loses the money in their computer systems. eBay needs to invest some of that big brain power and get to making a good company again and clear out all these trash can sellers agents and employees. 
 Another scam and yet eBay let’s them keep selling called and asked ebay what they are doing about it and they said he is restricted. I said well he’s not restricted from selling bc his listing are still up. Ebay then ask what do u want us to do about it……. Idk maybe your job?????",2
482,"Why are bad sellers not taken off of the platform?: In the last month and a half I have had two more experiences with bad sellers! The first one, I made a mistake and ordered the wrong part. I returned the part which cost around $17 and received a credit of less than a dollar? The second one was this week. I received two headlight bulbs for my car and both burned out within 48 hours. I can always tell these are going to be the bad sellers when they ask me for a picture of the merchandise I received.. It is then followed by we will give you half of your money back. I’m about done buying off of eBay after all these years! Is there any way to? Other than to give them a bad review? It seems like they’re always based in China!  That’s just my observation it seems like US sellers are more reputable, then China.",3
483,"I've had numerous bad experiences as a buyer recently: Ebay had begun allowing sellers to do pretty much anything they want without recourse.  I bought a Harry Potter poster and the seller photocopied the print on an inkjet printer onto regular copy paper, folded it and mailed it in a regular envelope.  Not only did Ebay not refund my money, they continue to recommend this seller every time I open the app even though they have hundreds of negative feedback. (I hope you are paying attention, Warner Brothers) I ordered ""like new"" books from a seller who sent books that were ripped, covered in dried food and sharpee.   I accidentally clicked on a buy it now on an item, immediately tried to cancel as it was going to the wrong address but Ebay and the seller refused to cancel or change the address.  The majority of what is sold is counterfeit.  I'm closing my account.  I can't deal with Ebay any longer.  It's a mountain of bad buyer experiences against an anthill of good ones.",1
484,"Great App: All around a great app. Missing a few features though that are only accessible on a PC when operating as a seller. Kind of annoying, but it is what it is. Hopefully eBay revamps the system a bit for sellers so we can print out all associated documents with selling an item (invoices & packaging slips) on mobile. I’ve also lately been having many problems with sending/replying to messages via the mobile app where it keeps prompting an error and doesn’t send the message. Very frustrating. Still a 5 star app all the way though. Newest update just brought a few bugs and I just want more features lol keep up the great work eBay, but maybe lower those really high taxes too.",5
485,"eBay is the best: eBay is a great site to find vintage items that are very unique and useful. The eBay app makes it very simple an easy to use for the customer to use.

So that delayed the process while the “30 day guarantee” was flying by! Never got a follow up Especially conveniently after providing EVERYTHING they couldn’t see anymore on their end after 30 days because scammers are strategic! All the correspondences where a seller robbed me & how they did it. It’s no wonder they were comfortable doing so & they are probably robbing others as I type this! it’s like the more we evolve, in all big corps the worse it is for us consumers, customers, buyers, clients to anything today be protected, then to be scammed! I’m disheartened with all now big corps today! Apple you don’t fall far from tree either!",1
487,"eBay gone to the dogs: Not only has the app gone downhill but the entire experience on eBay has gotten horrible. I have items “saved for later” that I can’t delete, some of which aren’t even currently available. The entire eBay experience is geared towards favoring buyers and completely disregarding sellers perspective. Buyers can return items for a ridiculous time frame even if they break them with sellers having to pay the return shipping fees. Buyers can now buy items but never pay for them with no repercussions, all the while taking the item off the market for almost a week, and sellers can’t even leave negative feedback to warn others of this behavior. Needless to say I really don’t care for the latest app or the entire marketplace.",4
488,"Trash customer service & different answers!: Got Covid and was so sick I could barely lift my head, so I got behind on shipping or messaging people. When I got better, I messaged buyers and they were understanding. However, eBay’s people restricted my account for “fraudulent activity.” No big deal right? I’ll just send in ALL the information they ASK for to make my account unrestricted. Nope! 3 months past and my account is permanently restricted because “it was enough information.” ALTHOUGH I SENT EVERYTHING THEY ASKED FOR!! Not to mention they are holding about $500 worth of MY money for the items that were shipped AND DELIVERED, because they thought making my account restricted for fraudulent activity WITH shipped AND delivered products was necessary!!!! Now they’re telling me I have to wait ANOTHER 2/3 months for my money. 

Long story short, eBay is crap! Not fluent in English, can’t get all their representatives to say the same things, and like to hold money that IS NOT THEIRS!!",1
489,"eBAY could be an AI model: If you can compare the amount and scope of articles sold here with the needs and uses of the people who buy them, it could be categorized as a model plan, add the support of a solid solution of operating difficulties through standing by policy and you would have a working model.
This comes about by accessing the store shelves and back yards, ideas and services put forth to the public in need new and used.
The amount this business has provided in obsolete industrial products must be staggering, it almost as if you have a salvage operation down the block that is open 24 hrs and has your total inventory of parts and the cross reference of those, from minor changes to upgrading design can be had or close enough for that matter, Thanks eBAY",4
490,"I will rate your app when I am done reviewing it: You’re app insists that I rate it. 
I was only part of the way through the review and not ready to make my opinion of the app. 
The (x)out does not respond and it would not go away. 
I could not finish the review of the app to form a opinion of the app. 
I had to delete the app with giving it a fair shack because it asked for a review of it before I was done with my reviewing of the app. 
At that point I had to disregard the app as none functional for the app would not let me proceed any further with the review of the app. The review’s by user’s should be an option that the user chooses to do at their leisure. If the app is good the user will let you know when they want to. 
So if you’re app is going to be this way I will never have a use for it. 
I will be in control of every aspect of what I do not and will never bow to an app’s insistence that I do as it would have me do.   
I have been the victim of bullying and I will call it out every time I see. 
That review tab was out line when it did not retreat when I wanted to (x)out. 
Bad mojo. Offensive. 
If you put a (x)out on a tab don’t disable it for the user. 
That is what you are doing wrong. 
I got the app for I have wanted to use it after I made sure it was a good fit for my needs. Now I will never know if it would have been a good fit for my needs. 
Sorry.",1
491,Horrible platform: The customer service team lies and says they put in work orders for you but I’m reality they just watch videos or do other things at their cubicle while making up whatever their manual they read from says. eBay is too lazy to go thru all the mistakes the computer does and fix errors the computer makes when you completely follow policy. eBay is super quick to punish sellers if they don’t like something they see and they adjust their policies and have broad worded policies to just blatantly do whatever they want. They let buyers abuse sellers via messages without taking any action as well while giving buyers more privileges and making this a buyer favored platform even tho eBay boasts a safe and fair market platform that is balanced between buyer and sellers rights but this is blatantly false in my experience. Not happy with eBay lately as are tons of other sellers in the reviews here on all over other forums.,1
492,"Long time EBay user: EBay is great! Honestly, big fan...
However,,, I’m using you guys a bit less these days for selling as you your selling fees are steep. I typically sell items around $1000 or more and when it’s all said and done I’m always shocked at how much it cost me to sell on your platform. I’m starting to use other free platforms more and more, but I must admit, eBay reaches out to the most people than anyone else. Buying on eBay is great and I buy 10X more than I sell.  
I will say when things go wrong there’s really no way to contact anybody at eBay. Over the last decade working with you guys, I’ve only actually called and talk to a person once but I recall the process was really difficult to find a phone number and get to a human.
My final constructive criticism is around your invoicing. I get an invoice telling me what I owe eBay and you just go into my account and take the money, which is fine. My only complaint is the invoice never shows an itemized list of the fees from the items I sold. There must be a way to get a bill that is itemized but I haven’t been able to figure it out yet.
Thanks,
Matt",5
493,"Worst App for Sellers: It shocks me that eBay has 4.8 stars on the App Store, but I’m assuming that’s from buyers. It’s a great app for buyers, but terrible for sellers. I’ve sold on every platform there is, and I can honestly say eBay is by far the worst. It’s so full of scammers and you can’t even report them, eBay doesn’t care. Also the fees eBay charges you are NOT clearly outlined so be prepared to lose more money than you thought you would. If you end an auction early because the item broke or you change your mind, you have to pay the person with the highest bid. Why?? Also, someone can win one of your auctions, and then decide not to pay because they don’t want the item anymore. But do they have to pay you a fee? No, of course not. Because eBay only cares about buyers. Sometimes I redownload eBay because I’ve forgotten how awful it is, and then I get fed up all over again and delete it. Please, if you’re a seller, use ANY other platform. Depop, for instance, is very seller friendly.",1
494,"Buying fabric on eBay: There are not many bargains on fabric here.  Many sellers don’t make it clear what units are being sold.  Yes, it’s there somewhere, maybe 3 or 4 scrolls down through other similar offerings!  Very confusing sometimes!  FQ means fat quarter, some are offered by half yard increments, by the yard  or by uncut yardage.  This information is critical, and it is too often hidden ( perhaps accidentally)!  Before purchasing fabric on EBay, look at other brick and mortar sellers or their websites to see what “normal” prices are so you can compare.  I purchase fabrics in many different placed online and real time.  You can find lots of interesting things and lots of them are very overpriced!!! Some shipping is free, some is also outrageous!  I saw one FQ reasonably priced, with shipping well over $15 from US to US!!! Buyer beware( as always)!",4
495,"Hypocrisy: They took down my listing many times even though starting price was very low and below market price for the item. I still see hundreds of the exact same product being sold and listed, but they’re still up. The hypocrisy is terrible. If anyone sees this, know the hypocrisy and stand up against it. I emailed and called everyone in the ebay chain to speak out against such hypocrisy. You should do the same.  They’re trying to hide behind a sneaky email rejection of your listing but I’m not gonna let them. I need the real reason behind them taking it down and leaving hundreds of others of the same item up for sale. Just the worst. Everyone speak out against this",5
496,"eBay becomes worse and worse: I have an ebay for about 8-9yrs, being using well, almost never had problems with it, and the app is made well, but for the past 6months to a year, it start becoming horrible, some scammers has show up, and few times already items that Have purchased were deleted by eBay because seller is not sign to it anymore or so, question why those seller post are still available and shows when I or someone els looking to buy, then I have issues to make sure I receive a refund, wait 3 days until seller returns if not I have to call ebay again to ask for a refund, like really instead fixing it make it easier, and batter we have to run thro all this pain process... Saying honesty I’m disappointed about ebay and if it keep going like this, I’ll find other app, that really care about there costumers!!!",3
497,"Customizable notifications needed: Overall this app works well, but notifications do not. This would be greatly remedied if the app allowed you to customize alerts. For example, I would prefer to receive watched-item-ends alerts an hour or so before the end of an auction. Usually, by the time I see the notification (which pops up 15 minutes or so before the end of the auction), I’ve already missed the item. What’s more infuriating is that I sometimes get 11-minute-old alerts saying ‘auction ending in 14 minutes.’ That should mean the auction still has 3 minutes left, but more than once the auction has already ended on me. I would be more accepting of this discrepancy if I had the option to receive the notification earlier. 

I’m a millennial who constantly checks my phone, and even for me fifteen minutes is just cutting it too close.",3
498,"Disappointed: I use to love, love, love eBay.  I don’t like when I find a item at a great price and place them in my basket and because I don’t immediately check out because I’m doing my Christmas shopping and wanted to make one large purchase now because some items have a lengthy shipping date. Within four days the items that I really wanted that had a great price was removed from my basket. That left me feeling some kind of way. This is not the first time that this has happened. The first first time I purchased a security alarm for my resident and eBay allowed the seller to cancel my after I’d paid for it and waiting for it to be delivered because the seller that they made a mistake on the advertised price and let me have it at that price, but I could reorder the same item at a higher price. I reached out to eBay and PayPal regarding that issue and neither company responded. Shame on the both of you. I’m a loyal longtime customer/buyer and deserves to be treated better than this.",1
499,"Uncomfortable/Stressful selling: I have never left a negative review of anything in my life because I hate to complain, but Ebay has really caused me a lot of stress and anger. I sold a bike on Ebay and from the start, I was never told just how much money I would lose buy using Ebay or that I had no choice but to sell once listed without being fined. The buyer paid 6k for the bike, I am said to receive 4800 and I haven’t yet. Its been 2 months since the sale and Ebay put my funds on hold because I’m a first time seller. Now they said they have dispersed my payment to my bank and said that my bank should see the money with them and it will take 1-3 business days to get into my account, so I called my bank and they said they have no record of this yet. I highly recommend facebook market place instead. There is no reason for communicating with buyers to be so difficult, payment to be so stressful, and transparency to be so lacking.",1

I looked all over this metropolitan city and I couldn’t find any stores that didn’t have cotton or goose down pillows. I finally went on EBAY and found a cotton and goose down pillow. 3-4 years ago I found a goose down coat. A couple of weeks ago I looked for a goose down coat. I found one. I like the Pandora charms and I have a few bids in. I bought a 24K gold box chain necklace and need a few charms. ( Pandora charms ).
I also have bought some sandals and they came in pink and in purple. They have lasted 4 years and they look brand new. EBAY is a perfect platform for me.

I’ve purchased numerous wrecker’s and pieces of shop equipment for my small Auto Repair & Towing business to clothing, jewelry and sneakers. You name it and it’s on EBay at a better price! I’ve even bought EBay stock. Every purchase is insured and secured. I tell people all the time to look for items on EBay.

503,"Cancellation Process Needs Improvement: eBay system is flawed.  It needs to improve the cancellation process.  They lack efficient processes as other online competitors.  If you place an order and shortly change your mind and cancel, the system should automatically cancel the order assuming it hasn’t shipped. Real life example, I placed an order late evening 9pm, then canceled it shortly after (2 minutes later).  I had to wait to see if the seller hadn’t shipped it out.  Next day I get a “Could not cancel notification”, and the I get a shipped notification.  Wouldn’t the EBay system know that the item has not shipped when I cancelled it because the sellers hasn’t notify EBay that the item is shipped which would normally generate an email and tracking number?  

Simple solution: Buyer cancels, EBay system recognizes that the seller has not provided a tracking number or flagged as shipped, therefore the item has not shipped and order is automatically cancelled and funds credited.",1

I understand you charging final value fees on the cost of the product. But I as the seller have to pay the shipping cost to ship the sold item to the buyer.  I make no money from shipping.  So how does it make sense to have to pay you for that.  First class shipping is $3.50.  I charge that amount.  But I pay the post office that amount.  So you taking 9% of $3.50 for every sale makes absolutely no sense.  In addition to the actual postal cost I have to purchase envelopes, packing supplies, tape, ink, labels, and gas for the trip to and from the post office.  So I am already loosing money charging actual shipping.  But why does the seller have to pay you for what is a cost to them not an income?  Absolutely makes no sense.",3

I wish I could attach the screenshots in here. There is the difference when you buy something from a seller with 100% feedback and rating of 1 OR a seller with 99.1% feedback but 485,913 rating.

Now that I’m retired and trying to live off Social Security, which is impossible as most of us know,  so I’ve been on eBay selling full-time  for a lot of years.

I love being able to find what I want in most cases at a reasonable price and it helps to have many sellers to chose from and not run from store to store. To the door delivery. Love getting message that my product has arrived! Like being able to contact sellers. One of my recent purchases was from quicksalereno and our communication revealed to me that when you leave feedback when you talk about high postage it went against the seller. He is a great communicator and I want to fix it. I also mail out in my business and it hurts to pay postage at these new rates,That is what I was speaking of. Is there a way to retract and raise that score? Postage is not in the sellers control. But it is out of control so that makes me untruthful to say that I am pleased with it being so expensive. 
If we can work on at least my case I would appreciate it. But I do think it is a bad question. I'm at a loss. And I was HAPPY when I got a chance to write this review! It couldn't have been more timely!

Not alerts that auctions are ending soon on items I’m watching, not “discount alerts” for artificially higher priced items that have been “discounted” for the illusion of a deal, etc. If this continues, I’ll be watching a LOT fewer items — and by extension, buying a LOT fewer things. Please stop the insanity and keep messages for MESSAGES and notifications for EVERYTHING else. There’s also an incredible amount of nonsense messaging — for example,  “still interested?” notifications about an auction I’m watching that doesn’t end for SIX F*ING DAYS FROM NOW. It makes me seriously reconsider watching auctions and allowing notifications at all.",3
525,"App does not work: I tried to purchase online and I was told that I needed to run Java. Since I’m on IOS and am not running I tried to use the app. I downloaded, signed in, and confirmed my account via email. After that the system kept saying that I needed to confirm my mailing address, then gave me the same Java error. I called customer service number and spent 15 minutes online with a women who kept telling me that the app only has limited access and that I should really just use Chrome. Since I don’t have Chrome, and the app should work for the basic function of buying, I asked if they could just do the purchase, and she told me about ten times to use Chrome and not the app. That is the advice from the company. Don’t use this app. Very flustered. Just want to buy a kids toy and ended up with a very bad customer service experience. The app won’t work for purchases, at least it wouldn’t for me. Deleted off of my phone and tablet. Don’t waste your time.",1
526,Rate: I love using eBay but sometimes u run in too a sellers that missed worded adds and communicating with you trying to resolve that issue with the seller sometimes can be very difficult they usually tell you They will give you a 10% discount on your next order which being a buyer is not very satisfying for the customer especially when the Item is needed. Customer service with eBay is excellent if you call them with any problem they will resolve it for you they stick to their word. But some sellers can be very difficult with the customer. That eBay usually lines them out. EBay really does have your back 100% Believe in customer service like you’re a king and a queen. Thank you eBay for backing your customers.,5
527,"These bugs are like joke-level programming: When using this app to sell an item on eBay, you need to take a picture of the item you’re selling. The camera feature built into the eBay app is so bad, so laughably unbelievably bad. When you click the camera capture button, if there was any text on the item you’re taking a photo of, the text will become unreadable. Straight edges become jagged. The picture quality is terrible. It’s unacceptable. 

It’s almost as though the developer would rather you close the eBay app, take pictures with Apple’s camera app, and then import the photos to the eBay app from your camera roll. I honestly don’t understand why there was a camera included in the eBay app at all.",5
528,"Ebay has given me something to look forward too daily: eBay has given me access to an array of different items that I would no longer find elsewhere. It is perfect for replacement items that might break. Also it is great for finding rare clothing, and collectible art, toys, glassware, music, outdoor toys and clothing. Literally anything the list goes on forever. I love buying and selling on here! I have turned into a collector because of this app, and have learned so much. I buy something new and can sell what does not serve me anymore. I sell a lot of replacement parts for just about anything. It has entertained me so much through the years. For that I am grateful! Thank you eBay!!",5
529,"Couple issues but overall works ok if you’re buying: As a seller it shows I have say 4 items for sale, but when you click the 4 to open the page that lists them all, that page shows none. I have to search them by name as a buyer to see my adds. Same when they sell, have to go through notifications or messages to find them. 

If I’m selling 4 of the same item, & would like to offer 1 shipping rate for all 4 together if they buy all 4 together, (because i can fit 4 into a flat rate shipping package) I can’t do it. It charges 4 shipping charges. PayPal keeps the fee for the large total, I refund the difference to the customer & still paid a fee for the large total & not the correct total. 

If I’m a buyer it’s great. Searches well. Keeps track of a lot of info.",4
530,"It’s ok: I’ve been using eBay for well over a year now maybe even two, and I gotta say I’m a lil disappointed in some of they’re sellers. I’ve been ripped off 3 times now and was not happy at all, BUT however, eBay did Compensate and refunded my money each time. My only thing is now every time I purchase something, I have to feel worried if I’m going to get ripped off or not. It’s just a headache, but other then that, the prices are the lowest and I do find some items that are way too expensive on other sites, to be a lot cheaper on here. Just make sure to read the REVIEWS for each diff seller, and my best advice to give when skeptical about purchasing... is to CONTACT the seller! See if they even respond, and if they do... then you should be good. You should feel safer, at least that’s how I feel after contacting them. So I know this is long, but I sure hope it is helpful to others and new members! Thanks",2
531,"eBay App: I’ve been an “ebayer” for 22 years.  The APP makes it dangerously exciting to check on items, collect favorites, purchase quickly.  There are several features that as a long time user I just struggle with on the app.  Following my FULL watchlist, not just items ending soon.  I wish I could pinpoint sellers local to me so I could shop “nearbys” like a thrift (pick up versus shipping) and the redundancy of emails in the APP AND in my regular email AND push notifications is too much, so much I end up ignoring ALL of them.  For items I am most interested in, especially auction style, I set my own reminder alarm.  Like I said, calm down with the over-communicating and instead help me curate an easier stockpile of “favorites” items and sellers, more effectively.",4
532,Monies from something sold: I haven’t sold in a while and I recently sold something for $166 but I only get one 119 and some change I can’t find or see where the other money went even though I sold this for 166 or something plus I can’t get my money because I have to put in a checking account with a routing number and all that sorry but with all of the scams in the world and every country trying to scam the US out of their money I will not put a checking number from my personal checking account into this computer so I guess I lose $119 I’m sure this was in the fine print or even big print but that’s not happened before it’s not how it works before so I did not realize my loss so now I will not be able to sell Ebay I don’t sell them much anyway but I was hoping to,3
533,"Overall good: Still having issues, deleting multiple orders from same shop is not working. I have iPhone xr and once deleted they pop right back. Also I see the whole list of completed orders that I have even hidden on the website, the app shows them with no way to clean up by deleting old and completed. Buyers are sending messages at time of purchase and as a seller, I'm not getting them. This has happened several times with customers getting upset because they don't get color choices despite leaving a note. 

It would be nice to see an option of going deeper into eBay through the app and look at purchased shipping labels in order to reprint them. 

I do like the simplicity of seeing what is selling and posting my things from the phone though. Printing labels and completing shipment from my phone works great.",3
534,"OK had enough of this: First of all, I want all new users to read my comment and then decide whether download or not. This is basically what happened, me writing an email to the official. I never bought anything or sold anything, only putting some items in my cart and drafting an item for selling, but for no reason, my account has been locked for twice. My first account used my email to sign in, which is ***@***.com that also got suspended. I have been so confused since I barely did anything on it. The second account too. I didn’t even put one item in my cart, only liking a few today, but it suddenly said my account has been suspended. It’s only less then a month since I used eBay, but it had brought me such a bad experience that I can no longer handle my business. I am seriously angry about the situation, but since most comments are nice, I would like you to think before you download!",1
535,"Autocorrect Issue: I haven’t had an issue with this app in the past, but currently, it changes everything I type to something else. There doesn’t seem to be any way to disable the autocorrect feature and it automatically changes my search words to a different product entirely from what I am looking for. It doesn’t matter if I use quotations or not, it still changes my search. I contacted customer service and was told that this is an active bug that they are working on, however, when I searched for solutions on the Internet, I found posts from a year ago complaining of the same issue with no resolution. I am writing a review in the hopes that someone will actually read this and fix this issue. Please add a way to disable the autocorrect feature. I shouldn’t need to use a Google search to find products on your app.",2
536,"eBay scammed me: I’m a seller on eBay and one week ago my eBay account got restricted temporarily and eBay told me that if I contact their customer service and answer some questions they will reopen my account, but if I don’t do it within the next 7 days they will suspend my account forever, so I connected their support team right away and they said that they can’t help me and my account is suspended forever, and when I tried to explain the email that eBay sent me they ended my support. Today after 7 days I got an email from eBay saying that my account is banned forever. But if my account is banned today, why those customer service agents told me that my account was banned one week ago? Because they were lying and my account was was not banned. I think they were just lazy and didn’t want to help me reactive my account. My friends tell me that I should contact a lawyer and discuss this case with them.",1
537,"Sellers beware: I recently was scammed when a buyer reported their item as “defective”. This item was tested before shipping and passed inspection without any issues.
When the item was sent back, I noticed that the serial number on the product was different the one I had sent. The buyer had purchased my item in auction, reported it defective, then switched it with a non-working item of the same make and model. 
When I tried to dispute the claim, I was directed to their customer service page, which doesn’t offer any course of action to appeal the claim. When I called their fraud department, I was not given any option to report that I had been scammed, nor did I get the option to talk to a customer support agent.
eBay claims that they are concerned about security for users, but does nothing to back it up. This kind of behavior toward their users blatantly antagonistic and demonstrates how little concern they have for their users.",1
538,"New policy is horrible: I have had an eBay account for 18 years. eBay has recently changed their policy so payment is processed through eBay and fees taken out, as opposed to through PayPal. Shipping and tracking must be uploaded in 3 days, but payment isn’t received for up to 4+ days directly to my bank. While I like eBays fees being taken out directly of payment (their fees are another matter- you are charged more fees with a lower seller rating now, and higher rates and fees that are horrendous) I hate not having access to my funds in order to ship the packages. It’s like having to have money to make money. I’ve never had a below “Above Standard Seller” rating in 18 years. So even with 100% positive feedback, I now have below standard seller level and a restricted account with how much I can post now. The new system is awful and after almost 2 decades, I will be closing up shop and my business with eBay.",1
539,"Don’t waste your time: I had to try to sell the same item 3 times because the potential buyers would try and get you to do business off of eBay, which is against the policy and causes the sale to have no protection from eBay, I’m guessing the buyer can rip you off then. I would refuse, they’d cancel offer, I’d have to relist. There’s so many that the shipping location is inside USA and they have a positive feedback as buyer, but if you look closer they are actually overseas and the shipping review was like one, from over a year ago. They’d only have 1-2 reviews, enough to look good at face value. I tried to bring it to the attention to their “help” people so some less cautious person didn’t get ripped off, yet I wake up this morning to find it’s MY account that’s suspended and I’m officially suspended and am no longer allowed to buy or sell on eBay, so… basically don’t bother even looking at eBay as a tool for anything.",1

I was looking at a listing when all of a sudden I get a little notification for my gmail saying that my account has been suspended. I click on that and then it says “Because of security concerns we have to suspend your account” and I’m like WHAT THE- and I read the entire thing and it says “Your account will be suspended indefinitely” and that I can’t have or make another one. Now I’m going to be honest— The only thing I’ve been doing since I had that account is looking at shoes. I didn’t buy anything, comment on anything, bid on anything, I’ve just been looking at things. So think about what you did eBay.",5
541,Things you are looking for: I have been a seller & buyer on EBay for about 12 years or longer. Something I am looking for now matter what. You can think of something you enjoyed as kid example like your favorite toy. That is no longer around Just it. In EBay search engine just type in item you are looking for the most part. You will find what you are looking for. As Seller it is a great way to make extra money. Items that maybe just in storage that you hold onto for some reason. But you need extra money over time and price right your item will sell. I think if you just look around on the web site you will stay around like me. A member that has been here for over 12 years and counting. Thanks,5
542,"What a horrible mess: Ive been selling on ebay for years. I was under the impression that sellers and buyers were protected equally on this site. WRONG. Long story short, i sold a phone on this site, a fraud account stopped my item, made ebay say that this item was SOLD, and send me money on paypal. Here’s the problem, ebay tells me that the person attempted to commit fraud 2 DAYS LATER! After i already sent out the item. I call ebay and explain the situation to which they replay “take this as a learning experience” and puts all the responsibility on me. I am sorry, i am selling on your site, when something goes wrong, support me. Paypal does it, why not ebay. He tells me that i need to contact the carrier and see if i can get the item back, then make a police report, if i cant get the item back, oh well and im out of the item and the money and they dont want to do anything to correct the situation except for blame me for this. I am done. Besides their app turning into a terrible mess, SMH.",1
543,"Consistently good app!: I have been using eBay almost exclusively on the mobile app for about five years now and I have NEVER had a problem with it! Customer service team has been exceptional too and they are great in regards to scam protection. I get happy whenever I have the opportunity to buy something off of eBay—every purchase feels safe, secure & fluid! No they are not paying me to write this I just genuinely love the app so much I could probably spend hours on it if I really had the time to. Buying secondhand on here is amazing and usually people are very transparent! Let's stop buying everything brand new! Kudos to the dev team for being my favorite app to shop on for years now!",5
544,"Great app but there is flaws: I love the access to millions of eBay items in the palm of my hand and the fact I can sell, buy and be connected with messages with other ebayers, but the the app come with many flaws and lack many features I think should be presented in the phone. Flaws like leaving feedback, I have been leaving feedback and it still tells me to leave feedback and when I do it tell me error you already left feedback, or when a customer buys multiple items I can't print label off of my phone, I have to go to actual website and I still have to add the tracking number to other item when consumer buys multiple items. The mobile app also doesn't give the buyer or seller a choice to rate the buyer or seller in depth on there experience. In general the app needs a little more work, but im grateful for it",3

Two of them arrived damaged. One of them arrived very late. And finally, the last one, because of which I am writing this review, did not arrive at all. And I have proof - a tracking number! But EBay employees ignored this and refused to return my money. I can not open an appeal, the application is glitching (the latest version of the application is installed), and when I click open dispute, I get a white screen. Of course, I recorded a video of the screen. I tried to write to the support, there is only a robot, the word «agent» also does not react in any way and does not switch to a living person, and following the robot’s footsteps, I again switched to an unopenable dispute. For the safety of my funds, I will not order anything else on eBay.",1
546,"Bad for sellers: If you plan on selling on ebay, don’t. If you sell an item that is even close to being expensive, they will take down your listing for “counterfeit.” Even if the item isn’t counterfeit it gets taken down and if you try listing it again, they will just take it down with a suspension that follows. The customer service is the epitome of terrible, they don’t tell you why they think it’s counterfeit because they don’t want to tell me how they decide on which listings to take down. I have had so much inventory I want to sell on ebay but now I just can’t. They favor the buyers over the sellers. Their suspensions are super unforgiving where if they decide to suspend you permanently (which they did to me), you cannot appeal nothing, their decision is final. I really miss the old ebay, I’ve been selling years now but now every thing is absolutely terrible. DO NOT SELL ON HERE IF YOUR SELLING SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVE BRANDED ITEMS PLEASE. PLEASE DO NOT!",1
547,Great place to buy and sell: I have been using this app for over 20 years. It was a great place to buy and sell goods. For a few months now I’ve been having a problem with accepting an offer or requesting an offer. The only way to do either one of them is to use credit card or PayPal. I have available funds that I am not allowed to use to buy these items. The only way I have found to do it is to insert a credit card put in my offer and then delete the credit card. I have tried to contact eBay but that is impossible. It would be nice if they would actually bring bad customer service so things like this could be resolved.,5

549,"Many lousy sellers: eBay seems about 60/40 on wheather or not you get what you think you’re getting after reading the description. If you don’t get what was “advertised”, you still wind up, paying 25% to 50% restocking fee and shipping back to the seller. I’m now the proud owner of a nice spoke rear wheel for a Harley Davidson, even after going back-and-forth and chat with the seller to determine whether it was the right wheel. 
The seller had no return policy. Then, then, like an idiot, I ordered another wheel from a different seller there was described for my motorcycle year. Yep, you guessed it. It’s the wrong wheel. To add insult to injury the seller gets to keep 25% of the purchase price and I have to pay to ship it back and it didn’t come in a box so now I have to find something to ship it back in because the seller shipped it wrapped between two pieces of cardboard and a ton of pallet wrap.",2
550,eBay platform: eBay is a great platform and has a huge range of products that cross almost every aspect of daily living and interests. I have been on this platform for 23 years now and for the most part it has been hassle free. I can only think of one instance where eBay made a very unfair ruling on items that turned out to be counterfeit and I was told to hold onto the it until I heard from them.  Well I didn't hear from them and when I contacted eBay they told me that the return date had passed and they would not refund my money. That cost me thousands of dollars and I think since then I have been very wary of how to deal with any issues that I need eBay to step in.,5
551,eBay motors is a joke: So I have been selling things on eBay for several years on and off and I decided to put my husbands car on there not realizing that they charge $50 regardless of whether or not the car gets sold for just simply posting a picture and a description there’s virtually no money involved in them posting the image of the car and the description!  yet they decided that they were going to charge me $50 regardless of whether or not I sell the car and on top of that if I don’t Pay them the $50 I’m not able to use my eBay app well guess what there’s so many stores I can buy things out I don’t need your miserable eBay app for anything.

552,"Payouts: I sold 9 sonos speakers in near perfect condition. 

Initially, when posted the speakers there isn’t any kind of warning that my funds will be held for 30 days for going over a “certain high value amount”. 

The 9 speakers are sold and I purchase the shipping label through eBay and there isn’t a insurance option to ship them with USPS. I spent the money for secure shipping with all the packaging material and box from USPS. USPS destroys the box and notes visable damage several times before delivery. The box was completely damaged and 6 of the 9 speakers were damaged. 

I called USPS and they won’t take responsibility bc I didn’t buy insurance on it. They told me to take it up with eBay. eBay says to take it up with USPS. 

The buyer calls USPS and they tell him to return it in the same box if a claim can ever be validated. In good faith the buyer says, there is no way this box can make it back to you. So, let’s try to figure something out. 

So, I ended up sending him two more sonos speakers at all my cost while eBay and usps sit back and point the finger at each other. 

I am not trying to get my funds released. Even though, they can clearly see that my case is resolved and I went out of my way to make everything right. They are holding my funds hostage for 30 days. This type of business is unacceptable to me and it should for you too.",1

554,"Con artist site: I know that my review ain’t going to do much to deter people from it who needs a means to compensate themselves financially. But I genuinely want to dismiss people from dealing with their services and the people on this site. If your a buyer, this a paradise for you. Con and hustle people out of their products if you feel it isn’t up to snuff. Pay absolutely nothing for something after it’s shipped because you can claim it’s broken with no photos and still win. Or damage it yourself and demand a refund. 

If your a seller, be ready for all kinds of nonsense. You can win a case with PayPal, or your bank for the refund, but eBay will still declare the buyer is in the right. And have constant messages from people trying to pretend to be the buyer, only for eBay to claim that person is the buyer and tell you to ship it to them, when it’s a completely different user name and address. 

TL;DR : “Don’t sell on this site.”",1
555,"Transaction holds: As a new seller, it impedes on business and brings it to a halt when eBay places a 21-30 day transaction hold. I need those funds to continue to keep my operation going and not wait 21-30 days for prices of what I want to buy to inflate to where I can’t make the purchase. There’s no logical explanation to hold my funds for that long especially when an item is already delivered, with signature required, to the buyer. Yet I still have to wait a ridiculous amount of time because of eBay’s asinine payment policy. eBay has lost my business, they’re nothing but a monkey wrench in it. I recommend avoiding this legacy platform to sell. There are many other platforms existing now that clear your transactions and have your funds to you in less than a week. In these times of massive monetary inflation, your dollar is worth more now than it will be in the future, eBay doesn’t seem to understand that.",1

I’ve been a member since 2007 and I just deleted my account because today I got bad feedback from a newbie account that had no idea what they were doing. I appealed and lost. I was shocked. I wrote eBay. They held up the decision. The package was damaged and I refunded ASAP. Nothing humanly possible I could of done to avoid this. They left me bad feedback. As a seller you cannot leave bad feedback for buyers anymore, not matter what. That’s crazy. eBay has taken away all seller abilities yet we pay the 10% eBay fee, not the buyer.

I’m not mad about that. I’m mad that I have provided proof against this seller and he is still in business. They can’t help me, but they could help the next person who buys from this person. He has already received feedback from one person saying they didn’t get the exact item that was listed, but got something else. I didn’t get anything. So this person has my money and eBay is allowing them to stay open so they could scam others. Yeah eBay is wonderful and safe let me tell you. It was stupid on my part, but I didn’t read into it.

I can get all my account information, read my feedback, and generally just keep track of things. It makes leaving feedback for multiple purchases impossible, I have to select each item individually and leave a feedback. Are used to have to leave a manual feedback for each one but now its remember the last one that I used, a little more convenient. The app doesn’t even recognize the fact that you have account information, structurally the app is great. It doesn’t freeze or act stupid or close out, it’s just not very informative. It’s a very vague overview of the full eBay experience, for that reason I hate it. I Use it whenever they offer 10% eBay bucks back, but other than that I don’t touch it.

Being able to see updates on an item that I’m watching, bidding and or selling is a must and the Apple Watch is the perfect device for that. An app for the Apple Watch doesn’t need to have all the features of the iPhone and iPad versions but it should at least allow me to receive notifications for items I’m interested on and or place bids. The Apple Watch is the perfect device for those situations where you can’t pull out an iPhone or have access to a computer and now with the series 3 and LTE capabilities having an app for the watch becomes more important.

Package was delivered but now eBay says they can’t refund me because I didn’t require a signature. The seller didn’t require a signature when it was delivered to me!

I’ve had plenty of a lot of worse websites when it comes to shipping and they didn’t have to deal with all of eBay’s logistics. 

Products always come as described. I love buying used things, especially tools, video games and plenty of other items just because you can beat the deal your getting. eBay has does a fabulous job with their app and has made it very easy and functional to use. They’ve truly doing a fabulous job and I hope they stay around for years to come.",5
565,"Cancelation problems: 2 minutes after I purchased a item with insurance I changed my mind and tried to cancel my order. Only to be told it was to late and I had to try to work something out with the person selling the item. This was no more than 2 minutes after purchase. No person or machine could move fast enough to get that order pushed thru so it could not be canceled. I even bought insurance just in case the product was faulty or I had a problem. What kind of business is this that a insured item cannot be canceled in a timely manner. It’s not the money it is the sleazy manner in which this company operates that is annoying, frustrating and unfair to the buyer who should have the option (of course in a timely manner) to change one’s mind with peace of mind honestly integrity and not have to worry I want to be taken advantage of. 
Bad Business Practices makes for bad business.",1
566,"Holds funds on new sellers?: I’m a new seller and I made my first sale! Yay! Right? Well, no. Turns out, for no other reason than I am a new seller, my funds are on hold for 14 days. Oh, I’m still expected to ship the item, of course, despite the funds to ship also being on hold. So I decided to just cancel the order and do a refund. Not worth it. Turns out, I’d have to do the refund out of my own pocket… and just wait on my funds to be released. I’m just going to ship the item and wait for the funds; it doesn’t seem like I have a choice. But I canceled all the remaining listings I had on there and once this transaction is complete, I’m canceling the account all together. No thanks. Terrible experience.",5
567,"My appreciation for everyone on eBay: I have purchasedA great many items and products from the eBay source line. I have been very pleased with the business aspect, and the personal affiliation to the people who are vending their product’sAnd items for sale. I would say 95% of everything that I’ve purchased have been a pleasure to have been brought to me for my use. There have been small times and count that The item was not as it was described. And those disappointments are few compared to the amount of purchases that I have made. So I am well pleased with the quality, the correct item and description, and the packaging in the process of shipping. Sincerely Stephen Landua",5
568,"Awesome!: Awesome! eBay tops when you are really looking for items that are no longer manufactured. eBay is the online store where you can find those unwanted used items that people still happen to have and don’t want them anymore. Like they say, “other peoples junk but, it’s another persons treasure.” Only problem that some sellers are just pricing shipping charges way too much. Reason for that would be, because the packing is just too big for the item that does not really require too much protection or the item is too small for large packing. Besides all that, eBay app is a must when you are looking for hard to find or is just not made anymore.",5
569,"Filtering for sold items too complicated: I feel this has gone on way too long and may be intentional at this point. Filtering searches by sold Or completed status always seems to include an additional step like opening up drop menu or requiring constant reaffirmation by not saving search specifications. This is the only way to find value of items for sellers and should not be invalidated. Years of this, always changing slightly with updates yet always still not prioritized, instead on the contrary made to confuse, complicate, and impede progress. I don’t get it, seems it must be intentional for some malicious spiteful attitude towards your sellers, ie the roots of your business.",5
570,"Barcode Scanner: Update, I was searching for answers to my problem and I saw that somebody else had said that every time you update the app you have to allow permissions for the camera again. I did not know this and it has never worked for me anyhow so I went into my settings and Walla the barcode scanner works.

The App has been great. One thing remains the same.. The barcode scanner has never worked. It has never worked for me. I upgraded my phone to the newest iPhone and it still doesn’t work in the app. Every update I think maybe it will work now? It never does. I know it works for some people. Is there something else I need to do so that it doesn’t just show a scanner with a black screen?",5
571,"Ebay buries small sellers: My direct experience after many hours of preparation to sell properly on EBay has been infuriating. It appears to me that they do not allow listings from small sellers like myself that are too competitive to their “top rated and power sellers” to even show up in a search of the key words. Additionally, to get items that are competing with sellers with “stores” to show in a search of key words, I had to offer “free shipping”, returns by the buyer, and use their “promotion” process at additional charges to me as a seller just to get my items that didn’t directly compete with “top rated and power sellers”, but only to folks with stores and individual sellers like me, to show up in a key word search. If you are an individual and your item you list doesn’t sell in the first day don’t hold your breath awaiting the “it sold” message. After 3 weeks as a seller I’m running at a 4% success rate. I’ve sold 2 of 50 competitively priced items.",1
572,"STOP CHANGING MY LISTINGS EBAY!: Be careful when using this app. I sell a lot on eBay and adjust my prices to make stuff move quicker. Well, when ever I use the app to adjust a price, eBay decides my shipping is wrong and adjust it to what they think it should be. So if I don’t pay attention, they change the shipping and when it sells, often times people are charged shipping when I offer free shipping or they change it to the size eBay thinks it is, because obviously I have no idea even though I own it and packed it. So then when someone buys it, I lose money because they adjusted my shipping weight and size. AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COST IF YOU ARE A SELLER!

**Edited to add**

It’s STILL HAPPENING! Now its changing the titles to what they want. I start a new listing, put in my title and they change it to what they think it should be which is WRONG. If eBay wants to control that aspect of selling, buy my stuff and sell it yourself! Ebay is becoming more and more like big brother, AVOID if you can!",1
573,eBay: I’ve been selling on eBay for close to 20 years. So much has changed that it’s hard to be satisfied with eBay.  They take a high percentage at end of auction not to mention some of the shipping!!!!!! Then their side company PayPal also takes a percentage!!!really??  Crazy. They side with the buyers and not the sellers for a majority of the time. You can’t even give a negative to buyers. They can rate me negative??? That’s something I don’t care for. To be able to sell my items I’m happy for that. I just do not think they advocate for who is selling on their site. I have talked to many sellers who have just wanted to leave. Many have found other venues. I don’t know why they ask for feedback because nothing seems to happen. For years people have put in complaints. For what?? They do nothing to make us happier. They are too money oriented to care. Really sad.,2
574,"Customer Service: I have never had a problem receiving a product (and I’ve ordered a significant amount of items and this was one of the least expensive items I’ve purchased). Why do you guarantee to help your customers when you don’t even look into the case. Is there a customer service phone number I can call?
I was told by the other party to “check with USPS/& my mail carrier” which I had already done before I even bothered to contact you all?! My husband and I went through our mail again and again to make sure we didn’t miss it, checked with the woman who delivers our mail, checked with our neighbors etc. This was a minor purchase, but if EBAY doesn’t protect me on this how are you going to protect larger purchases? I’m frustrated with how this situation was handled. I am an honest person (I realize there are people who aren’t). It may have been delivered to a neighbor we don’t know. Who knows? Why are you going to  advertise “protecting” your customers when you don’t. 

I would like a response because I am a customer and am disappointed in how you all handled this as a company.

Sincerely,
Shawn",5
575,"Great place to sell: After initially having trouble to set my account up (my old account froze up, I suspect it was due to the change of policies on eBay happening at the time.) I believe I got caught up in the process so I had to close my account I had for yrs. Customer service kept saying someone would get back to me but never did. After waiting a month, I tried to sell my items on another site. Only one thing has sold in the month. On EBay, 9 have sold in less than a month. It’s exciting to wake up and check everyday!
Only problem is the long wait on the phone and/or lack of help from customer service. All they had to do was tell me what was going on so I didn’t sit around waiting over a month! Nonetheless, probably still the best place to sell.",4
576,My favorite Deanna Durbin film: This is my number one favorite Deanna Durbin film I think it’s one of her best films ever made. Deanna shines so bright in this film. I love storyline I love the costumes and I love the songs especially Happy Go Lucky And Free It’s Only Love and the title Something In The Wind and You Wanna Keep Your Baby Lookin Right.  My favorite scene in this is where Deanna is at a fashion show and slaps John Dall who plays Donald Read who later falls in love with her and says I’m insanely jealous I love the dress she wears at the Fashion show. I also love the part where she and John are on the balcony and she serenades him with the title song. I recommend this film to anyone who loves black and white films buy this right now you will fall in love with it once you watch it,5
577,"Almost 20 years buying and selling on EBay!: Through the years I have bought and sold many items on eBay. Over 1200 transactions and have maintained 100% positive feedback score. Recently I have had two issues purchasing jewelry that was not as described. Unfortunately, one of them was a gift that was given a month after receiving, and when the solid white gold tarnished and the coating came off, it was beyond the 90 days… so after multiple phone calls and having multiple associates tell me that this seller is conducting fraudulent activity on eBay my case was rejected and I was scammed and lost my money. this seller continues to sell on eBay. Between the increased seller fees and not feeling very protected or secure on eBay any longer, my confidence is definitely decreasing in eBay.",3
578,"eBay “app” is woefully lacking…but they don’t care.: There is missing functionality on the eBay app versus accessing the eBay website directly (such as when using any “smart device” versus a pc. Most notable and frustrating is the buyers inability to place multiple items from the same seller into their cart and request a combined total. Instead, eBay forces the buyer to pay for each item individually AND charges full shipping charges on EACH item in order to process payment. Then the seller must waste time initiating refunds on each item to compensate for the gross over charges of shipping charges. This has been brought up on just about every eBay initiated conference call, to deaf ears and closed minds. They don’t care because they (eBay) makes more money this way since they skim $ off shipping charges, hoping and betting most won’t either catch that or hope refunds aren’t made.",1
579,"The new text is ugly: Having been an eBay customer for more than 20 years, I have been through a few versions of the app. While I’ve only use this latest version for a few days, my initial impression is that they have really made the text ugly with this version. What used to be neat compact bits of information are now loosely presented, spread out faded, jumbled bits of information that often flow over to new lines of text unnecessarily. Things that used to require no more than a quick glance like tracking information have become something more like  a decoding task. I hope they can fix this soon, and I’m hoping there will be more to like as I continue to use this new, but so far unimproved version.",4
580,Not for everyone: My lady friend suggested I put some of my shoes on eBay(I have 70% of Gucci shoes) eBay is a decent site plus they walk you though the process easy I appreciate that cuz I’m not a internet person. Honestly it’s not for me but it’s a learning experience for me to stop buying shoes I’m not going to wear. It’s like I’m trying to convince people to buy my shoes? I feel like you should be happy I’m selling my real 100% authentic gucci shoes to you at a discount plus I have the receipts. But the low ball offers I feel offended/disrespected real talk!!! So it’s not for me. But eBay is a good place and with walk you though everything step by step so so easy to sign up hassle free. Perfect for clueless people like myself,5
581,"New Dark Mode setting is not for everyone: Though many people enjoy may the new dark mode option, it can be terribly straining on the eyes for others. Despite contacting eBay support, I am still unable to turn off the dark mode option. On both the app and classic site, the option to opt out of dark mode is not listed under ‘Settings.’  It seems as though it is now the new standard, which is unfortunate. It should be an option of preference for each eBay user. Perhaps the dark mode is helpful at nighttime, but it is headache-inducing during daylight hours, at least for me. Maybe the new update will contain the option to turn off this setting.",5
582,"Watch out when buying expensive items: Be careful when buying expensive items. Usually when buying cheap stuff everything goes as usual but when buying more expensive items and there’s a problem of any sort, ebay is not very concerned but they’re more interested in making a sale to get paid. Also, watch out for the Offers through ebay. They’ll hit you with taxes after seller accepted it and if you try to cancel, they’ll say they shipped it already. Ask me how I know: got hit with $111 taxes, 9 mins after the offer was accepted I tried to cancel and the seller says he shipped it already. No tracking number provided, all I got was “don’t worry I have 300 good reviews”. For some reason there’s always something going wrong when buying items worth hundreds or thousands so you might as well be better off using other online services for your needs.",1
583,"Update makes app absolutely annoying to use: EBay decided to update a perfectly functional app, and make it harder (and more work) to find information you need. For example before the update you could simply click “tracking” under your purchases to track… Now you click tracking but it only shows if shipped or not, you have to scroll to the bottom of the page to click tracking again! Let’s say you have 10 purchases you want to see where they are, before it was clicking tracking on each, but now your work just got doubled with zero benefit. Why on earth they don’t just have a tracking tab that shows the current location and status of each item I don’t know… EBay app never has been especially easy to use, particularly the selling part, but now it’s better to simply log in directly… or use competitive products instead.",1
584,"eBay more like fee-bay: So this review is from a sellers perspective 

Now eBay used to be a pretty decent place to sell things...sure it took time to build a reputation and actually start making sales
But once you got the wheel turning
you could sell just about anything on eBay within a week to a month 

Now recently eBay has made a change in their system, they ditched PayPal
Meaning that now if you wanna sell you gotta let them link up into your bank account
And they’re using their own payment processing system known as “Managed payments”

And not only that..now you also gotta give them your ssn? Like excuse me? Why?

That’s extremely invasive and if you don’t hand it over your not selling with them anymore

Also this has always been a problem but the fees are ridiculously high, 10% is insane to a small time seller

And don’t even get me started on all the overpriced features you can tag onto a listing 

But they know most people will accept the fees and happily give in and hand out their ssns 

After all “We’re eBay no ones gonna look at your stuff on the fb marketplace or poster ad and we certainly look better than offer up or wish over in the corner, we’re basically your only option get used to it! :)”",3
585,"Been happy until the update this weekend: The app added about 8 hours to my work load as it was incredibly laggy and kept replacing all listings photos to the last one posted. Trying to scroll down was like pulling teeth, photos being uploaded half of them would load blank screen white. With all of these negative reviews Ebay team says they refuse to credit my listing fees that went unfinished total of like $40 if that.   A company as big as Ebay not able to own up to their potential faults from a faulty app update, unreal. With proof of being hospitalized with no computer only my iPhone X, unable to even make a move without being directed to the bunk app. Incredibly unhappy and will keep escalating.",5
586,"Good for buyers, HORRIBLE for sellers: This review is more for my boyfriend who recently sold his ps4. After selling the ps4 to a guy, the person requested a refund saying that the ps4 is too slow a MONTH after buying it from us. Not to mention,
it was a PS4 in new good condition. But fine, not a problem, we’ll just refund the guy right? 

First off, Ebay automatically accepted the refund without giving the seller a chance to fight the argument, going so far to even have my boyfriend pay the shipping fee. When we got the ps4 back, the guy gave us a DIFFERENT part than what we sent him. We know it’s a different part because when the buyer sent us the piece back, it did not match the picture posted AT ALL. After contacting eBay about it, with numerous long complaints, eBay is still having us refund the guy despite him not returning what we originally sold him. All in all, eBay is great for buyers, but a complete absolute SCAM for sellers.",1
587,"Ebay app, good for buying, not so much selling: Ebay app makes purchasing easy. I always make my Ebay purchases using the app. Selling....not quite there. I use the app to import pictures and heading for item, but always save as draft and finish on the website. The app is too nagging with everything from product information to pricing. Example, if listing a Bad Religion album, it automatically fills out the genre as Religious/Devotional. If your description has new in its title like, it’s a new day, it automatically assumes the article is new. On the website, it doesn’t automatically fill in category, price, descriptors etc. The app use to be used by me for both buying and selling, but for awhile now, it’s changed for the worse and actually takes too much time to list items, especially if you have many items.",3
588,eBay poor costumer services: I have purchased a pair of shoes full price a month ago. Seller did not ship it! It did not respond any messages. I requested refund ! and so far I did not get my money back. You are not able to talk to representatives over the phone. They just talking and email about eBay money back guarantee! Which is a JOKE. I keep opening the case to solve my problem and requesting my money back. Please be aware shopping in eBay because they don’t have a customer service and enough team to solve your problem! Imagine your money sitting in eBay accounts for long time . No one help you. I am assuming eBay promotes fake sellers because it helps them cash flow.,5
589,"Fixed price listings only offer good til cancelled: I can no longer list my items through my phone or iPad apps. There is no longer a choice for how many days I want the listing to be if it’s fixed price. It’s automatically ‘good til cancelled’. I wish I never updated this. I feel like it is a trick to make money off of unsuspecting sellers. It will automatically charge me every 30 days until ‘cancelled’ or sold for this listing. I prefer to choose how long my listings last! Now I have to go through the process of taking pictures, info, description, save as a draft. Then go to the full website to be able to access the drop down menu and choose how many days I’d like the listing to last.  This hurts sellers.  eBay needs to change it back ASAP. Also, stop automatically making it accept offers! Let me choose that! It will secretly do it when I change a price during a listing and the next thing I know it is accepting offers!",1
590,"Stop auto-best offer!! Make sellers answer questions. Photos on the app are problematic: Make sellers answer questions. A simple answer to a measurement going unanswered costs them a sale and I don't buy the item if I don't know. 
Also- eBay automatically makes your relisted items accept offers. I don't want to accept offers unless I specify! This is really irritating. 
Also, the photos are a time consuming pain because if I update my listing's photos (like add a photo) then suddenly the order of my photos is all out of whack. Some pics even show up as a duplicate! And just now I as checking my listings on the app, and my photos were out of order and duplicates randomly. I went on the desktop to check and it was fine. There's been times when I've edited my pics on the app and they were out of order/duplicates and this showed up even on the desktop. Major problem.",2
591,"Bad experience: I have been buying from eBay for years , I’ve spent thousands of dollars in getting great deals and at times fantastic deals . Recently , I purchased an Insta 360 degree camera from a China based seller . They sent tracking info that was absurdly off , I reached out and they sent a different tracking schedule . Now it said delivered , I never received it , I contacted the seller - they ghosted me , I contacted eBay , they denied my claim and now I am totally disappointed !!!
Bad on you seller and more so to eBay for not taking care of an American buyer whom has been doing business with eBay for more than a decade ! eBay believed the China based seller over my real experience. Unfortunately , I still have a few purchases I made and when I have them delivered - I will quit eBay and move away from this forum . eBay has proven to be a big , big tremendous let down !

Some buyers are just crooks, so seller beware. Also always verify, and research anything coming from China.

Done tried everything eBay wanted me to do as in asking the seller for help and looking around my complex and all that stuff and everything still falls on deaf ears!!

596,"No seller protection. Buyer lies. Inadequate shipping fees.: I have been on since 2015. Recently I had a few purchases back to back. In one the buyer claimed there was missing and broken. When I asked for photos he denied.  Obviously buyer remorse. I thought. But when he finally returned the item. One month after eBay refunded him, I got the item back incomplete and could not make a claim since it was a closed case. He stole parts of it. 

In the other sale, they claimed same. The buyer changed his mind “bought” replacements and would keep the item after standing up for myself. 

Another time I had to send an item to Puerto Rico, I paid more on shipping than what eBay claimed it would. Lost money on the sale. 

Next, I tried contacting eBay to cancel my last sale after trying to resolve my first dispute since August. I am unable to get in touch with a human. Email takes forever, I don’t get email notifications because eBay response is so delayed. 

Buyers are incompetent. They do not read. You have to message them before accepting funds to assure if they understand the listing details and what they are truly buying.

Thank you for working on the other issues and making many of them better.

On some levels, as an antique dealer, it negatively impacted the meaning of “rare” and “hard to find” and certainly value but as a collector, it was heaven and made things available that I would never have had an opportunity to acquire.  It has also made possible to “buy back” many memories from my childhood that I had lost and had great sentimental value for me and as I grew up in a very remote place, I found many things that were simply dirt cheap.

601,"Overall I enjoy eBay but 4 stars for one reason.: The thing that upsets me is I get charged several dollars when someone accidentally makes a payment. That is straight up robbing your clients(us vendors) for zero reasoning since the refund can be reversed the same day without fees. So why did I get charged for a customer submitting an offer and it forced them to buy it afterwards and they didn’t want it they said. So giving them back their $275 bucks costs me almost $10 bucks and I barely make any profits as it is after fees. Regardless, please eBay change your policy on refunding your own customers at no expense to us vendors. Since we pay the highest in profits for you all to host a website/app and to bring clientele to us.",4
602,"Annoying bugs: When listing, there are frequent errors for things that are not visible on the listing page. It can be frustrating to add photos as well. There’s also the never ending “add recommended specifics”, of which most or all are inapplicable to the item. 

I also find the “offers” feature frustrating. Right now, I have a “pending offer” showing on an item, but when I review offers it is not there, but instead it is in “completed”. 

There are random crashes also, and when setting shipping the interface is irritating. 

There’s also the constant pressure to do an auction for items. I have never received as good a price with an auction listing as with buy it now. The trending price information is fairly useless. To top this all off, items basically don’t sell unless you pay for the promoted listings, the price of which makes very little sense because it is hidden behind a percentage of the ending price. 

There are a few other bugs, including random crashing , that I can’t think of right now.

I have waited and waited and waited for upwards of 6 months for items to arrive when you say it was delivered many months ago because I wasn’t ever prepared to receive a file via email .

604,"Rave review for eBay:: I have been an eBay buyer since before, I believe, 1995. I have purchased through eBay fine furniture, rare fabrics and laces for myself, and specialty gifts so numerous that I have long since lost count of them.  I have usually never seen anything like these gifts anywhere else and I would not even know where to start looking. (Where else would I find Spinone clothes hooks before 1990?)

I have dealt with sellers who are uniformly gracious and helpful. They offer items I have never seen anywhere else. They have always been quick to point me to other sellers who might better meet my needs. With exceptions so rare that I cannot remember any, they have been a pleasure to deal with.  

On the single occasion when my poor health caused a difficulty which was entirely my fault, eBay quickly resolved the problem, accepted my apology, and made all well.

I was also quick to inform eBay on the single occasion that a seller offered to conclude a transaction outside the rules and auspices of eBay. I have always been straight with eBay and eBay has always been straight with me.

I highly recommend eBay.",5

Once you sell something the buyer has one month to nit-pick and try to find any possible reason to return your item. If they want to return it eBay then holds your funds and forces you to send the purchaser a return label and a full refund. They also give the buyer almost an additional month to send your item back (The eBay money back guarantee does nothing) By time you sell something and get it returned could be 2 months and you’re out the money you spent on the original shipping and the return label. You’re better off selling on Facebook marketplace so you never have to deal with the scrutinizing, nit-picking, meticulous buyers on eBay that just buy to “look” at your item and see if they like it knowing that they have 2 months to return it. Like I said, buying on here is great but selling is a PAIN!",1
606,"Poor app cannot use it to upload items easily: 1. Trying to upload an item and for some reason when you go to the shipping preference all you can enter are the dimensions and weight. You cannot select shipping preference such as first class or UPS etc.

2. If you create an item in the mobile app, it is not allowing you to input the compatibility information. Thus you have to save as a draft however when you go to pull it up on the main site the compatibility feature is not working so you can not  manually put the information in.

I love EBAY but lately it’s becoming very sloppy. I’ve been listing for over 10 years and disappointed about all of these errors.",5
607,"EBAY IS A GREAT SOURCE FOR BUYING MERCHANDISE.: We enjoy using eBay for buying the things we need and the things we think we need. The things we think we need is the funny dynamic about EBay. We are collectors of so many different things. So, like so many buyers like us, we buy things that fit well with our collections that, at the moment of buying, do not fit well with our finances at the moment of purchase. In the end, although these unnecessary purchases create a little pain for us to meet our standing budget, we have, in effect, bought into more enjoyment buy owning the things we really love to own, irrespective that we initially suffered just a little, financially, when we first acquired them. Thank you EBay!!!",5
608,"Pretty great to use: The app is way easier to navigate than the mobile or desktop browser. 

If developers add an option to customize item notifications, this could be a 5-star app. The only thing I hate about it is the constant push notifications. I don't mind notifications about items I'm bidding on, sold, or bought, but ""ITEM ENDING SOON, HURRY UP AND BID!"" several times for each item gets really annoying. I also don't consider 24-48 hours as ""ending soon,"" on top of multiple reminders. I had to just turn off all notifications on watched items. If we could customize, say, one notification 12 hours before it ends, that fits my buying style better. Just the ability to choose your own notification settings would be great.",4
609,"Latest update: So apparently after the most recent update, an app that I've been using on my iPhone for years no longer has a functioning watch list which I use all the time. Yes, I rebooted my phone. Yes, I reloaded the app. Still doesn't work. Yes, I'm running a version of iOS that's at least 10 or more. Suddenly found myself in the eBay community forum reading comments where people are suddenly told they need to update their phones to use the new version of the app and the response from eBay is just use the browser. With all the technology out there certainly it can't be that hard to run multiple versions of the app. I've had problems in the past but usually they fix themselves quickly. I like eBay and use it a lot, but this kind of customer service makes it yucky. You can do better.",3
610,"Ebay disappoints: - Sellers frequently present items deceivingly, requiring a precise examination of the fine-print descriptions (Ebay feels at times like a giant, virtual, used car lot with shifty salesmen running around unchecked)

- Formatting options on my iPad are poor (I can’t highlight and copy item descriptions when searching the web for independent reviews)

- Notification options are limited (I can’t opt for Ebay to notify me when I’ve been outbid without also opting for unending pestering solicitation notifications for other products)

- As of the time of this review, I cannot complete my purchases for some reason (the “confirm payment” button is grayed out and will not respond when I select it). Awaiting reply from Ebay to my help query

- On a positive note, I am impressed with the seemingly limitless purchasing possibilities on Ebay (just about everything and anything I can think of turns up for sale here, with numerous choices)

- Product description photos have always been very high resolution and detailed

- Would like to have a reference menu to explain certain guidelines and functions I’m not understanding (For example, after bidding on one item, the buy it now option disappeared, never to return.  Why is that?j",3
611,"16 years down the drain!: I’m getting old wow, I can’t believe it’s been this long with eBay. But they let a seller send hate mail and didn’t refund my money. Then they erased my feedback and let the seller remain. They have a 100% rating and they been scamming for years if you read their feedback. So eBay is clearly more interested in protecting criminals and fences than hard working people. It’s all money to them. Dirty or not they don’t care. They outsourced all common sense to the dust bin. They’re bureaucratic and put protocols above their customers. I’m done. I mostly make purchases. And if you want something broken, lost, not what you ordered, and harassed, ebay is your place. But I could get a good deal, a better deal, online elsewhere. And now I will!! I’ve been loyal like a fool for years. I’m divorcing these jerks. It’s over! Hey wait didn’t they recently ban adult content too? Oh they’re fell off!!!! BOYCOTT EBAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

Was testing out how to use the app and accident made a bid, the app did not tell me how to delete the accidental bid (I had to search it up) then it did but let me delete it. It said I had to contact the seller (did not tell me how to do so) had to search that up also, I contacted the seller! I did not want the app after all of this unnecessary drama. I tried to delete my account but it did not let me because of the “pending bid” that I did not want in the first place. Followed the directions on how to delete the bid and it told me that there weren’t any bids under my account. It does not make any sense because it still did not let me delete the account.

613,eBay’s gift card problem: I love eBay and for years I have asked friends to give me eBay gift cards for birthday and Christmas but I was recently trying to use a batch of my cards and was having a problem getting them to work so I went thru the eBay chat helper and I found out the following two things: #1 even though you can put up to $1000 on one card the fact is if you try to use more than four gift cards of any denomination it will be rejected that includes leftover amounts. A lot of people give you $25 gift cards and that is a problem that eNay needs to fix. My review is really five stars for eBay but one star for eBay gift card policy,5
614,"Latest update awful: The last update screwed up all of my saved searches. It shows searches with new items and then when I open it, no new items. Wish I could revert back to the previous version but I don’t have that option. Very irritating. 

Previous review:
1 Star. This app keeps getting better for listing, selling, buying... They are really improving the features. Unfortunately the latest update didn't follow this trend. I uninstalled it and reverted back to an older version. The current version was harder to navigate, had more taps to get to the same screens, and screwed up my searches. I have a specific search set and saved but now, suddenly the update thinks it's smarter than me and keeps searching for an alternate spelling. Then I have to click the ""search for [original spelling]"" link. Useless.",2
615,"Beware of Hidden Fees and Unjustified Payment Delays: I am writing this review to express my deep disappointment and frustration with eBay's opaque fee structure and payment policies. As a seller in dire need of immediate funds, I chose eBay to sell an item of great personal value. However, the experience turned out to be disheartening due to eBay's lack of transparency and unreasonable policies.

Firstly, eBay's fee structure is excessively complicated and not clearly communicated. As a result, I ended up paying significantly more in fees than anticipated, which was a hard hit considering my urgent financial situation. This lack of clarity regarding fees is misleading and unfair to sellers who trust eBay for their transactions.

Moreover, the most distressing part of my experience was the 30-day hold on funds after the sale. This policy is not only unjustified but also highly impractical for sellers who might be relying on these funds for urgent needs. The money, rightfully earned by the seller, is withheld without a valid reason, causing unnecessary financial strain.

I strongly urge eBay to reconsider its policies and improve transparency, especially regarding fees and payment processes. It's crucial to treat sellers fairly and respect their financial situations. Potential sellers, please be aware and consider alternative platforms that offer more straightforward and seller-friendly policies.",1
616,"Beware of Scammers: eBay will allow you to get scammed and do nothing about it. An algorithm chooses who is correct in disputes and scammer have figured out how to open a profile, but something and then disappear. eBay flags your profile and will increase your fees and then do everything possible to not reduce the fees. I had positive feedback from 20 people recently and my percentage went down, that’s not mathematically possible. When you have an issue you will have to call the Philippines and speak to someone who barely speaks English and hope they understand what you are saying, but probably not. eBay is becoming a trash place to do business.",5
617,"Required info out of order: Once you enter in 1) photos and 2) item title, the next rubric is 3) item specifics—but the item specifics are dependent on the next rubric—4) category.  So you are going ahead whistling as you work, fill out photo, title, the incredibly tedious and inane item specifics and then you get to item category and OH Fck—the listing you copied from has used the wrong category! Just great. so you change to the correct category and then, BOOM, all your item specifics are erased and you have to do them ALL THE F OVER AGAIN.   Suddenly you no longer feel like whistling. you are forced to do the inane Item Specifics all over again.  

IN SUM—engineers put the category rubric immediately after photos and title. 

ALSO, if you choose Fashion Jewelry as your category, why don’t the Item Specifics for Fine Jewelry disappear?  Why am I prompted to give how many carats and what not about costume jewelry? I mean eBay is a big company, theJewelry  category has a higher fee than other categories but you still can’t deal with this BASIC issue. 

FIX BOTH THIS ISSUES PLEASE.",5
618,"Fake buyers: I started selling here like two months ago, all of a sudden five sales in one day but they have 48 hours to pay, the next day I get two messages from people saying to call them on the same phone number. So I realized they were operating on two separate accounts buying from me one after another in minutes. There is no button to report these fake accounts, and when eBay cancelled the other other because a hacked account ordered from me, they didn’t remove the payment pending so it looks like it is still waiting for payment. If you got no face and no ratings good luck because I won’t be selling to you",5

I am completely unhappy about the new shipping labels page. I want the old page with the drop down boxes that list all options on one single page. I cannot forcefully enough express my dislike for the new print shipping labels page. 
Printing International shipping labels are impossible through my app or iPad.

621,"Sick of the regressions: eBay hasn’t improved or added a feature in the 5 years since I last used this app. Other than dark mode, that is.

Now they take away the number of results from saved searches, replacing it with the words “saved search.”  I know it’s a saved search. I saved the search. What does that do to improve the search experience? Nothing. But taking away the number of results is disastrous. I’ve no idea if I have one screen full or 80 or 300. 

This is typical of the experience on eBay. You can search your watch list on the app but not on the site. Why not? You can’t filter your purchases on “needs feedback.” Why not? 

Why do I get item ending notifications for items I’m not watching or bidding on? That’s useful for tricking me into thinking I was interested, is all. Do you really want to be the company that tries tricking us into purchasing something?

You split notifications into “act now” and “other” but put shipping notifications into “act now.” Why? How am I supposed to act on that?

The list goes on. Any useful feature they come up with eventually goes away.

Do you even have a UX person on staff? Do you do A/B testing with these features? Do you just change things randomly to make it look like you’re doing something?

Anyway, I think I’ll move on to Etsy or something for a bit.",1

I was able to contact the seller a long time ago and they said they would reimburse me for now and ask that I send the money back after I received my orders.

It takes too long deleting items one at a time.  Also would like option to pay by seller when in shopping cart instead of having to pay everything at once.  Also please crack down on the shady sellers, knockoffs and sellers who repeatedly post one thing and ship something completely different...then they only offer a 10% refund.  They’re literally making money off people by shipping junk and only giving 10% of their refund.

I called to question this, and after 20 minutes on hold was told it was because I didn’t fill out all of the personal information.  When I signed up through the mobile app I was never given the option to fill out any additional information.  I was then told I would need to provide a series of personal information over the phone to get the account unlocked.  At this point, I was already frustrated and hesitant to give that kind of information over the phone.  I unfortunately will not start using EBay after the experience.  If the situation is indeed a result of a bug, and  not a scam, the company needs to fix the bug ASAP, it is a horrible first experience with the service.",1

I use buy it now 100 percent of the time, yet, I am not aware of anyway I can set that as the default. Often while browsing I have to save my place while I exit the screen to check to see if I’m in buy-it-now preference mode. Sometimes I lose my item while doing so. Not a big deal-just an annoyance. I also have had my bank account hacked, I believe, by an eBay merchant or imposter of an eBay merchant. I would have appreciated more help than I got from eBay attempting to track down what happened. Got almost no support. It happened again a few days later.",5
627,"Ebay not for Sellers: Ebay has created a culture where sellers are forced to start their auctions at .99 cents in order to see activity - in many cases items sell for that low start when savy buyers home down on those auctions.  If that is the environment you create then you should make it a fair zone by not charging Sellers for insertion fees and reserve prices.  

In addition, if Seller has a no return policy, you should not force seller to accept returns when they receive item as described and want to return because they expected more!  That is why Sellers post item description and photos which are part of the description.  And when Sellers disagree with buyers - Buyers should not be allowed to give negative feedback.  All of these accounts demonstrate your non-support towards Sellers.  Ebay has always struggled in recognizing that Sellers are your customers too!  We provide the merchandise, pay your fees and yet we have very little customer support!",1
628,"Ebay actually heard me!! They took my app feedback!!!: I opened my eBay Seller dashboard and saw a new feature that happens to be something hyper specific suggested for Seller Tools! 
How do I know it came from my feedback? Besides the hyperspecifity, I have had some experience professionally on the back end of UX, so my feedback is refined in it’s usefulness. Plus, I know it’s from me because i only suggest features that don’t exist yet I don’t nitpick problems. My feedback is gold and I normally restrict gifting it to my Corporate overlord of choice, Google, which is so vast that I would have no way of knowing if Google implemented something that had been suggested by me.

629,"Buying is great. Selling?  meh: I’ve gotten some wonderful deals from some great US based vendors.  But buying proved problematic when folks would win auctions (pushing other bidders who might have paid aside) and then never send money.

Once this happened EBay recorded them as sales and it seemed almost impossible to get those unfunded sales removed from my account.  Maybe I just was unlucky, but I finally gave up selling because my wonderful experiences with some great vendors didn’t transfer to the people I met when I tried to sell things myself and the wonderful feedback I would get paying promptly often mentioned clues to the fact that seemed rare.",5
630,"Seller beware!: I recently sold an IPhone on eBay. It was brand new until, the customer I sold it to wanted a refund 3 weeks after purchase. The customer stated the device did not turn on. eBay will always side with the buyer. I inquired about the phone return and suggested the buyer go to Apple and tell them the phone doesn’t turn on and it would still be under warranty. The buyer opens in case eBay sides with the buyer. The buyer doesn’t even return the phone before They are granted a full refund. So eBay policies are perfect for criminals. You don’t even have to return the item you purchased as soon as tracking information is uploaded on eBay, eBay processes a return for the buyer. The item DOES NOT HAVE TO BE RETURNED TO you, ebay will process a refund in favor of the buyer. Sellers beware! The phone I sold and did not receive back $973 USD. Ebay literally sent me a link stating “things to avoid next time.”",1
631,"Improvements: Great platform for selling but a lot of improvements could be made with policy. 1) if buyers are required to pay within 72hrs then sellers should have to also give item to postal service 72hrs after payment. Sellers just create a shipping label and take their time actually sending to ship off. 2) Add video of packaging. Seller can record packaging and buyer record opening of package to help in disputes, if buyer does not record opening he or she shouldn’t be able to dispute condition. 3) notifications with new listings, for collectible buyers, in constantly have to check the app for new listings, would be good to be notified, example, if I’m buying “Joe Burrow” cards, any time one is listed I can sign up to be notified",4
632,Account suspended forever with no explanation: I am relatively new to eBay and have only sold a couple things. But yesterday I got an email saying I’m permanently banned and that if I had any questions to contact them but without being able to get into my account I can’t email them and ask what happened. And if it was because of the last item I sold then they could’ve said something when I posted it on the website like my other way better marketplace mercari did right when I posted it. But eBay let it get posted twice and let it sell twice and then when I shipped the item the closed my account so I don’t get my money for my sold item and it already shipped so they aren’t reimbursing me for my loss. Kind’ve super shady to do after I shipped the item. I thought eBay might’ve been worth it but not like this. Sad that mercari’s algorithms are more on point than eBays.,1
633,"Not recommended as a selling platform.: As a 19 year loyal eBay customer/seller I e had it with their return policies. I’ve had this problem 3 times now where buyers will send back empty packages, but I was still forced to fully refund the buyer. 

This last time, I contacted eBay as soon as I received the empty package, and I was instructed by their customer support that I had to wait till Tuesday, to let the buyer respond. Tuesday morning comes buy, eBay fully refunded the buyer out of my funds. I re-contacted eBay and after a lengthy conversation, I was told that there was nothing they could do, the buyer had already been refunded. I followed their instructions, and still lost money. I was told that I could attempt to reclaim my money outside of eBay. I did not pay for my seller’s subscription to be screwed like this.

Their refund system does not allow you to block, or deny claims when you have a bad customer falsifying their returns. All three times, I ended up eating the cost, which was less than $200, but it’s the principle, not the monetary cost. eBay has made thousands and thousands off of me thru the years, and they lost me, my store, me using this platform to buy, all over bad return policies, and bad customers. 

Do yourself a favor, find another platform that doesn’t reward bad customers.",1
634,WARNING DO NOT SELL ON EBAY!: This is a warning to all sellers on eBay. Do not sell any items on eBay especially if it’s of value. eBay does not back sellers up and there’s a lot of buyers who scam sellers. All buyers need to do is claim the item is not as described and send back a false item. eBay always sides with the buyer and fully refunds them. So as a seller I don’t receive my funds for my item and the buyer keeps the item and also receives a refund. eBays policy is terrible. I filed an appeal and the appeals department is no help. I filed an appeal about 7 times and eBay’s response is sometimes you take a business loss. Take your business elsewhere if you’re a seller. If you do not believe me look up “eBay sellers take a stand against scammers” article written by Anna Tims on the guardian. The only way of maybe getting your money back is going to court. Save your money and time and sell on another platform. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ITEM!,1

Jeez, how many more days do you need to be ready to let me have money that was paid a week ago to me AND you already took your fees too? Immediately? Criminal, the way the payouts work. How many sales do I have to have until I get paid in a reasonable amount of time. Buyer paid in full on 6/15, it 6/23 and I don’t have an Fn dime. You crooks. The buyer has had my sale item for TWO days now. I hate this bull crap. My last sale item that was paid for on 6/17 is my last crummy sale I have to deal with horrible eBay. I could sell more stuff, lord knows I need the money, but feel demeaned and stepped on by eBay. I don’t care if eBay continues or not with this crappy pay model for sellers. But I won’t ever consider eBay a fair company. Shame on you crooks. Two sales still no money. Thanks for nothing you idiots.",1
636,"Good companion to eBay website: Good companion to the eBay website. It's a stripped down version which is expected. Allows for quick listing of items if you are a seller and you can easily use your phone to take pictures of items and add to your listing. Obviously works well if you use it as a buying platform. If you have an eBay store, it does not allow you to access certain features such as managing your store or vacation settings but again it's a simple version of the actual website. I primarily sell on eBay so ONE HUGE ISSUE WITH THE MOBILE VERSION IF YOU ARE A BUYER...the “ITEM DESCRIPTION” NEEDS TO BE “CLICKED” TO VIEW AND IS OFTEN MISSED BY BUYERS....RESULTING IN QUESTIONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IF THEY (the buyer) READ THE ITEM DESCRIPTION.

Should be able to have more eBay employees from home helping us email, messenger, texting etc. that would be a way that this could and would improve our experience. Other than that I’m happy but I was frustrated when I felt alone and I couldn’t ask questions about issues and topics relating to cancellations, refunding and the unique variables that went into my situation. That’s when we need a person. I understand covid19. But where there a will there’s a way. U know that.",5
638,Really easy and quick Refund!: I ordered some Polaroid film that was supposed to take more than a month to get to me. I waited so long and on the day it was supposed to come the delivery date had changed to three days later. So I decided to wait three more days but it still never came. I was frustrated that I had waited so long for a product that never showed and I went to eBay and followed the steps for when delivery doesn’t occur. In the email eBay sent it said it may take a week for them to get everything in order and reply but within a half hour they found the problem and gave me a full refund. I’m so relieved and happy it was so easy and quick! Thank you eBay!!!,5
639,"Bad Disappointment: On the surface this app looks just fine and is fairly easy to navigate. Using it for a longer amount of  time,  however, makes for a poor and often frustrating experience compared to the browser version of ebay. The biggest problem is that it is extremely laggy and will freeze at unpredictable moments. Even if my network connection is perfect it will still often act super slow. The worst part was when I tried bidding on an item that was close to ending. It took more than a minute to process my bid and by the time it actually did so it was too late to buy the item. It also omits details that are present on the ebay site, such as the people watching your listings and info about the sellers you are buying from. Besides for occasional quick browsing, just ignore this app and stick to the regular site.",2
640,"Super easy to use!: I’ve been using eBay since 1998, mostly to make purchases, however I started using the app about 10 years ago and began selling through the app about 4 years ago as well. Let me tell you, they have definitely streamlined the online selling process! It’s insanely easy to sell stuff through the app, takes maybe 5 minutes to make a listing, shipping is offered at a discounted rate, and the selling & promotion fees are VERY reasonable compared to some of the other selling apps that I’ve tried. If you haven’t used eBay to sell anything yet, I implore you to give it a try because you will not be disappointed!",5
641,"REMOVE “JUST FOR YOU”: I use this app almost everyday primarily as a seller. As most sellers, I am eager to see notifications which indicate I’ve either sold or received a bid on an item, or an important buyer message has been received. In the last few updates, eBay has this recommended “just for you” annoying marketing message that pops up in the app and cannot be disabled. No matter what you do, there is no option to disable these marketing messages. You can delete them,  but cannot remove their notification from coming through. About once or twice a week, I receive these very annoying notifications thinking it is something involving my sales or buyers, but nope it’s just an annoyance from eBay.

eBay makes ENOUGH profit off our 10% we give them from EVERY sale, so it would be nice if we could remove their intrusive marketing messages, but they still find their way through unfortunately.",1
642,"Needs work: I’ve been using the eBay app for the last three years & the latest update is deficient. It doesn’t auto-reload & frequently freezes. Whenever I go to the seller page nothing is listed even though I have current listings & sold items. 

Ended items remain on my active list long after they have ended & the information is out of date. Overall, previous versions functioned better. 

One improvement sorely needed is the ability to create multiple watch lists & add custom labels to each. For example, I would have a list called ‘Want to bid’ & another of ‘Research’ or simply ‘Watch’. This would make is so much easier as my watch list is so large with only a few items I actually plan to bid or purchase.",4
643,"Great: Ebay is good but whatever you do do not get involved with SocialGood it’s nothing but a scam.

I was promised a dollar for dollar in SocialGood tokens yet I was lucky to get 7000 out of 200 K now that’s 7000 is worth less than 3000 because I’m no longer a member because SocialGood screwed up again by telling me, I need to buy $200 in tokens which I had already bought more than once, so it’s just a scam and eBay is involved with it. It’s just shame that Ebay allows combat veterans to get ripped off by a company they sponsor. Do not trust SocialGood and their lies. It should be called social scam.",5
644,"Mostly good: No serious issues with the app; it’s a mostly streamlined experience from the website mobile UI, but with a little extra functionality.

By only real complaint is more of an eBay specific complaint, so it applies to website (desktop/mobile) and app experience. I really like that eBay wants buyers to choose a payment method prior to submitting offers on auctions, hopefully helping sellers from having to chase down buyers/bidders. My only request would be that they allow you to choose a method other than credit/debit card or PayPal; it’s 2023 and contactless payment has been around for almost 10 years, let’s get support for electronic wallets and Google Pay/ApplePay going.",4

646,Worst customer service and no regard for there users: One of the worst experiences I have ever had allowed to sell items and charged me for said items but when it was time to pay me it would not allow my account so I was charged all these fees and have customers that are irate with me because I have to cancel orders because I don’t have the funds to ship because the little money I did have was taken from me. There customer service reps were rude and curt and would literally just repeat the same script over and over that basically stated there was nothing they could do. But as soon as I asked to speak to a supervisor they tried to help then I’m the end just told me there was nothing else they could do for me and hung up! This is an absolute disrespect and they should be ashamed of the way they treat they’re so called loyal customers but they do not absolutely the worst experience,1
647,"Best place to get bottom line discount from your couch!: During these times of social distancing, I most miss hanging out at the cosmetics counters in our major store to learn and TRY ON the newest products. But I feel this is way, way down the toad, especially here in California. Do I’ve turned to EBay, learned to trust their Sellers return policies and comparative shop on other sites and sellers before I make a decision. You know what, Ebay and their ultra competitive prices wins every time in both product, price and genuine efficacy! It’s a win, win buyers market. You’re safe at home, the prices and vast selection is on point and delivery is prompt and timely. I am a customer for life.",5
648,"Policy for leaving feedback: I bought something for a gift and went to leave a review after I gave the gift. Which was a couple of months after I bought the item. I couldn’t test it until giving the gift. So it was junk and I went to leave feedback, which I should be able to do at ANY juncture after purchasing a piece of crap. But eBay wouldn’t let me. Apparently their policy for leaving feedback has changed. Which means I will no longer be purchasing from eBay now. I buy Christmas and birthday gifts all year long so I can afford them. If I can’t buy them and leave feedback when they’re used and tested, then purchasing from eBay is over. They also had Dont away with their customer service number so I now have no way to contact them with certain issues. As they are preselected options in the “help” section. So 12 yes of eBaying, over.",1
649,"LETTING GO!: I really don’t consider myself a hoarder. However, my family would probably disagree. The 70s were great times for identifying yourself through ur fashion choices. Over 45 years later I found myself with practically everything I wore in the 70s, 80s, 90s, & beyond. Honestly, I should say I had saved most of my things & had accumulated a percentage of everyone else’s as well! Through EBay I have been able to LET GO of things that I truly treasured. In fact the RUSH I get when others purchase my items is indescribable! I have been a seller on EBAY for many, many years & it will take me that many more to LET GO of the rest of my KEEPSAKES! EBAY IS THE WAY TO TRULY LET GO!!!",5
650,"Fees: eBay has gone massively downhill since their recent split from PayPal. Their fees appear significantly higher, transactions are harder to monitor... the list goes on. They claim the split was to “make things better for sellers.” Based on what I am seeing from others, that is absolutely not the case, it seems it was more about letting eBay handle transactions (and charge all their own fees) rather than PayPal. Honestly the selling fees are getting to the point I am looking for an eBay alternative. For example, I sold an item for $925, after fees and all that, my “payout” was a hair over $700... are you kidding me? Over $200? Clearly the PayPal era is over, but I very much hope they rectify this situation. A company with the traffic of eBay does not need to gouge their sellers to make a steep profit. This new system is significantly greedier than before and I question its usefulness to the non commercial/ bulk sellers in the near future.",1
651,"How to make eBay a better online shopping app.: The I’m saying is because a year I actually bought one item back and it turns out not the way we expected (yes my mom was included). We literally didn’t if the item was to the picture or fake so I thought (just my idea you don’t have to take it), but if people were buying a product they like, but are not actually sure if it’s legit or would look at the video below the item review and it would show 
If the is what the says in the picture (literally all the items I look through for cheap items some turn out to look exactly but different price for some reason 🤨). This is just my idea of imagination there’s nothing actually wrong with this app it’s a great app really.",4

I believe I had an advanced version of selling and now I have some childish version that doesn’t let me pick start times by the minute only every 15min and when downloading pics it changes the orientation and order. Also over simplifies everything as if a child is using it, filling in prices automatically and giving my step by step instructions I don’t need. Tried to reed reviews on this but app conveniently doesn’t list reviews in order of date so who knows what people are thinking. Talked to eBay customer service, said it would take 10-14 days to get back to me, REALLY!!! WHAT THE $&@?!%#£¥€",5
653,"Convenient: I love the simplicity of the whole experience, connection to PayPal, etc. With that- let me contradict myself by suggesting;
1.) ""saved-item"" folder(s) so that I can save items for later but won't necessarily have to look through all 200+ ""watched"" items. 
2.) a ""compare"" section under the ""EDIT"" area so that once again, I don't have to keep scrolling back and forth through 200+ items in my ""watched"" list. Thanks for considering my suggestions, or at least reading this before deleting. 😂
3.) hitting the back button after viewing an item in your cart SHOULD go back to your cart items, NOT to the home page. Very frustrating!

654,"I love eBay Service!: Im this days were is all about technology, it is quite refreshing to call eBay 1-800!! 
I was afraid the first time I was in need to get in touch with them, as it was late into the night, or better day, early morning (about 1:00 a.m.    I got their automatic system, but after the first easy screen step, (which I think it was a question as if I was a buyer or a seller, I was asked the reason of my call?) but right after, I was able to get with a real human being, with a great attitude!!  All I can say, it is; WAY YO GO eBay!!   & thank you for making the processed as easy as it was and do not made me waste my time with tons of prompts!!  I LOVE IT, and is a big reason I’m still using your Platform!",5
655,"Reviews: I enjoy the app.  The one thing I wish I could have is a button the shows me things like it.  Some times someone buys it before you.  In it can take a lot of time I don't have sometimes to find another one. 
Second, I would look to see a system where like google you can put a picture in and it will search for items like it. Will speed things up and people will buy more making eBay more money too. I have a lot of other ideas but we'll start with this first.
Thanks for years of finding my great deal and in hard to find things. Hope whoever reads this that your having a great day or at least enjoy your weekend when it come.

656,"Great for Buying but Not Seller Friendly at Times: I’ve primarily used eBay as a buyer and have nothing but pleasant experiences on that end. Sellers are friendly and I’ve never had a single issue with any of my orders. However as a seller, fees have hurt my earnings. I’ve lost money on multiple sales due to the selling fees that are charged to me. Almost all of my buyers have been great to deal with, and I’ve never run into an issue with any of my sold items. However as a small seller I have to be weary of my feedback score. One bad feedback can tank your score and hurt your future sales for a while. eBay isn’t seller friendly when situations arise either. I have better buying experiences than I do with selling",4
657,"Tires: The first time I ordered tires from eBay I had them sent to their affiliate Firestone. Setup an appointment and I went there. When I got there the gentleman went to the back and said my tires never got deliver, so I was like man there’s no way! Could you please check again! Ok, the second time he found them he said “sorry someone moved them to a place where they shouldn’t be”. Got them installed okay no problem. 
Second time I ordered tires again to the same place. Went there again, same thing again! They are not there again! Guy goes and checks nothing. Says they aren’t there again. eBay said I am not getting a refund, because the tires were delivered according to the fedex documents. I’m out $450, be weary of this! I am still fighting! It seems like a losing battle. But once I get to the point where I think it is absolutely over I am deleting the app, like you should!",1
658,"Annoying bug: There is an annoying long-time bug that prevents the app from being useful when selling items. 

If an item is listed as “Best offer” with an “auto-accept” amount, that setting is hidden in the mobile app when trying to edit/revise a listing; it’s only visible in the desktop browser app. So you can start editing in the mobile app, make all of the changes, and then they won’t e saved because of an error with the “auto-accept” amount, which you can’t fix because it’s not available within the mobile app. 

Such an obvious bug that’s been there for a long time, it’s very surprising that a large company like eBay can’t fix this simple bug.",4
659,"Balance: I have been using eBay since 2005 both as buyer and seller and I can say that is the easiest way to sell and you can also find really good deals and auctions in your favorite items, but lately the seller fees have gotten ridiculous as well as the costumer service they seem to help the buyer no matter what and the seller as well and sometimes it could very unfair I don’t like the ad boosting method they implemented but I guess they gotta find more ways to make more money since they don’t have enough with seller fees they have cancelled my account several times for no reason literally for no reason while I had auctions going on and they were cancelled so I have lost money because of their fault. And now of course is very hard to get a hold of them",3

Further, when you make a purchase and pay for it immediately and the seller figures out he could have gotten more money and refuses to ship your item, there is no penalty for the seller.  This happened on an item I have been looking for for 25 years!  He kept making excuses then finally said he was not shipping the item and the threatened to FILE A  COMPLAINT ON ME ! He was totally dishonest and should have been thrown off of eBay!,   I did get my money back but he was able to go his merry way !  Further— DOANY HUMANS WORK AT EBAY ???

662,"Need to eliminate bud sniping: I love this app and would have gotten a 5 star rating if I hadn’t lost two items this week where I was the only one bidding on the item and watching the item for two days and then lose it with two seconds to go to, someone who sniped me. There needs to be something where if you do get sniped you have a chance to match the bid or something. Someone that just puts a lot of time and effort into watching something and bidding on something and then lose it to someone who just watches for things ending soon. That’s not fair. And something needs to be done to address it. That’s unbelievably frustrating to where you just want to not get back on the app for days at a time",4
663,"Problems, slow, user unfriendly: So disappointing as I typically love eBay. The new ipad app is slow, freezes up frequently and listings are much harder to see. You cannot sort, view multiples or scroll as easily as before.  Viewing saved searches is inconvenient and limits the number you can see at once. Please let us back into the old app, even if it's just to search and view listings.  The best thing I can say about it is I'm finding it so much less enjoyable that I'm spending less and less time shopping and thereby not purchasing as much and will ultimately save money. So for that, thank you, eBay. I'll miss the sellers and community, but it's no longer a pleasant experience.",5
664,"Feedback Option Gone: For some odd reason I no longer see the option to leave feedback for purchases in this app now. I searched the eBay site for a similar issue and they recommended signing out of your account, deleting the app and then re-installing it and signing in again. Well, I did all of that and my two most recent purchases still do not have any apparent options for me to leave feedback for those purchases.

I'm very confused about this problem. I'm running the most up to date version of this application, on an iPhone 8 Plus using iOS Build 14.6, also the most recent iOS version.

I'm pretty darn sure as well that i haven't previously left feedback for those two purchases, because in the listing for each one it still says ""Leave feedback"" at the bottom of the thumbnail. Yet, I click each one and there is nowhere listed on the next page to leave my feedback for the purchase. This is very frustrating to me as I want to do the right thing and give positive feedback to my last two purchases.

So, I wanted to ask the eBay programmers to please look into this apparent bug in the eBay application and please fix it soon with an update. Thank you if you'd so and God bless.",2

667,"Two important things that are broken in this version of the App: Update:
After reading another users review I logged out of the app and logged back in and now I have advanced listing capability on the app (yeah!). I’m raising my review from one to three stars now. I just wish the two different times I called tech support that they would have known this. 

Original review:

As a seller there are two things that have been removed from this version of the app that are very important;

1. You cannot set a return policy to allow for 30 days. This may not seem very important, but to be considered a “top rated” seller and receive the promised 10% off of your eBay fees, you need to offer 30 day returns. The only way to set it to 30 days is to go to a computer and go into advanced listing and change it there. That takes time and time is money. 

2. You used to be able to describe your items in the condition “used or new” section. Can’t do that on the phone app either. That’s a disadvantage to the buyer, which in turn hurts the seller.",5

By and large eBay has been one of the top commercial retail websites to parts for all types of vehicles.  

First, there are a vast amount of information to obtain by utilizing their search engines.  I was surprised while exploring the different dimensions that was available to me e.g: I thought I had exhausted my search an stumbled into a vast array of businesses where I immediately found exactly what I was searching for.

Secondly, the website is user friendly.  I was able to obtain valuable feed back which assisted me in determining if my custom ideas would manifest into the project I was actually expecting to achieve therein.

Lastly, all of my searches, all of my requests and all of my written transactions were archived in my eBay account.  

Ebay received high marks for the aforesaid mention palatable computerized system that is now available for your convenience.  

Thanks to EBay’s staff I now have the patience to obtain my goals.

Post Script:  knowledge is power 

Thank You

669,"from on OG: I was one of the first in my circle to partake in buying and selling on eBay … the unique marketplace from all over the world .good customer service. ..the only reason for not giving 5 ⭐️s is the eventual evolution of time it now takes for sellers to receive their funds. ..once upon a time the monies showed up in my PayPal account instantaneously after a buyer winning an auction, or buying it now. It now takes an extra ordinate time before funds show up in my account. (unlike any vendor in any other company) ..it’s annoying, but it still works. ..I imagine it detracts a number of vendors that used to be involved with eBay, and I wonder if the benefits to eBay were worth that cost.

670,"Return policy isn't the best: You can find good stuff on eBay, but some sellers are stubborn on returns; for example: If you bought a new item and you find it’s not up to your expectations, then the seller will want to ask you a bunch of questions not respecting the fact you aren't satisfied with the product. I understand there are bad buyers out there, but come on, the buyer should come first as the seller just as the saying, “The customer is always right”. If I'm not satisfied with an item then they should just accept the return. If the return arrives back damaged then don't issue a refund; simple as that. EBay, please give the seller their sell fees back if a return happens.
Update: now I'm having login issues; both my email and password are correct, but it won't take them for some reason. Maybe it's the app…",2
671,Rewards terrible customers: Ebay has really gone down. I had a customer who ruined my product and essentially stated so in her message to me. She decided to put on a pair of antique shoes and naturally they broke. Not rocket science there. Then the customer was blatantly rude to me about these shoes. At first I thought EBay was going to help me out. Their customer service rep Nick sure made it sound like it. Then their customer rep Alisa didn’t even read my notes but was trying to get me to add a payment method to refund the customer instead of using the funds that they were holding. I explained to her several times that this customer ruined a pair of shoes and now I lost an opportunity to resell them. But sellers aren’t valued anymore. They refunded her the money and I am left with a carcass of antique designer shoes. Ebay basically thanked me for being a customer for 15 years then slapped me in my face.  Very dissatisfied.,1
672,"Read before selling: They don’t even show your listing in the search results unless you pay money. I spent an hour with seller support explaining how I filtered down the search with price, auction and ending soonest & my products aren’t in search. eBay is shadow blocking my listings. They claimed I had to pay more or it won’t show. I’ve paid in the past and it’s a hoax. I barely got 50 views yet I can look in the sold area & there are thousands with the same listing title and at other price than mine…. eBay is ridiculous for new sellers. Not even worth the time to make the listings when they aren’t getting 3 views. Like I said it’s a popular item. I have 70 listings of popular things that people are selling every day. Thousands in the sold history. Probably 100 a day sold. But mine doesn’t even show up in search at all. Waste of time if your a new seller. Don’t even bother…",1
673,"EBAY’S BUYER PROTECTION DOESN’T ALWAYS PROTECT: Customer service is non-existent if you have a real problem with a seller. I received an item that was pretty much trash. They advertise buyer protection. Seller wouldn’t refund my money. The options for excuse for me to open a case aren’t available to choose to initiate a refund request myself. Unless they want me to lie and choose the wrong one. I finally got a real representative on the phone. They told me to give the seller more time after it had already been a month!!! I was given a reference number, so I could call back after 48 hours to get a quick refund if the seller didn’t respond in that time. They didn’t. I tried to call back and the automated system keeps hanging up on me now & won’t let me reach a real person anymore, so the reference number was a joke. Now, seller has my money, I have an item full of holes, and EBAY’S BUYER PROTECTION DIDN’T PROTECT ME!!!!",1
674,"My experience as a seller for 15 years: Sometimes I feel like my listings aren't shown right away or even for days not all the time, I don't know the algorithm demands i end and sell similar frequently or my store selling goes stagnant. Way too many item specifics that often don’t apply to what I'm selling. If you don’t fill the specifics all in with something the blue circle stays unclosed and your item doesn’t show. If i have funds pending for payout and i sell something else, it pushes my payout day to a later date and changes the amount. On the app if i send a customer a coupon it takes away my ability to leave feedback. Ebay is not what it used to be, it used to be easy to sell 20 years ago. Now i have to cross list to other platforms to move things. Too much algorithmic things going on.",2

So as I was waiting for payment this person messages me and ask me to send more pictures of the perfume to there email I was like ummmm seriously you can only send so many pictures of a perfume bottle and why would you want more pictures if you already purchased it?? A red flag immediately went up ! I contacted support and they were like well just wait and see if they pay you or not and I was like seriously you are not comprehending we’re I’m coming from I also have heard that scammers are using your email now to hack you so guys please be careful on here!!!!,4
676,eBay overview: I’ve been using eBay more and more this year and enjoy the product that I’ve purchased. I like the increased variety that’s available and the prices are competitive. The only complaint I have is after purchase service. I purchased a couple of items recently that I didn’t receive. I followed the instructions for recovery and got a refund on one but nothing on the other item which according to the product was marked delivered but i didn’t receive it. I’ve done my part in reporting and even checked with USPS. They marked it received. The item was Tylenol and I’m disappointed that it’s not been properly completed.,5
677,"Update broken, changed whole flow!: IF IT AINT’T BROKE..........LETS FIX IT ANYWAYS! 

New update broke the app ok iPad and has changed everything that was good with the entire experience.  The My eBay section is no longer split into two sections where you can view multiple pages at the same time. It was previously split screen so that you could continue to view your items while switching tabs as well. ....... Now with the new update you can only view one page at a time and this requires you to make multiple clicks to get to the same section. It’s just more work. Everything is super slow and laggy while trying to switch and is painful to use. Pages and icons are smaller now and harder to click on or interact with.  Everything is buried deeper and deeper in a menu rather than being actually accessible.

It is not a shortcut ; actually it is very annoying to have this button at the bottom that blocks the titles of the new items ... It is a bad design ... “ Sort / filter “ section should be left alone at the top ; please remove this floating button on the page ... It blocks the view when you scroll down ... At least have an option to have a see through button or cancel it completely... Some things should be left alone ...,5

When I go to my list of things that I want to purchase and click on an item the prices change, this is bogus!

If y’all are going to keep changing prices other than what I see in my list y’all are going to lose a good customer. Again I see what EBay is doing, if you have two of the same items in your list and one of the items is a lesser priced item y’all take that item off of the list and list it as a closed item but keep the more expensive item listed. Shame on you EBay!",4

  I’m sorry but that’s absolutely ridiculous. Almost 1/8 of the sale price went to eBay. There are better ways to sell stuff and I for one will go elsewhere. 
  Yes the app is nice, easy to navigate, and has countless items on it. But that’s a heck of a cut for being a glorified auction site.",5

It’s not at all what it started out to be…… now it’s just people selling stuff…… the stuff they sell is overpriced. You can hardly find a good auction. And let’s not even start on all the regulations if you want to sell or auction something on the site. In no way would I ever hook my bank account to this site. I still buy from here, but won’t sell or auction anything here anymore. Guess all good things must come to an end……..",5

Ebay then charged me & put me in a position to not be able to make it home to be able to make the money due to not having gas money. I then opened another appeal in order to get some sort of temporary compensation to get home & they also denied that. Come to find out that 2 days after I clearly states to them I was negative in my bank account, they charge me 14 more dollars & when I call support to ask what the reason was for the extra charge, he says it was some sort of fee & hangs up instantly as I am responding.

So with that in mind I’ll say as my full honest n personal review ... EBAY IS THE BEST WHEN YOUR KIDS NEED THAT TOY OR PRO SCOOTER OR WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED AS GOES FOR US ( parents) .....😀.

684,"Better than the website, still bad: I don’t understand how a company this large can have such a terrible UI and navigation . Trying to find something other than making a purchase is like navigating a labyrinth. And i’m a software engineer ! I write apps like these. And yet I routinely find myself in buggy workflows or experiencing workflow crashes and bugs.

Sometimes it an obvious technical failure (like a crash) and sometimes it’s just terrible business requirements (like the seller balance and fees workflow). The “improvements” they’ve made to the seller workflow currently made it worse. It’s such a mess.

It’s better than the website, but that’s a low bar. Doing anything other than making a purchase is such a frustrating experience - it’s a confusing, sloppy bare minimum with no real support or help desk.",2
685,Please read this review: I recently just started selling some items off Ebay. First of all don’t believe that your listing your items for free. Second Ebay and Paypal have a terrible system. I sold a PC to a buyer. Buyer wants to return a item. So I accepted the return and refunded his money via Paypal on the 09/27. However Ebay refunded the buyer again on 09/30?!?!? Without my authorization?!?!?! Are you kidding me? So i called Ebay. The Ebay representative from the Philippines. Told me to call Paypal and verify. The Paypal representative from the Philippines also told me to call Ebay. First of all Ebay rep told me to settle the refund via paypal? Now ebay taking over and charging me again? First of all don’t tell your seller to refund them via Paypal. This customer service is unacceptable? Why am i getting charged twice to refund a buyer? Why there is no “SELLER” protection? Once this is all over I'm going to delete my Ebay and Paypal account! This practices are unacceptable!,1
686,"You’ve messed up this up with last updates!!!: I use eBay to buy, sell and list, which is very convenient, but now a few annoying things:

WhenI scroll through my listings it has to load more if at all, when before it was scrolling normally. 

After revising a listing and going back to all my listings, it goes straight back to the top, when before it took me back to around the listing i revised

Quit telling me to lower a price, before I know it, its going to be $1 for a 1 carat diamond ring!

No such thing as no return, seller do abuse this even if you tell what’s wrong with item, a lot of sellers don’t pay,, but do they get penalized probably not

My biggest thing is when i make a listing and check that i Do Not want best offers, well guess what, after it lists i check my listing and there the best offer option 

Just stop trying to fix what isn’t broke, cause you’ll mess it up, no one cares about the newest look of a website just make it functional and simple! And sellers shouldn’t be punished if someone buys something while you’re in vacation mode and I can’t ship it within 5 seconds of the purchase. The buyer sees the date I’ll be back!

Read everyone else's reviews they tell other junk the developers have screwed with",2
687,"4.5 really: Great place to save money on preowned or hard to find items that generally are bigger ticket . Love that if u don’t like the price you can bid lower, can’t hurt. Most sellers are very pleasant to work with and reasonable. No minimum for free shipping on select items . Can go pickin and find stuff you haven’t seen elsewhere kinda like a yard sale. My only suggestion to improve eBay would be to focus more on the reviews for the actual item vs the seller reviews when looking for something specific . I tend to have to google an item separately to find reviews of items vs an all in one experience there . Otherwise one of my favorites",5
688,"Perfect, but turn off live notifications!: I use this app regularly. I never had any issues with this app, buying, selling, or just browsing for fun. However, the notifications about when a seller goes live need to be turned off. There are no options anywhere to turn off live sales. I get them multiple times a day and I buy from the those sellers once in a long time but to get bombarded every day with these notifications is annoying. Only options are to turn off ALL notifications or unfollow those sellers if I still want to receive other important notifications, like when an auction is ending. Will rate 5 stars when that gets fixed.",4
689,No Guarantee: eBay does not support you when there’s an issue with purchase. The app does not give you many options if you have an issue with a seller. Purchase item. Been 5 days and seller still hasn’t shipped my item. I tried to cancel my order and the app told me unable to cancel. I tried to leave a negative feedback but eBay gives you an option to contact seller. I wrote seller before my purchase and got no reply. I write a second time still no reply. I write again asking to cancel my order and no reply. I tried to cancel on my end but the app still said unable to cancel my order. I’m stuck - no other option at this time. This incident really pushed me away from using eBay. The app has no option to edit a review either. eBay’s interface was better back in the days.,2
690,"Help with  defective items from sellers: It seems the assistance received from e bay on items purchased from sellers that are defective when the sellers are  not willing to replace or refund the items is at Best  token  intervention!   
I purchased an item that was defective from a seller that was out of the country and after supplying the requested info to the seller substantiate the defect,  the seller promised to replace the item but strung me along for months and did not honor their promise.  After contacting e bay who promised to contact the seller and get back to me regardin the purchase, I never heard back from them or the seller.    
After a second attempt at contacting e bay  I was told that because it was past the time limit for resolution on prob;em purchases ther was nothing that could be done!  
The seller I’m sure knew that if they drug out my request with false  promises (which they did for 6 MONTHS) it would end the matter and they would not get negative feedback.  

Since e bay says they are concerned that non reputable dealers are something they  try to  prevent it seems they would be more involved in helping with issues like this from out of the country sellers!",3
691,"GREAT APP! Easiest one to sell anything from!: This is one of the only apps I feel you can do everything you can do on the computer version on their mobile/app version! Only problem was you weren’t able to print a shipping label from the app but they just changed it so now you can! 5/5 stars and with the notifications turned on you don’t miss any sales or offers..I use it daily! And also love how it is not limited to selling just clothes or anything, if it can ship it can sell basically, making me a lot of extra money when I need it (also with it being one of the lowest % taken from the sale)!",5
692,"Not MY Bank Account #: I have been an eBay user with a 100% rating for many years and now you are forcing me to use YOUR handling of payments by providing my bank account  number?!!!! I do NOT wish to divulge to the world this personal financial infornation. Not that I am dedicated or loyal to PayPal in any way, but I should be able to determine how payment can be made in buying and selling. Are you REALLY going to close my account and prevent me from using eBay in the future? Not ethical in my opinion. You probably won't publish this statement, but  I would hope you would reply to me directly with  answers  and the means to continue my use of eBay without giving up my bank number.

693,"Hillboy scooter: I can't understand and how dangerous it was to have bought this scooter when from one moment to another it has broken in such a way that if it had broken on the road he would possibly be dead or hospitalized today.  I wonder.  Who is responsible for this?.  that guarantees me that once requested it will not break again.  I only used it between August and October of last year and to come winter and spring, it was stored in my garage for 6 months.  I started using it three weeks ago and now I have this problem.  So for having less than a year of use, I request the return of the money or the exchange for a new one, according to the commercial legislation of the United States in which.  for having less than a year I can reach this agreement with you.  I look forward to a prompt response.",2
694,"Helpful for Managing Multiple Bids and Sold Items: If there are many items you want to keep track of at once, and you want to monitor how the selling prices for those items change over time, then having the ability to save listings and keep the records after the bidding ends is quite useful. It should be noted that these listings do eventually disappear after a few months, so you should save the records externally while you can. Then you will be able to create a more detailed record of how the asking and selling prices for various items changes over time and determine how you will want to bid and sell on these items accordingly.",5
695,"Why eBay is Amazing: eBay is worth more then 5 stars the simple app and website that has millions worldwide on shopping and selling. Selling is simple and for your small business you can never fail with waved and small fees. As a buyer or collector looking for certain items you can always find it here. Whether is be in used preowned condition or new in the box the options are limitless. The government ruined our eBay fun going to court and added taxes on everything we are still fighting them today over it. Hopefully we will win but it doesn’t matter the eBay experience is still there and the items are limitless. Thank you eBay for years of buying, selling, and fun.",5
696,"Won’t accept my credit card although it has funds: I’m 1000% sure I inserted my information correctly. I’ve double and even triple checked.  It’s correct. Yet it keeps saying it’s not. I didn’t have this problem last time I made a purchased here. I love the app don’t get me wrong.  But it’s this one thing that I’m having trouble with.  I read online I need a Paypal account but I’m not 18 yet to open an account. I’m almost but not yet.  I’m just trying to buy some shoes for myself dawg before my 18 bday which is coming. But I can’t 😕. Like at this point I’m willing to pay a small fee for not having a paypal account.  I’m. Not sure if you guys would even read my review but if you guys do, take this into consideration.  I just want my shoes!!!",4
697,"If it ain’t broke don’t try to fix it!: The “track package” button that is on each purchased item is useless. When you tap track package it takes you to the main item page but doesn’t open the tracking. I preferred the last version where it simply displayed the tracking history without tapping a track button. But... if you have a track button, make it work correctly. 

Overall I like this app. I will always advise you to keep things simple. Don’t change things that aren’t broken.  I've been an eBay user for 17 years and it is my main source for purchases and selling gear.",5
698,Limited: When looking at an item I'd like to see the seller and their feedback rating along with the item for sale; all at the same time.  I try my best to hold 100% and when someone is shopping for an item I'd like them to see that and when I'm shopping I have to go the extra step to see the sellers feedback rating (and shouldn't have to) - I don't buy from someone with a bad rating and pay a little extra to the ones that have the highest rating on an item I'm shopping for.  When I sell an item I can't send a buyer an invoice with the app and have to wait till I'm in front of my computer to send an invoice.  There many disadvantages with the app alone.,5
699,"Too controlling not great for sellers anymore: I loved ebay. And loved when I could make money. But now, so many taxes are charged as well as when you do transactions through PayPal, which don't they own? Anyway. Since when did ebay take it upon themselves to change your selling options. I like a fixed price and then I randomly get offers and see that ebay arbitrarily takes it upon themselves to change MY LISTINGS to accepts offers. If I wanted that I would set that myself. NOT cool ebay. NOT COOL!  How can anyone expect to make any money on here anymore?!?! Fix this stuff or you'll be losing a lot of sellers with all these unfair options you just do without even considering the seller. Or ASK if I would even LIKE to change that before you just go and do it. I'm sorry I still like being in charge of my own items and how much I set my pricing for them.",2
700,"Communication 101: Love eBay. But once in awhile a seller leaves important information out. They give two dimensions of a three dimensional object. If they submit 8 photos of an item, and six are from the same angle, and nearly all are in poor lighting, or too far away from the object.

My English teacher always stressed the dynamics of writing: address the five basics, which include, who, what, when, why, where.

Always keep in mind that the seller is much more familiar with the item to be sold, and should convey the message clearly, along with detailed photos. The transaction will proceed much easier, with fewer returns and poor reviews. Then everybody wins!",5
701,"Logging me off constantly and keeps changing my drafts…: eBay app has been terrible recently with the latest updates and such. Idk what is going on in that department but it needs to be fixed. I’m constantly logged out, it will not let me stay logged in like it used too. And yes I have tried every solution that has been said to remedy this problem and it did not help. Also recently my drafts that have been saved for later are having issues with the prices mysteriously disappearing or having been defaulted to whatever the lowest last sold was. Which is extremely frustrating because if you don’t check your listing and you have it go live it may sell for a super low price. Please fix these issues as they are making the app experience VERY frustrating and annoying as I draft items so that’ll it’ll save me time.",1
702,eBay: I made several attempts to buy a countertop ice maker and for some reason ebay cancelled the bid. After finally winning one the seller showed it delivered to my house and it definitely was not shipped here. I live in an area where no one can access my property without being seen and no fedex EVER shipped here. After some confusion on getting a response from the seller I contacted ebay and they explained I should have selected another option. I was assured they would forward the issue but no one has ever called back. They have it set up where I can’t file any issues so I guess I just donated 70 bucks to a multimillion dollar company,5
703,"Unfair to sellers: I have been selling shoes on eBay for quite some time, with eBay fees and promotion you end up having to pay 20% of your sale to eBay. All my shoes passed authenticity guarantee and one buyer reached out and said they didn’t receive their shoe. Tracking proved that they received it, but eBay wouldn’t even give me a message back, it was just an automated message responding to me. Got no help from eBay support. They took the word of the buyer but decided not to even look at tracking which shows that it was delivered to the buyers address. I got banned for this even though I did nothing wrong. Pathetic, completely dissatisfied. Lost more money than I potentially would have even earned from the sale. The shoe was listed for $60, eBay fees took $30 and I was only going to receive $30 but they made me refund the whole $60, taking it from my bank account",1
704,"Serious Upgrade Needed!: Come on, guy! In this day and age, you still have such an outdated app. First off, when you defined business requirements for the interface, did you really consider user-friendly end user experience? Most likely Not. Nothing is intuitive, you need to be super techie to understand how to insert info and how pages are structured. Forget about using “Revise Item”. This is like a rocket science. Some validations do Not make any sense. I had to remove “decline below this price” option because it was not able to revise item with Buy It Now price of $180 and decline offer below price $160. It did not let me set it up that way and I had to opt out of Best Offer feature. It’s a mess. Ancient approach in app development. I’m sure you lose lots of business because of that. So, don’t be stingy and invest into a good app and you will quadruple your sales. Hopefully me too. Cheers.",1
705,Overall: Overall I think he bass a very good place to go shop for items that you can’t not normally find in the store however it does get a little confusing when you are trying to find a specific thing and you cannot get the description to be smaller in size that becomes a problem when you’re looking for parts or anything else other than that in the over influx of a lot of foreign parts or products gets a little to me annoying but it is what it is fair trade fair market overall though I like eBay I do enough shopping mostly for myself. Again eBay is a great place to shop.,5
706,"Horrible place to buy things.: You have to worry about selling AND buying on eBay nowadays. They literally stripped ALL SELLER PROTECTION for sellers. And if you want to buy something, good luck trying to use PayPal. They constantly make you sign in on PayPal, making you vulnerable to scammers while out in about. eBay has fallen off tremendously. I’m a member of close to 15 years. This has been the worst eBay has ever been. Be careful! Getting scammed isn’t a question of if, but when. You will get scammed eventually. I know 5 people who buy and sell on eBay, and all 5 people stated they’ve been scammed at some point. Really sad that eBay has things become this way.",5
707,"Really easy to navigate!: I find super easy to use! It couldn’t be easier to find an item, look at its pics and details, and shipping information as well as seller’s details. Likewise it couldn’t be easier to list an item as a seller. It’s like almost every possible scenario they have thought of. It just feeds you steps to the next option for help if need it. I am coming off an accidental buy and cancellation request and it couldn’t have been easier to file a request to do so!! I am really pleased with all the improvements they have made dating from years going back!! I definitely love this newer version of eBay now and am enjoying using it!!!",5
708,"Best thing that I have ever decided to do!: First of all the eBay app is AMAZING! It is so easy to navigate and easy to get assistance if you have a hard time navigating or run into any issues. When you reach out for help you do NOT have to wait forever, the wait time is listed and you can call them or they will call you! It’s soooo nice! eBay has done wonders for me and my family. It has allowed me to stay at home with my son and now we are able to consider increasing the size of our family due to me selling on eBay! It’s so easy to sell and it’s a pretty fun job, honestly. I work my own hours, in my own house in my own jammies! Thanks eBay!",5
709,"eBay: eBay app is almost too notch. Easy controls, clean layout, and mostly fluid experience with the exception of return items address. In the app one can not change the return address for items sold. To do that, one has to be on the desktop. I had a situation where someone bought an item, didn’t like it and wanted a return. eBay sided with buyer and forced my hand. I use the mobile eBay app for buying and selling and I found out the hard way that my eBay app info wasn’t the same as the desktop version. Because there is no way to change your return address in the mobile app. Long story short.... find and fix all issues on the desktop because eBay don’t care about seller issues.",4
710,"eBay review: Over my years of using the eBay service I’ve noticed that eBay has some awesome customer service when dealing with issues. I can also say that this platform definitely helped me boost my small business. Ive been earning my rep with this platform and I hope to soon become an eBay top star member. I Would definitely recommend this platform to anyone starting a small e-commerce business, clothing store, shoe store etc… this platform is great for entrepreneurs that have trouble getting their name out. Also great to anyone that just has some old stuff to get rid of. Give eBay a try , I promise you won’t regret it!!!",5
711,Too Much Anonymity: People are spending big amounts of money through eBay and there's too much fraud happening for all these deals to be going down with such anonymity. eBay needs to include a comment section so we the buyers can't protect ourselves and each other. Buyers should be able to point out what they believe may be scams and fraud accounts. I recently bought two items that each seller did not ship out. Now I have to wait towards of two weeks to get my money back. The customer support is horrible. Therefore we need a way to look out for ourselves. We should also be able to know who we're bidding against. So we can identify sellers who are just inflating the prices. All this blind bidding is not safe.,4
712,"Inaccessible and complicated for sellers who use VoiceOver: While I have bought and sold much using the eBay app, the experience is excessively complicated and somewhat inaccessible as a seller who uses the iOS VoiceOver feature.

First, when selecting photos, I have to take pics of my items using the camera instead of selecting from my photo library. The integration between VoiceOver and the eBay app in this regard is an epic fail.

Second, the listing duration cannot be changed from good until cancelled to 30 days or less. This is highly problematic if I do not have any additional free listings, as I incur listing fees that I wish not to. The only work around is to cancel the listing a few moments before it ends and list it again when free listings are available.

Pricing is also problematic, as listings sometimes enable best offers after I specifically disable offers.

Shipping settings are also a headache. I wish not to sell internationally, yet international is an option, despite me disabling this setting.

As for preferences, buyer restrictions must return.

Finally, the whole selling experience on the iOS app is an excessively complicated nightmare. I hope eBay really does read these reviews and reverts to the simplified format previously available.",2
713,"It's Great at Finding Odd and Well Known Items: I have been a user of eBay for over 10 years now and it never disappoints at finding things that I can't find in my local store or old items that they don't make anymore. Of course because of my ""addiction"" to eBay, I have bought things that I didn't need, but just wanted. Usually the prices are pretty good, but some can be outrageous. So if you don't know the prices you can pay too much for stuff. I bought my son an Xbox 360 three years ago through the app and I have been using it ever since. I only went on the computer before. Now I am looking for some outdoor Christmas decorations that will be less than the stores and what they don't sell anymore.",4

I wonder why maybe because American Express will protect their users from being robbed?? This liberal California pennypinching company has no right to continue staying in business. They manipulate truths about PayPal and eBay not being the same company yet they share  your info amongst each other which is privacy fraud

Unbeknown to me I accidentally sold the movie projector at the sale. Two very nice men were running the sale and I forgot to put it aside to save. SO I was VERY happy to find one on sale on EBay.

2. If multiple purchases are made from the same seller and they do a partial refund, I’m only allowed to leave feedback for one item, not all. If no partial refund is issued, I can leave feedback for each item individually. This is cheating sellers out of valuable buyer feedback. Also, the feedback is not always the same for all items.

Long story short, opened a case for non receipt of the item, I lost the case since they said it shows it was delivered. I tried to contact eBay but they make it virtually impossible to get a hold of someone to talk to for issues like this. The USA appeal office or whatever is closed. They will ofc blame Covid for that but I’ve never felt this upset and disgusted with any other platform. USA buyers and maybe sellers alike be aware! You’re on your own!",1

721,"Pros and Cons of  eBay: PROS: As a buyer I love it! Great deals, no problems. As a seller I love it! Brings in extra income so we can survive. The international shipping program is a jewel! I never would have shipped out of the US, and now I have absolutely NO PROBLEM doing it!! Yay eBay 

CONS: As a buyer I buy way to much stuff, especially when I can’t sleep! They ought to cut me off after say 11:00 at night! As a seller, (and this is my real gripe), their return policy for buyers needs improvement. I appreciate them being on the buyers side IF there was an actual problem. But I’ve been burned a couple of times as a seller, cost me shipping. At least split the shipping if there is a question on the return.
In conclusion, I do love  eBay!",5
722,"New app is just awful!: I’ve been using versions of this app for several years now and the newest one is by far the worst! I loved the version three years back and it was up and taken away last month. Now I can’t even delete items I’m no longer interested in viewing to possibly purchase. I’ve bought over 1,000 items and lately this new app has made me bored with the experience of eBay. Very disappointed! You really need to bring back an earlier version and stop trying to push items that don’t interest me to the front of the screen. I buy plenty of what I want the other way. Now, I hardly purchase anything at all on here.",5
723,"Overall: Overall I’m very satisfied with eBay services. Anytime I have had issues with a sellers, most sellers have been more than willing to make things right... (example: if items damaged in shipping or was never received) I have had an issue where eBay had been involved and the situation was solved and everything was handled in a positive matter. In the beginning I learned fast to read the reviews on a seller so I may know the quality of the product I’m interested... I have not personally sold anything on eBay at this time mainly because I haven’t taken the time to learn how to but am confident that that too will be pleasant experience as it usually is. So thank you eBay, you have helped me locate items that I otherwise would not have had the opportunity to find!",3

Just take us all to bad app land with out having us all have to put newspapers on our floors.  A lot of us get our news from the web now and don't want to subscribe to a print paper..... Check that last point, a lot of us are probably going to go back to the newspaper want adds, given the app garbage you deliver.

I've questioned on this so many times it's ridiculous and I know all kinds of other people that have had the same problem.

OK, but I still really like the app and they make selling easy.

727,"Good for buying but horrible for selling: This app is the worst nightmare if you’re selling. I sold an item and when purchasing the shipping label it would bug right after the payment before the download (or print) option so I had to purchase it 3 times. Then the app printed the wrong label.
Then obviously the item was shipped to the wrong person and I had to refund the buyer. Ebay win’t let me refund him but would charge my card multiple times (I have my credit card completely locked due to many PENDING transactions from Ebay that won’t clear!
I started a chat with the costumer service and they say: whats the order number? I ask: if I go back to look at it, would this interrupt che chat? NO DON’t worry! And the chat interrupted.

Just a very poor app with a very poor service. If you are trying to sell with this app you have been warned!",1

3) miles be seller who decided to ship only 1/2 of what was mentioned on the paid screen & kept the refund. Then blamed me for not reading the description?!?!

So, I’ve been selling on EBay for a while now, I’ve made around $700, sounds great right? Well it would be great if they would actually give me my money, I’ve only been paid $260 some of that money, they have held on to the rest. Seriously EBay? I also sell on Mercari, I get paid literally within just a few days on there, but it’s been about a week on some of the stuff, and not a penny from it has been given to me.

730,"Too Arrogant: When you finally have to reach out to EBay for any issues good luck with reaching a competent employee.  The app simply does not address everything, as few apps can.  You are forced to resort to a telephone call.  Sadly, eBay has not invested any of their ill gotten profits on training employees. A case in point in point is feedback, that unique method inherent in eBay to report a seller to the community.  If you’re unable to leave feedback, particularly on a bad actor, the community as a whole suffers.

eBay employees simply are not prepared for issues that they consider “in stone.”  Learn something eBay, from your customers—if you actually care.",5
731,"Two issues that need to be dealt with: I started a new account about a week ago and listed a few things to sell. I have been FLOODED with offers telling me to “kindly text <phone number> to complete the transaction” or “one question about you item please text <phone number>” in other words asking me to do transactions outside of the platform. I know this is a scam and know better not to fall for it. 

But this hasn’t happen once or twice, I had about 30-40+ offers like this in the first week of my account. In my second week I receive about 3-4 of these scam offers a day. As a new user this is terrifying and makes eBay seem like a very dangerous platform full of scammers. 

This is a major issue and eBay should take action because it would be easy for users to be taken advantage of. I am guessing there have been a lot of issues and lost money and items as a result of these scams.

Secondly, I notice another issue: some of the information isn’t being updated. Like if I take some action in the sellers tab on an offer notification I receive, it will still show the offer as new in other places in the app. 

It seems like the parts of the app don’t talk to each other or there is no single source of truth.",2
732,"eBay is where I go to buy everything: If there is something I want and need, I search eBay, find it then compare it to what I find through an internet search. The price and quality with free shipping usually beats what is available on the internet. Coupling eBay with its guarantee of satisfaction and PayPal’s options for paying and shielding exposure of the buyers’ bank accounts and credit card accounts as well as its own guarantee of satisfaction has created a place that offers convenience, security, a multitude of choices from various sellers and a sense of getting the most bang for the buck. I shop on eBay first and have been doing it for more than twenty-five years.",5
733,"App Freezes All the Time!: This is SO frustrating! I’ve been using eBay as a seller & buyer since 1999. So I’m not new to this. The app on all OS needs work soon. 
1. I’m simply trying to look at products close up or tap on photos of items etc. it freezes. I have to close out what I’m doing & start over. This is going on for a couple years.
2. I can’t stand the search in this app version. I want to see all products & be able to search for the lowest prices but eBay’s algorithm decides what we get to see. It’s never the lowest price or best bargain available on eBay.
3. When forced to go from app to online version, it’s a pain & doesn’t work. Say I’m wanting to see items in a sellers eBay store, when I click on sellers store items, it doesn’t allow me to see items more often than not. 
4. Promoted items always are the items we’re shown not all items especially popular products.",1
734,"Dealing with sellers: The app is very easy to use but comparing items is tricky, you have to know what you are looking at but I bought LED lights from a company on here from China and they sent me the wrong color and when I contacted the company about their product they quickly turned around and used every excuse they could to say I bought the item from another company but I double checked plenty of times and I can confirm they have sent me the wrong product but that’s not what this review is about. I go to ask eBay to step in and there is no way to contact eBay that works you try to contact them and you can only call which is stupid. The buttons to have them interfere with the problem don’t work so I have bought my last item from eBay and I will not be coming back to use an app that lets buyers screw you over.",2
735,"Update Impractical: The most recent updates for this app make it EXTREMELY difficult as a seller!!! First off, the listing format has gotten progressively terrible. Listing has hidden drop menus that are hard to catch. Some listing require a “MPN” but there is no option to even click “does not apply”. The are also times where the shipping option and are capable of being clicked. Second, browsing your own inventory takes forever. Typing the item names into the search bar was easy and would gradually reduce items as you typed. Now, you have to type the entire word out and hit search. Lastly, The pictures take FOREVER to upload. I understand that there was always a delay but now it is extremely slow. 

I am a long-time user of eBay and the application as both the buyer and seller.

This update is displeasing.",2
736,"Please go back to the old version: I love the eBay app and it's been very useful, but I dislike this new version of it. The new layout is very cluttered and harder to read and you have to scroll though everything to click where you need to go. I also don’t like how it automatically relists my auctions with no way to turn it off and also how it automatically allows people to make offers on auctions. That you can manually go in and turn it off, but you have to do it every time you list something and everytime eBay automatically relists the auction. It’s very annoying. I’m not listing things on here for people to send me low ball offers so I lose money trying to rid of things. The garbage can is free. I don’t make money and I don’t lose money with that. 

I really wish they would go back to the old version of the app. it was a lot more user friendly.  just a much cleaner layout",1
737,"Poor business: I sold something on eBay and it was completely wrapped in brand new. The person who purchased it said that it was not what they were looking for so they wanted a refund. Not a problem. EBay had placed the amount I charged in my PayPal, and then once the buyer wanted the refund took it out. The buyer then sent back the merchandise. I went to pick it up at the post office and the post office had sent it back to the buyer. So now not only do I not have my merchandise, I don’t have any money for it either. The buyer got both of those things. When I address this with eBay they said and I quote “once we get the money it’s no longer our problem”. I know it sounds as if this may be the post office problem, but eBay should have never taken back the payment until I received my merchandise back. Because now I am out a total of $1000. So no I would not use this company again.",1
738,"I love eBay but...: I don't understand why every other update changes this one important thing. Being able to open the app from outside sources like an email sent to me, Safari or Chrome. Like why is it that I have to physically open the app when I pressed the link that should've opened the app and taken me directly to the item I wanted to look at or the message that eBay sent me? Every night I receive emails from my list of saved items and when someone posts a new item from that list and I click it, the link opens up in Safari. From there I have to copy the title, open eBay and paste it just to find it. In the past, I didn't have to do all of that. It would be a link asking if I wanted to open this page in the app. That doesn't exist anymore. Now let's work on opening the app directly from another app.",2
739,"Account suspended without telling why: This was my first time ever using eBay. I signed up, found the book I wanted to buy, and placed a bid. The next morning, I woke up to an email telling me my account is permanently suspended. I called support to see why I was banned thinking I could easily resolve the issue, but support told me they were not allowed to say why I was suspended. 

After doing some some research, I found out that placing a bid requires a credit card and some other info on file. Why on earth would any app let me do something that would suspend my account at all, let alone permanently suspend me? The app should have told me I was missing information before ever letting me place a bid. Overall design and esthetic is 3 stars, but due to the magnitude of the consequences of accidentally doing something forbidden, 0 stars. Insanely unfriendly to newcomers.",1
740,"Customer service: I have been working on eBay over 3 years and I have to say eBay have excellent customer service.I used to complain eBay a lot until I open my Etsy shop.. so recently I got a lot of sales from Etsy which is great, but there is no customer service on Etsy at all! I know most platform does not side with seller, but that is fine, when I reach out to Etsy more than 3 time, no body is answering my questions, none of them cares about my concerns.I had 600 sale on Etsy, and I have 2000 sales on eBay, and I have to said even eBay is kind of slow now, but I have much better experience with eBay.",5
741,"$500 gift cards locked for no reason: Got $500 dollars worth of eBay gift cards at a convention where they were handing them out as gifts. They were in different increments ($200, $100, $50). I checked the balance online to determine which was which, as they were not marked. When I go to use them, they don’t work. Turns out, eBay locked the gift cards when i checked the balance and would not let me recover them because I didn’t have receipts of purchase. How could I possibly get a receipt for something that was given to me as a gift… Customer Service did nothing to help. I spoke with 3 different people over 2 weeks and had to explain the situation every time because they couldn’t do something as simple as create a customer complaint file with info regarding my situation.

744,"eBay and PayPal Conflicting Policies: Too many conflicting policies across eBay and PayPal create more risk to Sellers. eBay allows claims/cases to be opened up to 30 days after sale. Buyers can leave feedback up to 60 days after sale. PayPal allows buyers to open claims/cases up to 180 days after sale. Not to mention, sellers have to deal with ebay and PayPal customer support to resolve issues. 180 days is way to long for a seller to have to hold their sale proceeds before they know it can be spent/moved. eBay needs to put in place a better policy to ensure feedback is left by everyone. I only feel like the sale is complete once i receive positive feedback.",5
745,"iPhone 7: I was so happy to get rid of my BB Torch 9800 because this app on the BB was really crappy!  It would always freeze on the 3rd & 4th step & had to start from scratch over & over again.  

I now have the new iphone 7 & I love the app but it's not so user friendly when you have an ebay store.  

I can now at least list my stuff for sale, w/out any problems, but I have to go to my computer to edit the categories & then some each time.  

Although it would be nice when we log in on our mobile devices to have ALL the required fields incorporated w/our ebay user id.  I know it's asking for much, but after all, us sellers are PAYING good $$$$$$ to use eBay!!! 

FYI, the Auctiva app isn't any better either.  I had downloaded it on my phone, but it was REALLY USELESS so I deleted it &  I even notified them & they're aware of the problem/issue & they're working on it.  We shall wait & see.

Finally, bring back the old mobile version because I could at least choose my multiple shipping & category options more user friendly.",5
746,"Horrible app: Another update and nothing fixed!  I love clicking in the app and watching it crash or just hang.  Why give me the option for something that doesn’t work.  Yup, my item hasn’t been received, but your app can’t bother to DO anything when I select that option!  

Why do all auctions count down in real time but don’t update bids in real time?  How did I have an app telling me I had a winning bid when the history says I was outbid hours before?  With all the stupid snipe bidding going on and this garbage app, there is no point in using ebay anymore.  There are better sites and services with less irritation and less fee skipping jerks that put $70 shipping so that they can list for free.  Ebay hasn’t been a good site in over a decade when they sold out to China and I honestly don’t know why I even bothered giving them another chance.  Bad experience and not worth the headache AT ALL.",1
747,"Do not sell on eBay: I downloaded the eBay app to sell a couple things I don’t use anymore. It was pretty simple, you just make an account and list your products for “free”. But it’s a complete joke. Almost every “buyer” was really just trying to scam me. One of the products actually sold but the buyer never paid. When I tried to relist the item eBay counted the scammer as a buyer and said I couldn’t relist the item for another 30 days since I already sold an item in that category even though I didn’t. When I tried to contact eBay I never received a response. And today I got an email from eBay saying I owe 5$. Like are you kidding me. It said I could list my items for free and now they are charging me 5$. eBay might be a good option to buy stuff but if your a seller stay away. You’ll be bombarded by scammers, hidden fees, and a bunch of other stuff you aren’t even expecting.",1
748,"Great App: This app has made using eBay easier than any other way, and I only use the full website on rare occasions now. If they would allow account access from the mobile app I’d never need the website. It’s more compact, take a pic with phone and list instead of transferring images to the pc etc.... I’ve been using the app since I’ve had a smart phone and while it has progressed nicely, it needs a few more tweaks and then it will be perfect.

For instance Account Control, Purchase history - even though now you can see previous orders, it’s still a pain the way they have it set up. 

Otherwise it’s my most frequently used app!",5
749,"Customers/Buyers are sometimes ridiculous: I don’t have a problem with EBay......  it’s the people that want something for nothing, or, buy something used and expect it to be like new.....  This makes my experience on EBay less enjoyable.....  I do, however like how EBay conducts themselves pertaining crazy, unreasonable people.....  The transactions should be between the two people making the deal.....  Unfortunately, sometimes a crazy purchasers will give a crazy review.....  I’m going to continue to place items on EBay, but honestly, sometimes dealing with entitled people is more of a hassle than what’s its worth.....",5
750,"There are some serious bugs for sellers!: If you only buy from eBay with this app, then it works fine. I just started selling, though, and it has been extremely aggravating. While setting up your ad (or revising it), the app crashes constantly, especially while editing photos. After about 10 crashes, I frustrated and just hit “List Item”, but once my ad was finally listed, it wouldn’t turn up in searches and it wasn’t even visible under “Selling” anymore. I eventually gave up and just went on ebay’s actual website to search for my ad. Found it immediately. Revised it how I wanted it in a couple minutes. So much easier than the app! Then, inexplicably, everything started showing normally on the app after I had already gone on the website to do all the work. What the hell!? Fix this!",2
751,In need of a human instead of a bot.: I’ve been scammed and I have tried to get the bot to get me through to talking to a real person that can actually help me but it keeps putting me in a loop of questions.  All I want is to get my money back. Very disappointing that EBay would hide like that . All I want is my money back.  I thought I was buying a good deal for my sons bday he wants a rtx 4080 super. And I saw one list very cheap early in the morning so I bought it  later I realized that the card in the picture is not what is being described in the post . And just the other day I get a message that eBay took it down due to an issue with the sellers  account . Could they not of put a phone number or even an email address that I could communicate with an actual person . This is a serious matter I’ve been robbed on your website .  Please call me EBay,1
752,"Terrible App To Resell: I have my bank account connected to my eBay account to get paid whenever I sell a item I listed on the app, my first bad encounter was when I shipped an item and it never got to the buyer I was charged $500 to my account when the buyer eventually cancelled and I never ended up getting my item I shipped out back. I was told to make a lost parcel claim which I did and been waiting back to hear from for 5 months, today was the last straw when I was charged $200 for a final value fee for another transaction when I called about each issue the customer service representatives were rude and irritated with me. Somehow this final value fee is something they charge whenever they feel like it and now claim it is their policy please don’t sell on eBay they are big scammers and do not care about you please take this warning….",1
753,Fake bidders?: I was selling a Pioneer DJ deck and the person that won the bid never planned on buying it as you can read in messages and he was actively bidding for reasons I don’t know but I do care because it wasted my sale as there were others bidding and there was no way to reverse or cancel the sale once I found out he was wasting my and others time . What can I do about this ? He/She shouldn’t be able to just do this and not be punished with at least a bad review and maybe a probationary punishment. Please lmk asap as I want to repost or offer it to the next highest bidder. I thought you would of gotten involved seeing that they haven’t paid and his message was very unapologetic.,4

I tried using the call option, will get a call back, will pick up, keep saying “hello” for a long while with no response before the person hangs up. Then I’ll receive an email stating they tried contacting me and couldn’t reach me because: The call was not answered. The call reached a voicemail. The call reached a busy signal. The number called was wrong or disconnected. 
Wrong, I’ll pick up and no one will speak. Tried several times. And gave up. 
Please create an efficient customer service email like Am*zon. & we need a customer service email address. Whats up with a huge company such as ebay not having a customer service email address?
And it says nowhere that name can only be changed on desktop and not on app or mobile version.",1
755,"Not a big help: I’ve been using eBay for years many years ,And I’ve never had a problem until a couple of weeks ago. I was supposed to get a package and it was not delivered to me it was delivered to another address. So I tracked it down...And informed Ebay they checked into it and said too bad it was delivered. Well yes it was delivered but not to me to a completely different address. And I tried to tell them that. But they would not listen and there’s no one to call to tell what happened one trys to email, And the email goes nowhere so I guess I’ll just eat the $23 that I made for the purchase but I think long and hard about doing business with Ebay anymore",4

Once I ordered something and it was never shipped and I still had to pay for it. And that was after I filed a claim. They said I was out of luck basically. 
Another time I order some sports cards. About $200 if I remember correctly and again I never received my item and again eBay said I was out of luck. 
So just be very careful with dealing with eBay there representatives that deal with the claims seem like they are out to just make there percentages of the sales and could careless about you. 
I never had any problems with selling anything as I always put insurance on everything I shipped to cover myself.",5
757,"This app has gotten worse !!!: I can't even use the app much of the time. I only use iPad and iPhone and there is room for serious improvement. It gets a glitch where I can't finish a listing (the description hangs up) and have to go to the classic site on the Safari browser on the iPad which is not ideal either. 
Such a pain. And you can't do many of the functions you need to do like search for a member, etc. It's very limited. I really can't stand it. And i thought they had improved it for a while there but NO.
Revised review - still horribly glitchy. Shows “this item did not sell” when it DID sell and you’re at the post office! No address shows up in this glitch. This is so bad. I’ve reduced it to one star. Hate to but this is ridiculous. I depend on it !!

758,"Lame New App Layout and Best Offers: The new app is awful. The layout has changed and it takes longer to post your item. Secondly, eBay and decided to try and dictate how you should sell your item, force feeding sellers the “Best Offer” option, wasting even more time for the seller. They will change your prices to Best Offer, so you have to go back and change each one. While posting, if you don’t do your Best Offer last, it’ll continuously change to that option, say if you change it, go into shipping section, then go back, it’ll be changed to “Best Offer” after you just changed it. Very irritating and time consuming. Wish the old layout was still around. This blows.",4
759,"Summer 2017 update is BAD UI for Sellers: As another reviewer, Mantiseater, noted below, the changes to the UI for sellers are horrible. It now defaults to Good Until Cancelled, as if you're selling an inexhaustible supply of the same widgets, over and over again, not unique antiques. It no longer allows you to give buyers multiple shipping options. It also has a different look and feel to the rest of the app, making the experience inconsistent.   The Description field format has been changed so it warns you that your current information will be erased if you make any updates. It has already crashed twice in the middle of making updates to other fields. It has failed to keep all of the Item Details terms that I had added to the listings. eBay needs to consider their USERS, not their programmers, when it comes to changes to the mobile app UI, or gyfo of the mobile app business.",1
760,"Poor management: I’m writing this to let you know that I think it’s poor management to stop me from listing any new items, or for that matter even changing items I have a listed. I have been with eBay for many years and have only one negative with almost 5000 positives. I am suffering with colon cancer and trying to continue to make things work. Over the last two years I’ve had a rough time, but have continued to try to keep going. There are people on eBay with very few positive feedback‘s and a couple of negatives.

The app constantly has issues wether its creating listings that don’t save what you’ve added or signing you out every time you get back on the app or not showing you view counts and activity on your listings. Not to mention how they throttle your listing unless you pay extra on an already outrageous percentage to have your listing “PROMOTED” Its always something on ebay always.

766,No way to permanently block a seller: I find it very frustrating that there is no way to permanently block seeing a specific seller on eBay. All you can do is use advanced search to block a seller from individual searches. The option to save up to 10 different item searches with that seller blocked is great I guess if you are constantly only searching for the same specific item. However I shop for anything and everything on eBay. Having to do advanced search to type a particular seller(s) in for every single thing I search is a pain in the a**. eBay gives sellers the option to permanently block buyers and I don’t understand why buyers don’t have the same option. Please fix this!!,3
767,"Love the app: I love this app, I really do. I’ve been using it for awhile both as a buyer and a seller. The only two issues I have with this app is that 1.) Ebay gives way too much power to the buyer and the seller usually loses any dispute that gets made. 2.) when you have an auction listed and someone wins your auction, they don’t charge the bidder immediately. You have to wait and nag your buyers to send you the payment for the item they bid on. I believe that when someone bids on the item, they should be required to choose their payment info before they bid so that they can get charged when they win.",5

I just purchased a fake Montblanc, before I even received the fake, eBay is asking me to leave feedback on an item NOT received AND the seller closed his account so I can’t try to get a refund. 6 weeks later, eBay steps in to help with refunding my $$.",5

I run my business from my phone (most of the time) and used to be able to access my customer’s phone number and email address once they placed an order. Not anymore! In fact, I can no longer access my seller hub from my phone. And I seriously don’t like the fact that eBay CAN’T be reached AT ALL anymore if there is a problem with an order or a customer!

In fact I got a notification saying “we’ve sent your payout.” THERE IS ALSO NO REAL OPTION FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! The chat option is constantly unavailable, the “we’ll call you back” option is “experiencing higher volume than usual” and therefore is also always unavailable. If trying to use the “help” articles and choosing the feedback that it wasn’t helpful, that basically goes nowhere. There isn’t even a simple option to email and there’s no 800 number to call. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESOLVE ISSUES??!!! Seriously doubting if I’ll continue to sell on eBay. This is ridiculous.",1
771,"love it… however…: for the most part i can use the app to navigate ebay more easily than prior to the app being developed. however, there are STILL a number of things that you must go to the website to do. i find this frustrating because i’ve been using the app for so long and the two applications are COMPLETELY different!!! making it extremely frustrating to try to remember or figure out how to find what you need. i use ebay on a regular basis and have for 15 years, i believe… and yet i still can’t figure out how to do certain basic things! so frustrating!  i fully believe that the interface, on both the app and especially on the website, could be GREATLY simplified.",4
772,"I love eBay!: I have been both a buyer and a seller for at least 10 years. Just about every experience has been terrific. Last week I bought a pair of New Balance running shoes, no longer available in stores, that would’ve cost close to $200 new for only $40 … just an example …I have made many more purchases, including designer jewelry that would’ve been completely unaffordable otherwise. I have also sold jewelry, clothing, books, and other unwanted items through eBay, and have not only made money, but I’ve made people happy who wanted these things.

EBay is the best!",5
773,"New image search feature destroys app: I don’t understand how Ebay could release a feature that blows-up and destroys your searching when you rest your thumb as you normally would on an item on a search page. I spend a good deal of time deep into a search and bam, this poor app opens an image search and there’s no way I can go back to where I was in my search. Ebay needs an emergency update to this app to allow disabling image search and they should change the interface so you overtly select items you wish to be used as input to an image search so that this feature, by mere normal browsing, doesn’t undermine you and EBay’s business. The app has always had quirks such as, today, not correctly displaying sold item listings. The app needs far better attention to basic common sense usability and correct operation during basic Ebay customer activities.",1
774,"Remember!!!: Buying anything in this app .. you are gambling ! U may get deal or good items .. but remember you lost your money if there is any problem… Ebey respond to my case as customer!!! Quote- Hi Qandagha, We're sorry you had a problem with your purchase. However, to receive a refund, buyers need to return the item within the required timeframe after the seller has accepted a return request. This item wasn't returned to the seller on time. After reviewing all the details of this case, we determined that you won't receive a refund. We weren't able to give you a refund Hi , After reviewing this case, we decided to keep the original outcome. We weren't able to grant your appeal because we determined the original decision was correct. You won't receive a refund for this case.

The reason!!

775,"Not sure anymore: Used to have PayPal attached to my account. Worked great and in the past, PayPal helped me tremendously to get money back on a couple items that I bought that were damaged or mis advertised. They did more than eBay did. So eBay gets rid of PayPal and now wants access to my bank account to disperse funds back to me when I sell something. I haven’t done it even though eBay reminds me of “how critical” it is to do so or my account will be suspended. So I’ve gone to other arenas to sell my stuff. I still buy stuff here on occasion but the more I use other avenues the more I have stayed away from eBay.",5
776,"Please Fix One Thing...: This is probably my most used app on my phone.  eBay has done a great job of updating it so that it’s performance is flawless.  

However, please fix one thing.  Give the user the ability to hide past purchases.  It can be done on the web page and it would be nice not to see listing after listing in the purchase history of the app that are marked “unavailable”.  When they’re marked in this way, they cannot be removed by the user at all.  It makes this part of the app very cluttered.  I’ll do a search if I want to find something that I purchased in the past.  I don’t need to see it all of the time.",5
777,"Greedy greedy greedy!!: I left eBay because  it’s money hungry ways of doing business! Not only do they take whatever  % percent of the sale, they also take % percent of shipping! On top of that they boost the shipping up and the discount you get is the actual usps shipping cost! The greed doesn’t stop there they charge for stores.... the only benefit to that was the selling template because any little thing to boost your sales put money in ebays pocket! The buyers and sellers alike have become soo rude! I was on top of sells left personal messages( not automated) and packaged like Christmas to get no feedback or rude feedback! The buyers now wait till the last minute to send and no communication expecting 5 star ratings because they automated it to pressure you to leave the same!! All did and said it has become one money hungry greedy place to buy and sell!!!",2
778,"eBay apps gets worse and worse: My biggest pain point is that that app just adds and changes things in the listings - duration, price, shipping etc - without giving me the choice to do so, or even better, do NOT do it at all or st the very least ask. I’m an adult, i can decide how I want to sell my items and the last thing I need is some generic suggestions that are not even communicated. Even worse, the changes made by the app itself are not even trying to mimic my other listings, just some random stuff that someone at eBay HQ thinks it’s OK. I don’t care about such suggestions, let me give full control of the listing and do dare changing it.",5
779,"eBay doesn’t support its Buyers: Seller sent the wrong item, a different item than what he listed. eBay admitted and confirmed that Seller is responsible for return shipping fee. Seller was unable to print out a return shipping label to send to me for return of item. eBay emailed me to make alternate arrangement with Seller for return shipping fee, that Seller is responsible for this fee. Seller told me “not to worry” that “I would get my money”, to go ahead and return the item, he (Seller) stated and confirmed he would reimburse me once item returned. Seller immediately closed return upon receipt of return item, most likely to avoid reimbursing me for advancing the shipping fee ($7), and he never reimbursed me for the return shipping fee. Seller is avoiding fee and eBay let Seller get away with it. I am thinking of closing my eBay account.. I have been a Buyer since 2004 but I am not going to support a company that doesn’t support or backs its Buyers.",1

Mu husband started this account for his hot wheels for him and our grandchild I uses it for quilt supplies. We decided to buy a camera and I did the first rule you don’t do. Order from those with sorry feedback. I just want my money back if there is any left after his “fees” please help us to be honest and above board on this. His fees depends on who he gets to determine if I’m a liar or not. I’m not especially when it comes to the safety of kids.

781,"eBay Review: As a buyer eBay is an Excellent venue for shopping of competitive priced articles.  No matter if Finds are new or preowned It's like having a treasure chest at hands reach with a few clicks of the powerful search feature a surprise awaits every single time. 
As a seller sometimes buyers have a change of heart and stretch the truth by claiming items are not as described. Multiple times eBay has sided with buyer rendering the seller no option but to pay return shipping even if descriptions and photos clearly indicated the contrary. This has occurred a few times but I continue to participate as both buyer and seller. 
Thank you, ecofriend_2008",5
782,"Good for buyers, not so much for sellers: This app used to be amazing and I still do enjoy using it as a buyer.  As a seller though they just can’t keep it working. Listing especially is a nightmare with shipping not much better.  It is impossible to list items as the app will not save you item’s shipment information. You have to use a browser to enter that information.  For shipping the app will not allow you to select parcel post even when it is what the buyer paid for, you are forced to purchase priority.  This app has been a train wreck for six months now, get your act together eBay!!!",5
783,"Messed up item return procedure: I requested return as per item purchasing terms and return was approved , return ID created, message has return address in Chinese, but eBay message requested me to contact seller stating they can’t provide return label while still being responsible for return. I contacted seller via that message and seller responded to me asking to return to their USA warehouse instead, but did not provide address. I responded with request for the return address but still have not heard back. I sent copy to eBay. I think eBay should handle this communication and update shipping address themselves or more actively since I have no way to obtain the shipping label and extend the return deadline since I am still not able to ship",3
784,"So much potential: I want to love the eBay experience, as their barcode scanning feature is incredible for listing items to sell. But honestly that is the best thing about eBay and everything else has been a major headache!!

From having me sign in 10+ times in one session for no reason, shutting my account down after listing 30+ items and almost $200 on its way to me, and leaving very little instructions on how to reactivate the account besides literally forcing ME to go into the Help center and press “contact us”

When I finally got ahold of someone, they told me I contacted them through the wrong account. How could I possibly have done that? Did I create a 2nd account somehow? No, it’s just a headache through and through. 

eBay you have so much potential but why doesn’t your app fully host all the services you have? Why do I have to go from app to browser to computer to email just to get one task done? And when it’s done why do you undo everything and lock me out of my account with NO helpful instructions whatsoever?

I would use eBay every day if it got a serious makeover. Until then I’m going to be forced to use eBay’s competitors instead",2
785,The worst and most greedy: So using this app has always been a nightmare. The interface is really clunky and scammers can always scam you unless you’re doing extreme due diligence to make sure you’re not being scammed. But I just listed an item and I typed in the words clearly and selected the correct item to list but for some reason eBay is algorithm automatically renamed the item and when canceling it they’re going to charge me $68 because their system is flawed. That would be the final price if it’s sold at auction and I’m going to be charge for it because their system has an error. I hadn’t used eBay in a year because of its issues and horrible overpriced fees I come back and this is how you treat your customer.  I wish I could say horrible mean words to you and I wish I could do it to your face because this is unacceptable.,1
786,"eBay lately: I have been doing business on eBay for 16 years with much success.   Lately however, eBay has decided to tweak the sellers experience for the worst. Ideas such as automatically lowering the sellers price and erasing a seller’s feedback if that person sells their account are nothing short or ridiculous.  Feedback earned is feedback created carefully by a person running their business, not the actual business itself. Why should I loose it because I sell?  My pricing should be mine alone, and should not be eBays choice.  The eBay experience should be as uncomplicated as is possible.  Stop messing with what once was a great platform for sellers.",5
787,"Fees to sell are high.: I’ve used EBay since it’s inception, and have used the app since it came out. Recently the app was upgraded which made it buggy, and I dislike the layout from previous versions. It was easy to navigate before, now it’s too techy. The main thing is that fees have been increased for sellers. Used to you paid a percentage for a sale price up to a certain amount. But now they charge sellers that don’t move but a few products a month (your average consumer) a penalty percentage (5%) Expect to hand over 15% on most sales (higher than previous years) If your not a drop shipper or major business. Sadly due to these fees I will have to raise the price of shipping or an item to make it up, which makes you less competitive. Sad news for the every day garage seller. It’s all about profits I suppose.",2
788,"Works mostly, but has bugs on my iPad: The app works, mostly, but when it becomes unresponsive on the page of my watched items-that is frustrating. There is also a problem on both my iPhone and iPad, where eBay turns on, but says I have had no purchases in the last 90 days or the are no items in the watchlist....I have to do a full shutdown, then restart the phone or iPad, and they all come back.

790,"eBay Is AMAZING: eBay was founded in Pierre Omidyar's San Jose living room back in September 1995. It was from the start meant to be a marketplace for the sale of goods and services for individuals.

In 1998, Pierre and his cofounder Jeff Skoll brought in Meg Whitman to sustain the success. Meg had studied at the Harvard Business School and had learned the importance of branding at companies such as Hasbro.

Meg culled her senior staff from companies such as Pepsico and Disney, created an experienced management team with an average of 20 years of business experience and built a strong vision for the company -- that eBay is a company that's in the business of connecting people, not selling them things.

They quickly shed the image of only auctioning collectibles and moved into an array of upscale markets where the average sale price (ASP) is higher. ASP is a key metric in determining eBay's transaction fees, so increasing the ASP became an important item. By forging partnerships with namebrands such as GM, Disney and Sun, eBay has managed to do exactly that. Sun has sold 
$10 million worth of equipment and it now lists between 20 and 150 items per day.",5
791,"Great for certain things: Stuff like clothing and computers from individuals are the ticket. And no more worry cause if a seller rips you off eBay refunds you instantly and then goes after them. Always look for 1 or 2 points within a 100% seller rating. 

Also, leave a good review about what you expected versus what you got. It’s not just nice for the seller, it helps the next “you” finalize a choice. 

I was able to get a jacket an ex girlfriend swiped from me years ago for like $40. The one she took I paid $200 for.. woulda been a bit easier to swallow $40. We live, we learn. Trust your gut and Godspeed on your e-commerce journey lol.",5
792,"eBay Stores Barely Exist in any eBay App: There’s no way for shoppers using any eBay app to easily find, browse or view an organized eBay store. To shop by store category is a hard to find filter. This is a horrid platform for store owners who have made and continue to make eBay exist. Items in “Active” selling is limited to 600 for review. Browsers, menus and searches are driven by very limited choices very low prices. Keyword searches are so disrupted by filters I can’t find my own items using EXACT words from my own titles. Store owners are paying for a store with almost ZERO representation on any app for any device other than a PC or laptop greatly limiting our exposure for sales. These apps are killing store owners with rare, unique and collectible wares, we barely exist in eBay apps. The collections tab would be helpful to store owners with categories. How long is that going to take the programmers to finish?",1
793,"THIS UPDATE IS BUGGY! DONT DO IT!: This update is a complete nightmare for sellers. 30 day fixed price listings can no longer be selected (only good til cancelled or auction, which is the default). Best offer is forced as well. Shipping selection is buggy too. There is no place to change preferences. When you update an item using the app eBay tries to force you to select an option to lower the price every 5 days. The only way around listing with the app right now is to create drafts and list later on the computer. And of course this isn’t smooth either. As I mentioned the shipping bug- where first class shipping was previously set it’s changed to parcel select unless you manually switch it. I called 2 days ago and they claimed to put a ticket in to fix these issues but it’s not done yet. Presently it takes HOURS to list where it previously took minutes. PLEASE FIX THIS EBAY ASAP!!!!",1
794,"Deception Is The Norm!: The app wont work on older iPads. You cant download it. eBay allows sellers to use deceptive practices. Bait & switch is the new normal on EBay. Titles list item for low price but after you click on the item instead of $1.99 opening bid its a fixed price of $23! Almost 85% of listings use a price range instead of firm price! You see a listing that has a photo of a specific item and a specific price only to find out after clicking on it the price refers to some other item sometimes unrelated and that item in the photo costs 20 times what the listing advertised. eBay is at a new low! Very deceptive! Sellers cant even leave negative feedback when a buyer doesn't pay up! And, the automated systems run you in circles hoping you won't figure out how to get a credit for an unpaid item. Anything seems to be allowed unless they deem you politically incorrect!",1
795,"My review of EBay for iPhone! 😊: For starters, the service is Perfect! 👍 ..... there’s never any slowdown at all.😃 There’s also a Fantastic variety of items that pop up. My one little complaint is that sometimes when I search for an item with the character’s name, other items with the same name will pop up that are not even related to the character that I’m searching for and oftentimes those items will sometimes take up WAY!!! too much space on the page 🙁 But other than that small complaint, everything else about this clever 😊 little app is Spectacular! 👍👍",5

Every time I try to purchase multiple items from a vendor, I run into the problem of have to pay an exorbitant amount in shipping. The vendor always assume I can just request an invoice. I shop on eBay exclusively on my mobile devices. Time to accommodate those who don’t tie themselves to a laptop or desktop computer to shop on eBay. I don’t really have any other complaint. Thank you for providing a medium to purchase some wonderfully old things like they were new!",4

For starters the font they changed to makes my eyes hurt, but that's not why I'm here. THERES LITERALLY NO WAY TO READ A PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IT DOES NOT EXIST ON THE APP. Fix your app you bunch of losers!!! Make it usable, stop focusing on whatever you are focusing on. Start from scratch.

798,"eBay scams sellers: I came here to write a review, but I see that many other people have already experienced my situation and written reviews. After 10 years I will not be selling through eBay anymore. They allow buyers to lie and automatically issue them a refund despite proof that backs up the seller. They also automatically charged my account without telling me, caused an overdraw on my account, and racked up an additional $210 in fees. They also never ensured that my item was returned to me. No customer service, no reply to my requests, even after the buyer cancelled the return request they robbed me. I will be seeking legal counsel over this issue, however I doubt suing them will recover my money. Horrible company, atrocious way to do business; it’s time to abandon ship like so many others have done and pray this company is bankrupted into the ground.",1
799,"2 sides…Buyer & Seller: As a buyer this app/ service is good. You get protection and you can basically RETURN ANYTHING if you return it as “ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED “..that’s a little secret I found out the hard way as a seller. 

As a seller this app/ service DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. PERIOD! Only the buyer. They take a huge cut from your sales. I had the terrible experience of having to deal with a jrk that filed for a return on a product, that I had clearly stated NO RETURNS . I told him I won’t except the return so he filed a return as “ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED” . 

He stated the screws on the product looked a little different on the photos. (He lied) . Customer service just reads a script or copy paste a generic response. After almost 1.5  months of this,  I called customer service they told me not to worry prior  to an international trip. During my trip I got emails from customer service stating that if I didn’t pay for his return shipping they would refund him the money and he gets to keep the product. 

Not only did I have to pay for a return , they deducted 1000usd that had already been deposited to my account , the jrk returned the product and eBay stopped responding to my emails.  Bye bye to my sellers account.",2
800,"Wish listing was easier & faster: I love eBay and have sold a lot. With that being said, its not clear on bottom line take away price for sellers without digging through website. Wish it was more like other sites, where you know when you put in sell price it tells you what you’re going to make when all deductions/fees/taxes are taken off, it breaks it down so you know exactly how to price. It seems like it takes a long time to list on eBay then it’s not easy to find what the charges and fees will be once sold. Hoping it will get to that point here on eBay!",5
801,"eBay has lost its way: We all know what eBay does.
I just didn’t know they had given up on caring about anything.  Hurts are not responsible for anything. They bid win then ask questions and back out. I wasted hours upon hours listing various items. Sold 4 and got paid for nothing. I could have sold these items elsewhere already. 
You can go ahead and bid on anything you want. Then just don’t pay if you don’t want to. 
This has been my experience on four items sold already. 
I haven’t received a penny for any of it.
I could have sold this stuff on offer up already.
I’ve wasted a week waiting for these auctions to end only to then get absolutely no response from my buyers or eBay customer support. 
I messaged eBay about the non payment and started a process to have the auctions canceled since my buyers were all non responsive. eBay never responded either. Finally I called eBay and got ahold of a customer service rep who was either new on the job or poorly trained. He just kept stuttering and reading scripted robot like phrases that barely made sense. I still have my items marked as sold with no payments or response from the buyers. eBay does nothing to ensure bidders are legitimate. 
Needless to say I’m furious with eBay for wasting my time.",1
802,"Sell on Mercari instead: As a buyer, eBay is fabulous. I’ve found tons of stuff on there, and I’ve never had issues with people I bought from. 

But as a seller it was my worst nightmare. The fees are RIDICULOUS! I had to cancel an order because of a death in the family (btw family emergencies or other situations isn’t an option for canceling) so I couldn’t ship it out in time. But because I already “purchased” the shipping label (the buyer paid for it) I had to pay that fee on top of the transaction fee they still charged me. I’ve sold on Mercari before and had to cancel one order there. I didn’t have to pay out of pocket for the shipping fee after printing the label on that site. 

It’s already bad enough that people don’t want to pay for what an item is worth, but you tack on fees and you’ll never make a profit.",1

All three items sold for just over what I was expecting. The only problem is, after 2 weeks only 1 of those items was actually paid for by the highest bidder. The other two are still sitting there with no communication from the auction “winners”. The prime time to sell these items has passed and if I list these items again I’m looking at 50-60 percent of what the first auctions brought. So I end up being the one punished while eBay lets these losers continue to bid on other auctions. Why is there no system in place that immediately takes payment from the auction winner’s account as soon as the auction is complete?",1

Someone put a fake dispute when I had proof that I gave her her stuff and ended up having to wait 5 weeks for a review back just for ebay to take my $44 & charge me $20 on top of it I find it pathetic cause they been taking money off me since I started and continued wanting more? There losing an amazing seller. I recommend not selling on this app. (If this problem is resolved my review will change.) I just want my money back cause she won’t give me the stuff. BACK TO UPDATE MY REVIEW. Another person claimed they’ve never gotten there items over a $200 dollar order. Gave all my proofs of giving them there items already.

Not that it’s ended, not that it’s about to end, not that the price has dropped, only that it’s there, which I already know because I put it on the list. What this does is after being bothered and having no choice but to turn off all eBay notifications, now I am unable to serve my customers if the buy, make an, offer, or ask a question, and sometimes I have lost a sale because I didn’t get a notification about a message. It seems like this app is designed to cause rage.",1

807,"EBay cust-service hung up on me: I sent a message to eBay this morning to call me back as I believed my acct was hacked into. They called me within 2 minutes and I explained the situation and reasons for my concern. 

The lady from eBay rightly pointed out that the acct was in my wife’s name (as I had set it up, I had all the details). That they could not make any changes to the acct till they verified this request was coming from her. 

All that made sense to me, so I asked if she could check if the password for the account had been changed that morning. She said she could not - again only to my wife. I then - my voice now showing irritation but neither did I raise my voice nor use any inappropriate language - asked if they could put a hold on the account till my wife called them back. She said she could not do that either.

Finally I asked for her name as I would be noting timing of this call and would reference her if any purchase were made this day not by us. She hung up on me.

Exceedingly unprofessional, this was clearly my last request and a fairly simple one that didn’t require my wife’s consent.

809,Hindrance of stores on eBay.: ebay puts a cap on the items that new sellers and stores can sell on their site. These caps include the number of items and the money made within a 30 day period. The money cap is so low that I reached that cap within days because I was selling products at a low price and was doing very well and all my customers were very satisfied. But eBay tries to control the market by implementing these caps so that the prices remain the same generally and it prevents someone from selling a good product at a lower price. Because eBay misrepresented their store description I opened a store believing these caps/restrictions would be lifted but they are not so now I am paying for a store that I can’t even use. There are too many other auction and sales sites that are rising up to challenge eBay and this practice should stop.,1
810,Auction suggestion: Perhaps you should have to send out any reasonably sized items like trading cards to something like a ebay shipment/storage location so that when someone wins an auction the seller HAS to let it go and can’t retract the auction sale to then just slap it back up at a penny or whatever starting bid because they didn’t like the price it sold for because I have wasted much time looking through auctions and any time I can find and win on a good deal I don’t waste hours and hours of time when sellers choose to be disingenuous about start prices and what they actually end at😕,5

Why would you think that added an extra step to view and escape item photos would be of value? There are so many additional features more deserving… ability to filter watch items by Auction or Buy it Now, filter searches for auction items with 1 or more bids, etc. Stop wasting time trying to fix things that aren’t broken and instead deliver new features that add value and have purpose.",4
814,"eBay good, but not that good...: Few years back eBay was not full of with scammers, eBay buyers protection was much better, even sellers protection from the wining “changed my mind “ kind of buyers. Also since eBay started cut their taxes, selling here less and less! Seriously? Cut taxes on used products??? eBay fee wasn’t enough for eBay?  Also can’t reach nobody on phone, in fact customer support number not even exist anymore. But you can chat with a Bot! Great!  You take lots of money from the sellers, but if there any problems, can’t communicate with any representative. Problem solving on eBay these days are 👎🏻👎🏻 
Zero! 
Just cutting and collecting. 
Also thousands of fake scam listed items. Use eBay since 2005, but getting worse.",3
815,"Needs Work: This app is not as user friendly as you might think. I have a lot of problems trying to do a number of different things. After playing around with it a bit clicking different options I can eventually figure out how to do what I’m trying to do. Another annoying thing is sometimes it will allow you to print shipping labels from the app, but other times it tells you you have to go to eBay website on. browser. I was charged for a shipping label that I didn’t have access to and the support team pretty much told me “yeah that happens”. They were no help whatsoever and didn’t respond to me after that.",4
816,"Bad issue: Why is it that when I put in my choice parameters this system must auto change what I have loaded. It auto loads categories that DO NOT WANT. 
Please let me do what I want to do!!! Also it reminds me of listing I saved but did not save!
Also the new search menu is pretty nifty but when you’re 1000 items down at the bottom of the page you got to go back up 1000 items just to get to it.

I just want to tell the bright idea club, if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. By the time we get used to something you change it and we have to get used to it all over again",5
817,"Cant launch app: OK, so after using eBay app for years and years without any problems I go to list a few items today and I cannot launch The app???? I called eBay customer service and they tell me They did some updates so it was probably automatically updated, although I have updates turned off in my settings. So the gentleman tells me to delete the app and reinstall it, which I do. Now because I don’t have 12.0 or higher I cannot install the eBay app again. I don’t know why they try to fix things that ain’t broke. This is a big inconvenience to a seller on eBay....",5
818,"No notifications: Been using eBay for 7 years.  Love the forum.  However, in the past 6 months, despite having all notifications activated and even installing and uninstalling the app, I do not get notifications on my iPhone or an email to my eBay account.  It has generally been tolerable as a “glitch” but in the past 2 weeks I have lost over $1,000 in sales because I was not notified of offers that met my minimum offer setting.  Therefore I did not even get the option to barter with potential buyers or accept their offers outright.  One sale alone was $700 and I had 3 offers for that item that simply sat and expired.  Hopefully eBay will fix this.  It is incredibly frustrating and makes me reconsider selling and buying in this venue.",3
819,"Everything I Need I Get: I have been a loyal customer of eBay since 2005. I have purchased a number of things with consistent results and satisfaction guaranteed when item is returned.  I still have the first item I ever bought and it still works (fax machine)! I buy my professional materials as well as personal items saving variations of 20%-50%  per item.  Now I also enjoy selling on eBay! So easy to list, easy to know when ""Cha-Ching"" happens, easy to print shipping label and collect payments. Easy to sell and buy! Easy to track items shipped and feedback available. Easy pay and instant purchase satisfaction! eBay does it all!",5
820,"I love eBay 💕: The app is great, so far I haven’t had any issues with it or wished for any kind of change. I must add that I love eBay. Love love love it!! I use it every day, for selling and buying. I can find literally anything on eBay. I had a pair of heels put up for years and when I went to wear them they had deteriorated 🙁 they were at least ten years old but I searched on eBay and freakin found them! I had lost my love for dolls, had grown out of it, but one day about 5 years ago I just happened to search for fashion dolls and BAM! Loved what I saw and started my collection back up again. It’s a hobby and a passion of mine and I thank eBay for helping me reconnect.",5
821,"Sales so slow: Sales have been so slow I've been losing money each month for months now. I cant do this much longer. Ebay has ruined my store and its reputation is worse than ever with small sellers like me. Have to go elsewhere to sell soon. Called several times and nothing changes, promised calls back that are never received, received emails back to waste time reading them about a different subject. Ebay is charging astronomical fees now it's become a rip off. The only one getting rich is ebay. I'm a top rated seller and items don't pull and are not viewable. Very disappointed. This year is the end of my selling on eBay.",5
822,"Makes Using eBay Enjoyable!: This app is really good. I actually prefer using the iOS app over browsing eBay on a computer. It has a logical layout and is easy to use. You can do everything you need to do, be it buying or selling an item from the app. I find myself frequently checking eBay throughout the day for items I want to purchase using the Saved searches feature, which is easier to use here than on a computer because it has counters for how many new items have been listed under that saved search. Keep up the good work, eBay!",5
823,"Stop it: This app gets worse with every update. The stuff I NEED isn't in there, and the changes keep making me have to run to a computer. For example, the send offer now does not work on the app on my brand new iphone or my iPad that's only a year old. What a joke.

Then fees... Why am I forced to pay 30% now???? Come on... You do nothing to help sellers.

Couple all of that with the fact that they just allow buyers to leave bad feedback all willy billy, and it's just getting out of hand.  There needs to be a process before someone is allowed to do that. I sold something that the buyer didn't know how to use.  They never asked me or reached out the the manufacturer and then left negative because it didn't work since they has zero idea what they were doing with epoxy.  I literally answer within an hour, unless I'm sleeping, and easily could have helped. Instead, their failure made them give me negative and it literally said they didn't know what they were doing.  

Long story short, I've been here since the beginning of time, and I'm very close to being done.",3
824,"Overall great App but with some improvements needed: I’ve been a victim of shill-bidding on numerous Ebay auctions for sports cards. USPS has lost sold items at no fault of mine and Ebay should help prevent sellers from losing both their sold item and having to refund the buyer when it was USPS’ fault besides having to buy separate insurance. Ebay fees are relatively high which makes insuring orders cut even more into the bottom line. I’ve seen auction winners not pay and come up with bogus excuses on why they can’t pay for the item they won. Aside from these and a few other issues, Ebay is a overall great app.",5
825,"eBay has changed: Very very long time EBay user both selling and buying. Buying always great results , always pleased with items and sellers are great, as a seller things have changed. Whatever they have done, people call out the algorithms, huge difference, I will list items that previously had huge views like “Steven King” or “Michael Kors” etc and no views for weeks or 1 view, I imagine if you don’t pay the extra amount to “boost” your views you will continue to get none, so I tried a few items at the added expense and maybe had 1or 2 more views but nothing much. Drastic fall off that I’ve read many are complaining about. Too bad was fun while it lasted, time to investigate other options!",3
826,"eBay is still great!: I have been using eBay on/off since close to the beginning. A fairly long time. I have placed many business and personal orders and had very few incidents of dissatisfaction. Never with eBay as a company.

Again, today, I received great customer service from a member of the small business community that lists products on eBay. I would highly recommend using this service and supporting small business ownership. It’s a great platform to buy/sell and maybe trade? I don’t know, never bartered using eBay! Lol…

Thank you for the many years of connecting all of us!",5
827,"Delightful!: I have been an EBay customer for many years now and through lots and lots of transactions. 
I can count the number of issues I’ve had on one hand (with fingers left over). The VERY few I’ve had have been resolved quickly and fairly. How cool is that?  
I buy super cool vintage China, memorabilia, and what have you, along with the most amazing Christmas items,  from the most incredible sellers!  
I love the opportunities this website gives me to find “that footed cream soup bowl for this gorgeous set of Castleton china” or “this fantastic old Sunkist metal sign” I just had to have…I love that.
It’s here, come see!",5
828,Mighty Has Fallen: I use to love using EBay for selling many of my items but as of late this service has gone down the toilet Selling now has included a feature called Payouts which is the dumbest move they could have done. It is said to protect the buyers but what about the sellers Once you have sold an item EBay places a hold on the money until the buyer receives the item. Which absolutely makes no sense because why will you place a hold on payments when as a seller needs that money to pay for shipping. It’s happened to me several times and the customer service reps claim that feature is removed once you’ve established a good seller rating which is dumb because it should never be there in the first place Personal I’m done selling on eBay and only will use it for buying since it favors them over sellers,1
829,Loving eBay!: I love eBay for the selection & price plus I never have to leave my home. You order what you want & there is almost always a huge selection with different shipping cost & arrival dates. You get to really look at & check out what you’re buying & you can see what others thought of the product & seller that you’re dealing with. I like the fact that you can see what more than one person thought & I have made my decision over this many times. I’m not going to leave good feedback if I’m not treated well but if the product & buyer are great I show them greatness,5
830,"Best auction site ever!: Great for collecting retro toys and video games!!! Just about anything you can think  of is on eBay. Retro brand new McDonald’s toys, brand new VHS players, laser disk players, 80’s toys, New in box sealed Nintendo games, Books, movies, and much more!! I have a great collection of Old retro video games thanks to eBay. eBay has some of the best deals around. I’ve been a member since 2001 and they’ve come along way since then. They now have a money back guarantee, so you’re more protected. I’m also a seller on eBay and would recommend them. Whenever I need some extra cash I just sell on eBay. I highly recommend eBay!",5
831,"FRAUD: I sold well and my store was just closed.  When I tried to find out why, they gave me intelligible answers.  They sent me an invoice and said that if I pay they will open ?!  Lies and swindlers!  I paid and my store wasn’t opened yet!! FRAUD!  Then if it says no return - but in the end they still return, and in my case, even after two weeks!  Although it was written that there is no return ?!  In this site you can sell something from the very beginning!  But then they will shut you down ?!  You should not count on this sai ?!  A lot of lies and deceit!  I now work in other sites and with much better conditions!  Good luck to you too!",5
832,"Shipping charge issues!!!: All of my listings via the mobile app have automatically switched my shipping to free! I never offer free Usps flat rate shipping on auctions!!!! That is a fast way to lose money...WHICH I HAVE AS RECENTLY AS THIS WEEKEND! My listings up until this last update had always been automatically “calculated shipping”.I was horrified this weekend when I printed up labels only to find that I was paying for shipping! $8.40 to ship an item that sold for $3.99!?! I was shaking mad. I have listed 11 more auctions since then and even though I selected calculated shipping, they’re showing as “free shipping”. This HAS TO GET FIXED. Sellers are losing money! I reached out to 3 sellers tonight who had free shipping selected for “but it now” items that were less than the shipping fees. I’ve heard back from two of those sellers and they had been unaware that their items were offered to ship for free.
PLEASE FIX IT!",1
833,"Connect and protect: Thank you EBay, no doubt about it and for sure eBay turned the world of business around, I take my hat off to eBay and it’s management, you literally brought all products that I want and put it on the table in front of me and gave me a protected choice, what could be better than that!! Then Product information plus seller information on top of that specs and comparisons, that does it, plus good shipping time, close to impossible and they always came through, I’m so happy and will use eBay all the time. Thank u, and it took years after eBay existences before other eBay wanna be companies showed up. Thank you",5
834,Missing features in latest update: The nicest part of the app was being able to search watchlist and other areas by seller.  This no longer works which is a huge detriment. They really need to add the option to request total PRIOR to purchasing for those sellers who combine shipping. I have yet to find a way to do this in the app even tho it’s a longtime feature of the website. Similarly the app forces you to pay for some items immediately in order to purchase them...which again causes issues if purchasing multiple items from the same seller.,5
835,"Ebay Community: I have been a part of the eBay Community almost since its initial launch in 1995.  During the last 20 years I have participated in both the buying & selling hundreds of wonderful rare items on eBay.  Items you won’t find in a department stores or at a large shopping mall.  Rare items that have been well cared for many, many years.  eBay is at the center of everything that is good, fun, rare, exciting, and amazing online.

Thank you for the best website in the world !!!!!!",5
836,"Real bargains Good quality: I have found things that are no longer available in stores, like cool belts from Chicos.  The prices are very fair.  I have seen similar used items on other sites asking full price and sometimes more than the original price!  Sellers on eBay seem to price things so it’s hard to pass up the bargains.  Everything I’ve purchased so far looks new.  I recently bought a fountain for more than $100 less than retail.  It has a tiny scratch that I’m expecting moss will cover.  Or not, it’s in the back, I’ll never see it.  So happy with my purchases so far.",5
837,"App keeps deleting my recent searches: App keeps deleting all my searches, which is extremely annoying. Every time I need to look up my usual searches, which is several times a day, I have to write the search terms again, apply all the filters, including sorting results as newly listed, change categories and change item location settings. I lost the chance of purchasing several items that were listed as buy it now because of this issue. I look at all my searches several times a day and it used to take me about 2 minutes each time. Now it takes me 10 minutes every time I need to check if there’s anything new. So annoying. Of course their selling fees are getting higher by the hour and I’m not sure for how long I’ll be able to sell on the platform.",1
838,"EBay member since 1998.: My family has been in retail over 30 years. I joined eBay and began buying and selling, making long time friends through sales. After I was in a violent auto accident and was unable to work as a nurse, in the hospital setting.

839,"Scam: eBay is full of so many scams I’d spend a lifetime counting them. I had spent $350 on a Nintendo switch, I waited for about 3 weeks, eBay kept saying it was delivered but every time I checked with the post office and they had kept saying that it was still in delivery, when they finally told me it was delivered, I checked everywhere around the house and still couldn’t find it, turns out they had sent it to the wrong place, I tried to message eBay about it and they said I had to talk to the seller about it, talked to the seller and he said he wasn’t doing anything about it, he got the message that it was delivered and that’s all he cared about, the worst part is that eBay agreed with him so they didn’t do anything about it either, so I’m out $350 and no switch, freaking bull crap( would cuss if it didn’t star it out)",1
840,"Ebay Rocks!!: I’ve been an EBay user for many years now, and I love Ebay!! Prices are usually right and shipping. Selling is made easy, plus they give you so many chances to sell with discounts!! I use Ebay ALL the time!!  

Now, a few years later…. It gets harder and harder to find good deals on Ebay.  I’m not blaming Ebay, but the economy.  And I’ve just about quit selling on Ebay because you try and make a few bucks, but now you have to pay taxes on your sales when you already paid taxes when you purchased it to begin with.  It’s almost not worth it.  Again, not EBay’s fault!!",5
841,Can’t get a refund: Can’t get a refund for an item that I done sent back only getting told by support to keep contacting the seller and the seller is not responding back go back to the store where you got your eBay gift cards from and see what they can do and that there is nothing they can do about my refund because the seller closed the refund the same day I requested to return item there nothing the support can do but only keep telling me to contact the seller and that everything have to be settled outside of eBay for me to get my refund what do I do if the seller not responding and this is my first time having to return an item back to someone I need help I would like to be able where someone could be able to contact the seller all I can do is write a review and leave them one start for bad communication,1

For example, Mint condition Pandora charms, jewelry of all kinds, Clothing & the cutest hats, Brooks & Nike running shoes, even my fave perfumes. If you take the time to really look around you will find such deals as I did.   

I just thought about my review! I’m leaving a review that may just cost me to have extra competition with my future items of interest😱 Oh well! It’s too late now, I’ve already written my review so I’ll just have to live with the consequences.

843,"Once upon a time ...: ... There was an eBay app that was so easy to use and worked perfectly. And then something happened. It changed and was updated and now updated again. Features disappeared, items were listed and sometimes relisted incorrectly because of glitches. It was no longer a quick, easy, and complete task to list an item. It is sometimes necessary to have two apps/devices open to complete a task. Purchasing an item is still so very easy, although not all items appear in a search depending the device or app being used. It now just takes extra time and is frustrating, but eventually it will all work out. Why constantly change things when something is working just fine?

I’m told to keep on contacting the seller, whom keeps ignoring my requests. I was given a return label, but I can’t return it. If you did any upgrades to your computer, they won’t refund that either. The seller promised to send the RAM, then waited until the last second before their account got reported to send me a shipping label. I won’t send the computer back because I’m afraid the seller will say I never sent the item back. eBay was more than happy to have me buy another RAM stick through their website, which  is why I don’t think they want to refund me. Thieves helping thieves, I guess their motto is.",1
845,"If people can mess it up they WILL: eBay was great when I first started using it10 years ago. For the most part all of us sellers and buyers had a set of ethics and rules we strictly followed. Now , it’s a free for all. Way too many scammers and ignorant buyers and sellers. Too many listing from sellers that put ridiculous reserves on items or will start the auction at a price higher than the item is worth. Ten years ago I could go on here any day of the week and get a great deal that the seller was comfortable letting it go at. Now I will be lucky to get one a month.
Unfortunately I don’t think it’s something eBay can fix and it’s more of a social systematic issue.",4
846,Horrible customer service: eBay doesn’t provide a phone number if you have an issue. You have to click like 6 different buttons to finally figure out how to get a chat bot and ask for a call back . Took me 45 minutes to figure out how to get a call . When I ask why they dont provide a phone number on the website they say because of the pandemic. But yet we can fill up an arena for the Super Bowl but eBay can’t have a few operators in their office answering concerns of their customers. Or if they want to have their operators work from home they already provide a phone for the operators to call you they can have them answer the phone when we call.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and they refused to talk to me . I have been a member for 20 years but I’m done and won’t be back because of this .,1
847,"Sellers BEWARE: eBay will NOT “step in and help” like they advertise. They will “put you to work” and “walk you through” and put you on hold and ask you to wait til tomorrow.

I am beyond disappointed and disgusted with my experience selling on eBay. I will never get the time back that I lost “working” for eBay trying to figure out how to ship/ cancel an order so I could complete the sale. They just said wait til it expires and we will release the money back to buyer and you can re list the item.

848,Amazing money back offer: I recently purchased a graphics card for a pc I’m building off of eBay because of how inflated the prices are right now in December / January. After purchasing the card I waited about 2 and half weeks and never received it which was worrying because graphics cards are expensive so I opened a case against the seller and they failed to provide proof that they sent it. A few days later eBay gave me a full refund including shipping. Now I definitely am a little worried that more purchases might end up not being sent but now I know eBay can be trusted to provide a full refund if it happens.,5

851,"Functional app that needs some tweaking.: Over all I would honestly say the eBay app is actually a very well done shopping app. 

Pros: Secure, fast and easy to use. Purchase history limitations seem to be gone and search results seem to match google or desktop computer web browser results. 

Cons: for some reason it appears that PayPal is glitchy when using it via this app. It will skip ahead while typing in the password for your account or it will glitch and skip the password keyboard entry altogether. Trying to skip ahead. This is due to the most recent update.",5
852,"Horrible Undisclosed Fees: I was selling golf clubs on eBay for $475 which was fine until I received $100 in fees, I was aware of about half of it which is still a lot for only 475, for some reason I also received listing fees which was odd because it said I had 50 free listings but it was an additional $10 in listing fees. The fees are insane and it’s not even worth selling through eBay since it has even more fees when you transfer to PayPal so I only received about $250 after massive amounts of fees. I would never sell items on here again and strongly discourage people from doing so since I was never told about how much fees there were going to be, I would have thought $30 for fees would be fine for $475 but instead it was $100, and I was never told that it was going to cost that much. It is horrible for fees and I would rather sell on another website instead.",1
853,"eBay’s managed payment ripoff: Don’t waste your time (and money) selling on eBay anymore. All seller will be forced into their “managed payments” program after July 15, 2020. Managed payments means eBay holds ALL SELLER FUNDS for 3-4 days, then sends it too you, and tells you it takes 3-5 business days for it to hit your bank accounts. I had too wait 10-12 days too see ANY money, had too pay shipping out of my pocket and wait too be reimbursed. The buyers had the items 5-7 days BEFORE I EVER SAW A DIME. With PayPal I saw my money minus fees in minutes NOT DAYS OR WEEKS. Holding our money to invest in money markets too profit even more off of the sellers WHO MAKE ALL THE MONEY FOR EBAY BECAUSE EBAY DOES NOT SELL ANYTHING. I guess when the banks gambled in the markets with OUR MONEY and lost OUR MONEY and needed BILLIONS IN GOVERNMENT RELIEF TO SAVE THEM DIDN’T TEACH EBAY ANYTHING.

Worse than mercari or letgo, a lot worse! So 1 star is even a bit high maybe only because I can look at other things to buy. But thats it.

859,"eBay is a life saver: Dear eBay,

I have been a avid user and member since I totaled my first motorcycle in 2003.. it wasn’t exactly something I could claim on my insurance. It took me many hours and thousands of dollars to rebuild. I could have simply slapped it all back together for a few hundred but I found all the upgrades I wanted and it kinda snowballed from there.

 Since then many other similar platforms have taken off and some have done spectacularly well, in most cases.. I refuse to use other sites and eBay will always be my first and only choice for online shopping.

I have bought a car here, I also buy most of my clothes here.. and if eBay had a dating section I’d try to find a future online shopping friend that enjoys savings too! Thank you eBay for all the great years you’ve helped me rebuild, repair and upgrade my home, my cars and my lifestyle. eBay is and always will be my go to and #1!!!

(If there is ever a eBay dating section I’d like to be remembered)",5
860,"EBAY STEALS: Quite a few issues with EBay, they’re certainly not the business they were in the beginning, here is just a few.
1) If you have a hot selling item, they will have there employees shut down your item and then sell it themselves sweeping your business from under your feet.
2) eBay will charge you invoices for items they know you have not sold and if you don’t notice that you’ve been overcharged they don’t notice it. Highly Unethical. 
3) They also sell hemp oils, cannabis oil and other cannabis products but will not allow the sale of vitamins because they are not FDA approved? I didn’t know marijuana was FDA approved. 🤔.",5
861,"Can’t complete purchases Still being charged.: I can make purchases on a web browser on eBay no problem but when trying to use this eBay app I can’t! I can’t complete a purchase and somehow I am still being charged for the item I tried to purchase. Called customer support and nothing. They don’t care. $377 being withheld from my bank and they don’t care. One guy even laughed at me at eBay customer service. First I’m told it’s my banks problem. How can that be when I’ve used this card on eBay before? Then they tell me it’s the merchant service provider Adyen. Can’t contact them. Who’s going to help me? When will I get my money back? The $14 I have left in my bank account won’t hold me over till payday. Oh yeah, that’s right. For a purchase I attempted that didn’t go through I was charged twice.",1
862,"Update App is causing EBay/vendors to loose money!: I do not want to update my IOS, therefore I can’t purchase anything from EBay, just who thought that was a good idea? Also, even if I wanted to update, I do not have WiFi at home, (as I’m sure many others don’t also). I have family & friends that I use when needed, only time I use eBay is late night, I’m not going out in the middle of the night just to update an App. I thought eBay would realize this was a problem & correct it, however every time I try to use eBay I’m told to update. What’s wrong with letting those that don’t want to update just use it as they always have? Hopefully when vendors realize their sales are down, they will complain & this will be corrected. Also, I’ve read & heard too many complaints with the update, why risk updating?",1
863,"Suspended Seller Account with no notice.: I recently increased selling a lot, so understandably, eBay looked into my funds to make sure the customers were being taken care of. However, the froze my account to do so and before they did this, they told me I was doing nothing wrong. They have declined my request to have my account reinstated even though I have been a 5 star seller for quite some time now. I have now had to cancel orders because the funds have been frozen and I cannot list. I have lost a few hundred dollars directly, and the opportunity cost of listing. 

Before this incident I did love eBay, the fees are pretty high, but it is nice to have protection as a customer. I am giving a one star because although this is one mistake, it is a very costly one and they have not been very helpful in the process at all.",1
864,"App isn’t user friendly, new payout method stinks: The app itself is okay, but not great.  Searching for items, bidding, and selling are all pretty easy.  Any other research, the menu system isn’t user friendly.  The new way of getting paid out stinks, and I can’t find any way to change it.  They automatically deposit funds in your bank account (after several days).  That might be fine for some, but PayPal used to be immediate.  I don’t even know if getting paid via PayPal is even an option anymore, as I can’t find a way to change payout method anywhere on the site.  eBay used to be easy to do business with, and for buyers, it still is - but selling isn’t a great experience.",3
865,"Doesn’t even work right: The majority of times I try to bud on an auction it displays an error message that says I have reached a buying restriction. I have bought items thru auctions before, however it is rare I find an item I am interested in that I am actually able to bid on. I always pay promptly; probably within three hours or less of winning the auction. I have no strikes, yet the message is continually displayed even when I have not interacted with another auction for weeks. I have contacted customer support and they essentially told me that it was the sellers fault and the only thing I can do about it is message the seller. Sometimes this can be very disappointing. Wish eBay would fix the issue or an alternative site would outcompete them. Face book market place often seems to be superior. SMH",1
866,"Most Recent Update = WORST Update: I’ve been an eBay member since 2002 and I use the app multiple times a day. I have found the most recent update to be the absolute WORST update ever. 

The app freezes for a moment every time an item is being watched. It does the same when deleting those watched items. What’s even worse about that, is after the watched item is deleted, it’ll automatically bounce you back to the top of your watch list. This happens after EVERY single time an item is being deleted. Super annoying and frustrating. 

Most important to me is...what the heck happened to the push notifications for items ending soon?? Where’s my notification for items ending in 15 minutes??? I guess eBay doesn’t want to continue making money. Get your crap together, eBay!!",1
867,Bad deal for seller: I listed an item for sale and it sold easily enough. The buyer paid and I shipped the item the very next day. Eight days later the buyer hadn’t received the item due to post office delays and because it wasn’t delivered exactly on the estimated delivery date EBay saw fit to refund the buyers money from my PayPal account. Subsequently the item was finally delivered and I paid the buyer to send my item back to me. I also paid selling fees to eBay for the sail of the item. eBay takes no responsibility for anything in this matter even though it was their fault in my opinion for refunding the buyer and costing me  over $100 in shipping and fees.,4
868,Why does one of the biggest selling platforms lag!: Why does the biggest selling platform lag. I have this eBay app for some time and have been a reseller for even longer. But this app makes things so difficult selling items viewing items and opening cases with every moment it lags. It’s not my service I have Verizon which is one of the best services out there. But this app lags in every way loading photos opening cases viewing history. It is terrible I don’t understand why it has to be so bad if it is one of the Huges selling platforms out there. Do they not make enough money to pay the tax to handle this problem.,4
869,"I bought this for nothing: y’all need to fix this gift card thing. Some of us don’t have paypal or a credit card. So we buy gift cards, but they’re useless now because when you try using them it tells u to put a card or PayPal. And I just bought a 25$ gift card and was so happy to buy my things until I couldn’t. I even made a new account up till I had no more emails left and noticed y’all added a feature where u have to have a credit card or PayPal. I am sad I bought this with all the money I earned up for a month. My parents and my family doesn’t have much money so I just did this for nothing. The least you could do is change that. I am so disappointed I used up all this money for some card I’m never gonna be able to use. Last year I had bought one too and it worked so what’s wrong now. Y’all just ruined a kids day.",1
870,"Crash and Burn: I have tried everything I know to create business? I have lost 80%+ in sells. I cannot buy anything for the fact that I can't sell anything and now I'm finding out that I have a 14 day return policy,No questions asked! Then PayPal tells me that I have to accept returns that are 90 days and longer and they automatically deduct it from my account without my consent!
       I have called several times to ask PayPal to report my credit to the federal credit bureau in which it never has shown up that PayPal has reported? I'm really confused why? I sell something on eBay and PayPal is making ALL of the decisions without my consent?
        So, my question is? Who runs eBay? PayPal or eBay? With eBay I'm not having any success with your algorithm methods when pertaining to searching items or selling items!
       I have noticed a large number of my friends and competitors are crashing in sales also. If I'm to be successful so does eBay need to be successful! If I'm not selling? I'm not buying! I believe this is why sales have gone down with eBay is because of this times the amount of customers who sell and buy on eBay?
      And now that PayPal has joined in on the decision making? This is becoming ALL out Chaos! 
         Please Help!

871,"Unfair for sellers, no seller protection: eBay doesn’t care sellers at all!! Sold an used textbook through eBay. I was provided a shipping address in New York. 5 days later the packing slip changed to California fo no reason, after book was delivered!!! Spoke to the resolution team and they confirmed me that the first address is buyer’s primary address... I still lost the case and gave refund!! How? It’s not like I shipped to wrong place, instead I shipped to the exact address eBay provided at the time of the order!!! Lost 5 dollar shipping fee and my expensive book!! I don’t know what step went wrong but definitely not on me!! How can I imagine an address happen to be buyer’s primary address under his exact name... of course I was provided the address by eBay!!!I sold 10 items before so it’s not like I’m new to the process. Really unfair eBay team!!! Will never buy or sell from eBay again",1
872,Not the 5 Star Site they used to be. I am a seller and buyer and i: Not the 5 star Site they used to be. I am a seller and buyer and I cant believe how high the fees have gotten and there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. SO I AM PAYING MORE AND GETTING LESS.  I DO NOT offer returns and Ebay gives everyone their money back no matter what. Its more like they steal it from you. I even had one customer ship me an empty envelope back and as soon as it arrived they gave them a full refund even though they never had any intention of sending me the phone back. So they got to keep the phone and got a full refund back. I am very disappointed.,5
873,"Don’t like the updates: Why are you guys making the app harder to use?  It seems that every time you update tbis, I have to make more and more clicks to get to what I want.  Example: when I click “Track Purchase”, I used to get all the tracking information.  Now when I want that, I have to click a “Details” button now.  This makes no sense!!  Who is designing these updates??

And before this, when I wanted to look at items I had already bought, ONE click has now become THREE for each item.  Why???  This just doesn’t make any sense.  Maybe test your updates with users before making them live?  Just a suggestion.

BUT - you guys get a HUGE thank you from me for NOT forcing updates!  You allow the users to update when it’s convenient for them.  I really appreciate that, and I know a lot of other users do too.

Please consider my comments above; I know other people with the same gripes.  It’s the little things, but they add up.  Appreciate your time, if you read this.  And seriously, thank you again for not forcing updates on the users.  👍🏼",3
874,"Every now and then: Every now and then eBay is hit or miss when buying items. I have received good service and accurate items much of the time when purchasing but also have had several bad experiences. I have lost over $500 dollars in 10+ years if not more purchasing items that I never received, obviously scams! eBay nor the sellers of those transactions made it right so I had to just accept my losses left with the feeling it was my fault somehow????? Not good for business so,…..Buy on eBay at your own risk because it definitely isn’t a secure enough sales site to prevent scams and scammers from ripping people off!",4
875,"Never working with them again: I was sent an email saying my account had been restricted. The only thing I’ve ever bought on my account was funko pops- I’m a college student. I’ve also never sold anything on the app because I’ve never needed to. After spending 40 minutes trying to figure out what I could have done wrong to have my account suspended, the agent I spoke to was rude and refused to give me any information. I asked multiple times what I had done that “violated the community guidelines,” considering I hadn’t purchased anything on my account in 3 months. Unless I was hacked and something happened, I did nothing wrong and I am extremely frustrated. Overall, this was a bad experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I WOULD NOT recommend downloading or buying items through the website/app.",1
876,"eBay Bucks: I would like to see more Ebay Bucks. That’s something I Always looked forward to getting and watching it as the period went on. Then getting it and Thinking which item I want to spend it on! 
 I don’t think eBay is very fair At All when it comes to customers like myself who can only afford to spend so little. Something that could help or work would be Ebay gives me a Job being a Secret Shopper?? And give personal reviews on the Sellers!? And I keep whatever it is that I purchased. Something for You’s at Ebay to Consider?? So after this review I look forward in Ebay getting ahold of me and hiring me as a secret shopper.",4
877,"Good for buying, but selling is complicated: So I buy all the time! I love price shopping and having opportunities to buy from reputable sellers. 
I’ve tried several times to sell things on EBay, but every time I did, someone would buy it and not pay for it claiming “their child was playing on the computer” and bought it. I think people are addicted to bidding and trying to “win”. They do it and win for the thrill then blame someone else for it. It’s very disruptive. You have to wait for it to become open again for sale. It was a hassle and besides I’m not a business.",5
878,"Looks the other way for scam sellers: Ebay has really gone downhill now that they allow sellers to just cancel sales if they decide that they wanted a higher price than they listed and were able to get with their auction. So many items that appear up for sale for reasonable prices get pulled away when you win the auction. It’s impossible to make informed bidding decisions if sellers can just flake out with no consequences. There’s no way to let other users know when an item was relisted at a price the seller already refused to accept. Sometimes I haven’t even received a full refund from purchases where the seller flaked out. If you make a deal to sell something, you sell it. If you wanted more, you should have listed the item for more.",2
879,"eBay is the WORST!: The app no longer works for those of us that have older mobile devices. The PUSH the establishment has put on people to keep updating devices and apps is just RIDICULOUS. It’s almost constant and I’ve had it! If it’s not broken why “fix it”.....Stop pushing us in to buying more mobile devices and forcing us to constantly update. 🤬
And another negative if you are a seller on eBay they literally treat you like POO. Everything on eBay is set up for the buyer even if buyers are LIARS and SCAMMERS. And also the fact that eBay has taken away PayPal and FORCES you to give them your bank account information otherwise you won’t get paid is just INFURIATING. I say RUN the other way and go somewhere else to sell. eBay is a  complete JOKE and it’s criminal what they do to sellers. They don’t respect or care about their sellers.",1
880,"Disappointed!: I have been buying everything from eBay for the last couple of years.  Everything was good until my last package never arrived.  I contacted seller, didn’t wanna take responsibility because item was marked delivered which Never got!  I live in a safe area where stuff is never tajen I have tools and bikes outside my porch, its never taken good neighbors and private.  I get stuff delivered from walmart all the time so, its impossible it just disappeared.  eBay got involved and all they said was item was marled as delivered so they couldn’t help me.  They don't care about your money.  They aren’t the ones losing it right!",5
881,Stock availability should be verified: I am a long term eBay buyer and have had generally positive experiences but during COVID-19 I have experienced multiple seller issues for products that I believe should have had some vetting by eBay prior to listing.  Refunding due to “lack of stock” 5 days later means I could not purchase from a reputable seller at the time I wanted to make a purchase. This is not a “no harm/no foul” situation and the selling platform could impose fines or otherwise do a better job to make purchases trustworthy.  I do realize this is an unprecedented time but I hope things can improve on eBay.,5
882,"They do not refund money: Purchased items from seller on eBay and returned items and eBay will not honor money back guarantee.  Contacted seller and he will not refund money.  Contacted eBay and they will not investigate or refund money.  Do not buy anything from sellers on this app because eBay will not help you get your hard earned money back.  I have never heard of a company that you show them proof that you have returned a item and they still do not refund your money.
I was well within the “30 day money back guarantee” and they tell me to contact PayPal.  Meanwhile seller has the equipment That I purchased as well as the money I used to purchase it and eBay allows this.  Take it from my experience that they will not help you and they favor sellers more than buyers.  Use offer up or any other p2p that will offer good customer service to everyone in the community.",1
883,"To my favorite company of all time!!!: I can’t thank eBay enough for being an amazing company & your customer service is top notch, I’ve been spoiling myself on eBay & I’ve been beyond happy! I recommend you to everyone & want to thank you for some of the nicest sellers I’ve met in a longtime. I can’t even start to tell you how thrilled I am not to have to drive, try to find a parking space, not having to go into stores & just find over priced junk & having to wait online to checkout, who ever though of eBay is a genius in my book!!!!

884,The app itself works as it should: I have no issues with the app ebay it’s self however have alot of fraudulent sellers I’ve been scammed out of so much money and so many products I deleted account and redownloaded years later hoping for change because I’ve been with ebay a total of 10 years they have no loyalty to their long time customers they could careless had to reach out to paypal one time for a refund cause ebay did nothing if you purchase from this site please cover yourself by adding pay pal because when ebay sides with the seller for 2weeks you’ll have a back up plan after I receive my refund this time which ebay says is may 5th after seller swore up And down they sent item and i spoke to the post office confirming they never received the item i am deleting my account for good ebay is a rip off but app works fine,1
885,"App trys to force sellers to take offers at 50% Of listing price: If you were selling using the app, please be aware of a very annoying feature. Whether you want offers on your items or not, you will get daily emails that say “congratulations! Your listing can now accept offers.” Without your permission, the app will cause the “best offer” feature to appear on some of your listings - at 50% of your listing price. Yes, you can go in and change it – one listing at a time… The only workaround for this is to NOT List on the app, but to use the desktop instead. Simply put, if I wanted offers on an item, I will put the best offer feature in myself. This is a bad choice which makes the app annoying for sellers, and disappoints buyers (because if I do get an offer on an item that I’ve already listed at my minimum, I’ll of course decline it). Just WHY EBay???",1
886,"Loyal seller and buyer: I have been selling and buying on eBay for many years now.  It is a great way to save money while you shop for much need merchandise.  Almost everything you could possibly want or need in your life is found on eBay at a great saving.  And, due to me selling as well, there is always a customer looking for something.  My only draw back is customer service.  They need help bad.  And believe me I could go on and on regarding my experience with them.  But, I won’t.  But, I will say this.  The good of buying and selling out-weighs the bad of customer service and that why I have been loyal all these 15+ years.  Motheruno",5
887,"Gets worse over time: Especially bad for sellers looking for a shortcut using the app for seller tools. Was great and easy to use a few weeks ago and now defaults to products with a stock photo that is impossible to remove. Even the advanced listing tool did not have the option to create a custom listing. This shouldn’t be this hard. I have to use my browser instead of the app to get good results. Plus, there is no back button when searching on the app. You can only go back one page. It also does not save settings on the search for each new search. You have to reset filters such as price and buying format with each search. There are plenty of ways EBay can improve this app. Come up with a good seller tool and stop changing it. Why is it so difficult?",2
888,"It Just Never Gets Better: I have not really been a fan of the eBay app since the release of 3.3.4 in December 2014 that totally changed the look and feel. I was forced to stop using the old app in January as it expired. So I have reluctantly been using the newer app though I primarily use the web for purchases. Now with this latest update, I see that searches no longer display the number of items found. Beautiful... Now I have no idea if 10 items or 1000 items were found. I have to keep scrolling down with no idea how far I have to scroll. Is this an improvement? Thankfully the web site still tells me the number of found items so I guess it will be more web site for me.

UPDATE: eBay told me where the count is (now at bottom of screen. It auto hides so I was not seeing it)",2
889,"Ebay to the rescue: I retrieved wood shelving from a friend’s shed that was being torn down. While taking it out of my car, there was a tiny nail that tore a small place on the armrest of my Highlander. Like 1/2” tear. I was distressed about the tear. Took the car to a local marine upholstery business to see if it could be repaired there. A quick look and the gentleman told me it would cost $80. That was at least double what I had counted on paying. He suggested looking on Ebay for the purchase of a whole lid to the armrest . So glad he did!!  Found a brand new lid fir $14!!!!👏👏👏👏. It will arrive in a few days and I am thrilled 😆",5
890,"Cumbersome and limiting options: I find that the app that I have been using for a few months should allow me to edit an item for relist.  I was stuck when I hit edit and found my only option was “delete”.  Then when I selected help and searched for “editing a relisting”. I found nothing.   Way too many repetitive steps to get simple answers.  In this day an age I should be able to do it all on a phone without have to look through a manual or search help screens. It would be good if “edit” is an option that there should be an ! For an information link of how to use the option.    When other apps are able to capture images and list items instantly,  eBay needs a “quick list” feature.",3
891,"Full of errors... that will separate you from your money.: Between errors in eBay software and a flaky app, you will likely have trouble both buying and selling items.  By trouble, I mean you will likely end up without money and your item.  EBay offers very little in terms of seller protection.  I recently attempted to sell a motorcycle and had to deal with a fraudulent buyer that wouldn't pay but demanded I ship the motorcycle.  I lost hundreds in listing and sales fees and still have the bike.  Buying: I recently bought an item that was sent to an incorrect address.  EBay wouldn't let me open a case because the estimated delivery date had not been reached.  Every day, the estimated delivery day slipped another day. When the item was finally delivered back to the shipper, eBay marked it as if it where delivered to me. I have no item and no recourse to do anything about it.",1
892,"No help, customers service.: Overall I’ve had an 80% enjoyable experience with eBay, for the most part everyone I have boughten items (mostly clothes and shoes) have been legit and have had good communication. I’ve been scammed out of a few hundred dollars because there is no help when it comes to eBay’s customer service. So for the people scamming out there there is little to nothing you can do about it because they can delete their eBay account and start a new one before You can report it. All the while it took me months to get a hold of someone on eBay’s customers service and they basically told me there was nothing they could do. Buy at your own risk!",3

It removes the background but no longer lets the seller make adjustments.  Sales have never been the same as pre-updates on the site. Is it due to website issues or people are not buying as before. Maybe both!  Also, I don’t like the promotions eBay offers. I find it is put in a bad place. Sellers tap it accidentally and get charged even if the item doesn’t sell. Done on purpose? Maybe not! It seems a bit underhanded.  Also eBay wants sellers to pay shipping to the shipping site on international sales. Nope, not doing it. I quit doing international sales",3
894,"EBay supports China Illegal Movie Sales: EBay is supporting illegal coping of Netflix and Apple+ movies, but China!
   China ignores the copyright laws and produces movies they stole from the USA.
    If you purchase one you may not even receive it, but yet be billed for it through eBay .      eBay’s refund policy is being voided by the shipper (China) by sending emails to the user stating the release of the movie is being delayed!   This pushes eBays refund policies to exceed their 30 day limit.  Thus they will not get involved when their is an issue!   China goes ahead and processes the billing and puts out a false claim that the movie has been delivered!   Thus getting eBay approval to step out!
    Bad on eBay!   Pure thievery from China!",4

You name it! Thanks Ebay for being my go to place for any and everything a person could want/need. Your service really makes my life a lot easier.

As far as the sellers on the platform, they’ve always been very friendly and helpful whenever I had questions regarding an item. Shipping estimated times are very accurate too. I also sell on the platform, the fees associated with selling are minimal and safe. I will continue to buy and sell with eBay because they have wonderful sellers and customer support. I recommend that you give them a chance too!",5
897,"My Go To For E-Com: Love the platform but the app really needs to sync better with the desktop version. It is frustrating when trying to modify an existing listing and losing a pre-chosen font colors and font features if you’re attempting from your phone. Hopefully in the future the app will match the desktop. I also would like to see the smart pricing feature come back…allowing to reduce a predetermined pricing at every set amount of time. If I’m just managing a handful of listings I don’t mind manually adjusting the pricing but now that I’m managing hundreds of listings, it’s time consuming!",5

Not to mention they took it out 71 days after I had thought it was settled…. so it was a surprise to say the least. I had no clue didn’t get any correspondence other than the day they took the money. Oh and never got the item back either. So im currently in my car crying my eyes out starving with no gas and the best part is I just left my chemotherapy appointment so I feel like death on top of it. Not like I could keep anything down even if I tried but I could definitely use the gas to get home. Which is an over 2 hour drive. Im so heartbroken and completely defeated at this point. Shame on you eBay.",1

Multiple times I have requested for the buyer to send images of the products and many times it’s false images, and yet eBay gives them a refund AND they get to keep the product. That is a felony. I have lost hundreds of dollars because of that. I can’t imagine how many people go through the same thing. eBay provides no insurance or verification that the buyer is telling the truth. I pay monthly for their service and the value of their product worsened. I’m supposed to put 1,000 listings and I cannot surpass 250. I also now have to pay for listings unlike before.

Otherwise it really seems like every other day the app gets a red notification icon that you’ve gotta stumble through three menus to make disappear. Just make it a pop up when you open the app, seriously. I’d have posted this elsewhere but the app doesn’t seem to have an easily navigable “contact us” feature. 

Otherwise the app works fine.",3

When I try to open the app I get a screen message saying I have to update to the latest version of the eBay app. When I try to update it I get a screen message saying that operating system in my iPhone is too old for the new eBay app to work. So it gives me the option to either cancel it download an older version of the eBay app. It won’t download an older version so cancel is my only option. I can’t update the iOS version in my iPhone because I don’t have  WiFi connection so I’m screwed. Been on eBay 21 years and I hate this screwed up impossible update nonsense. From other comments it looks like if I am ever able to update the eBay app I’m not likely to be happy with it.,1

Of course, you do have to wait for the item to arrive, but I’ve rarely had issues with shipments. Usually, whatever I need is something I am not in a hurry to get, so eBay works great for me. There are many items on eBay I can never find in regular stores, so shopping on eBay is fun. Love it!",5
904,"Can’t Sell Similar Items: Ok so I’m cleaning out my closet and I’m selling old coach and Kate spade bags. I’ve sold ONE bag so far and I try to sell others only to be told:

“Buyers have high expectations when purchasing brand name items on the site. To make sure sellers are able to meet these expectations, limits are sometimes placed on sellers' accounts. 
You've reached your limit for the type of item you're trying to list, and you won't be able list any more of these for 30 days. However, you may still list other types of items. These restrictions apply to all sellers, so please don't feel that we're singling you out. 

These restrictions will remain on your account until you’ve received 25 positive selling feedback and completed 90 days as an active seller in good standing.”

Ok soooooo how will I get 25 positive selling feedback if I can’t sell anything? Why do I have to wait a MONTH to sell one item?? Why can’t you sell the same brand more than once? Also what “expectations” are you referring to?? 

This apps is a joke. Don’t waste your time if your trying to sell name brand goods. Just go to DEPOP guys I’ve already sold half of my bags there and they don’t bar you from selling YOUR items. They are great and super easy to use!",1
905,"Mobile app not feature-complete: Cons: Website has much better feature coverage. Can’t create templates, can’t view monthly quota to date in app (I got an official message from eBay and tapped the link, app displays blank page, not a temporary server issue).

Pros: the workflow for “list an item” for a first time user is very good. Being able to create a listing template by searching for your item then tapping a similar one is GREAT and a huge time saver.

Request: as seller, easy way of seeing when listing/revising both #1 historical sales data for item and (currently only avail when first listing) and #2 competitor item data for similar items listed currently on ebay",4
906,"⚠️ATTENTIONS⚠️: I want to help a seller return a item! 
Overall a great app and will get your money back if you get scammed but I am returning a item because a seller listed it incorrectly and I am going through a return progress and the seller would send a return label and you can return the item for free with no shipping cost and they refund your money but in this instance the seller refunded the money quickly to resolve the problem quickly and seller try’s to send a shipping label as well to get their item back but eBay won’t let them because the refund process went through, you should still be able to send the return label even after you send a refund because it implies you trust your buyer with the refund and the item! I WANT TO RETURN THIS PERSONS ITEM ‼️",2
907,"Costumer service is HORRIBLE: I purchased an item for my little brothers birthday off eBay and never received it due to the seller not putting my Apt # on the package. When I try to contact the seller to fix it eBay would not let me do so without creating a brand new account. I could not contact the seller no matter what. When I contacted eBay about this issue they just told me that I am not who I say I am and refused to help me further. I provided my order number. Item ID number, and email address I used to purchase the item as well as my name. They allowed the seller to take my money without me ever receiving an item and allowing me to never have any possible way to contact the seller. Extremely unhappy. I will not be using eBay again. This was the first and only time I will buy something from there.",1
908,"Ebay continues to streamline the Ebay App!!👍: Excellent way to not only buy, but easily sell on Ebay. Ebay is always finding new ways to upgrade & streamline the Ebay App for sellers. Making it easier than ever to create  listings with alot of pre-filled description specifics if needed. Or just change a few to fit your specific item. Easily sell trading cards like Pokémon by taking a photo of your card and it automatically prefixes the card details. Quickly create your listing with drop down item specifics, then just take a couple photos and list.
Thanks Ebay",5
909,"The Worst: Every time they “improve” this app, it gets worse. The latest glitch is when trying to use checkout after committing to buy something. Sometimes you get a message that says “we recognize you on this device.” If that’s the case, your PayPal information isn’t needed. But if you’re required to enter your email address, YOU CAN’T BECAUSE THE KEYBOARD DOESN'T APPEAR. After closing the app and reopening it 5 times to pay for something with my iPad, I finally gave up and used my desktop computer to pay for the item. It’s amazing that the people who author this software are able to screw it up so badly. Do they EVER check their work? Apparently not. I guess we’ll have to wait for the next release, and hope they realize what they screwed up with this one. The incompetence here is remarkable.",1
910,"Over a year shopping on EBay.: I’ve only had one seriously Bad buying experience on EBay in the last 14 months.  I wouldn’t suggest buying ($12,000 paperweight) Heavy Equipment before you see & test what your buying.

I will continue making purchases, as needs require and I have referred many friends & Family to look & Buy on EBay.   Sincerely, Jacque March in Placerville California",5
911,Sellers beware eBay sides with scamming buyers!: eBay is ok with not just fraud but charges you a fee if a fraudster wins a dispute against you even after the case is closed and eBay pays you out 2 weeks before they send you a decision email. This is the absolute worst experience I’ve ever had with any selling site. Avoid eBay at all costs (literally and figuratively). The app is bad enough but eBay as a whole is just a terrible experience as a seller and sometimes buyer. They basically have made moves to alienate their sellers not just with increasing fees or new fees but now by siding with most buyers that outright lie about purchases. There is no real “help” especially if you are desperate to speak to a person. They just offload all problems to their “community” or website to maybe find some articles that do not address the root issues.,1
912,"Latest update breaks key feature: With the latest update you can no longer copy an auction identification number. EBay keeps screwing with presenting auction identification number. In the more recent past you didn’t see it at all unless you expanded the auction info section. Then they displayed the auction number but you couldn’t select it to copy because it was just linked to the additional auction info (where auction number was displayed again, but you could select and copy it).  That latter approach no longer works.

If you use a bidding service this is a major nuisance.  You can’t just go to  eBay via Safari either because if eBay sees you have eBay app installed it forces you to use it when drilling down  into auction details.

You can use Firefox or Chrome to work around this limitation.",1
913,"Good but should be fair to sellers: I love eBay but I'm really getting bummed at how much eBay is taking out of sales anymore and if you use the USPS service, the company really had no excuse for including the shipping with the totals anymore! I think it's a way for them to take more and that's it at this point. If a seller proves they delivered through USPS and the price of postage was accurate, then it would be fairer. Charging sellers this way when USPS charges so much is making it almost pointless to sell on here anymore. It's not fair to the small sellers especially because we pay more for supplies and always ends up having to provide offers to make sales anyways. I just don't get how is profitable anymore.",3
914,"Return at item: I bought some corvette parts at eBay, the following day my house burned down along with my corvette. I tried to cancel order but when I hit the cancel order page, it came up as a technical error on ebays site. It continued like that for days till my order came to me. I then tried to return it, the same message came up on the eBay site…. Technical error.. try again later… that continued for another week… after dealing with insurance companies for my home fire , living in a hotel for a bit , I tried to return again…. Now it’s too late…. I tried to contact eBay…. Big hassle…. I finally did and they said to contact company that sold parts to me…. I contacted company , company said contact EBay…..  more hassles than I can deal with right now…. I’m out $800…. BEWARE!!!!   EBAY HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!",1
915,"eBay is great!: I've been a eBay buyer for quite some time. Honestly ok n my own personal opinion. I enjoy buying items on this application and I will continue to do so. eBay has everything and anything that I might need when ever I need it. Fair prices, good quality whereyou can review feedbacks and discription of a item and decided for your self, if you want to buy from the seller or not.  Over all eBay has your back when thiingscant be worked out with the seller and the mediate with the seller and step in. eBay's buyer protections is what kept me activity buying and feeling safe doing so. Thanks enay! Keep up the great work!",5
916,"Decent Interpretation: This app does a decent job at giving you what the desktop version of eBay offers. The messaging area of the app is more or less a wrapper around the desktop messaging system and could leave a bit more to be desired (especially the character limit differing here than on the desktop). Also, viewing an item page it’s not super obvious who the seller is and you end up scrolling around a bit looking for this information which is generally found sandwiched between sponsored listings. All in all a solid 3 stars.",5
917,"eBay is out for money not you: eBay allows sellers you have a long track record of negative feedback for taking money from buyers and not shipping or responding to buyers. eNay response is it not there problem and items are not money back guaranteed so if you buy something and don’t get it it not their problem but eBay will allow that user to sell more. This is a cop out and a poor excuse to not be responsible. Buy items else where from other websites that actually look out for buyers who are in the end the ones keeping you in business. eBay can shove their policies. Keep collecting money from commissions and auction sales. eBay is as much of a thief as the sellers who take money and not provide the items being “sold”. SHAME ON YOU eBay. Probably going to get banned but no worries, I’m not using eFake anymore.",1
918,"eBay user since 2002: This app is fine but could be better. When I’m searching for something and I set filters like item location = US it would be great to not have this default back to zero filters when I add a search term. Even better would be the option to set item location permanently- I never want to deal with international orders. I would also like to be able to filter by seller rating - I’m not buying from someone with a lot of recent negative feedback and it wastes my time having to manually look through seller ratings. Also it would be great to hide results from sellers/listings I’m not interested in. Craigslist has this feature as well as ability to hide duplicate listings. It wastes a lot of time looking at the same ads / search results, and hiding the items/sellers I’m not interested in would be a time saver.",1
919,"Sellers beware: Not good for sellers at all. For starters, I can’t even call their customer service or send an e-mail or anything. I had a customer purchase my items, but there was no shipping address from the customer. To top it off, the money never came. The buyer contacted me today asking me if I was going to ship the item. I’m not sending out ANYTHING until I get paid for the items first. Come to find out, there’s a hold on the money for a month. That’s ridiculous. I am not sending my iPad Pro to this customer without getting paid for it first that’s way too much money for me to risk.  On top of that, eBay is going to charge me and so is PayPal. I tried cancelling the order but the customer is refusing to cancel, and I can’t get hold of their customer service to stop the transaction. This is more of a headache then it’s worth, and I will NEVER use eBay again.",1
920,"Funds hold debacle: It would be great if eBay would send a message in the app explaining that funds from a sale are being placed on hold. Kept checking PayPal’s mobile app and it just showed “pending” for 5 days. Finally went to PayPal’s direct website to see the “hold”. This has caused a delay in shipping the item and will possibly get me bad feedback. I clearly selected “will ship in 3 days of cleared payment” when building listing. Common sense question...why would I ship if payment showed “pending”? Spent many $1,000s of dollars on eBay with 100% positive and I’m very frustrated over this. Customer service was useless over this issue.",5
921,"Vexing advertisement: Honestly the worst part of this app is the absolutely obnoxious aspca ad. I’m sorry, but there are way bigger problems and issues. The fact that I can’t get rid of the frustrating ad and I can’t change it to a different charity that I would actually consider donating to, is a repeated annoyance, which actually causes me to avoid the app and eBay unless I’m looking for something specific. I would never open the app to just browse for something. When I come across the ad, I’m most likely going to close the app and look elsewhere.
Besides that, I overall like the app. It’s easy to use, and I like that you can sort by price while keeping the search mostly relevant. Because of the ad, it’s just not likely to be the first place I would look to buy something.",2
922,"The way to Do business: I have been a Ebay purchaser for several years now, and I have come to the conclusion that Ebay sellers are the best business people out of all the web site applications ! I am not a seller on EBay only because I don’t want to disappoint the buyers on EBay ! I am sure they have and expect  the same high expectation as I do. But I have bought hundreds of items from EBay and received high quality items for fair or even cheap prices. The sellers are very professional and I extremely appreciate their professionalism and honesty when dealing in a business transaction !
Thank you Ebayers ! 
Keep Rocking !",5
923,"App Problems: The app works pretty well and there are few things I dislike about it. However, I’ve noticed a problem that hasn’t been fixed with the last updates. An item will show free shipping or the shipping rate changes when you open a page to see an item. It’s annoying as I spend time looking at things out of my price range and suggested item prices are inaccurate. I’d also like to see a setting to keep location the same as opposed to changing it for every search, and recommended items for the size I’m shopping for, not several sizes larger or smaller.",5
924,"App update has issues: Be careful if you are a seller, the app will apply recommended shipping settings unless it’s the last thing you alter. EVERY single listing I put in my own shipping settings, then changed payment settings, and it would automatically delete the shipping settings I previously entered. Make sure shipping is the last thing you alter before you list!

Even besides this issue I’m really not impressed with the new app. From a sellers perspective the sub menus when creating a listing add too much time and make it slower compared to the previous version. Photos from 16 of my relisted items have been deleted, all except the thumbnail. You are missing simple options such as charging sales tax. The camera within the app now defaults to auto flash every time. Also getting notifications for items I haven’t been watching.",1
925,"Fake buyer problem: I have had the worst experience the past 9mo with fake buyers.  The buy the item at full price and don’t pay.  Then the fake buyer uses a loophole in the system to say that you have been unresponsive to the buyers messages, which release your contact info(phone number) to the fake buyer.  Then the buyer reaches out to you via text.  Saying there is an issue with PayPal, that they need your PayPal info to send you an invoice, fishing for your info.  Then I report the buyer to eBay, after some time the sale will be canceled and I will have to relist the item. This may happen 3-5 time on a single item.  The issue is compounded by the sale still showing up in your total monthly amount.  I have had eBay tons of eBay fees on items I didn’t actually take payment on.  So I end up having to call eBay to fix my account each time.",1
926,"Such a great app!: The app is really great and useful coming from a sellers perspective. If any customers have any questions or concerns I can easily communicate with them quickly. The only thing that needs impediment is having access to pending cases for returns or other issues with items sold.

At this time if I’m alerted about a new case the app will not allow me to view it. The app itself  also does not allow me to see a list of pending cases. This forces me to have to use my desktop which causes delays and often leads to me forgetting about pending issues. It would be great the app would be enhanced to fix this issue",5
927,Overall great app!: eBay is a must use for any starter seller or even a veteran seller. It’s also friendly and easy to use for buyers as well. I’ve been using it since 2008 initially and I’ve never been disappointed whether I was a seller or a buyer. If you ever have any skepticism definitely give it a try and look at Feedback so you can have reassurance that the item that you’re buying is from someone who’s honest and compliant with the website. I can’t say enough great things about this website it’s definitely worth a go you won’t be disappointed.,5
928,"Full of glitches.: The app isn’t doing so well with the new iOS update - not from a seller’s perspective. Whilst listing, it will routinely lose your description after you’ve written it. When you press continue to post your listing, an error message pops up and says, “must have description” - no matter how many times you try. The app will then freeze and crash. It’s really frustrating. Second issue is uploading photos. You will upload and the images will not be there. I’ve tried deleting the app and starting fresh to no avail. The situation isn’t helped by their less than stellar mobile site, which is almost sparse compared to the information available and usability on their desktop site. Everything is mobile now. It’s time for a real and fresh update.",2
929,"horrible for sellers: eBay is the worst app to use for sellers. They let people get away with scamming you so not only do they get to keep your product, but you have to refund them too. My husband sells car parts pretty frequently on here and no longer will be due to consistent scams that eBay does nothing to stop or help. He sent out perfectly good pistons & rods for an LS7 and the buyer claimed they were damaged and returned them. When we received the package back, not only were they dirty and broken, but they had completely different factory markings and were not the original rods. He tried to dispute and showed pictures that they were something completely different, but eBay sided with the “buyer”. He lost 2 perfectly good parts and his money. eBay is only good for the buyer. I do not recommend selling on here.",1
930,"Horrible: Sellers nightmare.. auctions normally require immediate payment from the buyer. Not here. The buyer can delay with no contact whatsoever for up to four days, ending up not even paying in the end. Once your item is sold, if sold, expect your eBay fee to be instantly taken out of the proceeds because of course they want their money now, but your money they hold and make more money in interest for random sometimes (frequently delays of an additional 4 days beyond when the package is marked delivered to issue the funds, just to “ensure the buyer has no issues” when obviously there is a financial incentive to eBay holding funds. I highly recommend against using EBay for any reason no matter what the reason. There are many other platforms that don’t take 13+% and delay delay delay on every end.",1
931,"eBay Sales Etc: Usually Ebay picks up after the summer in September this year it did not happen in 2023 my sales on eBay have gone down 75%. I’m not doing anything different. My prices are always lower than most people selling like items I have called customer service which is always very good. Nobody seems to have a reason I feel that they’re not doing the advertising they were in the past, also other people were probably selling on other venues because of the fees I’ve been a seller since 1997.

I never canceled an order or disputed after when he bid, and they suspended my account indefinitely after contacting the health team, they were unable to help me saying they could not give reason to why I was banned. I spoke on the phone with help, and they basically said they did not want someone like me using their app after reviewing my profile, and could not give reason why, as I might use it to use loopholes in their system this is easily the worst experience I’ve had on an app and with the customer service base, I’m not one to usually leave a review, but is outrageous that they could not give me a reason or any explanation as to why I was banned",1
933,Incorrectly charging sales tax on us coins: I have been in contact with eBay multiple times now through chat and phone calIs. I buy numismatic US coins and live in Florida . In Florida we do not pay taxes on US coins (ONLY bullion as in .999 silver or gold) . Every time I speak with an eBay representative they tell me I will be issued a refund for all my incorrectly charged sales taxes to look out for an email within a few days . Not once have I heard anything back . All I want is for the right thing to be done and fixed for that matter . It still tries to charge me tax as I checkout . Please help !,5
934,Good for buyer not so much seller: I find eBay more enjoyable to transact as a buyer. The seller cannot give bad review to a buyer even if they’re unreasonable and don’t even read listing.  Buyers meanwhile can tarnish one’s ratings and say what they want.  Also sellers are charged fee on shipping which is ridiculous.  The fees are high and went up to about 15% from 10% on sales when you changed method of payment from PayPal to directly from bank- even though you mentioned sometimes they’ll go up or stay the same.  That was a lie. This along with the government mandating to declare and be taxed on sales over $600 a year I’ll surely be giving my stuff away on eBay- if not losing money. Better to sell locally.,3
935,"App - search multiple qty only/ trading cards filter: Hi. I was wondering if the advanced search ability on desktop can be made available on the app, such as multiple listing or minimum quantity to buy per seller.

Another thing is on big orders on up to 40 items no emails or shipping notifications emails are sent. Because of this I have had issues when clicking on the order and the page being blank, thus giving me now available details.",3
936,"Very annoying: Hi, same person with the notifications not going away and the app still telling me that listings are paid for and I need to ship them, but I already did.

Problem is persistent and I can get rid of the notifications by swiping left on each one under the Notifications tab, but while responding to eBay response team I get hit with a survey. That survey erased everything I was responding with. On top of that, while responding to the response team I keep getting hit with HTML errors and cannot post my response, and I have to “preview” my response and then am able to post it.

This entire update is just annoying me. And I know what I am talking about is directing me to the website but it annoys me further that forums and responses (even eBay responses) are on the website and outside of an app. C’mon. 

Even with all of that the new shipping page where you choose the label you want is just super drawn out and you have to scroll the entire page to look at shipping methods and prices. I like how it’s in numerical order, priced lowest to highest, but do you really think I’m shipping a 2lb item in a legal flat rate envelope?? C’mon.",2
937,"Best website ever: I love to shop from EBay bc I have 3 kids and I don’t have enough time to go to shopping so eBay makes my life a lot easier and beside their is some times things you can not find them in stores.

To me it’s is the safest website ever because I have used many other websites and many time I never got the items nor my refunds.  I highly recommend to everyone! Thank you eBay for making my life easier.",5
938,The App Simply Doesn't Work: The App has issues and addressing them to anyone who cares is useless time! There's no menu on ebay itself to report an issue with App with certain platforms. I can't delete any through the App using ios system. I've tried and tried to delete a item from the Notifications and Watch listing and it doesn't do anything to remove unnecessary items no longer wanted or active by the sellers.

940,Like the app but not the long updates during day: I list trading cards on the app and I could not access the shipping option for trading cards during the day starting today.  Is it possible to do smaller updates during the overnights when not as many people are listing.  The online site works but I think the app is way easier.  Overall I really like the app just wish some of the updates didn’t occur for extended periods of time during the day.  I also understand that some of the update times are unavoidable.

In that same time I’ve had my data breached on at least 6 separate occasions, from Target to Sony and everything between.  B/c I limit my online exposure to a single CC number it has required one call to clear up any issues.  This new policy opens a whole new Avenue to lose my personal data and at this point I’m out.

I wish the prices for selling were more affordable and they didn’t take a large percentage of the sale, mind you taxes are also tact on to the purchase on the buyer’s end. Aside from that, customer service and the app works great, thank you!",5
944,"Good service, good app, bad users: I’ve been using eBay for over a decade and have bought/sold many things here. The app itself is wonderful and makes the auction experience very easy. Besides the old days when PayPal would lock your account for no reason, it’s smooth. 

The one bad thing that has changed in the last few years is the numbers of buyers who scam, refuse to pay, or completely ghost you after winning an auction. It’s staggering—I’ve had to relist about half my auctions bc of deadbeat buyers. Yet eBay won’t do anything about them.

You don’t get to change your mind after winning an auction at Christie’s, so why should you on eBay without a very good reason?",4

I honestly give up on shopping eBay for a lot of things because I can’t be given a link to a list or anything. Nobody’s got time to send 50 links of their holiday wishlist items lol.

Sixty percent of the time I get lucky and find the items cheaper than advertised on sale in the store. Some sellers even offer discounts. I have favorited my favorite seller so eBay lets me know exactly when she gets in new merchandise and when she’s having a sale. I never pay full price on my favorite designer anymore. Shipping is typically free or really cheap and the merchandise is quality goods that arrive with speed. Thanks eBay!",5
947,"Easy to use with iPad or iPhone: As a seller it is nice to have an easy way to post auctions.
This app allows me to use my phone or iPad and post an auction. Because iPhones are so small, and iPads are a tad more cumbersome than a laptop with text, I like to post pictures, a small amount of the description, and form details, then save it to finish it on the laptop for fine-tuning.

Overall I don’t have any complaints.  Some detailed parts of my accounts are easier to access on my laptop, but this is actually an app you can use from start to finish if desired.",5

I have also successfully enjoyed selling and hope to become more involved on the selling side.  In addition, I have met many great people, buyers and sellers alike, on this platform. I highly recommend ebay and hope to continue to build relationships and my own business!",5
949,"Not as useful as expected: This app is so so.  Not as useful as I would expect from a company like eBay.  I feel a seller should be able to do everything needed to function remotely while away from their office especially for those of us who have very portable inventory and can travel with it.  Example, when a buyer wants to buy multiple items and shipping is negotiated to combined or free, its only possible while signing in on line and hoping the browser is up to date. Its during these events when we discover the browser is NOT up to date but we don't have our passwords with us.",5

951,"Great items and great purchases: I’ve only had one issue with eBay and I’ve been using it for years and the sellers want great reviews and they get exactly what they deserve and one I did have a problem with I did not change the review because I never got a refund and I asked for one since it was not the item I needed and they said they would give me 5 bucks refund and the item was 15 so I said no and offered to send the item back, but nothing good came out of it so I left it like that but over all ebay is a great place to buy new and used things from I still order today!! Thanks ebay",5
952,Very Unhappy: I recently had the worst experience buying on ebay. I believed until now that buying here was more than safe and reliable and that my money was protected. For days I have tried in any way to return an item that I bought which was broken and the seller deceived me completely and now I see that I lost my money. and ebay does not do anything to protect me. I think I do not deserve this. I can not do anything or defend myself because I do not know who sold me that article. all this that I pass I will keep in mind for a future and I will think about the possibility of buying again on ebay. Thanks,5
953,Forces sellers to accept offers: I have been an eBay member since 2001. My family since 1998. I can’t use the app to post or edit listings anymore as it forces you to accept offers. Even if you turn off accept offers while listing in the app eBay will eventually turn it back on without you knowing until they do it. It surprises sellers and disappoints buyers when eBay does this as nobody who has it turned off is going to accept offers when eBay invariably turns on offers automatically. There is no option to prevent this from happening and a very disingenuous move. Posting and editing via website is the only way to go now. eBay needs to stop acting like they are God and more like a marketplace. Two stars instead of one because otherwise the app works well.,2
954,"Doesn’t care about its customers!: I have complained three times to the Ask eBay twitter page about the stupid site changing my offer settings without my permission. When I list something on eBay, I’m trying to make a profit, so I set the price where I want it to be. I don’t need some automated bull crap changing my settings because it thinks it knows better than I do. So after a week or two of my items being listed, I’ll get an email that those items can now accept offers. And now it’s my job to go through ALL of those listings individually and turn off this setting. It’s stupid. I’m so over it. I’ve had more luck selling my stuff on a competing app anyway, so I’m just about to leave eBay behind and sell on there instead. There. Maybe a one star review everyone can see will finally get something going in the right direction.",1
955,"Great app, but slight issue: I only use my phone and this app has been incredible for me for buying AND selling.  Everything is easy to access and navigate. My saved searches are all listed and I get regular updates on newly listed items. 

However, when I view new listings in my saved searches, if there are several listings in the search it will keep repeating the same set of listings endlessly on the screen. For example, if there are 20 search results in a saved search it will keep display that group of 20 listings over and over again and never stop.  Please address this issue.

Thanks!",5
956,"Not Compatible With Some iPhone Xs: Tried to bid on an item I had been watching all week.. the app did not work with my iPhone X.  Later bid on something else with an iPhone 6 and it worked fine.  App needs to be updated so that it fully functions with all softwares.. very disappointed.

App also had problems with listing items for sale.  The app would glitch when it got to the “shipping” section, though that should have been fixed recently..

THEN I just found out they automatically changes some of my listings to “accept best offers”.  Wasted my time having to change them back to “no offers”.  Unbelievable.  “Try to help me sell?” How about just mind your own business? I’m not in a rush to sell my items.  Please do not interfere with my sales; you guys are already getting a huge cut of my profit when my items sell..!",1
957,The app is great: eBay is a different experience these days then it used to be. A lot of noobs that don’t want to pay for their items and there’s been a shift to buyer protection over everything. Which is annoying. But this review is for the app which works very well and does what I expect of it without trouble. I can list certain low cost items quickly and as easily as if I were posting to craigslist or let go. I can make a quick purchase of a item like a Windows license while I’m out and working on someone else’s computer. It’s nice to have the eBay marketplace in the palm of your hand.,5
958,"Declining quality: I have used Ebay for a long time. The quality is declining. The help section references options and services that no longer exist to resolve some pretty big issues like being scammed or accidentally offering an extremely large offer due to a misplaced 0.

At one point if you had a dispute with a seller it was easy to request that ebay help mediate the issue and the issue would usually be quickly resolved. The instructions still exist in the help section, but when someone sent me celery seeds instead of orchid seeds and they kept refusing to pay return shipping, the function no longer existed.",4
959,"No Customer Service: Fraudulent listings allowed to stay on their site.
Inform them and they do nothing .

One informs them that a listing has conflicting size information and they do absolutely nothing about it. The header states one size. The picture shows another size . The description shows one and the about this items show a different one! Which one is it! Why don’t you care!!! eBay has become terrible. They allow fakes and counterfeits from foreign countries but go after the little person. Just try to actually get a complaint acted upon. Search feature is ridiculous. Ask for a specific thing and different stuff comes up. Ended items not in order. Search comes up empty but then days later you come across a seller that has the name in what one searched for.",1
960,"Disappointed with eBay customer service policy’s: I’m a customer from eBay for over a decade and never had any major issues. This year we desperately try to acquire Personal protection stuff for our employees, ending up with many undelivered orders by bad vendors, this is terrible as qe have to stress ourselves to fix problems with them by ourselves.
Finally lalety we purchase something froma vendor who shipped the item which weren’t delivered to us by the horrible service bu USPS, who did reported it as delivered. I contacted the vendor who even try to help me, I’ve also opened a case with eBay to report that who then canceled the case and refused to communicate with me despite all
My efforts to do so. This is disrespectful, illegal, unfair and unethical from a company that size. Shamefully eBay shielded my account stopping me of contacting them. 
USPS became the worst option to ship anything anywhere and the care less.

eBay coverups with them is a perfect combination of opportunism and rip-off on customer like myself.

Sincerely.
Eliézer santos.",5
961,"Broken buttons using Voiceover: I am totally blind and I have been an eBay member since 2011. I have had no trouble with the app up until now. In the area on the sellers page where you can “submit an offer“, I am having some trouble. I can click on the submit offer button, enter my amount, but after that, I can’t confirm my amount and move on. There are three unlabeled buttons at the bottom of the screen under the number pad. Voiceover simply calls them all “button“. I have no idea what they are, and even when I tap on them, they do absolutely nothing. This needs to be fixed.
Thank you.",4
962,"App update ruined selling on the app: I used to use eBay to sell things and it was simple and easy. I didn’t have to go on a computer for any reason, I could even get the label straight from my phone and just email me the label to print out later since I don’t have a printer at home. Now the app MAKES you go to the desktop to even purchase the shipping label so you have no choice but to use a computer for everything now, making listing and selling on the app pointless. It has caused me grievances with buyers because I had no way to print a shipping label with no access to a computer from home since I used my phone for everything. It is anti seller and anti consumer and makes zero sense to make this change. Won’t be selling on the eBay app any longer until it is reversed.",1
963,"Excessive fees, taxes: The app is easy to use. Howeverwhen eBay   announced their compliance this year (2022) with the IRS request to report SSN’s selling cumulative amounts greater than $600 for the year, I pulled all items from my store, and I hope others do the same. That’s why I’m writing this. Our government isn’t content with taxing just all our purchases and even our property, but also every resale. This excessive taxation is wrong, intrusive, and un-American. eBay should’ve fought it,  and at least notified its sellers beforehand. Fees are already steep on here, but now I get surprised with a penalty for having successful sales. The sales tax on annual sales higher than $600 is just one fee too many on eBay. You’re charged over 10% on most items you sell already, and their fees are just too high. I’m done selling on their market.",1
964,"Absolutely No seller protection!: You will eventually get scammed by a buyer and even though you have proof and argue with eBays robot customer service you’ll lose your product and money’s! Sell local and take cash you will be glad you did. HORRIBLE COMPANY NOW! I lost $1,000 from a buyer return that was closed in my favor and was told absolutely no refund would be given by me, as well as proof given to me stating this! eBay then went into my PayPal and yanked 1k out of it! When I confronted them they admitted the customer service in appeals made a mistake but they unfortunately can’t help get me money back because the “SYSTEM” won’t let them. Nice way to treat a decade long top rated seller! SEEYA SCAMBAY! Hope that platform dies a slow miserable death! PayPal is the second lousiest company next to ebay so beware the practices on that site as well.",1
965,"Bring back regular eBay bucks: I miss when eBay used to have eBay bucks on every purchase.  It set them above their competitors. Without that, there’s not much need to shop on here compared to the guys with the smile on their boxes. I tend to shop less with eBay now, and my store on eBay has suffered as well. I have much less traffic than I did before.  I only gave the app 3 stars because it is still a good place to find old collectibles. Each time I review and there’s still no eBay bucks, my rating will go down. Stop being cheap eBay. You make, what, billions of dollars?  I think you can spare the 1% back on a regular basis.",4
966,"The best place to sell sneakers: eBay has really come around. Ever since eBay introduced their Authenticity Guaranteed, this has been my preferred place to sell sneakers. Also, receiving payouts from eBay as opposed to PayPal is a game changer. This app is very convenient to get things done. My only complaint is the fact that i’m unable to upload pictures using my iPhone. The eBay app doesn’t accept heic format photos, it only accepts jpg. That’s a huge problem since I’m unable to list items directly from my phone. I have to convert pictures on my laptop and that takes time. Please fix this issue and you’ll have a perfect app.",4
967,"Thanks: I’ve been using eBay for about 8 months and didn’t really have a problem until, I bought a the wrong variation of plant, I asked the seller to request a return because it said the seller would not be using eBay until august 4th so I assumed I could request to cancel the order but no, the seller without even saying anything to me, declines the request and ships it on July 29th. But it gets better. It was expected to come between august 17th and September 2nd. Well it never came, so I request that the item never came, but oh no, apparently you can only file ONE request per item, I tried getting with contact with customer support but they couldn’t do anything because I already filed a return request THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR OVER A MONTH. Now there’s 160 dollars less in my account and no plant :).",1
968,"Can’t report bugs in-app: ...so I’ll have to report it here. This recent version has a bug where, after going through the post-win PayPal paying process, subsequent opening of the item page says I’m committed to buy and still need to pay. If I tap the pay-now button it says something’s gone wrong (indeed so; I’ve already paid), but I’m seeing this happen frequently, across multiple items.

(Also, the UI really needs work. Being able to parse at a glance the item page is hard, I always have to really scour the small print to find important data like the description of the item, which is well hidden, or the seller’s credentials. Also why isn’t there a button on that page to directly ask the seller a question about the item?)",2
969,"Lou: Would be great if the app allowed you to zoom in on all the listings. It would make it much  easier to see all the listings on the phone. Presently,  I have to click on each listing just to get a decent look at the photo and description.  If I were able to zoom in on all the listings on the page, I would be able to go through them faster and more efficiently.  I have even found myself taking screenshots at times. Just to be able to zoom in on listings. The lack of a zoom feature makes me prefer to just wait until I get home, instead of using the app.",5
970,Tired of forced updates: I'm sick and tired of forced updates. Not everyone can afford the newest fanciest phone with up to date iOS etc. I did so much shopping and some selling on eBay just to try and open it for some Christmas shopping and I get an invalid request prompt that after research the fix is to update iOS (which I don't have the space for) all of my watched Christmas list is gone. There's no way you can make me believe that with today's technology you can't make things optional to your users instead of forcing updates that make the app inoperable for some. Ridiculous.,5
971,Love eBay: I love eBay! I have easily sold many items. I have bought 100 times more. Now my wife is hooked and uses it more than me. We can always find what we are looking for and at a fraction of the cost sourcing it locally and in most cases direct from the manufacturer. Checking out eBay is part of a daily routine in our house. Only suggestion is when making purchases pick the seller with the most positive feedback. They are always willing to correct any issues you might have with your purchase. Always contact them first for a resolution. Keep up the great work on the App and website!,5
972,"Ebay woes: If you are a new seller or an old one that someone wrongfully opens a case against or even inquiry into tracking numbers not yet posted(less than 48 hrs after sale), they will place a hold on your money up to 21 days.  This is unacceptable.  They have gotten so chicken ship that it is skewed to the buyer whether they are right or wrong. In short, buy here, but beware selling here.  But down the road you won’t be able to buy much here once sellers get reamed a few times.  Used to not be this way.  Items are flagged for new policy violations, without the ebay rep understanding their own rules.  Frustrating as a seller.  Great platform to sell due to its far reaching audience , and the only reason many of us small timers still bother.",3
973,wonderful site to make money and sell your extra stuff: I’ve been selling on eBay for years and it’s been a great way to make extra income.  I used to go to garage sales and buy vintage stuff that I knew was worth more an sell it on eBay.  I’ve bought video games and vintage DVDs from stores and sold them on eBay especially if you expect a shortage for Christmas.  This is a great way to clear out the stuff you no longer want and make a little extra income.  It is also possible to make a full time business with it if you put in the time.,5
974,No protection for seller: I’ve sold a couple of things from ebay usually with some irritation because of the holding of my money and their extensive need to make a the buyers content. I recently was told im having a product be returned because the buyer claimed their product was defective for being “dirty”. me telling him his laptop isnt defective for being dirty. he goes to make up a bunch of issues for the laptop without providing any proof and ebay offers him a refund taking his word over the evidence. this bid started at $1 and he went on to bid over $400 without a card on file or even the money on him at that time. this takes away from REAL buyers and is sad for both me as a seller and for anyone that missed out. i do not plan to auction or sell anything else on this app as they wont even reply to me.,1
975,My Ebay Affair: I've been an eBay shopper for over 20 years. When I children were younger I bought quite a lot of clothes for them off of eBay as well as for myself and my husband. No we're not as financially stable as we once were but when I do need anything eBay is the first retail type of outlet that I go to online. I can always find what I need in a price range that I can afford. In all my shopping I've only had difficulty with one seller and eBay took care of that immediately. I will continue to shop on eBay and look forward to doing so.,5
976,"Need improvement: 8/1/24 - Please get rid of the “frequently bought together” sponsored items under the purchased tab. It’s already annoying enough to be scrolling through the purchased tab seeing endless duplicate purchased items on the list.

Update- thank you for getting rid of the sponsor ads under the purchased tab. The duplicate purchased item seems to be fixed. I wish there’s a way to check the bid details on the mobile version. The most clicked Shopping selections are “watchlist, purchases, and bid/offer” I wish there’s a way to move it all the way up.",4
977,Bug In The New System: The updated eBay App within the Apple App Store recently failed to operate properly on my older model Apple iPad Air though it did work properly on my new iPhone 12.  The Apple App Store disclosures indicated the eBay App would operate properly on an Apple product running the iOS system 11.0 or higher.  My Apple iPad Air was running iOS system 12.4.5 but still would not load.  I spent 4 hours on the phone with Apple Support reloading the operating system on my Apple iPad Air to discover the actual operating problem was an apparent bug with the updated eBay App! 😫,5
978,eBay is never like before: Ebay become a place for scammers to screw people and eBay only care about who can bring them money. I have been selling eBay since 2012 got screwed over 5 times lost $500 and they stop letting me sell because I’m not selling enough due to Buyers open too many claim for refund. How’s that supposed to be my fault that eBay can stop the scammers and let the seller take the lost. When I open another account to seller they restrict it the next day but they can’t even watch out the people why intend to steal and say item do not match or never received the item to get their money back and keep the item. eBay is the one who benefits to people buy and sell. But they screwed the sellers and the scammers still out there and eBay can’t even catch it. Shame on eBay!!!,1
979,"Time management: Time is money and saving a hundred dollars on an item is not a real savings if it takes too long to find and procure that item. With the proliferation of online shopping options and the shear volume of items being offered for sale in some categories, well designed search and sorting options are the key to quickly determining whether a site has the product you need at a good value. Ebay needs to continue refining their search and sorting parameters in their app to optimize an efficient customer experience.",5
980,"Vendors: I’m disappointed that eBay allows vendors who don’t deliver their bid items to continue to be listed. These companies that are overseas don’t deliver their items until well after 30 days which is outside of what eBay says is there a guarantee. So even allowing these vendors to trade on their site violates eBay’s policies. I recently had vendor refused to send me the item I purchased and it has been 10 months and eBay will do nothing! When these vendors are purposely collecting money and not delivering items and eBay does nothing, that’s just stealing on both parties.",5
981,"Do. Not. Sell. Here.: I have been with eBay since 2014. I used to love this app, I bought my first record player here and many other items through these years of dedication to the app. But now I hate it and will never use the app again. 

Sellers beware! You will be able to sell your i teams and get money but DO NOT expect to have your money in your PayPal account in any sort of timely manner. They will put your money on hold for weeks no matter what your account rating is, no matter how much positive feed back you have. They will hoard your money and not give up a single penny

I have sold many items on this platform. I have never had a single complaint and now they are hold my money. Money that I need. When I spoke to the customer service reps they yelled at me 

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE YELLED. AT. ME. EBAY ARE YOU READING THIS??? THE PEOPLE YOU EMPLOYE YELLED AT ME BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO FEED MY FAMILY AND GOT FRUSTRATED.

982,"Making it better: LOVE ebay, and the app has definitely improved over the years, (should be at least a 4 star), however, recently, with recent updates, it is taking MUCH longer to bring up the pages and I am unable to delete items I’ve made an offer on, and was declined, but as long as the owner continues to post the item, it stays on my “Bid Page” eternally!  There is no way to delete it, even though I was declined, and may have even bought the item from someone else, it stays on there until the seller actually sells the item.  This is very annoying.",5
983,"Errors: There are so many constant errors in the listing database.
That causes frictions with buyers.
When we call the help desk, 50% of the time we have unfriendly eBay team mates, not very competent, long wait time. 
The recent update of the app forces me now to go to the computer for each listing; ie missing “store category”.
eBay has a lot of work to do to become a world class company. I would start with the culture. When I call the help desk, I feel like those employees hate me, talk down to me and most of the time are unable to resolve any issue. 
There are too many “don’t” show a lack of trust in the buyers. It sends the message that eBay is very worries that we are all cheater. I have way better priorities than to
cheat eBay.  For example the constant reminder that messages are monitored and reprecautions taken again make me feel like  I am dishonest.
I hope that somebody at eBay monitors the eBay Facebook forums.
We love to sell on eBay, love our buyers, our products. We just don’t like the way the eBay staff treats us.
I would love to get an answer.",4
984,"Great app, not seller friendly for on-the-go: I loved the fact that I could list items on the go when I was away from my laptop. With the new app update, I'm having a hard time listing my items. For instance, I can no longer customize the duration of a listing, I can't add condition comments, and I can't customize fixed price options. I work over a full time week, so the app was very helpful as I could use it in-between breaks. Now, I have to wait until I get home to do anything selling related on eBay. I don't like the new quick listing. Ebay has already tried this before...I’m so sick of them trying to force me to stick with their customization. It seems like they’re telling users, “We [ebay] will give you [user] options we like and call it customization.”",2
985,Can’t go without my Ebay: I find ebay to be a really good way to buy and sell items.  They have a money- back guarantee if it is not what the description is wrong.  I have gotten money back for this reason.  Also you can search and bid on everything.  The only thing I don’t like is that China seems to have the cheapest monopoly on their products so I try and only buy from our Country.  USA only!  It seems unfair and how in the world is there shipping so much cheaper.  Other than that I recommend selling or buying.  Ebay does take a fee from items you sell.  So be careful with the fee and postage.,5
986,"Well you wanted to know.: I use apps, and this app asked me repeatedly to rate it, so I gave it four stars because I do not want to be asked to rate an app, when I open an app I want to use it and not go somewhere else and write a review. The only problem I have had with this app is sometimes when I purchase an item I have to click buy twice, sometimes it will tell me that the purchases failed and I need to purchase it again.  I do and problems solved. The only other problem I have with eBay is the inefficiency of the search engine, telling me what it thinks I’m saying as opposed to what I want. I like to search for misspelled words & I can’t do that anymore.",4

*As a seller, there are also a lot of missing things on the App for Sellers compared to the classic site. Example, it does not give you the option to list in more than one category, on an item that is listed for a Buy-it-Now, it does not allow for immediate payment. There’s no box to check off and it doesn’t set it for immediate payment automatically so you lose that option. Also you are unable to provide a subtitle in addition to your main title. Also if you want to list a similar item, it asks if you want to keep the same photos - even if you check ‘No’, the photos are not removed, you have to manually delete each one. There are more problems with the App for IPad these are just some examples.

As a seller I am thoroughly disappointed with this app. I can no longer use it to create new listings or edit current listings. Listing products as ""buy it now"" also defaults to ""or best offer"". Any time I revise any part of an active listing from the app it adds ""or best offer"".  There is no way to change it from the app it has to be done from a computer. Condition notes can no longer be added from the app. And eBay's recommended pricing is automatically populated when you create a listing by scanning a barcode.",1

992,"NO PROBLEM RESOLUTION: Had a major problem as a buyer, and a major problem as a seller in the last 2 weeks. In neither case was I able to contact anyone at eBay. They refuse to have a conversation or chat with eBay employees despite a massive amount of effort and many many requests.  There is no road to resolution except their extensive automatic system. 

If their automatic resolution system doesn’t fit your situation perfectly, YOURE SCREWED. I spent three weeks just trying to get an EXPLANATION of how it was justified to keep my money  … I never got it. 

eBay authentication is WORTHLESS.  I bought an eBay authenticated item (supposedly). The item FAILED their authentication but they sent it to me anyway and I am out nearly 400 USD. It being authenticated was part of the justification for the purchase, especially at that price!!!!!!",1

I’m hoping this can get fixed so I receive notifications when a package is delivered without me having to open the app first. All notifications are turned on but it’s like the notifications aren’t triggered to let me know something has been delivered unless I go in the app. Please fix. Thanks.

All someone has to say is they didn’t receive an item and eBay will give them 100% of their money back and charge you, the seller, taxes and fees. There are people on the app that have multiple cases of doing this to sellers and eBay doesn’t do anything to discourage them. eBay is complaisant in these scams. I called their customer support with the tracking information proving the items were delivered and eBay said that isn’t enough for them. I needed more proof. I will be removing my items from eBay and finding another platform to use.

That’s why I look to eBay because it usually has the most affordable options, but adding tax defeats the purpose. Sometimes I’m paying almost full price for a used item, and the seller isn’t making the profits they used too either. Please stop adding taxes on top of the buy it now price, or find a way to show what the final price will be after shipping and taxes so you know what you’re getting into",5
997,Only use if bidding: I would use EBay all the time for stuff thinking I was getting a “good deal” only use EBay if you plan on bidding on something for auction. The reason for giving it 3 stars is cause the customer service is trash. If you want to bid on something make sure you actually want it and make sure the seller seems legit because if you basically buy something and the seller say “ well I sent the package and it says delivered “ when you never received the item nor did you want a refund just the same item.. Ebay will tell you the seller is right.  I would shop at amazing for daily stuff and for probably better made stuff. I would only use EBay once again .. only for bidding !,3
998,"Item advertised with train case not received: I am very unhappy that the original tray was not sent with my order of the Vintage Samsonite Silhouette train case that was advertised when I ordered & paid for it. 

Several messages to the seller have gone unanswered & you stated you would help resolve this issue. You did not. I do not want a refund. I just want to receive what I paid for which is the missing original tray for the train case. This is FALSE ADVERTISING by the seller. I am discouraged from ordering from this site ever again. PLEASE get the seller to send me the original tray! Karen Buford",5
999,"Sellers Beware: There is zero seller protection. Buyers are free to scam as they please and eBay will not back you up. Sold an expensive video camera that was like new and still had the box. Buyer waited 29 days to claim it wasn’t working. He was very specific about what wasn’t working with it. It was something that no camera does. I went to the company that I bought it from (B&H) and got in writing from them that no camera does what he was saying and submitted that to eBay. He THEN changed his story to say it was just broken. eBay sided with him and told me to pay him back. He shipped it and I never got it back. It says it was signed for and delivered, but I never signed for anything. I asked for proof of delivery from the post office and the signature is not mine. It’s just chicken scratch. So I lost my camera AND the money. Thanks a lot, eBay. I will NEVER use eBay again.",1
1000,"Thanks eBay: As a long time baseball card, (all cards really), collector I have benefited tremendously from eBay.
   In the old days completing a set was done over the phone or in person at card shows.  Both were very inefficient.  It could take years, (almost always would, you could figure years even on current and popular sets to complete), with eBay you essentially have the whole world of card collecting in one place.  I upgraded 16 cards in a 1954 Topps set in less than an hour, before eBay that would have taken a number of card shows to finish ... well over a year.",5

I have 100% positive feedback and have sold for 20 plus years and the fees have gone up immensely. Their new payout schedule is ridiculous.  I sold an item and shipped it two days ago, yet the funds still aren’t available for me.  eBay also charges money for accepting money on their platform, with NO explanation of charges.  Try calling customer service sometime...that’s right, the number is disconnected and you have to use a chat program, which takes 5 times the time to type what is going on than to just say it over the phone(because you have to re explain it due to a disconnect in typed words vs spoken words).  VERY Disappointed at what it has become.",1

I have been with eBay for 17 years it has gone to the dogs for both the buyer and sale er. I’m looking for another way to buy online. it broke my heart the way eBay done me.

1003,"Good app and platform except...: I have been on the eBay platform since 2014 and have seen all sorts on the site. The ease of selling to a wide range of people has never been easier! However, when selling there are a huge amount of problems. I recently sold a camera and got at least 10 offers that were for transactions out of eBay. I don’t consider myself a vigilante but I always report these. I have even gotten offers that I accepted and upon acceptance the buyer would only proceed with a third party payment. To top it all off all of these have been from accounts who were created that day and were no doubt a scam! Would love to continue selling her but please eBay, crack down on these sellers!",3
1004,"Ironclad Guarantee: Excitement of auctions aside, the ironclad 30 day money back guarantee is enforced 100% and a comfort for those worried about online transactions. It’s a “no matter what” policy that they back up even if they can’t recover the costs sometimes. It’s probably the best customer service any company offers out there so far and that comes from someone who is a hypercritical tech writer, who’s also opinionated to boot. I’ve been surprisingly impressed with the quality and speed of resolution in every instance I managed to raise or be a part of some issue. Simple service served with excellence. Oh yeah, I like the app; it’s fun to bid on auctions.",5
1005,"Needs Major Change: The update is horrible. When trying to list items, eBay tries way too hard to make your listing to specifications not the sellers. It takes longer to list because you have to deselect their options such a pricing, offers accepted, automatic auction etc. They even force you to list item for 30days with auto listing renewal. I have to go on my laptop to use the classic site just to select how long I want my listing to run...such an inconvenience! 
This app and eBay in general is a great place for buyers and even the scummiest scammers! Sellers on the other hand have a high risk of being ripped off. There is so much proctection and loop holes for fraudulent buyers to rip off sellers.

The lying seller shipped the box to another person, to a different address, but gave me this delivery tracker. 
I have repeatedly texted a complaint to Ebay that the package was not delivered to me, that this is not my track number. That the tracker number indicates the weight of the parcel is 1 kg. Have you ever seen an air conditioner that is installed in a window weighing 1kg? The instructions say the weight of the air conditioner is 16 kg and this is not a small package as I saw in the track number.
I sent all the proofs to Ebay that my package was not delivered. That the weight of the order does not match the description of the order, that the address and name are not mine…
Ebay replied that my track number is marked as - delivered.

Now, when you choose select all, you are forced to search each make of vehicle.

The app is buggy and not intuitive. It’s difficult to do everything you need to from it, you’ll end up having to use the website at some point to perform basic functions. Ebay also doesn’t protect their sellers. False claims from buyers enables them to return items you don’t accept returns on. They can package it poorly, not send you back everything, etc. Ebay is impossible to contact directly and you won’t have anyone you can talk to. For the fees they charge, it’s not worth the hassle.

1015,"The App is OK but eBay is really going downhill: Wow. It's the wild wild west on eBay. If you are a buyer you are mostly protected but you will still waste so much of your valuable time dealing with customer service due to bad sellers if you are a frequent buyer on here. 

If you are a seller good luck. Just plan on hiking all of your prices at least 15% to compensate for losses from dishonest sellers. At least selling electronics and electronic repair parts. Then you are less competitive and your earnings decrease even more. 

Or you can take the approach not to give into the buyers demands when they are clearly lying and offer zero evidence to back their claims about defective, broken, missing, etc. items. It doesn't matter how much proof you offer eBay will not overturn feedback from a blatantly dishonest seller when they hit you with negative feedback for not giving into their lies. And that feedback hurts where it counts. In your bank account. And you can't even leave the buyer negative feedback. 

So pick your poison sellers. eBay is just going to keep on doing what earns them the most in the short term. They are just going to continue losing more and more good buyers and sellers. It's bad now but it keeps getting worse.",1

It was the post office's responsibility that they misdelivered but also partially seller's responsibility for not requiring a signature upon delivery and/or a better insurance on the package.

This will allow the buyer to just keep the product and NOT pay for anything. When I asked eBay if this practice is legal and within their guidelines, they said “Yes”.

I understand that you want to ensure sellers get paid, but it’s going to cause sellers a huge headache when they have to constantly refund money to buyers who win multiple items.

They tried to brush me off to usps for an issue that’s not even related to usps. The seller has not responded. Both DESIREEJOY AND WENTZELNINO ARE DISGUSTING HUMANS. They take pride in not helping you. They will not help. WENTZELNINO FORCE ENDED THE CONVERSATION after I asked to speak to a higher up. This company hires disgusting humans who refuse to help and steal your money. I will file a claim to the business bureau and contact my lawyers. Such a nasty outcome over such a small issue.

But when I change it to the minimal price, it is literally selling a size chart or a non related garment. I would like it if eBay changed the policy of pricing items. For example instead of choosing options and the price going up, just leave it as it is. Don’t change the prices , make them all the same.

I’ve bought everything from toothbrushes to tires for a Corvette off of eBay. I even used eBay for my wedding and major milestone birthday celebrations.

My grocery store has gone to totally self check out which does not always work and staff member has to assist due to their system. Since I am not getting a discount to check myself out I have gone to a store that values their customers.

Having to put a nickname in to write a review and everyone I have tried is used——just another way to annoy customers? They have already signed in",2
1046,"Favorite brands: I find a wonderful variety of my favorite brands. Having recently changed sizes, I need some assurance the items I order will fit my new, slimmer figure. Talbots, Anne Klein and Jones of New York are brands on which I can rely to be true to my new size. Great clothes (mostly what I search and buy) at affordable prices, especially important in todays crashing economy! I’ve purchased wonderful comfortable robes even a unique vintage shower curtain not available anywhere else. It’s my ‘go-to’ when seeing something I think I ‘need’ and can feel good about saving money!",5
1047,"How EBAY stole and robbed us: We posted listings to sell a 2014 Truck and a 2017 Trailer and we couldn’t get our card to pay their fees for some reason we checked every detail in our card that it matched what it showed on ebay. We have  tried 4-6 times and we got a phone call from eBay that we thought was friendly at first that they just reminded us about the fees and that same day just a few hours later we had to use another card for it to finally go through of 158$ they deleted our account immediately after. Swept under the rug without any explanation they sent one message about the account being suspended and that we cannot do anything after.

Everything in the card matched the billing and mailing address and it didn’t go through they couldn’t verify “Regions” Bank.

After we tried to use another card which we had to deposit cash into. They stole the 158$ and then about 10 minutes after our account was deleted along with the money stolen.

So ebay, you don’t think we are good enough? That’s okay, we do. And there are other apps and websites that do to. We are going to go to them now. Have a nice day =)",1
1048,"Policies: Hello to anyone who may be reading this, be warned that eBay can AND will indefinitely suspend you account. When talking to customer service they told us that it is policy that they do not need to discuss what caused the suspension. Unfortunately, instead of having a conversation like adults she hung up and I was left confused and without answers. 

I bought 2 items, a plush and a keychain, when an error popped up saying to try and order again in 15 minutes. I did, only to be told I have been suspended. They informed me that my email will be cause of suspension in the future if I create another account. 

No explanation was given, customer service was of poor quality, and since my account was deleted I am unable to see if my purchases went through or were canceled.",1

And honestly, I love the experience, time arrival etc... Of course like any other websites you must be careful of scammers, and be more careful of international sellers. But overall item are original/authentic, you just have to browse, read the descriptions, and most of all I recommend communicating with seller before making any purchase if you have any doubts. eBay is my New Shopping Website.

1050,"Fabulosity!: I have been an eBayer since…mmm…around 1992? It has been a very long time! I absolutely L❤️VE eBay! 
They not only hold YOU Accountable; eBay ALSO Holds the SELLER Accountable, too! 
I have had only a few problems- maybe 2 or 3 (?) with sellers regarding either receiving merchandise or the quality not being what was stated. When eBay was made aware, when I was able to show a trail of documentation of contraction regarding trying to come to terms with the seller, eBay stepped in quickly and sorted things out with refunds, etc. 
Please do not hesitate to use eBay! I rate them
A++++!!!",5
1051,"Anyone Can Use eBay!: After 10 years enjoying eBay buying and selling, I cannot think of a better platform. From the onset, I found it easy to use and with my eBay purchases having money protection I’ve always had a peace of mind. The very few refunds that I’ve had to process, receiving or refunding my clients, eBay has processed that hustle free and with no further prejudice nor penalties. Over my years using eBay, I’ve observed that fellow eBayers are increasingly trading quality products and quite efficient with shipping.  With my payPal link I feel armed with my own versatile online trading platform.",5

So I would like to say a big thank you for the creators of eBay. I love how over the years I’ve seen amazing improvement of this website.  I love how eBay from time to time gives certain percentages off your shopping basket too. Every little bit helps. So thanks for that too. To everyone out there selling there things, keep bringing the good deals. May our Lord bless each one of you.",5
1053,"GREAT+Recommended😊: Ebay is thE BEST! I’m glad I found a way to not have to be bothered with going to+ spending time/hours shopping at stores. It use to take too much time to find something I liked+wanted. But then, EVERYTHING looked the same.
The ONLY problem I have with ebay is, they allow SCAMMERS to run scams on GOOD+ long time customers (list items but never ship them. Relist the items+do it over+over again). It’s not about “buyer protection”. Something like that should not happen from the same fraud sellers, more than once .STILL a 5 STAR shopping site.",5
1054,"Terrible customer service!: I ordered a drone on EBay and the seller used a tracking number from a package that was being delivered to my neighbor from Walmart, a new type of scam. Since the package said it was delivered to the front door, even though it was not in my name or to my address, EBay would not refund the money! 

They told me I needed to resolve the issue between my neighbor and Fedex, so I ended up wasting hours of my time trying to figure out how this fraudulent seller linked my purchase with the tracking number of my neighbors package. EBay took the sellers side the entire time throughout this although he was a new seller with no sales, purchases or feedback and I have been using EBay for 10 years. I will not conduct any more business through EBay, and I would recommend you do the same if you are reading this!",1
1055,"Nickel and dime to death!: There are so many layers of payment to Ebay, that you hardly make any profit! If you want your item to be seen by customers, you pay a hefty percentage, listing fee, and a final value fee.  Not to mention, that I pay a monthly and yearly fee for having a store.  I am very frustrated, and very discouraged.

Their customer service has also declined significantly.  I was told that someone would call me back regarding a restocking fee question that I called them about.  It has been now 3 days, and no one has called me back.  

I am researching other avenues to sell my products online.",5
1056,Money stolen: Awful people on this app item was never received at my location so I asked for a refund. My case got closed with not being able to talk to eBay personally. I’ve emailed eBay multiple times never received anything back from them when I was having an issue with the seller. Seller basically told me to get lost. Will never buy from eBay again this was my first and last purchase. Your better off just throwing ur money away then ever trying to get a case fixed with eBay. I am making sure to spreed my story so it doesn’t just get lost in these reviews that never help anything but this was my last resort after trying to contact them I’m not respecting a response tho because they are reliable at all I rather pay twice the amount from a company with actual good customer service!,1
1057,"Good but has flaws: I enjoy utilizing the eBay app.  I’m a seller and it’s easy to take photos from my phone and create listings.  While this is super convenient, I find that I have to delete the app and add it back, as it gets stuck with no option to back out or resubmit anything. It’s almost as if I am looking at a photo. The only way to begin using the app again is to delete and add it back. I experience this only when shopping - not when listing an item. It’s pretty inconvenient, as I have to set everything up again..  my feedback, user name, password, push notifications, and face recognition. Ebay- please - please fix this. Thanks!",4
1058,"Keeps getting worse and worse - Download poshmark: EBay keeps going down hill with their app. They keep updating and changing seeing and the layout of creating your own listing.
I constant find my listing being changed. My auctions are automatically being re listed when they were created to not be relisted. 
The layout of creating your listing is missing many key options that are available on the site. Most recently, my new listing duration was set to ""good into canceled"" with no option for me to change it within the app.
When writing descriptions, for some reason, on my phone the description is stuck being double spaced send looks very unprofessional. With no way of changing the double spacing, not even when I get on the site on my desktop. So if you make a listing on the app and stay to write the description, your decryption will be such in double spacing. It seems everyday I'm finding different changes to their app that I just dislike so much it's aggravating.

All in all, I just keep getting more and more disappointed in eBay and how they are running things. It's shows why everyone is ditching eBay and selling clothes on poshmark instead. It's so more simple.",1
1059,"Highly Disapponted: I used to love this app. It was super easy to use and maintain! But now, each update that I receive leaves something to be desired every time, and seems like they are back peddling with the updates. The app is slower. Shows every single purchase I’ve ever made (even though I’ve already left feedback and deleted them forever ago). It takes forever to place a bid on an item sometimes and when I do place a bid it says I’ve been outbid even though I am the highest bidder. It no longer has an edit option in the bid and offer page so I have to go through and slowly swipe items that I didn’t win individually to delete them instead of being able to select a group of them and deleting them. I am so disappointed with how this app has turned out, and hope that it improves!",1
1060,"Ebay: Ebay's platform is a fantastic place to buy and sell, but I have to comment on their policy and decision making when it comes to a discrepancy with a buyer/seller problem. Ebay is always looking out for their own interest by always siding with the buyer on a transaction problem. This is not fair to all the sellers out there that are honest and trying to make a living. Ebay needs to find a way to judge the situation in a fair and reasonable way for both parties, and not to side with the buyer to just keep their interest on a paying basis. Thank you and hope this helps make a change!",5

The classic/collector cars and parts that sell and make up an enormous part of eBay Motors more times than not need to be discussed prior to bid or purchase. I’m a avid buyer and seller in collector cars/parts and need the ability to discuss the cars and parts with other people. This is also how you set up a report with people, trust is hard to write.

There are a lot of great items and treasures to find but unfortunately a lot of scammers as well but eBay has always when notified of scammer taken care of them right away and refunded any money I may have given to said scammers. So shop with that comfort we all fall for em (scams) but eBay will give you a friendly knowledgeable person to help you out!,5
1064,Most seller don’t wants answer questions and the lack of communication: Ebay is not what are used to be seller stone care and I truly don’t want to deal with a refund or disputing something. They’re not willing to communicate with the buyer and then buyers beware and you get stuck with a high-end purchase of hundreds of dollars that’s crazy. Customer service used to be number one anyway that’s why used to purchase from you guys everything now I’m like no I’m just saving few dollars for 500 or $600 and I know it’s you and he’s legit so no that’s the reason that I used Ebay and shoes garments some thing that you need measurements there’s no communication at all and I don’t want to spend all day calling you guys and putting a dispute.,2

This is a terrible way to communicate for those without smartphones, can’t be on their phone consistently or do not want another app taking up space on their device, especially when you need to turn notifications on. You’re exposed to their advertising. Horrible way to run an E-commerce site - I will be using Mercari for my future transactions because this app is your only communication method.",1
1068,Account Suspended No Reason: I giving this app an one star review because my eBay account from 2019 had been suspended for no reason. When ask why the same sentence is being told “we can’t tell you the reason because it would circumvent our eBay policy”. At this point I recommend everyone to stay away from eBay because they will allow bots account to roam freely and post anything they want and then later after you pay for these items the accounts claim it out of stock or the product was found to be damage and give you a refund. I’m guessing because I got to many refunds from these accounts is why I was suspend. I tried to help eBay by reporting these accounts in a exchange what I got in return is a permanent suspended account. “ no good deed goes unpunished “,1
1069,"A change for the worse.: I enjoyed eBay for over 20 years. One thing that changed is trying to contact a customer service agent has become terrible. I use to get a US based agent during the week and a Ireland agent on the weekend. This is no longer the case. Last time I tried I had to correspond to a agent via the eBay app. This is terrible for a person who is getting older. The one time I tried a few years ago I couldn’t find how to correspond with a agent, couldn’t figure out how to do it. 

2 way authorization is nice, which is a positive change. 

I hope contacting an agent to the way way it was would bring my score back to a 5.",3
1070,Mobile App needs that’s wifi only: Explain to me what’s the point of putting a mobile app in the App Store that is programmed not to work on mobile data. That is kinda stupid don’t you think ? Like yeah oh yeahhhhh there’s just free wifi literally everywhere! Easy! Just connect to the free wifi! Except that …no. No there is not wifi everywhere.I can only use this app when I’m at home on my MOBILE PHONE when it’s connected to wifi. WICH defeats the purpose of a MOBILE APP. When I’d be better off USING MY COMPUER. Want me just uninstall this since you’re not gonna address this problem? I’ve left several different feedback on this exact problem for a long time now and nothing has been done.. months later after filing this bug report nothing has been done about it….,1
1071,"It’s generally lacking in many aspects.: Your donation portion doesn’t detect that I already made a donation on PayPal, but now you’re demanding I do it again through your donation section on eBay, meaning there’s no proper way to do it through the app. That doesn’t include the fact that most of your directory links lead out to an external connection on the eBay app, instead of the eBay app itself. Seems that the app is lacking quite a lot in proper functionality, such as viewing the invoice in a separate browser instead of the app.

Also, not only does eBay want a cut of what I sell, they also demand more money on a near monthly basis. It’s one thing about taking a cut when it sells, but also demanding a whole lot more money a few weeks later and threatening to tarnish my good standing? That’s some greedy tactics right there. To make matters worse is that your overdue draft fees make the DMV blush.

Lastly, I wasn’t able to leave a negative review on a buyer that never payed me and it left it as a positive review. 

Seriously eBay, you are managing to be even less desirable with each passing use.",2

After seven days of not even shipping, I wrote him. No response. A day later the app shows product is shipping. Product arrived, the wrong item. App says item delivered. There is no place on the complaint or help section to say that the wrong item was delivered. Then another delay. so far it’s been 20 days since I paid the seller and I still don’t have my item.",5

There are things on eBay that you can’t find anywhere else. As a bonus, I know I’m not contributing to the company that is trying to take over the world, put every other company out of business and monopolize prices, Am*zon. I either buy from eBay or directly from the manufacturer.",5
1074,eBay has lost my respect: Without any heads up they put a restriction on my account because I bank with PayPal. After providing them with my new bank information it has been 3 weeks and I still haven’t received my money. My new account information has been verified and approved but still my money is on hold. Customer service is awful and they will say anything to rush you off the phone and try to make you feel comfortable. My advice is for anyone using eBay be mindful that they don’t respect sellers or even care if you loose customers. I have a ton of stuff that I need to ship out but it’s hard when eBay is holding all of your money hostage. I was told that they could not issue a check and I had to wait until they were ready to release my funds.,1

I (a first time seller) have sold an item that was worth $400+ and the buyer opened up a claim on me saying they never received their package. They opened a claim a day before the estimated delivery date was set. eBay went ahead and sided with the buyer even after I provided tracking details that stated the item was delivered. I even contacted the carrying service (USPS) and they said the package had been delivered. After explaining this situation numerous amounts of time and trying to appeal it, eBay stuck with their decision on fully refunding the buyer out of my account and they still charged me the selling fee which is 12.9%. Worst company and horrible customer service they just give you the run arounds. Save your time and money and try selling elsewhere.",1

Always have tracking when shipping an item and you will never have any issues. Every month there are also “final value fees” as a seller so watch out for that. Take advantage of every eBay promo so it balances out with the final value fees you have to pay.",5
1081,Lack of information: App is fine and works perfect. All vender info is vague listed by Ebay. You don’t ever get full information on products you buy or the location its being shipped from. Poor customer service! No feedback links at the bottom of app or webpage because Ebay does not care what you think! Online purchases should not be a crap-shoot! Do not ever hit commit for any item. You will go nutz with the app consistently reminding you to pay! I want to be perfectly clear the App is fine. The customer wants more purchase information before buying. Brick and mortar stores are closing up. We want more sales information in order to feel more comfortable with an online purchase.,3

Please fix this as it really duplicates efforts and takes longer to pinpoint the item for which you’re searching 

I think this is a reboot of a past version that I really preferred using to the most recent ones. Glad to see it brought back.

This has been talked about for YEARS on different blogs and forums. I use Auctiva to create my listings and have LONG terms and payment and shipping profiles that launch with almost every listing. A potential buyer pointed out that the first part of the description for a $1000 coat mentioned defects!

Promise to make it all 5 if I do cuz I love eBay otherwise.  Also contacted PayPal who also said something similar... they are my first three transactions as a seller so obviously I am new to the process.   I was told to contact the buyers of the items who were refunded by eBay/PayPal to resubmit payment.  None of which will believe me the unaccredited party.  It is eBay / PayPal that has such a leverage and credibility.  We are talking a little over 100 dollars in total.  But I’m sure everyone wants money for their measly little transactions.  I have certainly bought way more than that.,3

It still held my location which it did not have permission to access in the first place, and proceeded to show me a page of items under the heading, ""Search local."" Needless to say I am deleting the app because Ebay is data mining- stealing info- from my phone. I really hope Apple comes after these sleeze thugs.

Also listing items until removed or sold option last 30 days, why offer that option when you offer 30 days ? I don’t understand why eBay makes more of my listings than I do.

I buy electronic parts frequently, and it is burdensome to constantly have to select “US Only” each and every time I perform a new search. In some cases it filters out 80% of the results doing this, which makes it far easier to find what I’m looking for and also cuts down on the number of counterfeit items (a real problem with components) I come across.

They then put me on hold for a couple minutes and came back saying that they have decided to not un-suspend my account and the decision is permanent.  I was extremely shocked and confused, so I did what any person would and asked “why?”, they claimed that they could not disclose this because “they don’t want anyone manipulating their policies”.  A completely unprofessional and delusional business that doesn’t even have to work for their profits.  Their fees are ridiculous in the first place.  Would not recommend to ANYONE and wish them the worst with their “policies”.",1
1092,"EBAY VS. A WORLD OF OPTIONS: I’ve used them all. But the tried and true original is always your best option. Simple to use. And if I was to take away a star. It would be for the insane amount of time it takes to get anything  from China. EBay doesn’t loose the start because it’s not the ones responsible for trade deals. I’m really hoping for a plethoras of ‘Made in the USA’ vendors. And I’m pretty optimistic that’s going to happen.
Till then. I’ll have to keep waiting for over a month for most of my things to arrive.
EBay is still the best in the biz.
The End.",5
1093,"Horrible: I don’t know if its the app or eBay in general but I can’t connect my bank account to make a business account which I don’t even want to do that. I have thousands of items i want to sell and ebay is hindering from doing that by not allowing me a limit increase even though i sold my limit last month and made over $300 off of it. Not to mention my brother just started an account and is already able to list up to 250 items a month up to $25,000 and im only limited to 5 items each month. No he didn’t start a business account and no he hasn’t sold a single item on it. Complete trash customer service you literally can’t even talk to anyone or have any type of appeal as to why i should be allowed a selling limit increase.",1
1094,"Scam: I have purchased two items from eBay and it’s been 2 going on 3 months and I have yet to receive my package and that’s no right. In addition to this happening I also became aware as a first time buyer, that’s there is no real time communication between the buyers or the sellers. The only thing that takes place when you make a request is push a all ready written response to, what ever the question maybe. It is a shame that as a first timer on this app, it’s the wrong app  I have delt with and I have used multiple purchasing app where you buy and see things! EBay received and will continue to receive a 1star and I’m never using this app again, have already deleted it and am putting this report together inside my apple store app!!!",1
1095,"eBay Money Back Guarantee is Junk: What it’s supposed to do and how I used it: 
It’s supposed to instill a level of trust so that you can quickly make a purchase for something that you would otherwise spend more time thinking about or may not purchase at all. You think, there’s some slight risk, but eBay has my back. 

What actually happens:
I bought a pair of New Air Jordans. There was no defect noted in the description, but pics were limited. So I bought. The sneakers passed the authenticity check, but when I got them there was a big black blemish on them and the texture was also worn down. I notified eBay right away, followed their process, and sent them detailed photos. They basically told me that I’m stuck with them and they won’t do anything because from their perspective they passed the authenticity check and the seller has no returns marked. Two problems here .. 1) there is no sense of quality check with the authenticity check and 2) even though their policy says the money back guarantee has you covered for sellers that don’t accept returns, they will not honor it. 

Shop with caution. You may get swindled .. by a seller and by eBay.",1
1096,eBay has been failing me corona virus: They let the over seas ppl charge us then they just delete the orders after they get our money. It’s BS How can they delete orders when they have orders outstanding. 0 stars I have tried every way to work this out. Don’t do over seas buying in the apps. But only with trusted ppl you do buisness with. The thing that get me the most is we can’t block the sellers that cheat us. That’s not fair at all. I know as a seller we have the right to block buyers that cheat us. So why can’t block the people that cheat us? Ebay needs work!,5
1097,"Great but needs more safeguards: I buy thousands of dollars worth of things on eBay for my business and for personal use every year. The main weak area is that eBay needs to do a better job of vetting sellers that are selling fraudulent merchandise. This begins by being receptive to direct reports from buyers to eBay. In my experience with fraudulent products that I’ve received I’ve not been able to connect with a human on the other end, and the multiple choice method of reporting just doesn’t do it. The deck is stacked against the buyer. With this said, I don’t know what I would do without eBay.",5
1098,"Review of eBay app!: Thanks, but do you have to notify me every 5 seconds?This becomes tiresome and eats up all my time. But I guess that’s your point: the more time spent, the more dollars you make. You’re a business, I get it. 
Here’s a idea,  that I hope you take seriously. Yes, it’s nice to be notified but there should be a way to limit the amount or time frame of notifications. It’s like the boy who cried wolf, they don’t become important anymore. The ONLY time I would want to be notified on the fly would be for auctions that were about to end, PERIOD! The rest of the other notifications can be batched at a set time of the user’s choosing. This would simplify the overflow of information we are continually bombarded.",3
1099,"Ineffective selling tool!!: I have listed three items with eBay and sold all three, this sounds like it would be positive situation but after the auctions close buyers would ask to cancel the order. This wasted three weeks of selling time and I could have filled other orders but I held on to them for individuals on eBay. eBay needs to figure out a better way to validate bidders and make sure when people bid they pay and the items are actually sold. Otherwise this is just a game of how high can I make the bid with no interest in actually buying the item. One last thing, when buyers cancel orders after taking the time to out bid others the seller should be able to give feedback about the cancellation. I am only writing this because it happened three consecutive times, that’s ridiculous!!",1
1100,"Like the regular eBay app, hate the motors one: I wish the regular eBay app would default to cars first then you can expand to parts and accessories. Dislike typing in a year / make/ model of a car in the search bar and getting slammed by 100,000 cheap Chinese accessories. 

eBay Motors app crams too many images in it, just like to scroll quickly. 

And what’s up with EBay and putting their ads in a products picture rolls, if I see that spooky glasses wearing eBay ad dude up close on my pc anymore I’m gonna shop of Facebook marketplace from now on.",5
1101,"Bad Buyer: I have been on EBay for 25 years. 100% positive feedback. I have an angry customer who thinks he did not receive what he paid for. I tried to resolve the issue, but buyer wants no part of it. I even offered to refund him if he sends it back. He refused. He opened a dispute and is requesting half of the money back. He wants to keep half of the equipment. He is trying to rip off eBay and me. eBay is offering very little help and will not remove the messages between myself and angry buyer. I gave him sensitive information to resolve the issue and would like it erased from the eBay servers. Again eBay has offered very little help with this matter and refused to remove messages, even though buyer was threatening. Never had a problem before. Hoping eBay does the right thing.",1
1102,"Terrible scam app: I registered an account, search for coffee, processed payment and suddenly my account was blocked without any explanation. I checked my bank account and saw that transaction is in pending status. Next day I checked it again, transaction was not completed. I suggested since EBay suspended my account, they would not withdraw my money. Next day I created another account and it wasn’t suspended, I could buy coffee. I got notification that money from my suspended account was withdrawn by EBay. I contacted to Support of EBay, they refused to refund, they wrote since my account is suspended, they won’t do anything, I am not under customer protection. fraud!. Such a big company and scam! My colleague said she had the same issue, after years of using eBay they suddenly suspended her",1

And the operating system doesn't accept the new updates of eBay because its no longer compatible unless you have iOS 12.2 or better, this system is 10.3 I've been using eBay for almost 18 years. I find it odd every time I try to use my eBay it crashes telling me I have to update and the iOS system will not update cause it's not compatible. Of course I do use it through my phone which regularly updates. But I'd like to use my iPad which no longer updates. Any help where I can use my iPad 4 would be appreciated.",5
1104,"Really frustrating and disappointing app by eBay: Hit or miss and unpredictable. Search function is STILL surprisingly bad, frustrating to use, randomly changes your search criteria on its own, so you end up getting results that are not what you thought you were viewing, and gives results that do not at all include the searched terms, or leaves out items that do. Literally have to use browser rather than app to search relatively reliably. And recently viewed items list periodically re-adds a bunch of items that were previously deleted, so it’s suddenly long and cluttered, etc. And some app updates are forced, suddenly the app won’t allow you to use it without installing an update that was only released a couple of days prior.",1
1105,Store search broken: I’m not certain what has changed but as a seller I can no longer put in a keyword to search for an item in my store. I also find the same issue searching for items in other seller’s stores. Example I searched all of eBay for a plastic shelf liner and found a seller selling them however the size was not wide enough for my shelf. So I went to see the seller’s other items and searched their other 1200 items with the keyword ‘shelf’ and it yields no results. Surely I would get at least 1 result right? Really would love to have this feature back. Thanks for listening. I’m using the eBay app on an iPhone 11.,3
1106,"No longer receiving notifications of offers: Ever since I upgraded to iPhone 13 pro, notifications of offers do not come through as a notification. All notification settings are correct within eBay and iPhone settings and both are on the current version of software. The only time I see I have a notification is when I open the eBay app and I see the notification section has a red icon. Notifications should stay constant when they are received on my iPhone but they are not even coming over. Please fix this bug. Customers are waiting longer to hear from me because of this.",3
1107,Sellers beware - hidden fees (bait and switch): I got a promotion email from eBay to sell 250 items for no fees. So I went ahead and listed an item for sale. The next day I noticed that my account had a $105 dollar charge on it. When I inquired to customer support they said that the listing had an “upgrade fee” that would be charged whether my item sold or not. So I asked that the item listed for sale be deleted and to reverse the charge. He said that the charge couldn’t be reversed because even unlisting the item for sale is considered not selling the item. So I closed my account and reported the charge to my bank as FRAUD. Not only is eBay not getting their $105 they just lost a user that buys from their site and they definitely lost a seller. NOW THATS WHAT I CALL A TWO FOR ONE SPECIAL!,1
1108,"I have to wait a month to get my money!!: I am very disappointed and furious! When I first start selling on eBay, my payment would immediately go to my PayPal and then I could transfer the money I’ve received in my PayPal account into my bank account in a day. Unfortunately, eBay dropped PayPal and the money would go to them whenever a buyer buys my stuff. It’s really annoying since eBay would hold my money for a week when I really need the money to pay for shipping and bills. Recently, a buyer bought some pants from me and eBay said that MY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE A MONTH LATER!! THIS IS REALLY RIDICULOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE!!! Shame on you ebay!! If I could give a zero star, I would. eBay ruined itself, it used to be really good but with all these unnecessary changes, it’s just horrible and unbearable now!",1
1109,"Looking for an item: If you put in search for a large shirts. you’ll get every single size shirt.  it does not just bring up a large shirts.
If you put in for Reebok shoes size 13. It will bring up all shoes from all companies with all sizes.
If I’m looking for a book say avengers hardcover it will bring up all books including comic books. This makes it very hard to look up anything and find what you’re wanting. Also since you think it should be looking up these things and you’re getting the wrong things on there you end up paying for something that you don’t want or is the wrong size and you can’t wear it anyway",3

Not only is it constantly freezing up(simple actions such as watching an item now take 10x longer), occasionally crashing, losing info already entered while listing an item for sale, etc...but you guys really did a number on your search generator.  These items need to be addressed immediately, before mass trading card hobbyists flee your site for ANY other platform. I am in a lot of groups on various platforms, and there are more people angered by these new issues than you can ever imagine. Good luck...",1
1111,"10% Percent fee: Unfair that everyone is being charged 10% weather you sell 1 item a month or 10,000 a month. The more sales the higher the rate should be because the people and businesses are saving on electricity, rent, insurance a store front and should actually be paying more percentage than an average person selling some item that wouldn't need to have to have a store front and other expenses. I believe they are even paying less than 10%. Don’t forget the little guy that started eBay and now your sticking it to them. This matter should really be seriously be looked at before people start going to your competition. Also you charge 10% on shipping fees now which makes the seller lose even more money. Really not happy with this and I’m sure others gotta feel the same way.",1
1112,Disappointed in EBAY: I have been buying and selling on EBay since 2007. I have 100% positive reviews and had only one small issue with a customer which was resolved.  I loved it! But the EBay decided to get greedy instead of thinking about the sellers and buyers. When I got the email about the managed payments they made it sound like it would be easier to get paid and such. That was a blatant lie! Now when I sell something instead of being paid immediately I have to wait for days . I sold something on a Saturday night and eBays customer service told me I could expect to see it in my bank account on the following Wednesday. They are growing and becoming a very greedy company.,3
1113,"Super Easy to Sell!!: I just recently started selling on eBay and have been super happy!! I have been wanting to sell on eBay for the longest time, but was always scared away for various reasons. Mainly, I just didn’t know where to start and it seemed that everyone I talked to that had sold on eBay before, had a horror story. But recently I decided to give it a shot and WOW it was so easy! From the listing, to receiving the money, and then to shipping the item. You have a long time seller in me and I will be sure to share my amazing experience with anyone interested!

I purchased and was excited.  After continuously looking at it I realized what happed and asked to cancel my order.  It was honored, however I have not been able to purchase since.
It allows me to bid to say $5. after waiting for days to be over, once someone else bids I cannot bid again.
Also let it be know that I have made a right out purchase.  I just don’t understand why this is happening and why everyone thinks EBay is so good.

Today I went to list an item using the app, and the old new terrible version is back???!!!! Why??!!  I almost quit selling through your site back then, and really might now!!!  I spent 10 minutes designing my listing only to have the app tell me that I “lost the connection to the server” and to “try again”. All of my 10 min of work was erased and I was forced to start all over. Frustrated, but I did it again, and AGAIN!!! Same thing!!! Wasted 20 minutes and ended up with 0 listings.

1118,"Good for buyers, terrible for sellers: I find this App great for shopping and buying, however, whenever I go to sell it’s terrible.

I always have to go back and fourth multiple times for entering package dimensions, buyer paying shipping, and which service. Then it also auto does buy it now at the same I do for auction starting which why would I want that? Then it also always adds in the make an offer option automatically. This is followed up by it never shows my scheduled listings and even after hitting save for a draft it only shows that I made it and nothing else that I entered into it. It never lets me print right from the app, I can screenshot the shipping label and print it or just save it and print it but not straight from the app.",2
1119,"Easy to use app.: App is easy to use, there are a few things you can’t do that you could do if you go to the website. Like looking for past purchases like a year ago. Also I hate when I type something to search and when I’m far down looking at the things and i accidentally press on the search bar again you are screwed, you can’t just cancel and go back to where you were, you need to start all over again and search. Other than that bids are accurate and easy to use.",5
1120,"Great place for auto parts and accessories: I’ve used eBay off and on for maybe 20 years. Early on, I searched for breweriana and music collectibles.

Over the last few years I have been doing repairs on my 2004 Prius, and have found the parts I’ve needed.

Some examples of items I’ve purchased:

Glovebox
Leather console cover
Door lock actuators
Blower Fan
Replacement rear hatch
Replacement window channel
Motors for AC blend door and defroster vent control
Window weather strips 
Driver side door panel 
Door lock control panel
Interior door handle
Floor mats
Emergency brake pad 
Steering wheel cover
Windshield washer nozzles
Taillight Assembly
Combination Meter

And probably a thing or two I’ve forgotten.

eBay is a place where you can find hard to get parts. I’ve always received what I ordered and the vendors I’ve dealt with have been responsive.

I have talked to so many customer service people and have gotten ZERO explanation as to why it was blocked. They said i would get my payout after 30 days, then 60, then 90, and now 180 days i have to wait for the payout. I feel awful for these customer service people who work for this terrible company. I will never sell on ebay again.",1
1122,"Trustworthy Company!!: I like the fact that you can be a buyer or seller on Ebay. The sellers offer reasonable prices for their products. The pay system is legal through PayPal. If a seller is found with a high negative feedback rating, they can no longer sell on Ebay. Ebay offers discounts on new products. I like the fact that you can bid or buy now on a product that a seller offers. I’m glad that Ebay sends notices often when they upgrade or change some rules. You can sell or buy most anything on Ebay.",5
1123,"Love eBay but….: I love the eBay platform. I sell thousands of items. But I don’t like the latest update on the “selling” tab. They took away the accurate count of my active listings. Instead of 2,735 it’s 2.7k. 
And the whole look of it is just less functional. I wish they had an option to switch back to the old style, like they do with the messaging section. 

I also wish the app had more features that the desktop version has, such as more analytics, the ability to choose the time frame of the grand total that’s displayed on the selling tab,  and the ability to create coupons, and make social media posts.",3

They also did not want to tell me why I was suspended because of “risk”. I literally didn’t even do anything and when I tried to ask for more information about why I was suspended eBay would end the chat right away without letting me speak.

I have not heard anything back from this person. Now I got an email saying this item is no longer available is this a joke? Am I going to get the item I purchased I’ve definitely waited almost two months now. I am definitely thinking twice before purchasing anything else on here that is for sure.",4
1126,Downhill fast: I have been on eBay buying and selling for years up until recently. Woke up found out that our account was suspended and they removed every listing. For no reason at all! When trying to get someone to help me there is zero customer service after finding a way to chat with somebody they told me there was no way they could tell me what happened and I should start an appeal. This is a publicly traded company???! Not to mention you can’t find one person from our country when it comes to customer service. No phone number. Nothing so if something wrong happens… You’d probably have to spend a couple of days before getting it fixed. Absolutely beware of Ebay I would never recommend this company to anybody anymore.,1

When I refuse, they delete their account.

1131,"Slightly Confusing App & A FEE SUCKING MACHINE!: eBay’s come a long way.. HOWEVER! The app is confusing as a seller when the ‘eBay postage’ comes into play.. & going back & fourth between pages once sold. It seems as a different layout once an item is sold? Would create a flow, that’d facilitate ease& speed to complete sale.. Thanks EBay! 
Here’s the other beef! 
💥You’re taking OUR taxes on goods sold! Seller’s are literally paying sales tax.. TWICE! Once when the seller purchases items & AGAIN WHEN YOU TAKE IT..~
OK~ EBAY takes a 10% FEE + TAXES on goods/items for sale, + ADDITIONAL fees if you choose anything EXCEPT a genetic listing  = INFLATED PRICES TO BUYERS!
(So that the seller can make a small profit) COME ON EBAY!! You’re a Big Machine! In the time of a historic Pandemic😷!! Cut the sellers/buyers a break. We can then list products for an amount that also benefits the buyer!

I personally bought a car that was sold by a scam seller.  Advertised as a great car with no issues...it was shipped to me...but upon arrival it was clear the seller stripped body panels off the car and stripped a large inventory of mechanical parts from the car and engine.  eBay didn’t cover a majority of the missing parts...issued a check for $1,000...but then the repairs exceeded $12,000.

1134,"eBay Has Been Compromised!: EBay was once one of the best websites on the internet, where users could do business seamlessly and with ease, however, in recent times,  due to that graceful and plentiful commerce solution not agreeing with the agenda of the new owners (the easily accessible solution for third party sellers to sell used items (coupled with the massive user base)), they decided to make the process as difficult as possible for the small seller, while robbing you of as much cash in the meantime as they possibly can(through their lovely subsidiary, PayPal). It is a very very sad thing to see this website with so much potential to be so very beautiful become compromised to the  “national elites”, purposely putting it to waste.",3
1135,"Simple update to items in cart: The app really needs some work on items related to the cart. When you delete or move for later, the app basically refreshes and moves you to the start of the list which is really annoying.

1138,Disappointed in Selling Changed: The changes made for selling items are very disappointing. I have been selling items on eBay for several years. Since selling changes i have not been listing items because I feel the changes are very unfair. My auctions are set at very fair prices. eBay now automatically change auctions as “make an offer” when the item does not sell in what they feel is an appropriate amount of time. And for ebay to continually lower the acceptable amount is very wrong. I feel eBay now gives sellers items away.,5
1139,"eBay stole my money: This app doesn’t deserve the 1 star I’m giving it. I started selling on eBay yesterday and I posted 3 items. I paid $1 for the 2nd listing and $5 for the 3rd. I was debating paying the $5 but I was eager to sell so I did. Anyway, the bid on the $5 listing reached its reserve price and so I was thinking about selling it to the buyer and when I woke up this morning, I got the notification that my account was suspended. To my knowledge, I did nothing wrong & I had made a potential sale, so that being said, that money is mine and they took it from me.",5
1140,"Newly listed items not showing: Please help? It's been months of newly listed items that I list as a seller, not showing in active listings. This is only on the iPhone app. Sometimes I need to make corrections or just want to go back and check my work but items I've listed don't show up for weeks. I actually have two stores and this isn't a problem with my other user name just this one. Can someone help me? I'm happy to change reviews I just really need this fixed I've left messages with eBay call center but I'm aware that might not be working lol Thanks ❤️",5
1141,"All you need: When you are selling coins, cars, anything , I don't go to the magazines that tell you their value. All Values are affected by what people are willing to pay for them. A great snapshot of value is looking in EBay it is only worth what someone is willing to pay!   I just about have bought everything on Ebay. Cars, homes, acreage, furniture, just about any of my collections. I feel sorry for the big box brick and mortars stores. 

My only concern is that the scales are heavily tilted toward the buyers and hurting the honest sellers. But that's another story.

1142,"Did not get refunded: I had 1 issued when I bought a machine with a cartridge of 120,000 pulses. You can not see how much pulses have, so after I use a few weeks in the face, I use much less than 1,000 pulses than was empty! I opened a case, told what’s happened, than was closed with don’t say anything, I opened again, was closed again, than I called and the answer was “as you use the product I can not do anything”. how I would know how many pulses had if I didn’t use?
The 2nd issue was a scarf that never arrived, the seller gave a tracking number and the case was closed! I never saw the scarf, but eBay doesn’t care!!! You can see I am buying much less than before, and I am advising people what happened with me and tell than to avoid by on eBay!!",2
1143,"Miss the old one...: I was forced to finally update after getting a message that my version would no longer be supported. Now the new version isn't AS BAD as when this new layout first came out a year or so ago, but I'm still not loving it. The old version had a lot of the vital shortcuts right on the main page. Now you have to dig for a lot of them. Hate that. So much hate. Miss having the shortcuts. This version shows me a lot of things I have zero interest in. Also, hate that I can't see on my sold page if I received or gave feedback without digging into the specific item. A lot more steps for everything when it was so much simpler before. SIGH. I hate when companies try to fix things that just aren't even broken...",2
1144,Love EBay! One Stop Shop For Everything!!!: Ebay is awesome! I buy and sell and receive awesome products at a great price. I love how you can bid and offer best offer. Also they sell everything and it's fun to have packages waiting for me when I come home from work. I've also made some extra money on the side selling some of my stuff on eBay so that helps out too. Customer Service is pretty great too and everything is backed by a guarantee! I'm kinda hooked. I mean who wants to pay full price when you can find hundreds sometimes thousands of better deals on EBay! Love it!!!,5
1145,Real Commerce: I have purchased everything under the sun through eBay and never really had a problem. Ive had more problems with a site that claim they have everything from A - Z and yet the shipping doesn’t perform like they claim and products aren’t really what I wanted. Sure it’s easy to return things but honestly…I never returned an eBay item. eBay customer service is the seller you buy from. I’ve been a seller when I can and I did my best to make the buyer happy. That’s commerce the American way. That’s why I give 5 stars.,5
1146,"Online shopping: I enjoy using this app shopping for various items, gifts, household supplies, jewelry, clothes - anything & everything!  Ebay makes my online shopping experience quite interesting, fun & easy. 

Returning items (which is very rare) is easy & convenient as sellers on this site value their rating making it beneficial to quickly & fairly, work with the customer to resolve any issues that may arise with purchases.

I highly recommend this app to anyone who may need or simply enjoy shopping online :)",5
1147,"Use a different option: First they take a decent portion out of the item you sell for themselves which is did not know until after selling. Secondly I posted an item and realized I put in the wrong amount in for how much I wanted to sell it for. I immediately changed it and got a confirmation email saying it was changed. Then later that day I get an email saying someone bought it for the original price. So now I had to honor his payment and sell it to him for less then it was worth, plus the 20 they took out for themselves. Don’t use eBay. Facebook marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist are all better than using eBay and you get the full amount post it for and don’t have to give a portion to them. I won’t use eBay again.",1
1148,Cheaper: I used to think everything on eBay was used. Either worn out or used up in some capacity. But I’m buying brand new items for half the cost or less!  Things I would’ve purchased either way. Don’t get me wrong I buy used items too. But I get them in near perfect condition. My children get an expensive fleece or jacket and destroy it in 6monyhs anyway. Why pay 3 times as much just to be able to pop the tag. Honestly I’m a shopper. The amount I’ve saved using this app is incredible. It’s truly addictive.,5
1149,"Don’t buy Chinese!: eBay has a serious problem with their goods coming from China. Before I buy any Chinese goods, I thoroughly read their reviews because Chinese sellers almost always post fake pictures of their crappy knock off products. I’ve wasted so much time & money thinking I’m getting one thing & getting something similar but inferior. Whether it’s the inaccurate clothing sizes (always too small), fake jewelry, inferior electronics that break at 1st use, or hideous wigs sold using stolen Instagram photos, their is almost always issues with Goods from China! eBay should not enable these Chinese thieves 🚫🇨🇳 Not to mention the ridiculous shipping wait, products that never arrive, & the crazy shipping prices since Covid.",2
1150,"Just wondering!: Have totally enjoyed the unique things that I have been able to find on eBay.
Two things that have changed that I question.  When I have purchased items from vendors outside of the US, I am still charged a tax.  The money goes to the vendor, but do they really file income tax in the US?
Second change has been the Ebay bucks.  The amount was often at a much better percentage as an incentive for the buyer.  Have not seen anything above 5% in a long while.  Plus, the tax of 5% erasers the incentive.",5
1151,"Bring back the old image viewer!: This was a good app, but in the latest update, clicking a product image opens a photo gallery of thumbnails instead of enlarging the image. This is extremely annoying. If I want a quick overview of product images, I swipe through them at the top of the listing. The only time I actually click the image is if I want to zoom in on a detail, and now doing that requires an extra click (which may not sound like much, but consider that it previously only took one total). This gets really tedious if I am quickly going through listings trying to find something specific.  PLEASE revert this!",3
1152,"It’s Ebay In An App: It’s fine. Nothing spectacular. Just ebay in an app.

One thing I would really like to see is the ability to scan the order-tracking QR codes from directly within the application. Either that or allow an order to be added to my “purchased” list by the order number or simply link it to an email address and have it automatically populate the “purchased” list. Seems like this sort of feature should be pretty standard these days.

Would be helpful for people who have employees that order items on ebay and forget to log in or grab the tracking information.",3
1153,"Ebay is awesome !!!!: I’ve gotten so many good deals on eBay, but last month I bought a motorcycle engine; FedEx lost it for a week, and then when it showed up there was a big hole in the box and a bigger hole and crack in the oil pan of the engine...Not only does eBay have your back on every purchase, if the seller doesn’t provide you with a return label, eBay will provide you with one, and if the seller doesn’t refund you within two days of receiving the product back, eBay will step in and refund you the full purchase price including shipping...!!
Now that is awesome !",5
1154,It is a ripoff to sell on ebay.: Dont sell on ebay unless you dropship from china...you will never make any money after ebay and paypal fees which are both owned by the same company. Plus a customer canceled an order and was able to leave negative feedback and i have had a 100% positive feedback since 2008. Yet i cant leave feedback for them. Buyers constantly dont pay and ebay does nothing to them and you have to do all the work to get credits for fees on listings that were never payed for. Sell on a free sight like craigslist or Facebook and save yourself a headache.,5
1155,"Do not shop with Ebay: I’ve used Ebay for 6 years now and have a 100% positive feedback rating as a seller and a buyer. I’ve sold thousands of dollars worth of items on ebay in those 6 years but I’m finished. I sold a jacket listed as size medium but when the buyer received the jacket and it didn’t fit them, they claim misrepresentation. I have the original receipt and the jacket itself says size small so the listing was correct, it was the buyer who was incorrect. Despite this, ebay takes the buyer’s side in claiming “misrepresentation” and ebay claims it is due to me not putting exact ruler measurements in the details on the listing, despite this not being require by ebay. Ended up giving a partial refund but still under the slanderous reason of “misrepresentation”. I will never use ebay again. Peace",1
1156,eBay stuck in the 90’s: App/website/mobile/classic/dashboard.... and on and on. It’s an absolute mess to try and find things in eBay. I just spent 10 mins trying to find my last months fees for items I’ve sold... never found it. For someone that occasionally uses eBay to buy and sell their app and website mix of functionality is a mess. Website feels like it’s still in the 90’s with no attention to UI. App is better but sooooo limited. You can’t see / find most settings and information. Fees and integration with PayPal is convoluted at best. I’ve been working more and more often in OfferUp for selling and buying and find it to be more user friendly and simple. eBay is looking to be heading down the path of yahoo and aol....,2
1157,"First time user problem.: I am a First time user of eBay. I had a little trouble with finding where to change my mailing address, after I had made some purchases. I did receive one item and noticed that it had the wrong mailing address. I had to contact all of the sellers to inform them of the problem after I made the address change on my eBay profile page. Did. It find the help notes for that problem on eBays help page right a way. Lucky I did some looking on my own on my own eBay profile pagers make the change. I can only hope that I still get the items that are In route.",4
1158,"Far from functional: There are many options that are not shown in the app when it comes to listings items for sale. Some options were not accessible to change information which can result in sales that end up being returned and the only one benefitting is the transportation business since buyer doesn’t get the item they want and seller ends up losing money for return shipping.
Leaving feedback is also terrible as all options are not shown. Such as there is no option to select positive or negative, it will automatically label everything a positive even if the feedback itself is negative.
How long has eBay been around? Cmon get your app working better for sellers, or make a separate app platform for sellers.",2
1159,Ebays wonderful I use it always to compare prices then I order great idea I want More !!!: Very interesting site it gives you future dates for sellers to pick what I’m more interested in what’s going on right now so if there was something that said from one to 10 days that would be interesting and then you get a reminder OK I’ve said it. I’ve done it. Let’s have more fun thank Hi A fun way to shop from the convenience of your living room have come across many many many items from tools to furniture from car parts to specialty items thank you for bringing the world to me,4
1160,"Not small seller friendly anymore: I liked the old school Ebay where you could sell what ever you had. But now I am concerned because if i ship an item, no matter how nice it is. The buyer can dispute it, get their money back, and keep the item. I have plenty of used stuff to sale but if i am going to be cheated out of my money, i should just scrap it. Last item i sold had the plain description of what it fit. The buyer said it wouldnt fit his saw which was not listed. He got his money back and kept my new bar!",5

Now I will definitely uninstall this entire useless app. Do not abide with this propaganda they all are in it. They just want your fingerprints and then they want your eye metrics. Now they will completely own your entire being now that we humbly give away our rights. This is insane. I should not have to update my ENTIRE PHONE In Order to have aces to the app which actually we are giving them the rights and access to our personal account, information, pics, email, password etc. I will just uninstall this app. We can just go back to the old fashion ways!",1
1162,"Unfair sales tax: I have a business I provided all the information to eBay I’m a major purchaser on eBay. I should have tax exemption and I keep paying taxes. I have contested it several times and have been denied. I have sent all the pertinent information in and I was denied it wouldn’t be such a difficult thing to except, but I have several friends who are also coin  business men and women who do the same thing that I do have the same type of business, and I do have the same legal paperwork that I do, and do not pay taxes to date nobody has given me a reason why you want five star rating answer that question. Sincerely, Fred Bonaccorsi.( ecenterbono)",3
1163,Great until I found this blaring breach of security and privacy: App was fine. I could even handle the occasional payment crash and inability to buy random items because of it. But I was pretty shocked when a seller called my personal phone using the phone number I provided on my account. I didnt know sellers could see that information. I thought that information was kept private. Nope it's completely public along with your personal information. I think thats a blatant lack of privacy and security.,5
1164,"Why would i want….: I appreciate that you offer things for me to view that i might not otherwise see… thats great, love that feature. But if I’m looking for a xxl tall jacket, what possible reason would you decide that would be beneficial to me and aid me in finding exactly what im looking for when you decide that looking at a extra small jacket. That’s like ordering a steak and getting something like chicken, which i won’t eat so i would just throw it away. Up or down one size just might work…. So, unless the garment came from the land of the giants, extra small just won’t cut it. Period.",4
1165,"One Stop Shopping: With the disappearance of electronics stores, Ebay has become my “go to” place for electronics, HIFI and vintage audio equipment at great prices. Simple things such as quality analog RCA cables and connectors are getting hard to find in stores. I have purchased 100s of items on EBay. In the rare occasion I may have had an issue, the seller was more than willing to accommodate. 

  I think I will also start selling items I own but no longer want. These items are in great condition and like me someone on EBay is looking for it. From what read Ebay makes it easy.",5
1166,Customer service on eBay is crap like wish: I had an item that was never received. The seller said that I had received it so eBay made me track it down instead of them taking a look at any documentation. The documentation that was sent by the seller had no ship to address which would’ve been a red flag had they even looked at it. The item actually never left India or the seller for that matter. They don’t look at anything glad I found out early before I bought anything really expensive through eBay. I gave them three stars because I have received other items but this was my first customer service experience I learn fast never again,3
1167,The reason for 2 stars by Troy Rogers: Didn’t get my lights that I ordered because I live in apartments and I didn’t take the necessary steps fast enough for eBay standards and I just got blown off by eBay and didn’t get a refund either..... but that was the only time I lost out using this website because I have always received my products offered. I think it would be a good idea to leave a note on the door saying your package has arrived or actually knock on a door instead of just supposedly sitting it in front of a door!,5
1168,"Minor flaws: I’ve been with eBay for over 20 years, but over the last few updates of this app, there are some minor annoyances. For one, you used to be able to have a cleaner “purchases” tab, in that you could hide old orders. What’s happening now is they reappear several months after the fact on the mobile app, but not if you’re using the website. You also can’t swipe to hide orders where multiple items were purchased in a single order, you have to use the “hide” click down on the actual website. I use this app on a daily basis, and it’s terrific otherwise",4
1169,"System Update to Feedback Section Request: Hello - just a quick request. It would save us buyers a tremendous amount of time and energy (not to mention the secure feeling to purchase more often) if one could go directly to the feedback of the PARTICULAR ITEM being viewed (not just the entire review section). It’s so frustrating to have to try and hunt down a particular item in one’s feedback to see if it’s of true value or not. It prevents a lot of my desired purchases if I can’t find the info rather quickly. Just a tip. Other than that, I love eBay!!!",5
1170,"Always great until this past order: Sold a very expensive item on eBay. My account has 100% positive feedback with multiple sold and purchased items. About a week and a half ago now, I sold a very expensive item. Buyer paid, money was on hold like usual, and the item was delivered. As usual, I expected to wait at most 24 hours to receive my money, since it was confirmed delivered through eBay. Well it has now been 10 days and my money is STILL on hold from eBay. And because of the covid situation, there is no one available to respond. Not through email, not through telephone, not through online chat, nothing. I’m extremely disappointed that such a great service has had such trouble transitioning.",2
1171,"Ebay since 2002: My participation on ebay has dwindled as a result of eBays insistance on globalism. Frankly, the internet is great for communication, but the reality of international forums for buisness is not efficient. Product delivery should be prompt, same as payment. Sadly, some sellers are allowed to represent products on this exchange service with little regard for the buisness agreement. Often taking weeks or months to deliver. 

A fix for this problem is to give users greater control over their personal experience with default values in their search results. If I live in the west, setting search results for the west by default would prevent unneccesary claims against untimely sellers. 

My 100% positive feedback over 17 years of buying and selling is a demonstration of character and credibility.",2
1172,"New sponsored items clogging up my search: I have used eBay for years, recently the addition of sponsored ads clog up my search to the point I get annoyed and shop or sell elsewhere.  When you try to search from low to high, you are forced to look at items that are no where close to the price you are looking at.  It ruins my experience at times and may eventually make me abandon eBay altogether.  Also as a seller, I price my items at what I feel is a good price, ebay takes it apon themselves to add make an offer to my items giving the impression that I have priced my item higher than what I expect to get for it.  I feel it leaves a bad taste in the shoppers mouth and they don’t understand this was not how I listed the item.",2
1173,Best Place to find all your needs!!!: I’ve used eBay for years. I love the fact that you can be looking for your needs and eBay will send you emails about the same items at even better prizes. eBay helps keep the sellers and buyers honest. I’ve never been disappointed with anything I buy. If there is a misunderstanding the resolution comes right after. Most items I buy I would need a truck to go pick them up. With most items being with free shipping it all comes right to my door. Sweet!!! This is my one easy one stop convenient way to shop!,5
1174,"Finally fixed problems, had to read reviews to find out: Since the last update for iPhone, the option for 30 day returns in-app had been removed. They were fully aware of this, despite the fact they were the ones who recently changed the 14 day return policy to 30 days for top rated sellers.

Problem finally resolved by eBay almost 2 months later and in order to see the changes you have to log out and back into the app, something I stumbled upon reading comments on here.

Glad its finally fixed. App seems fine now. Just wish eBay's communication was better.",4
1175,"Good app,: It's a good app. Has some things that need to be fixed. This one listing I have has multiple items. Well it continues to tell me I have two questions to answer when you click to view the item, but it's just old messages. Nothing current. I feel like that shouldn't continue to stay on the page. Also another listing a potential buyer declined my counter offer. Well it says something like ""the buyer declined your offer"", it doesn't show the active listing info that you would normally see when you open the listing. That needs to go away after the first time I view that.",4
1176,"Hard Time: Although your services enable common individuals the ability to buy/sell item they otherwise wouldn’t have the opportunity to, but here lies the problem, fees.  Make it free insertion for all items and if sold then the fee is necessary.  But if it goes unsold the seller shouldn’t have to pay any posting fees.  And treat your customers with more respect.  Your rules and regulations are so set in stone when the unfortunate instance occurs like shipping a coat to Mexico and not having any safety and thus I lost 400$ for the sale and my coat was never returned to me.  eBay did nothing to help remedy the situation so my use in your business has drastically reduced due to you lack of transparency and willingness to bend the rules.",3
1177,"Missing tons of necessary links and areas, poorly designed: Half of the things required as a seller can't be accessed on this app. Pages scroll on their own after loading, search filters randomly reset, customer support is horrendous. Not to mention ebays ridiculous fee policies, their collusion with PayPal, and the back and forth blame game between the two. Do yourself a favor and find another way to sell your items.  User beware.

WARNING: eBay policies facilitate buyer fraud on this site and as a seller your items can be bought and then broken, kept, replaced with used versions of themselves and returned by buyers, and eBay will take the money from your account no questions asked, helping these scum users steal from honest working sellers. Without integrity you have nothing, and this site has none.",1
1178,"eBay can be good, but…: eBay can be a great place to find something that’s been discontinued, but in my experience it’s grown so big that they can’t keep a watch on what I’ll call “misleading sellers” to resolve an issue. I don’t buy near the number of items I did in past years because of this and stopped selling on eBay because of people as well. I don’t expect eBay to control people with poor attitudes and business practices because it’s such a large company, but at the same time if you want good service, go to a local store. You won’t find it here and will lose your money if there’s a problem with the item. Buyer beware.",3
1179,"I do enjoy eBay however…: The USPS has been just awful.  I understand that you have no control over them, however, it it the preferred method of shipping on your platform. They won’t listen to a handful of customers but maybe EBay can accomplish something.

I ship very little compared to most sellers on here. I now have to daily check the tracking on anything I ship. This happens like 20-40% of the time. Then I have to contact the customer and explain why the cheapest form of delivery is either on time or god awfully late, lost or damaged. So I assume that there are hundreds of thousands sellers who are tired of dealing with the fallout from the subpar USPS. Put together a survey or have us sign a petition. You represent us. Together we have a bigger voice. 

The only way to really be competitive is to use the disappointing USPS and hope it shows up someday or to offer free shipping and eat the cost

Your company wonderfully connects buyers and sellers around the globe and that’s great for everyone. Please realize that",3
1180,"New Sellers: Wish they would vet Sellers more carefully and make it clear that first time transactions take longer to release funds. Am going through this with a young Seller now who refuses to mail an item because he’s under the delusion my money will be given to him before he mails the item. I have tried to explain to him that EBay has all the bases covered to stop dishonest behavior to no avail. My problem is, I bought an item for far less than it’s worth and I believe the Seller now knows this and is dragging his feet.",5
1181,"Lovin eBay except...: Love eBay but not when I can not return items especially when they smell or not to my liking I purchased a lot of stuff and for the most part I’m pretty happy I would say that I find a lot of things that I’m looking for and it’s easy to do a transaction with PayPal and most of the sellers are absolutely phenomenal and I am looking forward to 2024 with some more goodies. I just wish the shipping was not so expensive and so many items I’d buy more, if the price was right, and the shipping was less",5
1182,"It’s very buggy: I was trying to buy a broken PSP to see if I can fix it and get it for a cheaper price, but the issues are only listed in the item description section and the app doesn’t let me see that. There is a link to see the item description, but tapping it does nothing. I’ve tried resetting the app and the phone and nothing changed. I looked up the problem to see if anyone else had it and found a Reddit thread over 1 year old talking about it. So I guess eBay just doesn’t care anymore? I’m not gonna buy anything without reading the description. This is a minor bug that should’ve been fixed days after it was found. A big corporation has no excuse for letting something so major go unfixed for over a year.",1
1183,"Going downhill: Help used to be amazing with a few glitches. Now every time I open it up it’s advertising itself every listing I make is trying to upsell me on every feature. I wish there was a way to turn these things off as I’ve accidentally spent money on listings that have cost me more to sell than I made. On top of that there are a lot of things within the app that continue to break down on daily use. you think these would’ve been worked out. One inconvenience is the inability to print labels internationally through the app instead you must login on the browser, kind of like printing packing slips, should be a drop-down menu item instead of something that is only on the selling page on the web browser",1
1184,"eBay is turning into garbage: I sell 3-4 items a month, most definitely not a newbie to the platform. I deal with many different forums and apps, and never not once have I waited 30+ days to get paid until EBay and their paid Robots. They (eBay) gets their money withdrawn immediately, while the seller waits 30+ days to get their money. This app is going down the drain. I wouldn’t recommend using it, unless of course you’re a buyer but if you’re a seller please be aware because they will take you for a ride.",5
1185,"Sell item just purchased option needed for easy resale: Love eBay. I wish for easy access to long ago past purchases to make repurchasing faster to save time and spend more money!!! I also wish for the feature to return to pay all sellers at once. Soo thankful for Ebay, just wouldn’t buy another car without seeing it first, lost over 10k in fraudulent car and buyer protection did not cover 10k of the 20k loss.

1186,"Great app!!: I am a Seller on eBay and I can run my whole business from this app! The eBay app developers are very responsive to sellers wants and needs and are willing to revamp the app and have done so many times. I feel very confident running my business through my phone from this app.

I also buy a lot on eBay and the ease of finding what I want by scrolling through this app. This has taken Ebay to the next level! You get detailed information on the seller as well as easily reachable customer service.",5
1187,"Still worth having: eBay has changed a lot in twenty years and definitely not all for the better! 
The app however aside from being yet again forced to update a perfectly working version, is still a decent place to at least look for and checkout stuff you may purchase.
 Buying in the app is still good but what’s a major gripe is purchasing history just being lost and discarded by eBay (not even saved within the app!!)

So for example a year ago roughly you bought an air conditioner or auto part, who knows but now you need to find that purchase for whatever reason? Good luck!!!",3
1188,"Good app - hoping to see more features soon: I really enjoy using the app. It’s easy to search for items and list items as well. I do wish that you were able to do some of the things you can do in the desktop version on the app. For example, when printing a shipping label there is no option to print a packing slip from the app. I have to use the desktop version. If there’s a way you can do this that I don’t know about I would love to know! Thank you for all the hard work on the app.",5
1189,"Happy Ebayer: Love your excellent customer service! I’m never disappointed in dealing with representatives!
     I do have one complaint. I do not think it is fair a customer can leave negative feedback without making any contact so we are aware there is a problem. A client left me negative feedback with no communication and no proof of claim, which I am now stuck with. I am not able to LEAVE THEM negative feedback which is also wrong in my opinion. Other than that I really love eBay and recommend it to my family and friends, thanks for such great service!

However I went to a jewelry shop and they confirmed that it is fake, I requested a return on eBay but they immediately cancelled my request and closed my case without contacting me and just being pure biased on the seller side. The seller said no deception was made as they put 14k marked and eBay said the item was as described. Even though I keep giving them statements of it not being real gold. eBay just decided to ignore my emails, I’ve come to conclusion that this is a biased cased. Poor customer service, you’re lucky if you know an eBay representative to help your case wether you’re a buyer or seller.

1. i cannot send messages to any user. this is an option on the computer, but not mobile? why? if someone sends me an offer, and i want to message them, i have to hope that they have an item listed and then i have to message them through their site. inefficient. at LEAST have the option of sending messages to people who send offers

2. listing an item is a real pain. i sell basketball jerseys, many of which are extremely rare , there might currently be none on ebay. it doesn’t help me at ALL that ebay wants to simplify my experience by finding a jersey that is a similar to make me have to do less steps. i get it, it’s a useful tool, but just have it as an option (simplified listing vs advanced listing where you can do the specifics).

these are really simple fixes. please consider them",5
1192,"Where is the support for sellers?: Have been verbally abused , lied to by buyers, asked for assistance after written abuse by a buyer who I accommodated when they couldn’t pay on time, and begged for a manager to call and have received ZERO response. Why are you not calling me back?????
So a buyer who orders the wrong size on their end can demand not only their money back but also can leave negative feedback??? I did everything correctly, refunded despite it was their issue for ordering incorrect size ....and I am left with negative feedback that you have not even responded to after I asked for it to be revoked. In what world is that permissible!!!!

I keep asking for a manager to help me out. No response. None.
I know other eBay sellers who are very unhappy or ready to leave, and frankly I’m starting to really get that itch as well.

Call ME back. That’s all I ask. For help. Because sellers are YOUR CUSTOMERS TOO. Don’t forget that. We are your base.",5

If you touch the screen to scroll and tap a photo it drags the photo around. Was this developed by a 9-year-old kid? It’s completely non-functional and completely ruins the experience of trying to browse and scroll. Lose this feature, is it really worth ruining the entire mobile EBay experience? Because I gave up after trying to browse for 5 minutes and couldn’t even scroll through search results.",4
1195,Addictive: I didn't 5 star because I spend entirely way to much time on this app. The reason why is because there are so many items and links to similar items like customer also viewed links or I will see something that I get totally off track and hrs have gone by. It's definitely a good way to fix the boredom and to spend money on due to so many good deals!!!! Ok so I am?new to this still and I hope I get better on time management skills and the urge to buy so much. Great place to do Christmas Shopping!!!!!,5
1196,Where else?: Where else can I buy and sell so many amazing things that normal stores would never have? Where else can I buy something from a moment of my history that would otherwise be lost? Ebay makes the impossible possible! Ebay brings me so much joy through letting me reconnect to the things I've lost and also by letting me make a living by allowing me to sell things for a living. I'm never not on my ebay app and I wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you and here's to the future!,5

Their support ignores me and disconnects mid conversation, pretends to forward to manager, and I never hear back. I am not told when I am being sent to collections and there is no possible way to dispute this as they do not allow it. It has been years since I refused to pay a fee for an item I did not sell and now they threaten to impact my credit from something in 2022 by sending me to collections.. over not selling an item.

1198,"WHY, JUST WHY?: Your newest app update did NOT make searching easier.  Why would you remove the option of selecting items location?  Previously I would select location USA only and then when doing my initial search I knew I was looking at items within the USA only so I could easily like an item (without opening it) to review listing & Sellers other items later.   Now I have to sort through items from every location, actually open the listing, scroll down to where shipping from before I can even decide if I want to save or not.  Having to do this is a complete waste of my time.  It also limits my seeing Sellers I may be interested in buying from as after about the 2nd or 3rd non USA location I quit even looking.",1
1199,Stupid Policies That Make No Sense: I’ve sold over $5000 of stuff on here. Holding funds FOR A MONTH for a sale you already took your eBay fee out of before giving me my cut on the basis that I don’t have “significant history” with Ebay is absurd. I have a perfect seller rating. I have sent all my packages ahead of time with nicely padded boxes. And to be quite honest my pricing has been a great value to buyers. Ask those who have bought from me. Run my credit. Do a criminal background check. Interview my third grade teacher. You won’t find a single financial thing against me on this earth. You are playing with other people’s money. You wouldn't even pass the terms of a modern home loan because of how much wealth that isn’t yours you are attempting to float and leverage.,1

I maybe old, but I am not senile. Also at my age, I grew up with the “the customer is always right” philosophy. 
I get tired of typing in a search for an item, hitting search ; THEN having to to hit the “search instead for……” because you search for the item you think I want first, instead of what I want first. 
Program your APP to search for what the customer wants first, THEN ask if they are searching for what IT thinks you are looking for!",4
1202,"Doesn’t follow their own policies: I had a listing removed due to not following their policies. During the discussion with their representative, they sent me the policy in question as to why it was removed. When I pointed out the fact that the next paragraph lists the exception to the policy, the representative told me that she had made her point and ended the chat.

This is just the most recent problem in 10 years of selling on the platform. Their customer service is terrible and their high fees have made this platform unsustainable for small time sellers.

The only reason I still sell on here is because of the audience they have built up over the years. If there was any similar sites to sell on, I would drop eBay without any second thoughts.",1
1203,"Love eBay!: However, when shopping I have to pay attention to where the item is coming from! Not only are some items in other countries it also has to go through Customs which lengthens the time it takes to get!
Once you receive the merchandise and if it’s missing something or defective or you just plain want to return, the sellers overseas are absolutely a nightmare to deal with and I’ll try to never buy from one of them again!
Other than the issues above eBay is a decent place to locate everything and anything.",4

1205,"Mobile User Experience is dreadful: As a seller, eBay has fully taken away my ability to use the app as a means to create listings. A once user friendly mobile version of eBay, now there are so many bugs and errors while trying to create a listing I physically haven’t been able to post any of my products. I always offer Free Shipping on every order, and there is some new glitch in the app that will prevent sellers from being able to offer this. As soon as you make something Buy It Now, the option to ship for free literally disappears in front of your very eyes. This is how I’ve been listing my products since 2013. Why they decided to only allow for “eBay shipping” is beyond me, but I will sell on other mediums as a result.",1

The first time I got scammed was on a Leica macro lens for about 800 bucks. Then I got scammed out of a pressure cooker for 70 bucks. This is also not to mention I’ve been scammed as a seller. Someone pulled the buy one, get one free scam on me. Saying I only sent one, when in fact I did send two and couldn’t prove it cuz it only had one tracking number. I also couldn’t leave negative feedback on his account cuz I feared he would retaliate and leave negative feedback on my account. This system is a joke lol.

I was able to get a response immediately from the seller about my cancellation and carried on a short conversation with him.  This new system works well for me. Much faster than the old method of communication.  Thanks.",5

Funny thing is offer up another mobile app wouldn’t take the money you make, unfortunately it’s the only app people feel most trusted yet like the tax people they are just making money off you by taking yours. No taxes applied expect to get hit with that to during tax time. Can’t support an app that doesn’t support you even when you make them $100’s of dollars. They just keep taking. Personally should let ebay drown can choose to use it but expect anything around $800+ sold will be around $120 ebay takes in (fees) MySpace Facebook instagram all things you can use as a platform to market sale but ebay is trash.",1

1211,Being too personal: I don’t like that y’all are going through our messages and determining who we can or can not talk to off of this app.?. If we choose to make friends with someone on this app that should be our own choice. You guys take our info and sell it to folks that I don’t like but I have to deal with that to use your app. But I think it’s a sign of communist rule the way you are treating us. I’m so sick of the way we get treated by apps like you and Facebook and PayPal. All of the bigger players. But most of us don’t say anything because we use these apps.       Jeffrey,4

I’ve had bots with no profile pic and 0% rating “purchase” items from me and then never pay. That causes me as a seller to lose money if I promoted the item, then lose time to re-list because I have to wait to cancel the order for non-payment. There used to be an option where sellers could restrict/reject those kind of accounts from making purchases but it seems to have gone away.

Well the photo is an jpeg i can see it. Ok so maybe the size too big, downloaded some image resize app, and reduced the size to 600kb. Again tried it, but nop still not accepting the image.

Love EBay and would love eBay to provide me with all time %65 off all products for ever! eBay bay!",5
1215,My review: I’ve been using the app for the past couple of years and I like it for the most part.  Being able to scan barcodes has really made listing items go a lot faster.  The one thing I don’t like about it is that if an item doesn’t sell after a set period then it automatically adjusts your listing to allow offers.  I should be the only one with the ability to make adjustments to my own listings.  I don’t appreciate having to waste time changing them back.,5
1216,Review: Ebay is great except one thing. I was admitted to the hospital twice this year and wasn’t able to pay on time so I was classified as a non payer however I did end up buying the items. You see I have lung cancer and I have had three lung cancer surgeries I have developed pneumonia twice this year which landed me in the hospital twice. No questions whether there was a problem just restricted my buying. I have bought thousands of dollars worth of stuff but that is not taken into consideration. It has really upset me.,5
1217,"Changes made just for the sake of change: Often the app is changed for no good reason which just makes it harder for users rather than being an improvement. A good example is the recent change to the order invoices. Previously we could print a combined invoice and mailing label on one page. Now you’ve made a change that requires printing two pages to do the same thing. This is not an improvement. Similarly, the search function was changed and now requires re-selecting the category for every new search. How does that make it better for the user?  It doesn’t.",4

It seems like it started when they cut ties with PayPal, I pretty much had a pretty good experience up until then, they started changing things, the selling fees are ridiculous. I kind of feel robbed, for example I sold a boutique dress for $25, paid for shipping myself and only got $7 back 😳 smh. Let me mention, there’s  little to no support, when it comes to sellers, there’s no one you can even speak with, when I faced any problems or trouble, I really felt helpless.

Clearly the system was using UTC or another similar time zone but not converting it to my time zone. I reached out to support, and they responded with a generic “thank you for your suggestion, but we are not allowed to take your suggestion” (or something along those lines). This was a BUG I was pointing out, but eBay isn’t set up to hear about bugs or have a human conversation about it. I found a few other bugs and same response. Ehhh.",4
1220,No Payment Options in App?!: Pretty inconvenient that I can’t even update a payment method with such a popular website. Some apps are so convenient there’s nothing you can’t do but with ebays app you can only update addresses. Time for an update eBay sorry. Only reason you got 3 stars is because I use you so much but the app needs an update. Work on it please. I’m tempted in giving you two stars because of how inconvenient it is to have to go to the website and even put a review just so this gets addressed.,5
1221,Payment not excepted: I’ve tried to purchase multiple items on eBay over the past week and about every other item that I’ve tried to purchase the purchase has not gone through. There’s plenty of money on my card but the purchases are kicked back. Some purchases go through. I know the card works. eBay has some sort of glitch that they need to fix because sellers are losing money because of this and buyers are losing the opportunity to purchase because of this. This is a huge problem and I am almost to the point where I will quit using eBay.,4

I’ve only received about half of the feedback from my items sold even though I’ve had probably 160 successful sales. This way people that buy from me can see that I’ve actually sold more than people have left feedback for.

The ability to handle shipping labels is not as flexible as the classic site. Also you don’t have an option to print a packing slip.",5

I’m in San Diego couple hours south. Then two day later it shows the exact same status in the same location and nor a tracking number was said to be provided? Yet still remains In limbo I think still in Inglewood. So if it was showing progress on the 28th then nothing happened for two days and showed the package as shipped then two days later on the 30th now showing a tracking number provided and still in the same location then how was it able to be determined shipped on the 28th when it had no tracking number til the 30th ?

1229,"Does not take Authenticity Seriously: eBay used to be awesome when it comes to making sure the items listed are authentic.

I have reported dozens of these, pointing out exactly why they are fake, and the eBay team is not removing the listing. The only reason anyone uses eBay is because they used to do a good job with authenticity. The fake games are popping up first on your search engine.

1235,"Helps bad buyers and punishes sellers: This app, and eBay as a service, have made their app and site benefit bad buyers by removing any visible way of reporting bad buyers - those who bid and don’t pay, commit to buying and don’t pay, or who try fraudulent methods to get products from people following the rules. 

You can only leave positive feedback, even for the deadbeats. Yes, you can submit a report, but this isn’t visible to sellers nor does it ensure any repercussions whatsoever. The language of the reports say if enough of these reports are submitted for a seller there “may” be restrictions placed on their account. Wow, what a punishment.

1236,"eBay app & service: The app is pretty straight forward and easy to navigate. I’ve been using it to sell more than to buy. Makes selling easier than in the past (when things were done on a desktop). Scanning items is a major time savor! Awesome job eBay team. 

My complaint is more with their fees- very pricey in my opinion. Out of $108 that I’ve accrued in sales, eBay has taken more than $24 and that does not include shipping cost (that’s separate). 14.5% is the fee for media- seems very high to me. I think this also causes prices to be inflated for buyers, in that sellers are incentivized to price up due to the higher fees.",3
1237,"Fees are too high, but otherwise.. Good place to sell: The fees for selling are astronomically high; they are about ~13% for sellers. It’s far too high considering shipping and shipping materials still have to be dealt with by the seller. A far more reasonable percentage would be about half that value. 

Besides that, I’ve had decent success and help with eBay support and it’s a pretty simple app. There are scammers on eBay and I have had issues, but eBay support has always been helpful in getting these issues resolved. Be vigilant. Be safe. Make sure you use the star rating system and review sellers and buyers to help others identify who is and isn’t a scammer.",3
1238,"L o v e  eBay: eBay has worked exceptionally well from the buyer’s perspective. Amazing items, sometimes difficult to find, many times at amazing prices. Occas there have been snafus. Then there were some seriously impressive responses.

So now the seller gets double payment for an item I never received. This customer service makes me sick.

1243,If you are making an app...: If you are making an app that you want people to use to make purchases especially multiple purchases then make it user friendly to do so.  The continued inability to “request an invoice” to get combined shipping or discounts from a seller is absolutely stupid.  This shortfall has been identified by many people and yet it has not been fixed- listen to the buyers and the sellers and get this corrected or you will continue to loose customers to other resale websites that do listen!,5
1244,"Opt Selection: This is the most diverse as well as pay able diversity in the world. I am balancing nutrition per superior blood test (selecting optimal foods from categories) and using body assessment test (revealed skinny fat though I look lean and less than optimal muscle weight distribution) to see results of nutrition and exercise (International Masters competitor age 73). 

Thank you for providing optimal choices to help this and I’m sure many otherS succeed. Nutrition more important than great exercise programs because it enableS recovery and so brutal training can reoccur again and again until we’re done.",5
1245,"Many Great Features But Synchronization Lags: The app has a bunch of great features like barcode scanning / searching for comps. It Also is very handy when needing to update listings on the go. 

However, when you reply to messages or offers there is a significant (hours long) delay before they show up on desktop / browser based access. So messages remain “new” even after being replied to on another access point. Just keep in mind that updates may not show up and you could end up making duplicate replies to the same message.",4
1246,"eBay: eBay is an excellent site with a plethora of articles to please  everyone and at very good prices. The only recommendation that l can give them is to filter those items that will not be shipped to the US or its territories from these sites;  it is frustrating finding a wanted item at a good price and when ordering, finding  out then that it will not be shipped to your destination. 
Aside of the foregoing minor enhancement that could be done to  eBayś platform, I highly recommend it, moreover when they immediately intervene  to resolve to your satisfaction any problem that may arise.",4
1247,"I like it but it doesn’t give you enough saved😡For items you want to follow.: It Needs improvement for feedback. I need more time I hate when I go to leave feedback for a delayed mail order due to COVID and I can no longer give them the excellent rating they derserve!

Which means you aren’t able to give them their feedback rating when it arrives😡",5
1248,"Terrible customer service, terrible policies: All I was trying to do was to sell a men’s wallet. My account was suspended without notice or reason. It was immediately repealed, but I had to make a new account to reach out about my banned account. I re-list the item after the agent verified I was okay to re-list, and I was banned in less than 24 hours, and this time a permanent ban. When I asked customer service to detail why I was banned, they refused to tell me. They refused to tell me why I was banned the first time as well. When I asked for a phone number, I was told that their phones were too busy and that they were not going to provide me with a number to call.

I don’t think I would ever return to Ebay, and my friends and families will at least know of the experience.",1

To eBay for watching out for us buyers and keeping everything safe and legit. Shouldn’t be needed but sadly are, and I thank you for being there for me, my family and everyone I deal with.

The reality is not all sellers are honest but ebay is, they make up for the small percentage of bad sellers out there. I simply do not ever worry. If I don’t get what I ordered in a timely manner, I get my money back. It is a simple as that. 98% of the time everything arrives as described on time. Do yourself a favor and check to see if ebay has it first. You won’t be sorry, I promise!! 10,000 purchases so far!",5

The details kept prepopulating with incorrect information it “thought” was corrects based on my details entered. I cleared selection in color for example, cleared materials, then the color would come back, clear, materials would come back. Ughhh. Then when I saw it was wrong after listing, I tried more edits and listed, all the images were gone. Edit, list. Now I have two listings! Edit, delete, my details are gone and shipping has been reset and my PRICE was reset to like $10!! I finally was able to get to a laptop and fix this all before anyone bid. This is a nightmare! Never using again. Don’t even open your listings, it will edit them all!",1

The only choice away from using PC unfortunately ...  more disadvantages than advantages for the app ... be aware of limited functions.... also, the app will freeze when viewing pictures (only workaround is to shut off phone and restart) ... would be great if there was a back AND forward page option when navigating... be also aware that if you're selling on mobile version that eBay does a lot of micromanaging for you (by selecting options for you).",2

1256,"A star is brightest before it dies out…: eBay was once a respected platform. They lead the world into online shopping. This app, however, has lead them out of the lead and into the last corral. The app never notifies you of anything you set it up to. Because of the chaos it is my opinion and within my right to report that it is a fact that eBay changes your listings parameters, I’ve never had a listing shipping be paid for by myself yet the last two sold orders had me as the provider. If you’re looking for a decent online platform, this app is only suggested for the headless who have no clue what they’re doing and/or don’t care about how much money they will end up getting.",2

I called them two week on the row. They kicked me back-and-forth. None of them want to responsible on that so I don’t even want to give them any star and is make me so obsessed and no trust about where you put your money and how you buy with all the stuff on online like that, no responsible company even with the banking constitution.

1258,"Avoid eBay: For starters, it was difficult to to put up a listing.  I had to call them just to get a listing up and to remove a block. 
I finally got my listing up only days later to find out my account was permanently suspended. You would think I defrauded someone or committed murder. When I called to ask why my account was suspended they said they said they can’t say why and it couldn’t be appealed. I asked what is the policy so that I can follow the rules, they said they couldn’t say and they suspended me because I was a risk to the community. I was in utter shock. Avoid this company. The thing is I wasn’t even asking to appeal the decision, I just wanted to know why my account was suspended. I have had eBay since 2019 and account suspended without warning.",1
1259,"NEVER AGAIN.: I’ve had an eBay account for 15+ years. I usually don’t use it to sell, as its much cheaper to sell on c-List or FB marketplace.. I’m not giving a bad review because they charged me $40 bucks on a sale less than 300. Or even that their “shipping calculator” underestimated the shipping cost by about 35%.. Im writing this because the item has been sent, buyer has said they’ve received it and is VERY happy, but since i chose not to use eBay’s $9 pre-made label (to try and off set the high seller fee and in accurate shipping estimate) They won’t release my funds for over 2 weeks. Have called twice and the employee just says “it’s the system and they’re sorry, if you use the pre made label you can get your funds quicker usually.” Bummer eBay.",1

I found maps and annual reports for the United Light & Power Company and it’s subsidiary the Iowa-Nebraska Light & Power Company. I even found an HO scale tank car painted for Dow Chemical’s Midland Division. Most models are marked for their Pittsburg, California and Freeport, Texas facilities. 

I have also purchased some hard to find model ships and planes.",5
1261,"Its easier to use this app than the desktop: I find listing with the app a lot easier than my computer. There are some features that are a little buggy- like how it wants to predict the title of what I’m trying to sell - and if there is no match it’s easier just to pick one and change it rather than force it to let you make a new one. 

But the ability to wipe out the background, make revisions and post directly from my phone makes this very user friendly.",5
1262,"Communication: eBay paranoia:
The company is so afraid a customer will try and go around and collude with the seller that some transactions are not completed. For example, I can’t explain to the seller that because the item is so far away and they want to charge $425 shipping moreover, I have to pay sales tax on the item and my company has a resale number which I can’t use on this transaction. Maybe if you passed this on the seller we might be able to strike  a deal. Not being able to communicate makes negotiating impossible!
Thanks for listening if you are!",4

I tried deleting my account, but it ended up suspended instead. Recently I decided I’d give eBay a second chance to sell some extra things and I couldn’t use my old account, I waited a few days for an email to unsuspend my account but nothing, and then I tried making a whole new account but they immediately took it down too.

I have recently been trying to sell things I no longer need, but there are wayyyy to many scammers to make it worth my time to use eBay. I have been having to continuously re-list items that scammers pretend to pay for but when they don’t pay and try to get you to ship your item without payment it creates an enormous hassle and waste of time because they never had any intent to actually pay for the item. This causes the seller to waste more than a weeks worth of time selling an item. Ebay needs to fix itself before I use them again.",1
1266,"It’s great...but: If you thought that you can just buy any item with a gift card your wrong, this is the thing that I hate about ebay; you have to put in your credit card information in order for you to actually use the gift card, it’s like what even is the point of getting a gift card when you have to put down all this information down, EBay if you actually want to improve I suggest you have a option where we could add a gift card WITHOUT ADDING A CREDIT CARD",5

I know I can refine my search to items only in the USA, but I wish there was a filter to only buy from people and companies in the USA. Some items say it ships from the USA but the company is located in China. I think there there should be a filter to only buy from people in the USA and from US companies.

1270,"Best selling site: I have been a member since 2002 and eBay is the greatest. Great communication from sellers. Some sellers are so responsive, they will customize things for you. Easy to see true ratings of sellers and buyers. Best prices of any site, because of worldwide competition. You can filter where you want to see items origin points. Easy to “Buy It Now”, especially when using PayPal. ALWAYS USE PAYPAL!! I can not stress that enough. Extremely secure. But, I digress. eBay is sensational. If you can’t find it on eBay, you didn’t need it anyway.",5

1272,"My shopping at EBay review: I always recommend before buying from anyone to check EBay’s prices before you buy expensive things from any other place. Since I have been a member I have saved at least a thousand dollars or more. Note, I always check the sellers rating before buying an item. I never have trouble with the sellers. Ebay is an amazing place to shop and sell as well. EBay has made my shopping experience much better. I never thought I could save so much money before but with EBay I have done just that.",5
1273,"I love the Ebay app!: I love the Ebay app. I use it to not only buy but I also use it to sell! I manage every aspect of my selling from watching my listings, listing new items, leaving feedback for customers, shipping my packages, and answering customer questions. The only thing I wish they would do is add the ability to go on vacation mode as a seller on the app. Currently, I have to log on to the Ebay site from my home computer to make my status as away and setup vacation mode. It would be amazing to have this feature integrated into the app!",5
1274,"Needs some tweaking...: Honestly a great app to use for buying and selling but.....I find it very frustrating that so far (on the mobile app) once an item has gone 2 months past a purchase date, it becomes “unavailable.” I find that absurd and ridiculous for many reasons. One being I sometimes tend to want to re-purchase an item. I do not tend to save every seller I purchase from, so when I go back to my purchase history, it’s unavailable to even click on the item which could help sellers for people wanting to rebuy anything from them afterwards. Bad business right there.",4
1275,"Auctions and Wish List: Recently, as in within the last few hours, the app hasn’t been working. I can’t enter any auction- not because of the buyers limit either. It keeps telling me to place a higher “highest bid” but no amount is high enough apparently. My wish list is also messed up, with all my items no longer having the selections for what I wanted to buy. They only have the “buy it now” “add to cart” and “watch item” options. I’m honestly really confused, and won’t be purchasing anything until that is fixed because I want to make sure I’m buying the item I actually want. And I’d love to actually be able to participate in auctions...",3
1276,Still can’t list from the app: I had contacted eBay months ago about this problem.  Once I fill in the details field for a listing and hit the back arrow the app freezes and tells me the details field is empty.  I then close the app and go to the eBay website to complete the listing.  This happened when there was a glitch affecting many users.  After a few days I received a call from eBay saying the glitch had been repaired but I still receive the same error message even after shutting down the phone and reinstalling the app and all the other quick fixes.  It’s not a life changing problem but it sure is inconvenient.,3
1277,"They are trying !: I guess when trying to fix old bugs, they create new ones. There are some delay issues when trying to see your purchases within the last 60 days and sometimes those lists will not allow users to delete items from them. Also wish Ebay would allow some kind of option to add the auction to your calendar so you don’t miss it before it closes like the old blackberry app. A more visible text option in the app would be great!

But yet after 15 days you still cannot verify I’m a legitimate business . You are holding my money hostage for over 4 weeks because my eBay account address is different than my business license address . Its the same building !!!!  eBay has turned into a bunch of scammers since tech purchased the original eBay . I’m not a happy guy .

I’m so tired of getting 40 notifications a day from listings I’ve liked and it’s super frustrating that I can’t turn off buyer notifications/alerts for watched items and seller offers. If you’ve going to charge sellers such a hefty fee you need to actually make the platform worth it. Also, it’s incredibly frustrating and shady that you hold funds from sellers that haven’t reached double digit numbers of sales even after your item has shipped and you’ve gotten good feedback. Funds should automatically release after good feedback. Such a convoluted site.",1
1280,"Please add a “request total” button: People have been begging for this function for years, yet it’s still available only on desktop. I have to believe it’s because eBay is incentivized to NOT put it in since sellers end up refunding the extra shipping costs, but eBay doesn’t refund them any of the fees they’ve collected.

In general, this is a really solid app, but making it so hard for buyers and sellers to handle combined shipping is such a glaring deficiency, I have to knock it down a couple of stars.",5

If you are looking at items in your shopping cart and you click on an item, you can’t click back to get to your cart, it goes somewhere else. Something so obnoxious yet so simple. Even things like the “X” close out button being at the top left of every lusting. The farthest point to reach your thumb on your phone, and phones are bigger now. You have to adjust your hand to close out. Little things. Quality control and innovation needs a lot of improvement",3

All was good until my listings disappeared from the Sellers tab.  All it showed was Start Selling Now.  No more Active Tab.  Scared me, thought they got deleted some how.  Signed in online thru desktop and found they were still there.  Looks like a bug in the app.  I signed out of the app, deleted and reinstalled and still no luck.

It's also less convenient to see when there are new items for a saved search.

I appreciate that; however, word of caution —Beware of “non refundable items” and take care when purchasing jewelry items with diamonds for I purchased 1 carat diamond earrings that was gorgeous on website but the items sent to me were lack luster with diamonds so cloudy and cheap looking that I was totally embarrassed. What made the situation worse is that they were non refundable.",4
1297,"Update. The search engine is a joke.: Yup. Wonderful mandatory update. Crashes non stop. Are you in a competition with other companies to write the worst app possible? Make it simple, make it work or hire someone that can. You just keep getting worse not better. Its like walking through a store where they dump random products they hope you’ll buy on the floor that you’ll trip over while trying to find the items you actually want. I just don’t get it. Its also slower than before too. So it makes me wonder, do you pay people to give a 5 star rating? Seems like you'd have to to avoid the truth.
  Could you stop showing that you have search results when you don’t? That would be a nice improvement.",1
1298,"Why add more bloat (Vault, MyCars)?: Long-time eBay user and seller.
Generally, the app works smoothly, with one major caveat: the repeat adding of cluttering, useless niche functions.

I never have, never will use Vault (a sort-of catalogue for baseball cards). Now we’ve had My Cars forced on us. All this bloats the app’s size and makes navigation more and more cluttered.

With the latest update, your received feedback shows chronically oldest to newest. Why on earth would I want to see a comment from six months ago, without being able to see the most recent feedback at all (there is no “Sort By…” function)? More and more, I’m forced to use mobile browser + desktop view in order to access certain functions.

So… great bones, but can’t we please have optional features (Vault, Cars…) as add-on apps to be separately downloaded if desired by the user?

Lastly, not a fan of the infinity feed; wish we could have pagination re-instated. One thumb swipe and you lose your spot forever.",3
1299,New and improve eBay: With eBay’s new auto fitment program.   I’ve been able to find tons of parts that actual fit my vehicles   With any new program you still have a chance of getting the wrong part but their new system keep the chances very low.  They stand behind the buyer and work with sellers to avoid any problems and resolve problems quickly if they arise.  I’ve been happily impressed by the new system and continue to use eBay as my go to parts place.,5

Low and behold I was sent a broken product and I will not be getting my money back PLEASE refrain from using eBay it’s not like it used to be. Use MERCARI or some other entity that ACTUALLY cares if you’re scammed out of hard earned money. They actually help you out.  eBay on the other hand LOVES scammers but, that doesn’t mean you have to buy from them. If you don’t believe me then a buy a  product from them and see how they respond if it turns out to be broken. I’m surprised I wasn’t charged a fee for not even enjoying my product. eBay is not your friend…TRUST ME!!!",1
1302,"What happened to the new search options since yesterday?: The new search for looking for new items on your saved searches disappeared. I was just getting used to it. I noticed that the searches go outside of the search parameters to pick up items that have nothing to do with the search.

While I support the idea of buyer protection and fighting fraud they are absolutely terrible and incompetent in my eyes. Let me know if I am wrong please.",5
1304,"eBay is terrible for sellers, their employees encourage buyers to make false claims: If you happen to come across a buyer who loves fraud then you’re in big trouble as representatives encourage buyers to file false claims without contacting the seller. You as a seller will lose your item as they will always side with the buyer. Without sellers there is no buyers, I guess eBay’s representatives are forgetting this. eBay stop hiring representatives who love to encourage theft. Stop allowing buyers to ruin your sellers. Try Mercari as they have they same rules for both, buyers and sellers.",5

Why can’t we see 3 message folders when we click on messages. Inbox, sent, and my folder. And we click what we want to see. Why are photos of items now in album mode? Before it was optional. Now we have to click on a photo again to zoom in. And the back button twice just to back out. Not user friendly at all. It’s always some developer forcing changes on us just to make it seem like they’re  working and improving the app. But y’all are NOT! Why can’t y’all ask the users what we want for a change!!!",2
1306,Worse selling platform jus switch to Facebook: I’ve been selling on eBay since 2011 and today I decided to go on strike and delete my account all together. I will no longer buy or sell eBay. The Chinese and Indians have over run that app with false information and jus bad business all together. The fees are outrageous and there app is outdated. Phone app never works and doesn’t work for everything. I’ve so many of my honest reviews taking down by whatever bit they use to make these decisions. They don’t care about there sellers. All the care about this ur money. I wish everyone over night would jus get off eBay jus to really show them who holds the power. The people not eBay. I will never be back here again.,1

There have been lots of changes over the years for the better. eBay is so streamlined now it’s the perfect place to shop in my opinion. If there are competitors I wouldn’t know because eBay fulfills my needs and has what I’m looking for right away or will have it. I love it here!",5

The buyer wanted $20 refund less than 2 minutes after shipping said it was delivered stating he’d already taken it to a phone store to have them check out the battery and paid $20 for it. When I refused, buyer disputed with PayPal who refunded his money and told him to ship the phone back to me. He shipped me three scented pine trees to hang from the rear view mirror. I lost $100 and it was not worth the hoops I would have to jump through to dispute though I did take pics and send them the details but they did nothing. I will NEVER do business on eBay again. eBay and PayPal get double the fees and are owned by the same parent company and do nothing to protect the seller. Moving to other forums to sell.",1
1312,"eBay is nothing but scammers and fake accounts: I haven’t used eBay in a couple years but decided to use it to sell some electronics I no longer need. All I have received is messages  from fake accounts asking me to text them or for my paypal email to complete the purchase outside of eBay. I accepted an offer from someone who later turned out to be a scammer and I now have to wait 4 days for the unpaid item claim to go through when I should be able to flag them somehow and move on with my listing. eBay makes it extremely difficult to flag accounts, they say they scan messages for fraudulent behavior but all I receive are fraudulent messages. This needs to be addressed. I am currently looking for another site to sell my items as this is going nowhere.",1
1313,"The App has gone down hill with LESS functionaity: I have never bothered to write an app review. I primarily like to use ebay as an app and not on my computer. It has lost functionality and has even changed with even less options. With more people using mobile, why would they make this LESS functional. 

I like my many of my “buy it now” items to have a day limit of of 7 or 10 days. I find I have more success selling. I can no longer chose on the app and they are listing as forever. Not only that, but even if I save as a draft on my computer and go to upload pictures from my phone, it changes my listing from a limited amt of days to “until cancelled”. This makes no sense. I should have all listing options available in app. I take photos from phone. Why would you force me to desktop to complete? 

This is why although Poshmark takes a higher percentage, I prefer to sell many items there. Their app is simple and FULLY FUNCTIONAL. You are giving up sales buy making these changes. 

Get with the times Ebay. People like using apps.",2
1314,"Great for buying, less so for selling.: First off, the app and store are great. Wonderful for finding bargains in anything you would like to buy. For sellers, however, the app is less promising. First, eBay and PayPal together take enormous amounts of fees (up to 33%, in my experience). This eats at profits quickly, and drastically lowers profit margin. This is somewhat remedied by publicity in the market over its obscure or localized counterparts. Second, the html is not supported, so html documents must be done on a PC. Third, drafts don’t sync quickly over multiple devices and every once in a while glitch.",5
1315,"Some change is GOOD!: But to mess with everything is a little much!  For example, I just wanted to look for a certain make and model of car….. but eBay makes it nearly impossible to find ANY particular vehicle!  It is all so overly complicated.  It used to be easy to shop and sale items on your site, but for whatever reason your company has sabotaged itself and you are certainly paying the price…. or rather your shareholders are.  Make it simple again!",5

- so I contact the buyer - we made an agreement to wait until the end of the week to see if the item gets delivered. In the meantime - ebay apparently ignored the messages the buyer and I sent back and forth agreeing to a solution the problem and just issued a refund! Now the buyer has a refund and will likely get the item and I’m out an item and the $ — please tell me how this is fair!!!! I will wait for your response!!

1320,My EBay experience: I have been with eBay since 2015. I love the EASY ACCESS to all of my past purchases. Having such easy recovery to all information  at the tip of my fingertips is awesome in a pinch. Knowing EBay backs up the seller and the buyer and is there to help and gives full disclosure is PEACE of MIND. E bay has never let me down no matter what I have looked for in their search engine. The comparison shopping and having an option to buy used with knowledge of a return policies is the deal breaker. Thank you eBay,5

I’m on it every day all day off and on it is my go to but the last couple years been very disappointed when you do the eBay calculation for shipping is ridiculous I don’t buy because of that.

1330,"Glitch makes app unusable for book traders: I LOVE eBay and normally don’t leave bad reviews, but this glitch has existed for weeks now and still hasn’t been fixed. When browsing in the book category, “fiction” and “nonfiction” no longer appear, which essentially disables users from browsing through books. This is especially problematic for book traders/collectors such as myself that depend on eBay. The antiquarian and collectible book section is still accessible, but many collectible books today are not antique and are often listed under regular fiction, which can’t be accessed unless I specifically search for a title of author name in the entire books category. Please please please fix this glitch ASAP!",1
1331,"Signing up to sell = getting scammed: Ebays return policy basically enables buyers to buy and then make a false allegation about the product with no evidence and eBay will force the seller to do full return plus 2 way shipping cost plus ebay keeps their 15% from the sale and the seller pays that back to the buyer as well. This includes seller that chose the option “no returns” on the selling profile as I did. That’s a scam. It means nothing. Ebay will still take your funds and give it back to any buyer that complains. To top it off, the buyer isn’t even accountable for shipping the item back intact. They could even ship back an empty envelope and there is nothing the seller can do about it. Ebay may work for big business sellers. But regular folks trying to make a dime on the side just get railroaded.",1
1332,"Not happy: I’ve been an EBay customer for more than a decade. Until recently I’ve had no problems   Now it seems scammers are becoming sellers and eBay is hiding behind automated phone banks and restricted lists that prevents outing scammers and accurately identifying the problem.

1333,Nothing but good: I’ve been using EBay for years now. I’ve never had a bad deal. I’ve always received what I purchased and the few times (less than 5) the seller didn’t complete the transaction then eBay refunded me. The reviews keep folks honest on both sides of a deal. If a seller has less than a 99.4 overall rating I move on unless it’s something I’m willing to risk. Yep! That’s a high bar but that’s the beauty of eBay. Your terms and if the deal goes south and you competed everything correctly then eBay has proved to me. They have me covered.,5
1334,"eBay fees: I started using eBay as a new user, after a few months I listed about 3 things and only sold one item. eBay collections kept emailing me and saying a fee was way past overdue and I didn’t understand why! I thought it was a spam email so I kept deleting it because eBay in my opinion is a very sketchy way to do transactions as there are bots everywhere ripping people off. I realized after I attempted to list another item a month later that my account was suspended and I had fees I needed to pay. Very confused I went online and searched it up. No where did I see that I had to pay a fee when listing at all. False information listed and I am not happy about it.

1336,Don’t use eBay: As a first time seller went thru every step eBay gave me. My seller sent a fake PayPal payment. I contacted eBay to inquiry about my payment they stated since I was a first time seller it could take up to 30 days to have my money released. I told them about the PayPal they said they confirmed which they never did after shipping and waiting I called again to find out I was scammed. eBay acted like they cared and even said they would compensate me for some of my lost but after three weeks of no information I was told I needed to be more careful and it’s not their fault. So basically I’m not out $200 dollars and eBay walked away. Don’t use eBay for selling if you not a pro!! I’m shocked about this and sadden. Just beware it’s thousands of horror stories like mines and eBay doesn’t care,1
1337,"Thieve’s Heaven: Currently any buyer can buy something expensive and say the buyer sent the wrong item of the same shipping weight [because ebay’s only test to see if the buyer is being honest is to check the weight of the package]
Then the buyer says “hey you sent this worthless item”, and starts a return. 

He will end up getting his money back and keeping the item, AND he will be able to leave a negative feedback telling your customers how awful you are. 

This makes selling anything expensive very risky. 

eAsy solution , eBay could have expensive items SHIPPED TO EBAY before they are sent to the buyer to verify the item is there. They could charge $5 an item [+
Shipping from eBay to the customer] and make good money.

1338,"Great app but dumb start screen: I love the app, I use it for like 99% of everything I need to do in eBay. But why, when I’m selling something do I need to take 3 clicks to view that item? It’s annoying to check my selling items throughout the day when it’s such a no-brainer for a system whose entire existence is based on people selling stuff to have your items at the top of the home screen when you log in. It’s a simple concept. IF you are selling something, make it easy to get to your items. Duh.

Also I would like to keep “time ending soonest” as my default, but it will not let me. Why would I want eBay to put it in the order of who is paying them the most when, in the meanwhile, the item ending soonest gets done with bidding and I miss it. Aggravating to say the least.",3
1342,"My go-to app for shopping: If you’re buying something off eBay, great! Good for you. The search application is top notch and pretty easy to use. 

If you’re selling something, good luck. eBay is CONSTANTLY changing my shipping parameters and my selling parameters. They’ll allow bids on on items I specifically disallow on, without my permission. You have to really read the fine print about what category your item goes under or it might not sell. You have to double check the shipping as sometimes shipping is mathematically correct and sometimes they’ll charge $17 to ship out a shirt. 

The selling section needs to upgrade their shady “edit after posting” policy. I’m tired or receiving low bid on items I already over-low price.

Also, if a customer doesn’t pay after the allotted time, eBay does nothing. Nor do they allow you to cancel the transaction without claiming responsibility. This “ back-and-forth” correspondence between sellers/eBay/fire that goes on for over a month is not efficient or acceptable.",3

I don’t like Paypal, I don’t want Paypal and its time that eBay stop forcing it upon people.  Let us choose what payment processor we want to use.  The government ought to step in on this one.  Paypal acts like judge and jury often getting it wrong and allowing consumers to abuse sellers.  If you don’t play nice with them they ban you.  What other service is allowed to operate like this?

The directions eBay provides sellers to pay fees (one time payments) is round about, clunky, and requires signing in at least one more time. It's a but of a headache. Simple solution: put a section on the eBay app under ""Selling"" where we can view our sold items, fees AND... Pay them if we want.

Thank you",4
1348,"Why not a report category for shipping gouging?: I see items listed for .99 cents and some outrageous shipping fee which deprives Ebay of their cut of that sale money but when i try to report that infraction, there isn't a specific drop down box to do so? I can only hope the person who reviews the report has enough intelligence to see why I took my valuable time to make the report in the first place! I would think there is a lot of this going on so why wouldn't ebay want what they deserve for selling the item! Just curious???",5
1349,"Updated app defaults to 14 day return policy: I had always loved creating a draft on the computer, having everything complete except the photos. Then I’d open the app, snap a couple photos, and list from the app. Now, when I create the draft and go to the app to snap photos, the app changes my return policy from 30 days to 14 days. To comply with eBay policy and gain Top Rated Seller status and benefits, I can’t have 14 day returns. This is absurd! I now have to return to the computer after snapping photos and fix the return policy before I can list an item. From what I’ve researched, eBay is more than aware of this bug in the update, among others, and they’re not fixing it. As a seller, the app is basically useless to me after this broken update. Highly disappointed in eBay.",1
1350,"eBay: Enjoy looking for items. What really makes me feel comfortable is how eBay supports the buyer when you end up dealing with a bad seller. The one question I would have is how the satisfaction rating works, because I have noticed certain sellers with a poor rating. With in a month all of a sudden the seller has 100% and all the bad reviews are gone. This one thing that I have to question with eBay, otherwise a great site to look for items to purchase. Thank you",5
1351,Don’t use eBay‼️‼️: Be careful from shopping on eBay. I’ve been a customer with them since 2012. And recently I purchased from there as usual but this time the seller was a scammer and upon me returning the defected item. The seller went crazy and started threatening me and harassing me. I called eBay twice and they said they will take care of it and this is against their policy and he will be band from selling on eBay. But nope that was all a lie. They did nothing and no one contacted me for further information and proof. And the seller kept harassing me until I blocked him. eBay doesn’t care abt it’s customers safety at all. I will never purchase from eBay ever again. They lost a loyal customer and seller. And many of my family and friends as well.,1
1352,"eBay's Lack of Transparency: Violation of Customer Rights: The deeply troubling reality is that eBay's actions lack any semblance of transparency. 
My fundamental legal rights, particularly my right to understand why my account was suspended, are blatantly disregarded. 
As a loyal eBay customer who solely purchases items and has never violated any rules intentionally, I was shocked when my long-standing account, along with a newly created one, got suspended without explanation. Despite reaching out to customer service multiple times for clarification, their response was unsatisfactory, stating the decision was final, and no reasons would be provided. 

Feeling frustrated by eBay's lack of transparency, I believe it's my right to know why my account was suspended, given my confidence in abiding by all policies.",1
1353,"Recommend option: I enjoy eBay app very much. I’ve been a customer and a seller for the longest time . one quick recommendation : if somebody is interested in buying my item and if I want to send them an offer, I should have the ability to identify the buyers profile before sending the offer. In other words how many purchases or selling did the person had done?  what is the feedback from other transactions and more. I don’t want to sell my product to somebody who would not pay me immediately.

Thank you",4
1354,They make selling over complicated: I Had notification that my item was sold and accidentally pressed ship when trying to change the shipment method they wanted me to use their ups label wich was incorrect because i didn't know the details so i wanted to make sure it was right there is not option on the app to cancel that or go back wich is extremely annoying it also took 13$ for me too And in too of that i have to gi to the ups office and ship my package and my funds are on hold for whatever reason too so i don't even get my money right away I recommend selling on facebook or mercari because ebay is just too much and too complicated,2
1355,"Communication with eBay: With all sellers on eBay, time is money! That being said, it would be much more convenient if sellers/buyers were able to quickly find a contact number and to be able to speak with a representative in a timely manner! 

Also there has been a change, while listing an item as ""buy now"" eBay has changed the ""sold comps"" within the parameters of the buy it now.  Where you can click to see similar items that have sold.     The old was was much user friendly",4
1356,"Insane Fees!: eBay has completely lost touch with the people who have made it into what it has become nowadays. The fees are outrageous and now you pretty much have to promote your listings which takes even more fees out from your pocket otherwise good luck getting any views or buyers! They'll take out their fees instantly but make you wait 30+ days to receive the money you made from a sale 🙃. Greed will be the demise of eBay, especially when there's better platforms that don't charge crazy fees for everything under the sun. eBay no longer has my trust or business, I've switched over to Mercari and it's so much better!! I now get on average 10-20% more profit compared to selling on eBay. Was nice knowing you eBay.. NOT!",1
1357,"Listings are revised or deleted..: I am not happy to duplicate my efforts constantly on my listings..  items are either removed, duplicated, or item descriptions are removed mysteriously.  This is happening way too often and I’m not happy about it. Now I have somebody from Israel asking me if I ship internationally. Which I always do…but somehow this particular item does not offer international shipping.  Of course when I went in to revise the item to offer international shipping, I was not allowed to do that either.",5
1358,"Clueless tech support: Contacted them via the app about an issue with the app. They kept telling me to use my internet browser to circumvent the issue… the problem is… I can’t use my internet browser. Every time I try to go to eBay on the browser, it opens and forces me back to the app. If you uninstall the app and do the same thing, it informs you that you need to install the app to proceed. You CAN NOT USE AN INTERNET BROWSER, eBay will not allow it. This was too difficult for tech support to understand. They wanted me to provide information that I could only give them if I closed the tech support chat… can’t give tech support the information if tech support is no longer there to give it to after I find the info.",1

I think this is a great platform but their customer service and tech department are not doing a good job.",5
1360,"I love how streamlined it is to be a seller: Everything from posting items to getting comparable items to streamline the posting is fantastic. 
I have two suggestions for improvements:
1: getting to the sold filter takes too long. Move it to the top of the options because of how useful it is to resellers.
2: currently I don’t get notified when someone makes me an offer. That should give a notification in the same way that a sold item would.",5
1361,"Best Platform for Sellers and Buyers: What really separates this platform from all of the rest is the Fabulous Customer Service. I’ve never been disappointed with any of the interactions I’ve had with them - the Trainers and Managers of the CS team are doing it right.  
Also like their policies that protect both buyer and seller.  
They’ve made changes to the mobile app and it’s fast, slick, easy to use. 
Other apps are trying to get it right but they’re so far behind they think they’re first.

1362,Scammer won’t refund money ever on items that Weren’t received: If I could give them no stars I would I’m not one to give bad reviewsBut I’ve had kinds of problems with them they always say my package is delivered and I have a camera ring and at times I am home and I have not received any of my items that I’ve purchased I open a case and they always close the case without giving me my refund there’s scammers they won’t actually contact you if you have any issues honestly don’t use eBay. 50% of the time my packages go missing or are NOT delivered to me. I tell them they’re not delivered to me and then they say yes they were but they weren’t if I don’t have the product I purchased I should be able to have a refund.,1
1363,"Great, but not the greatest.: Simply put eBay is great to use, albeit not the most user friendly if you're brand new to online shopping. Btw clothes size should always be a selectable option, dunno why it disappears from the filter options on certain searches.

The app is also functional unlike Etsy (Literally couldn't buy a dang shirt of all things, thanks Etsy you glitchy dong gobbler) so 9/10. Plus eBay at least tries to help you if there's a problem unlike 90% of the companies that make getting customer/vendor support an excruciating nightmare.",4
1364,"Heated 4XlT vest for men: I had had good luck on eBay and felt thrilled when I purchased from a small business. I soon realized that I should've been looking into the background comments about the seller. I ended up ordering a heated vest that is made for a 4xlt man. This is hard to find- however, I thought I found one on eBay. It said heated vest. It was not heated. It was not electric. It had a pocket that was made for a phone or an item that needed extra protection. They worded the best and placed it in the middle of the other electric heated vest.",5
1365,"Finding the needle in the haystack: There are some things that seem impossible to find. Like a replacement microwave dish plate. I searched high and low for it. I searched all over the internet and couldn’t find it. I finally tried eBay, and guess what, I found in in minutes if not less. It was delivered on time. I got notifications from eBay. eBay is my go to place now cause it’s not just finding these hard to find items but also great prices for great products. eBay rocks!",5
1366,"One of worst customer service/selling department: They don’t have a form of communication with seller or customer if they have complaints or issues.  Very not deaf friendly.  Chat and the eBay employees trained to be a liar and never keep their words. Take my advice don’t become a seller until they fix their issues with shipping estimation accurately within ten miles, not two hours from where I live.    They never waived my issues and lie and threatened me to collection department when I didn’t do anything wrong.  I contacted them many times and they don’t EVEN care about you as seller or buyer.   

Take my advice. Don’t buy from them or sell through them until they get 800 number phone contact back on the service!",1
1367,Most features work well.: Being on the road often I have to rely on my iPhone to look at my eBay listings. This is a pretty good tool. However I still enjoy working on the desktop better. Good listing mechanism. Pictures sometimes a little balky. But overall allows me to be away from my desk. So I could just suggest keep up the good work and continue  further updates and I know they are doing that. I can see the progression of the app over the years and it continually gets better so definitely worth a try.,5
1368,A few minor tweaks!: I think this app is actually excellent but there are a few minor tweaks that could improve immensely. Starting with the clothing section. You should be able to set your standard clothing sizes so that in your search to bring something general items in that range. For instance I search for size 12 to 12 1/2 shoes. But it continues to show me sizes that I am not interested even when put in the size. And the same thing when I put in the clothing items.,5
1369,"Sometimes need a “KICK”: eBay is ALWAYS there. And I’ll b wracking my brain for something thinking “where can I get this”? You would think after all these years I would think eBay right away. I’m a Barbie fan since I was a kid. And I love the old dolls and clothes. Thanks to EBay I have quite a beautiful collection.  I purchase my own clothes, jewelry , and personal care products. Always convenient/— and now a necessity. And I love the amount of “BUY NOW”. Items. Today was looking for a way to paint over some spots in my bathtub. eBay came through again!!",5
1370,"Long time ebay patron, BUT: I’m growing more disenfranchised with ebay. A TON of overseas (especially China) market items, even when sellers “have warehouses in US” the business gurus appear to be overseas. What’s more is, ebay had long been a neat place to buy and sell specialty or hard to find items, the flea market/antique store/yard-sale and beyond for special peddling. Unfortunately, you seldom are able to find great bargains like we used to, and it’s really commercialized and taken over. Not to mention all this brought on taxation. 
I’ll still check now and again for items, but I’m inclined to begin to business by means through more grass-roots outlets. We need to fight the squeeze and return to the paths that were tried and true.",2
1371,"eBay forces best offer ability: eBay has changed more and more to the detriment of sellers and buyer experience. They now change your settings without your permission. I set my prices to the lowest I can accept and when I put “no” to accepting best offers they automatically tell me they’ve changed it to accept them. Then buyers get angry bc you decline their offers bc you meant it when you said no. And why would a customer pay your list price when your auction says you accept offers? My only option will be to inflate pricing so I can accept offers that eBay now forces. Have started using OfferUp and Marketplace with some success and more expensive items, bc EBay has become too difficult and frustrating, and fees are lower to zero too. Better for sellers.",1
1372,"Do not sell anything on here: I sold a Louis Vuitton purse on here for over $2000. The buyer was completely satisfied with her purchase and even left me a positive review. A few days later, she decides to dispute the charge with her bank. They then pulled the money out of my PayPal account. She did not even return the item. eBay is not taking any responsibility for this and they are blaming PayPal. Oh now PayPals phones are down for the past 6 months due to Covid. Come on, as a huge corporation, you guys are really not answering phones. It’s disgusting that eBay works with PayPal and refuses to even contact them to try to help me. All in all, eBay and PayPal just robbed me of $2075 and my brand new Louis Vuitton purse. Use mercari instead. eBay is the worst place to sell anything on as they don’t take any responsibility for anything!!!!!",1
1373,"Newest Update Not Left-Handed Friendly: Like many left-handed folks, I use my left thumb to scroll through the app on my phone. It’s terribly irritating with the new “Photo Search” feature that results in me constantly having to reboot the app when I accidentally allow my thumb to linger for too long when I’m browsing. Because the photo icons are located on the left side of the screen, coupled with the sensitivity of the new photo search feature, it has resulted in me being less reluctant to visit the app, and eBay all together.",5

The update doesn't allow me to modify my listings within the app. I can't add my store's categories, change my return window to 30 days, change shipping, or move the order of my photos. I have to complete my listings on my computer after saving my drafts. It's way too many steps to correct my listings. Please fix this issue. It's costing me time with my family.",2

I try logging in and now am getting a message that there was an internal problem within the app. But I couldn’t sign in. So I’m thinking I’m not the only one. Just need a bug fix and noticed the app had been updated recently so maybe it came with the update. In the meantime I’m locked out. 😢 Still a five star app. Please please fix it soon! So I can get my bid on! 🤣,5
1376,"This app needs major work!: Where are all the high ratings coming from? People who don’t actually use the app?! It’s glitchy, and shows out-of-sync with eBay when eBay is accessed by a laptop. Bid counts and prices are never accurate, view counts are never right. You are unable to edit your own listings, the app refuses to add the changes no matter how many times you make them! I’m not remotely impressed. I got the app so I could more easily keep up with auctions/listings I wanted to watch or buy, but this app is useless for that. It barely functions unless you are right up on a wi-fi source. Forget about it running smoothly on your phone data!",3
1377,"Needs to be same as full website: If it had all the functions as the full website that would be great. And when one relist on their app verse website. Can automatically list up to 3x on app and not through website. Can turn off things on website but not through the app.
Also when you try and contact them there is a whole dog and pony show to contact them. Not cool. You are a business and you need to have customer assist to real person and not jump through pages of unhelpful stuff to get to a some real communication help.
So be wary of the differences.",4
1378,"App hides sellers’ other listings/inventory and discourages communication.: App leaves much to be desired. By hiding the links to ask questions and find sellers’ other items at the bottom of listings with link to other items buried in drop down menu, eBay execs have taken away two prominent and critical features of the original website. These cost sellers sales easily converted on the website. These links MUST be made obvious, easy, prominent again. This has taken a critical feature for sellers and eliminated it from easy view. eBay should value its dedicated sellers, not disadvantage them after years or decades on the site. Thank you very much fir taking this review seriously, and taking action to correct this ASAP.",2
1379,"eBay app: For use on an iPad or phone, this app is better than using the eBay website.  But it still has a lot of glitches. 

For example, it often doesn't process every item in your cart, or worse it pays for everything in you cart but tells you that it hasn't. I have now learned to double check it, but once paid for an item twice because of this glitch. 

It often tells you that you have missed out on an item when you've purchased it and takes a long time to finally update correctly. It freezes up fairly often and needs to be re-started. In general, it updates your various lists very slowly. There are a number of other annoying bugs.

Not a glitch but rather a function issue...if you have accidentally deleted an item from your purchased list, you cannot reverse it, it's gone, be careful. 

As stated, it is better than using the website on your phone or iPad (mostly because the print is too small), but it needs some work.",3
1380,"Love this place!: eBay has been a life saver for me on my project cars and with reputable people doing business here in conjunction with PayPal it’s taken a lot of the risk of sight unseen purchases off the table.

After 5 days of holding my money and not shipping my purchase, I asked the seller when I might expect for him to ship my coin. He replied that he was cancelling the order! I believe that the buyer should have protections in place, that as eBay accepts my payment, and the seller has been paid, that item should then belong to the buyer and the seller should not be able to cancel the order! Otherwise, eBay should not be paid until the order has been shipped! The buyer needs protections also, or I will stop shopping on eBay!",2

I do not need eBay to be my middleman on payments, not happening.
This is on top of their steadily increasing fees. I recently sold an item for $49 plus shipping And eBay wants over $17 in fees for one no frill add… I don’t mind PayPal fees, they keep you out of my checking account. I don’t trust your security and that you won’t get hacked.",1
1390,Explanation for lower positive rating: I would like an explanation for the lowered positive rating I got: 95.7%. The buyer was already given an almost 60% discount from the original asking price and for me to allow her to return it saying that she did not fit the shoe was not justifiable. The measurements were clearly stated in the listing as uripen being in European sizing. She should have communicated to me prior to buying it. I would have provided her with further width and length measurements. She did not reach out to me and just bargained for the price reduction. The decrease in my positive rating is very unfair!,4

What's more -- and unlike its latter-day competitors -- eBay majors in major subjects = both Buyer & Seller are fully protected by EXCELLENT PROTOCOLS.

1397,"“Okay” app..: I like eBay, and the app is generally usable, but there are a few things that make it more difficult than it should be. 

1. Lack of customization. There are basically no app settings, which is odd considering that app customization is standard on most apps. (Examples: no way to setup/config home screen, no way to change color scheme, fonts, etc.)

2. For whatever reason they tinker with the watchlist frequently and usually break something. Current issues: (1) no way to see if an ended item was sold or not. (2) prices missing on numerous items in the list. 

3. Previously you could filter on multiple items in one category, but they took this feature away, which makes it more difficult to view items. (Example: I want to view new, new without box, and unspecified in the category of “condition.” I should be able to select all three of those, but instead I must view each list separately, removing the ability to compare/sort of these items).",3

For example, when I print out a series of labels ... without the ship/ inventory info ... how am I to know which package the label goes on.  After one label mixup, that was costly to correct, gimme back my old shipping label! 

Been getting oops messages from eBay, sending corrected invoices for customer errors in combined shipping, too difficult refunds(having to go to PayPal to issue a refund), has not made things better for sellers.

Very disappointed in the lack of care to the sellers!
But just try to answer a question for a customer in the message system by giving them a model or serial number to an item and the eBay police are all over you claiming that you are trying to exchange contact information with the seller!
If fixing real problems with their app was as important as being Nazi’s to their sellers then this unacceptable problem with the app would of been fixed within 24 hours.

People are complaining about this all over the internet so there is no reason for such inaction!",1
1402,All things Can Always be improved !: Cancel Button that gives you 1 hour to click and that’s it . Why Make it Difficult to cancel an item As it Stands Now is Almost impossible to Do ! I’m Sure Many people would Agree and Those Same People Are Ebay Customers and As easy as it is to Buy Something it Should Be Just as Easy to Not Buy an Item as it is to Buy ? Please Fix the This Failure to have 1 Button Cancel . It’s Not Helping Anyone To Make Customers Buy Against their Will or Desire to make a Purchase,5
1403,"My experience while shopping on EBAY: Is the best way of going in the 21 Century to find just about anything your looking for without going out & getting it .. There are some advantages which some things are free of shipping charges , taxes , & can even negotiate price on some items with the seller... To me is a no lose situation when it comes to shopping even save gas spending by having to leave your home to purchase items instead do it on your computer or smart phone the list is enlist...5 stars on a 5 Star chart ...",5
1404,"Full of scammers ... fees are too high ... eBay and papal charges around 20%+: eBay doesn’t protect you against scammers ... they will take your money first and then you will suffer (they will refund the final value fee) .... you may cancel many deals (because buyers are not actually obligated to buy even if they won an auction they get a warning) because there is no guarantee of purchase... eBay will not share with you the buyers personal details even if they scammed you ... you can keep relish your item and not get paid from scam buyers! 

It is not easy to report a buyer ... it looks like eBay want scammers to exist in their platform to make the market more competitive and also collect the non refundable fees... 

The customer service are not helpful ... and takes forever to reach one ...",1
1405,"TERRIBLE APPLICATION!!!: I'm not ""so appointed"" the app freezes and acts up at times. It shows, I have nothing for sale, it shows I have nothing sold, it shows I have no feedback. I have installed and reinstalled it many times I'm just not sure if it's an application issue? 
I do love ebay! The seller center and all of its representatives are absolutely fantastic customer service representatives of and for eBay! If eBay, PayPal, and Apple would teach Customer Service seminars, there would be millions & millions of people who would not DREAD calling Customer Service on any issue😊👍👍👍",5
1406,"Lots of bugs....: Help! This version needs an exterminator!! There are lots of bugs with this update. It's hit and miss if any of the lists will load up. If it does it may only load the last 4 items added to that list. That goes for watching, bidding, purchases, searching and favorite seller lists. I have lost several items that I was watching because the app would not bring up the item on my watch list. I get a page that states I am not watching anything. Hours later it will pop up and show all the items on the list but by then it's too late. There is a  50/50 chance I have to manually search for my items because my saved searches won't come up either. The version prior to this one was great...this one is not.",1
1407,eBay reviews: I like eBay they have a big selection with many different price range you can bid sell or buy on here. Returns are hassle free if you don’t receive your items they always handle the matter quickly. eBay downside is how long it takes to get your product your always going to have a long wait everyone else you can get next day or a couple at most so that’s the down fall for me is the wait other than that great platform.,5
1408,"Good app but still need to use full site for complicated stuff: I use this app to buy and sell on eBay. I only use this unless there is something that the app doesn't support which happens occasionally when selling and then I need to go turn on the laptop.

I do prefer using the app over the eBay mobile site.

As much as I love using the app I find that I sometimes have issues with information loading. I have items for sale and it will often show up as no items for sale. It can also sometimes be impossible to use the contact buyer feature.",4
1409,"Not saving recent searches: Armature coders. When doesn’t any other program delete a recent list?  Never. Only the eBay app. 

Why are you deleting recent searches? It takes time to build a search. Whomever thinks they are smart needs a new job. For the past week, the recent searches is always empty. What a pain! I hope this isn’t another example of them thinking they know what’s best for everyone. Like they did when they took away basic wildcard searches. They have to be losing a ton of revenue from folks not being able to narrow down a search to find what they need. Let alone items that are different by a single digit and you need them all but have to key them in 1 at a time.",1
1410,"*saved searches bug*: Seems like for around the past six months, the saved searches has been turning up a whole bunch of junk along with the actual search results. Most of the time it says there's a certain amount of new searches for an item, but when you look at it, it shows like 20 more. It's very confusing. I also keep getting alerts for new items in my saved searches, but when I look at it, it has nothing to do with the saved search terms at all. And it's always the same ones at the bottom of my list. Super annoying. Please fix this and I would give it five stars.",2

I’m a retired salesperson, and one thing I always advise to everyone: ALWAYS read details completely when purchasing, especially on high dollar items.  If you don’t understand details, ask questions and/ or get help from a trustworthy source to get advice.  Happy shopping!",5
1412,Terrible: I agree. This app is terrible. I’m not going to waste my time telling you computer people all that’s wrong. I am going to try to resolve my two items that sell and be done with eBay. I hate it as I am on disability and the extra cash comes in handy but not worth the anxiety it causes. I have a label that purchased but no way to print. I also had a case opened that I resolved with the buyer but eBay would not allow to purchase shipping label. Y’all should have stuck with PayPal,5
1413,"Just a friendly eBay user: eBay is a fraudulent application, I had sold an item and shipped that said item and the buyer had confirmed it was delivered. I have never gotten paid for that item that I sold. I have contacted eBay support team but when you do that they simply try and text you some ridiculous link, or try to get you to go on there website for answers. I got hung up on multiple times by eBay’s contact support automated team. The eBay system when you call them will not connect you with a live person, and if they do you’re very lucky. So I sold and item on eBay use my money to deliver it and never even get paid but eBay kept the money. So no do use this application, it is fraud.",1
1414,Horrible changes to selling platform: Such a disappointment with all the bogus fees eBay has implemented. Hardly makes it worth selling on eBay anymore.  I know multiple other eBay sellers that are feeling this same way.  There are other selling platforms available that a few of are are trying.  Can't imagyhow many unhappy sellers eBay has right now.  I have also chosen to not buy on the platform anymore until eBay resolves issues for their sellers.,5
1415,"Great for Collectors/Hobbyists: I’ve been using eBay for several years now and I’ve bought numerous different items on the app. It’s a great place for sports cards/fishing lure collectors like me because there’s so much to choose from and your able to come up with reasonable prices for any particular item you’re looking to sell (especially with the “Sold” filter).
Transactions are very easy and so is searching/filtering for items. Definitely recommend it for all collectors/hobbyists.",5

I’m proud to say and show who I am in the decals I place on my vehicle as well. Thanks for being there for all of us in showing how strong we feel.,5
1417,"Could be better: eBay has gone downhill. I’ve been a user for 17 years. The end user has a difficult time getting help with issues. Constant changes prevail which reduces sales while fees go up. It’s gotten very frustrating. 

Then I receive a below standard evaluation while being told it’s because I need more sales. Then higher fees are charged against me. It’s a viscous cycle. No support for sellers while buyers have full support. 

Glitches on the app tell me I have sales to mail and I’ve not sold something. eBay posts priority mail when I select first class mail. It relists items I’ve sold. eBay you need to do a lot better!! Glitches also include saying I need to ship something when I’ve already shipped it.",1
1418,"The place I find my happiness: Every time I am looking to get some nostalgia. I can always depend on EBAY to bring me happiness. I look for something from way back that has good memories and guess what? They have someone with it ready to sell. From old games, to garbage pal cards or needing some parts for my old school ‘79 Bonneville. Dude! EBAY HAD IT!  I decided to add aftermarket music to my car, EBAY HAD IT!  Also, if you get the pay pal credit. Everything is within grasp. Small payments and instant gratification.",5
1419,"eBay is bloody terrible.: It’s unfortunate that eBay has such a lock on the market. Terrible customer service for buyers, absurd seller fees, making money “off the float” post-sale (e.g. not giving you the proceeds of a sale in a reasonable timeframe), not facilitating refunds for lost purchases, everything about eBay is pretty terrible for buyers and sellers, alike. And it’s getting progressively worse.

The app itself is poorly organized, with an obtuse layout for account and messaging data. There’s no support for proper 2factor or authenticator apps. Instead, eBay is trying to make their poor-quality app an authenticator for their own service.

You’ll end up using this app, and their service, but that doesn’t mean either one deserves a positive review.",1

1421,"Please revert changes: I’m a longtime eBay user from this app and love using eBay. Over the last month eBay has limited the number of items you can watch at one time which is annoying. Also, eBay has limited your viewable purchase history. Purchase history is necessary for leaving feedback, keeping personal records, reordering and just plain keeping track of things when you have a lot of purchases. These changes make no sense to me. If memory is an issue notify us and make the needed upgrade to your systems. I will be happy to change my app rating when a fix is implemented or eBay has communicated over the problems.",2
1422,Great app but needs...: Great app but needs some adjusting . I'm a big seller on eBay and very frustrating to list on your phone when you have to “upload” the photos .. old app you took the photos and submitted the listing takes an extra minimum 45 seconds for the pictures just to upload sometimes 1-2 minutes when connections is bad . I like that you can now see all of your listings over 600 items . Need more functions like you were at a desktop but I’m presuming in time it will come,5
1423,"SHIPPING ERROR: With the current update, it has been quite frustrating when selecting shipping options while creating a listing.
When you’ve made your selections and preview before listing; you are shown in red “Contact Seller For Shipping Quote”... this is not accurate as Shipping option was clearly selected. This happens on each listing I try to create. I then go into the Shipping options and toggle things off and then back on a few times to try to get it to save correctly. It generally takes up to 5 mins longer than usual to get it to reflect accurately. 
Please fix this. It is quite frustrating and am unsure of how to remedy this.",3
1424,"eBay is my way of life!: More than 10+ years ago, after discovering eBay, my life became so much simpler! I actually go to eBay first before purchasing any product. I’ve come to realize I can buy almost any product, i.e., clothing, household, furniture, almost anything, cheaper than the stores! I don’t need to go out!  I’m called “The eBay Queen” by family and friends. They actually come to me asking about a product before purchasing anywhere else. eBay hasn’t let me down yet!! All I can say is keep bringing the products!",5
1425,"eBay App is OK - not yet great.: It’s hard to change such a behemoth, but Ebay and it’s app do need a revamp or update. It looks dated and the functionality is becoming dated. It’s tried and true in many ways, but out of step with the offerings of up & coming sites like Poshmark and Etsy which are slowly eroding their sales. Ebay wins for largest audience, but they are becoming more and more restrictive to newcomers and smaller concerns. It’s not hat intuitive and still lacks simple share functions. The Ability for sellers to make offers of reduced price to those “liking” their items is a great value to sellers. Ebay needs to offer more features to small and large sellers alike.",3
1426,"Need back “newest listing “ option !!!: As a seller I often like to go back to my recent listing to proof read and see if I need to change anything.  For some stupid reason, it has gone to something like...”last to end”.  They do not work the same way.  Why is this is so hard to add on “newest listing” option for sort?!?!? It is now so hard to find my new items to check on them.   Uuuuhhhhhg.  Bring back old version please or fix, cuz this is killing me!   Thanks.",5
1427,Automatic relist and good until canceled: I’ve been using the EBay app for a few years now  and it’s always been user friendly. With a recent update I no longer have the option to list only for  a certain amount of days. I have to save the item and update on the laptop to choose 30 days and to not automatically relist.  It’s taking me more to go through this process.  With the automatic Good Until Canceled i can’t even adjust it on the desk top. I have to cancel the listing.  I hope they put it back.,5
1428,"eBay app issues with relisting: I’m a seller and eBay’s app has always been our avenue for relisting items. Relisting. That’s what I said. Initial brand new listing are out of the question with this app. When anyone makes an attempt at initiating a new listing the app locks that new listing out of mobile friendly status making it an inconvenient experience. 

This latest update sports it’s own noticible problem. Now when relisting items, eBay’s new promotional “easy listing” tool hides away a listing’s duration option which keeps a seller from choosing the duration of the listing. When listed as is eBay automatically lists it as a good till canceled listing hindering the sellers options with relisted.

Be weary fellow sellers. Check your listings durations since the last two app updates. There’s probably a good chance that your listings state good till canceled. 

Otherwise the app is pretty decent and helps me tremendously with seller related issues on the go.",4

Many items are being shipped from China and it takes some time so if I don’t receive it by your due date then it’s a hassle to look the item up and contact the seller. I have to go through all these clicks to contact EBay and seller, annoying! It was okay before, I don’t know why you need to ‘improve’ things when in reality everything is becoming worse.",5

Another words they miss represent the item, but they continuously market their items that are not original, they’re not in NOS, is garbage but every time you look it up they keep popping into the filter I wish it was a way we can block sellers because it be a lot more enjoyable not seeing these defuses trying to sell misrepresented products all the time.",5
1431,"Great App, but...: I love this app because it makes responding to messages and offers so easy.    The company I work for has thousands of listings, and my job is to keep track of them. 
   My only complaint about the app is its inability to accurately search for active listings.  An item that has sold in our store can be searched for on the app using every search term possible for deactivation... but no dice. 
   Even with dozens of active listings of the same sort and description, nothing will come up in the search.  The desktop version is the only way to accomplish this.  
   Good app; not perfect.",4
1432,eBay is an amazing site!!: I have been an Ebay since it’s beginning. I have bought hundreds of items ranging from an Antique dressing table to monograms for Yeti cups!  I have purchased jewelry with never a problem. The quality is always great plus you can’t beat the prices. I purchased two rolling walkers for family members and they were half the cost if I had to buy them locally. eBay is quick to help with disputs but any time you contact a seller they are so willing to help. I love EBay!!!,5
1433,"eBay App: Not as good as in a browser. Harder to find simple necessities such as sellers other items, and ask seller a question, which get buried deeper and have to be found often in a series of clicks. Oddly the item descriptions are not prominent. The my EBay functions leave a lot to be desired, navigation is poor. There is not page back and forth function. Sometime items show up supersized and you cannot see them or descriptions, as they will not resize. Other than these problems, it’s. A mediocre app, not considerate of the user experience., but it does deliver EBay to an iPad,......",4

I hope in eBay's mission to forever fix things that aren't broken, they figure how to fix things that actually are broken - like this app.",5

Interesting in the sense that I have found items there I thought were impossible to find due to time and no longer available. Good in that purchases are easy and straightforward.

1437,"Amazing truely: When I had trouble with some items, I tried to get help from eBay. However, my experience with their customer service was very disappointing. They were unprofessional and irresponsible. When I sold some new items, they returned some of them without providing any specific explanations. When I tried to reach them, they made me even more frustrated. The counselor I spoke to couldn’t understand what I was talking about and kept repeating the same thing, which didn’t help me at all. They didn’t provide me with any details or evidence that I needed to know, and they just kept saying that they didn’t think the items were new. Overall, my experience with eBay’s Authentic Guarantee was a joke.",1

I would’ve been better off giving it away to a charity. I don’t sell on eBay to get ranch but I’m pretty sure it’s not the sellers doing really well on this platform. Maybe I’m just not a smart enough seller but my point is the fees and shipping costs do not seem very clear to me ahead of time. After feeling a bit burned  with the shipping several times in a row and noticing the fees being much higher, I think I will quit eBay.

Since it is I have a limit on what I can sell and it’s 5 items per month. They love taking fees from me even with a limit on my sells.

When I try to save it on the web, it gives me an error. There’s no way to override this behavior and tell it not to “autocorrect” my address or try to verify it against an out-of-date database.

1445,"A few major issues: First of all, and as many others have complained, eBay’s seller fees are way too high. But another thing I don’t like about eBay is that it only retains your purchase history up to a certain point. If I wanted to resell something I bought from there 2 years ago for example I would’ve had to write down how much I paid for it or search the site for similar items to get an accurate price. Lastly, the watch list only allows a certain number of items watched at a time which I already reached. If I want to watch something now, I would have to remove something else from my watch list first.",2
1446,Offer accepted problem: Twice in recent months after offers have been accepted the purchased item can’t be found by seller. Sellers should keep better track of inventories or did they sell last of items at regular price and leave me high and dry??

It’s annoying because it makes me waste a lot of time and if I’m not at home, I lose sales, if a size or color has been sold and I want to add it again in the variation, because either I have an extra one or the buyer cancelled for change of mind.

1452,Great app: I’ve used this app everyday for about three years. I sell 20-25 items per month and it’s great.  The only suggestion I have is the refund process. As of now you can only do partial and full refunds from the desktop site. It’s still a 5 star app but having the ability to send refunds from the mobile app would be better. I’d be able to give my customers better service if I could issue a refund immediately no matter where I am instead of waiting until I’m at my computer,5

1458,"Restricted bidding: I am new to Ebay and purchased 14 items within a week and paid immediately after winning. As an item I had watched for a few days had 1 minute to go I went to place my bid and my bidding had been restricted and placed on ""buy it now"" only. eBay help pages states they send out emails to explain the reasons but I never received one and it states to check out your cart and link PayPal and I've done both. Help page also states possible ""Fraud"" on new accounts causes restrictions. Again, each item has been paid for with my linked PayPal account within 15 mins of winning. So, all my watched items and  hours finding those items are a loss. Disappointed!!",2
1459,"Good when it works: When eBay is working it’s alright;  however when something goes wrong it appears like there is nobody to contact to help fix it.  And there are a few questions it addressed by the present menus.  You would think that eBay would have much better Customer Service.
Example:  the inability to place a Bid on an Auction item due to no linked CC??  Not so and from my call to PY Pal I was informed that I was not alone, and the issue would be fixed by eBay shortly.  Well a day later the issue still exist and not one word from eBay.  Not nice way to treTyour Prime Customers",4
1460,"Affordable, trust factor, Value,: Here a place to help fine a affordable products. Auction are all so another way you could win a item you’ve been wanting at a affordable price. eBay will help if their ever a conflict with a return.

I like to be able to find products for different times of years. E bay has is place that one one could just about buy  anything at a reasonable price. eBay  is a day place to shop.. I love e bay and have save money and I am able to buy items in here where I could not at other place.",5
1461,"Glitches: When creating special lists to watch they cannot be viewed in the app like they can online through all lists.  Revise app to view all list items and not just watch items.  

Consistent information from app to computer would be very beneficial.  I.e. on computer you can view number of views/watchers as well as bids.  On the app both phone and iPad these fields consistently show 0 (zero).

Currently you cannot write a review.  Again consistency between computer, iPad and phone would be a plus for the user to avoid having to do part of the transaction one place and another part on a different device",3
1462,"eBay review: eBay has made some really great updates to how selling/buying works. 
Things seem safer for both people buying and selling products. 
The only inconvenience I find as a seller … is having to wait for my payouts.  I’ve been selling for over 4 months and it seems I should be able to receive my payouts immediately at this point rather than having to wait for 14 days or until delivery has been confirmed- I’m a trusted seller with 100% positive reviews",5
1463,"Fraudulent buyer attempts.: I feel like I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done.  I’m so disappointed that there is not one other potential buyer other than these fraudulent attempts. It doesn’t matter what I say on my post about not contacting me any other way except through eBay. 
EBay, if you’re going to fine sellers for going outside of EBay, then at least change the algorithm to stop these idiots from getting through. If you can put a kabash on something that I post because you think it’s inappropriate then why can’t you do that with these appropriate attempts that are impeding on my sales.
There’s got to be a way to get around this BS. 
Thank you ahead a time if you take this into consideration.",2
1464,"Overall a great app: Makes it very easy to buy and pay. There are a few little things that bug me. One is if you buy multiple items from the same seller, you can't delete them when your done with them. You have to go to through a computer to hide them. 
Also, I've noticed when I search for items, not all items show up. I find some down at the recommended items. Plus a recent search said that no items were found but showing some with fewer words, and they said the exact same thing I searched for.",4
1465,"Not in the seller’s favor: I used to sell on eBay and it was pretty fair, however they made some changes and now a once a bidder wins they can make you wait an unlimited amount of time to pay or not even pay at all and just leave you hanging even when I have asked them if they were actually interested and they said yes. So not only are they taking my item off and marked as sold but they just have no intentions of buying therefore wasting my time and me having to relist again. This has happened to me at least 5 times in the last 3 months and I just feel like I can’t trust any buyer and eBay staff doesn’t seem to care.",2
1466,"Unique Finds.: eBay has been a great place to find those products that aren’t found in the cities by where I reside.
The professionals that sell items are very good with getting the products sent on time, properly prepared and protected with the items arriving on time, or before expected.
A few times I had an unfortunate situation with a few products and sellers that didn’t pan out as necessary per eBay, eBay made it Right and got me my refund.
Thanks to Everyone involved.",5
1467,Appreciate EBay: It’s not often issues occur with purchases. But when they do Ebay is quick to respond and provide refund. It’s great to be able to buy not just new but used products with the guarantee you will get what you paid for or money back. I hate shopping and going in stores. Its wonderful that when there is something I need I can hit the site and have it delivered to me. I’ve got all my friends an family using eBay now as well!,5
1468,"Do not sell on ebay: I have sold numerous items recently and ebay will not pay me for the things I've sold. Every time they send me a notification that they will release my funds, they turn around and make up a reason why they need to keep my money longer. They owe me over 2 grand and will not even answer the phone at the ebay office. The people they have for customer service chat are the worst I've ever had the displeasure of typing with. They have never directly answered any question I've ever asked and have given me advice that would have costed me $200 out of pocket with no plan for reimbursement. Generally a very poor experience from start to finish, but my lawyer will be sorting it out soon!",1
1469,Not as good as in the old days: Selling on Ebay has become a chore. Sales are dead. Promoting doesn’t help- your items will still be hidden. Constant glitches that can’t be addressed once and for all. Same glitches keeps coming back. Watch for items specifics as Ebay updates keep changing them and puts items in wrong categories and this causes items to be invisible in searches even when promoting. They make sellers exhausted and put off causing less and less inventory listed which doesn’t help bring buyers to the platform. Ebay needs reimagination again.,3
1470,"Generally Great, Getting Annoying: The search function is slightly corrupted by “reproductions” and look-alikes of collectible items which is getting annoying. The notifications that eBay is unable to send me notifications is getting VERY ANNOYING. Stop bombarding me with notifications that I don’t want!!

That being said, I still find it a better buying and selling ecosystem than most others and I enjoy the messaging feature now offered to more personally interact with a buyer or seller. Overall, a fantastic app.",4
1471,"I trust eBay: I had started purchasing things on another site and was taken advantage of on a purchase that was not what it was advertised as. When I attempted to contact the site, no one got back to me and there was no number to contact and talk to a live person. I am done purchasing from other sites. On eBay there is always someone available to help me and eBay not only guarantees my purchases, but removes sellers who are deceptive. 
eBay is the best and I am done with the rest!",5
1472,I Love the EBAY APP!: I just absolutely love shopping on EBay I have been using this app since it first came out and have never had any trouble. I find everything so much cheaper on EBay and always check here before buying elsewhere. I especially love that they tell you where your items are coming from before you decide to buy so you’ll know whether you want to wait on shipping time etc. If you don’t already have the app get it it won’t disappoint you.,5
1473,"Great concept, beware of scams!: I have been using eBay for many many years. For the most part I’ve had very good experiences however recently I ran into a scam artist. I was eventually able to resolve my issue by threatening to have them removed from eBay. Unfortunately the truth is this person has been scamming eBay customers for a long time, I was not the first person to complain, and yet I did not receive any type of response from eBay. Perhaps they were working behind the scene and address this with the SCAMmer, I don’t know, However I will probably be using eBay for smaller purchases until they provide a little more consumer protection.",2
1474,Decent: eBay is decent to work with…. They have done their best to stop the abuse of fraudulent sellers( some were rude and just terrible people and would take advantage of the system that worked in their favor sending fake or damaged items and refusing to refund) eBay now attempts to intervene a bit but not much… most people are decent (sellers) but still there are some looking to get over(sending incorrect size or fake goods) but you mostly will need to depend solely on PayPal to refund your money or otherwise make things right with sellers and buyers…. Facts,4
1475,"Ebay Ripped me off: Well to be begin with, i had a laptop that I wanted to sell , some dude offered to buy it , the laptop was delivered and after about 9 days this dude said that there is lines on the screen, so ebay forced me to refund this dude (he probably a scam artist) , well this dude didn’t even provide evidence like pictures or anything, and they accepted his claim, and then now you have a broken laptop (if any could be in pieces and bit by now ),  then you have to refund more than where payed for, cause ebay take her cut from the sale but you make a refund it’s all on you plus you have to pay the shipping 
Bad experience, i am really dissatisfied and disappointed 
Never again, be careful of using ebay as a seller 
Thank you for this awful experience",1
1476,"Great turns from different seller and great prices w/ no hassle returns and great customer service: I’ve bought many things from clothing to kitchen items to earrings to shelving units to so much other stuff 
It’s got pretty much a thing you could think to sell or buy 
and I find all kind of great deals with great sellers and no hassle returns and if there is a problem with things  
Sellers and eBay will almost always refund  or are suited to fix it -so everyone is happy.  I love eBay and it’s sellers .. 
Jeremy",5
1477,"Great Way To Quickly Access eBay: But there is one thing you cannot do...where you buy multiple items and each item has an individual shipping cost. Often vendors will say they will combine shipping costs when you buy multiple items. They instruct you to go to your cart and press “request invoice”. 

This is not available in the app. It turns out I have to go outside of the app and launch eBay website on a browser and then ask for a combined invoiced. This could be a 5 star app otherwise.",4
1478,"eBay is Wonderful, But Where Are My Helpers?: I have sold through eBay since the spring of 2018.  The coronavirus came and I know it caused most people to go through changes, some have had a lot of changes.  My problem is that I have questions that the eBay site, itself, has not been able to help me with.  If it has the help I need I sure haven’t found it.  I would like to bring my brother into my business.  That is where my questions begin!

goldenmarketing",5
1479,"Always Great!  With one exception.: Ebay has been my first choice for buying hard to find / cheap items for years. It’s a great service and it’s rare to have a bad experience. But lately, your algorithm or whatever has become very annoying with it’s repetitive nature. If I’m looking at a list, the goal is to get to the bottom of the list. I want to see what’s available. Not the same item over and over and over. It makes me not want to use the app. Just sayin!",5
1480,Best way to shop: With things being the way they are (covid 19) and plus the money you save the best way to make a purchase I think is to shop ahead it may take a few days wait to get what you want but I think it’s well worth the wait just wish the person would would take a little more care and ring the bell or put your stuff all the way on your porch and not just on the edge where anyone passing can just pick it up and keep going if you don’t happen to see it when it’s delivered,5
1481,Ebay Transactions: Ebay is much more than just a transaction medium. It is the complete package. It introduces you to the product based on past purchases and taste. It provides one a cadre of optional products and finally it encourages and supports a financial transaction. Ebay does not stop here. Ebay ensures the transaction goes well and it follows up until all matters of concern are resolved. I don’t know how possible it is to have an account attached to Ebay for easier transactions. We could bypass PayPal altogether.,5
1482,Poor customer service: Ebay your customer service needs ASAP an updates to verify verification you guys need a system for identify theft mine or my moms social security numbers could be at risk and I wouldn’t know cuz your customer service system is all messed up ebay should have a system for customers to look up their own social security numbers to make sure there is no credit card  fraudulent accounts opened in our social security numbers I need to know people need to know if there being fraudulently taken a vantage of there credit ASAP need to know if I have any social security numbers I’m not aware of or any eBay credit cards opened account that has my social security numbers linked to them fix this problem u will hear back from me,1
1483,"Doesn’t Seem Like The Same Ebay: I’ve used eBay for the last 17 years, both buying and selling. I’d consider myself an eBay junkie. It seems in the last couple of years eBay has dropped the ball when it comes to selling. More deadbeat buyers, I’ve had continuous unpaid items I’ve had to re-list, 2-3 times, and you can’t leave negative feedback anymore like the years before. I haven’t been listing too much on eBay for that reason. Still great for buying though, you can find just about anything.",5
1484,"Good, but found a bug: Generally, a good app. However, I recently had an issue with what I guess would be considered the profile section. When I made a purchase, it showed my address as the destination, but the seller received a different address from within my profile (a family member’s that I had saved). Fortunately, I was able to retrieve the item. However, it was definitely a bug, because even the email saying the package had been delivered said it had been delivered to my address, not the family member’s. A bug that should be looked into.",4
1485,Bad business: Recently purchased Milwaukee 1/2 inch impact wrench and seller did not contact me had to file claim and wait to get money back to my account total scam. Second one i purchased seller did not up date item and was sold a day ago and i paid for item now I’m waiting on another refund from a second seller and needed tool for a job made I should take my business elsewhere not good business eBay very disappointed  Will be very hesitant to make any more purchases .,5
1486,"WARNING!!!! Don’t Use!!!!: I recently sold an item on eBay. Selling process was fine. When money got involved, AWFUL!!!!!

First, my item that I sold was already at the buys house. Took eBay, a week to send me my money from my sold item. Felt like I was being robbed. 

Then I got my money and all was fine.... until a month later!

EBay charged my account $100 and over-drafted my bank to receive another $50 charge. So I thought this was a miss understanding. No biggie, I’ll just call them and fix it. 

Apparently they tried to send me invoices telling me I have an additional charge, however had no proof of sending me this charge. I had no notice of a charge coming out of my bank account. When I called, they were unable to provide me proof of why I got charged.

Magically, 30 minutes into the conversation, I got an invoice. It just appeared and the person on the phone tried to act like it was suppose to be there. 

I did not get my money back. 

I was robbed by eBay. They took money out of my account and had no supporting evidence of why they did that. 

Will never use their services again!!!! Thieves!!!",1
1487,Yeezy: Would give 0 stars if I could and will be leaving ebay soon. Had the worst experience dealing with eBay customer service. They would not allow me to sell a pair of authentic Yeezys purchased at Footaction which is an authorized Adidas store in US. I had the receipt also.   I Kept getting transferred to people from overseas who barely spoke English and kept reading a prewritten script.  They were all very rude.  They basically said the shoe is fake and I was lying...though I had the receipt and have sold 100’s of authentic shoes!  Ebay is going down the tubes,5
1488,"Terrible new selling format: Occasionally it works, other times it deletes listings, won’t let me edit shipping info, doesn’t automatically capitalizes when it should, always assumes that I will ship Priority and you have to jump through multiple fields to alter it. Also, I don’t want to accept offers - you shouldn’t assume I do. Maybe one of the app developers should actually attempt to list something for sale, then you will realize how clunky it is. The old format from a few months ago was better.",5
1489,eBay deals: Seems no matter what we’re looking for eBay is the final choice for both research as well as assuring were getting a good deal. In most 1/2 all cases we find what we want elsewhere and ultimately find a better deal on eBay. Having the e-bay assurance guarantee allows me to shop knowing they stand behind the buyer in cases where things arrive damaged or not as described. They normally don’t need to step in because I found most sellers are truly honest and want their customers satisfied as such correct issues on their own.,5
1490,eBay is the Jam Deluxe!: eBay is great for all the right reasons when it comes to listing and selling items online. It has broad and accessible pricing and delivery options (or local pickup). It’s user interface is intuitive on mobile devices and computers. It cooperates easily with PayPal and is straight forward in how payments work. And eBay costumer service is on point with a staff who is willing to listen to your issue and help where they can. I have been greatly impressed with eBay in general and will continue to use it!,5
1491,"Not good for selling: Another bad fix! It would be great if you or apple would actually test this thing! Now it kicks you out every time you go to list something. Pretty awful! 

Horrible app! Breaks and has to be installed every single day! App Store should not even allow them to have it without fixing it! It drops shipping types every day so you have to reinstall every day! Completely unacceptable! How about running UX EBay Before you drop another bug filled version! Apple how about testing it?

It shows items awaiting payment that are paid for and will not let you delete them. I mistakenly sent a payment reminder to customer who had already paid, really making her mad. I have tried everything to delete the already paid for items there are 9 and I have to ignore them and keep track of who has really paid. Crazy!

They keep changing it and not for the better as they do not do testing, the latest took away the ability to see how many bids you have as well as how many items you have to be relisted.  Really lousy, you would think they would be more professional.",1
1492,Ratings: Before I download apps I read the reviews to see how well the app performs. When I read the reviews on this a lot of the negative ones were about experiences on eBay with bad sellers and eBay itself not helping as much as you'd hoped. Well here's the the thing that has nothing to do with this app. As a buyer eBay provides reviews on the sellers so you can leave negative comments for them and also see before buying the product if they had bad reviews before. Glad to hear the app works though rant over.,5
1493,I Love eBay!: I first discovered eBay about 1995. It has become my “go to” place whenever I’m looking for something. I have bought and sold on eBay with almost no problems. I highly recommend it. Selling on eBay is a good way to make a little extra money and you can find good deals to buy there as well. I was burned by one seller who did not show an accurate picture of what she was selling but overall the sellers are honest and I enjoy shopping on eBay.,5
1494,"Items being sold are not in hand: It seems like this happens a lot.  You purchase an item and then they don’t have it.  They try to substitute something else or send you something else.  They always have some lame excuse.   Does eBay usually help with this? Yes, but it requires you to spend your time getting labels, repackaging, and spending your time going to some mail service to drop it off.  Let alone the fact that you don’t have the item you spent time searching for.  Very frustrating to say the least!   It keeps me using eBay as much as I might.",3
1495,"Great Way to Explore: Ebay definitely provides a convenient way to shop and investigate options. I’ve only encountered one seller that was flat out rude. All other sellers, and there have been many, are friendly, wanting to be helpful, and responsive.

I think one issue that seems consistent across the board is packing. Sturdier packaging and better cushioning would be a huge improvement. Now I ask for sturdier packaging, even if I have to pay a FEW dollars more.",5
1496,"Terrible Customer Support for Sellers: Ebay has gotten worse and worse over the years with protecting the seller. I have been selling on ebay for over 10 years and they constantly put restrictions on your account with out explanations and holds your funds from being released. Unable to talk woth someone from ebay customer support team to explain the issue without being hung up on. Kind of ridiculous to invest in a company that doesnt invest in its most important people, the seller. If you can short this company financially i would, buy puts because this company is bound to fail. If they keep up this track record heck they wont be here in 5-10 years and someone will surpass them.",1
1497,"Search has minor bugs: I can search within seller stores for specific words that are right there in the titles right in front of me, and the search will produce zero items. Doesn’t happen with all searched words, but it does happen. Happens every time when searching the word “organo”.

If I search for a specific word within a specific category, why does the number of search results change depending on how I order the results? For example switching between ‘best match’ or ‘priced lowest to highest’.",4
1498,Fees: I resell on many other websites and eBay is by far my least favorite. They fee you to death compared to most other reselling apps. You get a certain amount of free listings a month but BEWARE because even when you go to relist items the bottom of the screen will say estimate fees 0.00 and then they will charges you “insertion fees” even though when submitting those new listings it didn’t say you’d be charged. I’ve been trying to get insertion fees refunded and they just keep telling me 24-72 hrs. It’s been two weeks. At this point I’m just waiting for them to be refunded so I can close my account. Also I forgot to mention that they can just take the money right out of your bank account at any time.,1
1499,"The UI is terrible: This app is unnecessarily hard to navigate, and it seems limited in its features. It is ok (not great) for creating listings, but everything else is terrible. It needs to be scrapped and reworked. There is no reason why this app shouldn’t be priority for eBay, everyone is using their phones to shop and list, so it would make sense that they would dedicate more time to refining this app.

It’s feels like they had an undergrad create it, as part of a class project. eBay is a serious company and should have serious developers. I realize that their actual website isn’t much better, but this app is borderline unacceptable for a company like eBay.",2
1500,New app.: First of all I wouldn’t do any stars but it wouldn’t let me. Goes back to the old saying if it’s not broke don’t fix it. There was nothing wrong with the old app. I’m not going to use the language that I would like to about how well the new app works. Emails already having problems keeping sellers on here because of their prices and customer service or lack of customer service. Now they’re going to finish running everybody off with this app. OK rant over,5
1501,"Eh, 4 star: I would give it 5 stars if eBay really backed up the buyers when they don’t receive there packages. Even though the tracking says delivered, there was a time I did not receive my shoes, thank god I used PayPal though, they come through. There was one time I was told to make a police report, that ridiculous, 1st of all I don’t have time for all that when eBay has to take care of the problem with just two steps, second The police out here aren’t worried about a pair of shoes that has not been delivered, get real eBay.",4
1502,All my purchases: I’ve recently purchased about 45 different items and products. All of which were awesome experiences. All I can say is I’ve been using EBay over 10-15 years now and am continually happy and satisfied with all of my purchases. So once again Thank You EBay for your guarantee and standing behind your customer service and auctioned products. You have a customer for eternity at least meanwhile That I’m trying to take over the Galaxy. 🌌💵🤩💸🚀🌌,5
1503,"Soooo many scammers: I’ve had EBay for about a week, and I’ve received offers and messages from about 20 scammers. None of the people that want to buy my stuff are actual buyers. This is so disappointing because I always think that I’ve hit a sale. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it might be good for other people who are selling ordinary items. Otherwise, I would’ve given it 1 star. I don’t want to misguide anyone, this is just my own experience. EBay should do a better job at controlling these scammers. Also, the app is so confusing and very difficult to use.",3
1504,“ Constant Changes “: At one time years ago I was on eBay all the time selling buying. Then things slowly started changing the pay and buying with PayPal changed. Now it’s changed again. It cost so much now to have to ship item and pay all these different fees. That it’s not even worth trying to sell something. Everybody has their hand out for a portion of money for the item you’re trying to sell. This app and eBay is not as good as it used to be. I don’t use it Harley at all anymore. Facebook marketplace is awesome and don’t charge like eBay. So why even have this anymore,3
1505,"Search issues: I use the app a lot for research and it frequently has issues with recognizing items using the image search tool. Most often it says there are no options to suggest. Also when searching with the app, filters are automatically removed with each new search which is terribly frustrating. And finally, the search bar requires perfect spelling or it won’t come up with the correct items. Typos make it really challenging especially when I’m a rush. I love eBay for the info and marketplace it provides but this is an issue for the app.",3
1506,"Latest App Update is Terrible!: It constantly jumps around in saved searches and watched item lists.  It's extremely difficult to use.  Filters do not function well.
Additionally, they are eliminating the Resolution Center.  It is becoming buyer beware.
I had a seller cancel my item ordered after I paid with PayPal.  He did not notify me of the cancellation and process with a refund immediately.  
After I inquired where the item was, he cancelled it but didn't refund my PayPal.  Then when I asked about my refund, I was told there was an issue at my ""financial institution.""  There wasn't but even if there had been the amount would have been credited to PayPal in general.  It's trust level with buyers/consumer' is being destroyed.",1
1507,Great to sell and Amazing to buy!: I have always seen my mom do eBay and I always wanted to get into it’s just that I never had time to do so but now that I do it’s absolutely amazing. The users are fair with their prices and when I had a problem I was able to get my money back even though the seller refused returns. I was saved $21 that day and I used that money to buy more things that I wanted. I highly suggest using this app because there is no other app better than eBay for vintage highly collectible goods!,5
1508,Want it discount price? Gently used ok?: I can say that if you need it or just plain want it eBay has it! My family has been purchasing items from eBay since early 2000’s and  have never been disappointed! As long as you pay attention to the items description and the sellers user rating (something eBay takes seriously) you can’t go wrong! The peer rating and feedback system makes this hands down the best spot to shop when on a budget or just plain internet garage selling.,5
1509,"Suggestion: When a item page is open, it is hard for most people to find “seller’s other items”.  This shouldn’t be hidden.  

Also, when looking at a sellers “other items”, it would be so nice if I could look selectively instead of having to look at all of the seller’s other items.  For example, I could enter “women’s large jacket” and see only those items.  EBay used to offer this features long time ago.  This would save a lot of looking time.  Thanks!

Something new that I do NOT like is the seller only accepting credit card payment.  That’s all good BUT I as a buyer don’t know this until I click But It Now, then I am surprised by the new credit card pay.  You need to signal on all of that seller’s items that he is a credit card only seller so I have a choice whether to buy under these conditions or not.

Thanks!

1510,"So bad I’m writing my first review: I recently sold my old phone on eBay. The phone had a few issues that were shown in the description and in the photos, so the buyer clearly knew what they were purchasing. As soon as they received it, they asked for a return, I do not accept returns. They asked eBay to step in and they accepted the return on my behalf! I filed a complaint on this and eBay told me they agreed with the buyer. They took money from my account and even extra for postage back to me! I filed another claim for false return (as the item was as listed), they told me that I should have been more clear in the listing! So for a phone I “sold” it ended up costing me $10. Customer support is a joke to sellers. Sad to say I’ll be giving Jeff Bezos even more money.",1
1511,"Scams: I’ve been contacted way too many times by scammers. I’m starting to think the only people interested in “buying” stuff on eBay are scammers. Fortunately, I’ve been smart enough to realize they were scammers, but dumb enough to accept their offers. I’ve only been using eBay for about a week and a half and I’ve probably been contacted by over a dozen scammers making huge offers and requesting me to contact them. For the fist few items I listed, I accepted their offers(I obviously didn’t ship them but I did relist the items) and now eBay says I owe them $5.00 because I used their platform for the whole month of May, even though I only used it for a few days in the month of May. Definitely deleting my eBay account and the app.",1
1512,"Experience Depends on the Delivery platform: For sellers, eBay works pretty well on a PC. But I need a reliable and similar mobile experience, which does not work the same.  On Mobile listing updates, the software sometimes makes shipping and handling fee changes that I did not make, and I can’t correct while on Mobile. This results on loss of income to me. eBay has addressed this software deficiency as ‘something we are working on.’  That’s not good enough, and confirms issues other sellers have warned me about. As a buyer, the experience on all delivery platforms is much better.",4
1513,"Two main problems with this app: The worst problem with this app is the cart feature, there needs to be an edit function so you can delete multiple items or move multiple items within the cart from “in cart “ to “save for later”. I’m being kind when I say the cart feature as it is ,is terrible!
The other problem is , if you’re searching or using the app for a long time, it will just crash for no reason . eBay please work on making the cart feature a tool, not a very outdated stumbling block.",4
1514,"Issues Selling on iPhone: I‘ve been having with selling on the iPhone app... The photo upload feature doesn’t work, so I can’t upload photos from it. When I select the photos I want uploaded, it gets stuck in an eternal loop. Pressing “done” does nothing. It’s annoying especially when you want to post something quick. I’ll like a solution to this. Thanks.

Update 5/8/19
I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Photos now do upload. However, now I find it very annoying that if I scroll a bit further from a week (more or less) it can sometimes freeze the app. I have to sometimes close or reopen the app.",3
1515,No juul pods or eon smoke: Recently there was an update and it completely deleted all of my saved items and users. And for me the worst part is about last week I looked up juul pods because I usually buy pods on eBay.(more customer service can contact sellers etc.) and there was absolutely none! I looked at my sellers that usually sell jullpods and eonsmoke stuff and all of them have zero items for sale! Did eBay ban juul pods and eon smoke? That would be a stupid idea but it seems that way. Who knows? I don’t. Well that’s just what I think.,5
1516,"Bad customer service: eBay does a very bad job in their customer protection. my wife order to pajamas one was too big the other too small i request a return or exchange they want me to pay for the return which is almost as much as what we pay so we had to keep them. I also bough an electronic machine my self i never got it show it was delivered and left on front on my door on a date when we were in vacation in florida for five days and eBay decided in favor  of the seller based on the delivery tracking info , why an electronic item be left on front of the door  exposed to the whether and no one signed for it when no one was home . Plus they want me to go and get a police report and submitted to eBay in order for me to appeal the decision",1
1517,"Really bad customer service.: All though this is a fun place to shop keep in mind tho customer service is very hard to reach out to. So when it comes down to needing to contact eBay via email or # it’s hard to find a way to talk to someone directly that can help you. 

I’ve been trying for days to contact someone for help and I can’t find the help I need on a refund that’s a little over $500. 

I’m leaving a bad review hoping this will catch their attention to please hire the proper customer service or make it better for us! 

$500 is a big loss due to their app not giving me the option to return and receive a refund. 

I’m letting yall know right now tho if I don’t get contacted soon I will be moving forward with legal actions due to several inconveniences they are causing me! 

And just so yall know what’s the refund for its because I purchased a hood from eBay that was made so poorly it doesn’t not even fit or close! 
Now I’m down a daily vehicle because I can’t drive without a hood and risk rain damage to my motor.  
This has been so inconvenient!",1
1518,"Thieves!!!!!!!: I sold a Montana knife company Marshall on eBay. It was supposed to go to Germany. eBay straight up stole the knife. It made it to their intentional shipping hub and never left! They never returned it and lied repeatedly! I’m shocked how scummy they are. An eBay employee instructed me on how to ship the knife before I sent it and ensured me that it would get to the buyer without an issue. Then eBay straight up steals it at their intentional shipping hub and makes zero effort to make it right. There is absolutely no eBay policy restricting that knife getting to the buyer. There is also no law that prevent it, eBay straight up scammed. The person that bought that knife was screwed out of 530 bucks. I’m not refunding it without my expensive knife. eBay should be, but they’re con artists.",1
1519,They protect scammers: If you want your money or item that you purchased do not trust eBay to facilitate that…they will allow the scam/seller accounts to take your money eBay as a company will acknowledge the account is an obvious scammer on multiple recorded phone calls yet they will not open a case or refund the money in a reasonable time…. waiting 6 weeks from the purchase date is ridiculous and getting in the way of me spending my hard earned money in the way I choose…. They keep giving me the yes treatment that it will be refunded in 48 hours just to get ran around the same loop for four weeks… I’m over the multiple fake sellers on eBay the Chinese fakes that are everywhere and the lying from eBay staff,1
1520,"60 minutes show: I did see the 60 minute show where eBay went after that old couple and nothing happened to the CEO who told them to take care of the problem and instead you guys gave him a big pay day and nothing happened to him.  Very disappointed with EBay.  So maybe I don’t want to give you 5 stars.  All I can say is I’m just disappointed, I like EBay but if that stuff is going on almost want to stop using it all together.",5
1521,"No refund: I returned a set of 1/2 wheel spacers almost 5 months ago and followed the correct shipping procedure like I’ve done countless times before! I still haven’t received a refund of any kind $48 and the seller tells me to contact eBay and the case has been closed and I have no way of contacting eBay to share my experience nor to explain to them that I’ve done what was asked of me and printed and attached correct shipping label and dropped off with the correct carrier and 5 weeks later I havnt received a refund nor do  I have the item I purchased! Not good business and considering I make multiple purchases daily, it’s no way to justify me being out $48 and no item for well over a month now!!!!",1
1522,"For sellers this app is money! But extremely limited!: I've been selling on eBay for well over 10 years now and I've made over $90,000 keeping with eBay policies of course... I've had success and disappointing sales. I still rank 100% that's positive as a seller. Pound for pound this app is incredible at making money with very little effort. I strongly encourage anyone to follow their dreams and sell, sell, sell on eBay! If you have a creative mindset and lots of determination you will always be successful at what you sell on eBay. Bad support! As far as customer support and The 800 number goes well it's a miss, gone are the days of getting real support for the sellers.",2
1523,"Almost all the functionality of the website: I love the eBay app. Super easy to snap a few pics and list an item, or go searching for something to buy. My only real complaint is that some of the account management pretty much HAS to be done on the actual website. For example, I recently moved, and getting the new address to reflect on new shipping labels has been a little tricky. Similarly, when having to cancel and reissue a shipping label, it was nowhere to be found. Otherwise, I’m having a great time.",4
1524,"Let eBay give your money to scammers, it’s the best!: If you are a seller trying to get by but have wanted to suffer a little more in life, download this app! Scammers from all over the world flock to eBay for their nightmarishly confusing policies and somehow even more confusing custom service agents. Buyers will prey on you and eBay will put you through a series of mental anguish trials before finally giving the scammers their money back and telling you they really don’t care about you… at all.",5
1525,"Worst company for online sales and worst customer service.: The absolute worst service ever created for online sales. I am not one to put the time and effort into writing a review on an app. This company has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced, I have had over 4,400$ of funds on hold for “not inputting tracking numbers” which I had inputted and purchased the labels through eBay themselves. The items were delivered on time with tracking information provided and I still have a restriction on my account. I have called over 20 times over the past 14 days and still have no response as to when I will have my account back and my funds will be provided to me. DO NOT USE EBAY.",1
1526,"So convenient: I really enjoy the convenience of eBay. Instead of having to drive to two or more stores to find what I am looking for I can find it all on EBay. I am not fond of putting miles on my car and possibly wasting my time trying to find what I want. I save wear and tear on my car and money when I shop on eBay. I have more than enough relevant items to choose from when I search on eBay and get them at a better price. There are even discounts offered often when I put an item on my list. How great is that!?
So I have saved time and money ever since I started shopping on eBay and have gotten EXACTLY what I have looked for. I have even seen options I have never seen or heard of before as well. 
Thank you eBay for making shopping so simple and quick, no stress involved either.

1527,ebay has changed my life. Wish I started selling years ago: ebay and this app are incredible I wish I knew years ago how easy selling on eBay was especially with the app. You don’t even need a printer to print out your shipping QR codes. Just buy a $15 scale and weigh your item when you list it so you are charged the appropriate amount. Post your item then take it to USPS and you’re done. Money in the bank for items you’d never imagine. Take my word.,5
1528,"Unable to change name on account: I am extremely upset as eBay is unable to verify my bank account but if I could just edit my account info then I would be able to add my full name to the account then allowing my account to be verified but instead it only gives me the option to manage the account, I cannot edit it. To make things worse there is no way to get immediate support I have wait until tomorrow which extremely inconvenient because I have to work all day. Negative 10 stars for eBay for not allowing me to make a simple change to my own account, then making it near impossible to get help! Might need to consider somewhere else to sell my items.",1
1529,"To whom it may concern: I used to love eBay. But ever since eBay didn’t refund me over a fraud case and I lose over five hundred dollars. I have a hard time trusting eBay again. Like how do you ask for me to submit all the information that needed. But then when I attemp to do so now, don’t none of the links work. So I was out of a lot of money because I was blocked from getting my refund. Not to mention the contact number for eBay online has been hacked. Fraudulent ppl. Ended up losing another 600 dollars thinking they was eBay. eBay show clearly they they didn’t have my back as a customer.",3
1530,"Older phones not supported: I am sick & tired of this. My iPhone6 is good enough for everything except eBay’s new software, so I can’t log on to determine what my Customers are asking about anymore except by using my laptop. 
Every time they do something like this it makes it more difficult for me to conduct business. They should pay for a new phone if they are going to write software the Sellers current phones don’t work with. 
Shame on you rBay.",5
1531,"Goodbye to 4 years: I’ve been a devoted seller on eBay for the past 4 years, never had a negative review. I e been reselling men’s clothes primarily. My brothers account got restricted indefinitely 2 years ago for drop shipping and now today my account got restricted indefinitely because we shared the same physical address. eBay customer service had no resolution for this and had no interest in helping me. 4 years of work gone, thanks eBay. Lowering prices and apparently standards for customer service.",5
1532,"Fraudulent Company: Don’t trust this company as a seller; eBay committed an ILLEGAL action against me and lied to cover their mistake.

A buyer purchased a contractually non-refundable item from me.  They then requested a refund, appealing through eBay.  I called eBay support to ask about the situation, and the representative assured me without doubt that I was entitled to the money and that I had done nothing wrong.  However, eBay mistakenly ruled the case in the buyer’s favor, breaking their own policies and illegally refunding the buyer from my pocket.  Upon follow-up contact to eBay through the Better Business Bureau, all representatives lied about the situation to cover their mistake and ignored all cited evidence I provided from their website’s official policies.  Very unscrupulous.",1
1533,"Great app, but issue with videos: I love the app, and eBay! One issue I wanted to bring up is videos. I have a couple of listings with mp4 videos, and when viewing the listing in the app you cannot play the video. All that shows up is a square button. They work perfectly in any browser...it’s only in the app where there is an issue. They worked before, so it must have something to do with a recent app update. Would appreciate if a developer could look into it. Otherwise, it’s a great app.",5
1534,"Hardly usable update: Few months ago, they updated the app and broke it so horribly, it’s hardly usable. Made it extra difficult to contact seller and initiate/track returns. Contacting support is nonexistent and they turned off Apple keyboard when doing that so no auto correct there. 

Every time I open the app I run into errors and issues that were never there before. I used this app for years, now I always look to other stores before buying on eBay, because this app makes it so crazy inconvenient should there be any issues with the purchase. 

Can’t stress enough just how incredibly buggy this app is. Doesn’t make me feel secure about my purchases at all with this level of coding incompetence and lack of support.",1
1535,"Need access to a live person: I’m an eBay seller as well as buyer.
For the amount of commerce that is done I need access to a live human without having to read a 3 minute article and waiting for someone to call me back.
The live body that I eventually do have access to an hour later does not usually have a he answers or the power to do anything about the situation .
For such a great site what’s behind it in a say to day level leaves something to be desired",5
1536,"EBay Shipping Bug: Apparently, eBay was attacked on July 18,2019 with a shipping virus or bug that the computer scientists at eBay has not been able to disarm yet after all these months and it shows all items on eBay as unable to ship items to Hawaii and Alaska even for tiny items like bumper stickers that can fit inside a standard first class envelope. Ebay does acknowledge that presence of the bug but not when they can remove it from their servers. Thus the one star rating.",5
1537,"Great app, but needs dark mode: This app is long overdue to receive a dark mode option. I’ve been using dark mode since iOS 13 released, and the lack of a dark mode within this app deters me from using it at night while I’m in bed or in a dark room. Please eBay deliver a dark mode ASAP! Also, there’s been recent issues with receiving false notifications. I receive emails, and push notifications every day for items that I’m not watching and do not have saved. I get item updates as if the item is on my watch list, but it’s not. This has been happening constantly for the past month or so. (Dec 2019).",3
1538,Prefer Classic Site: I loved shopping on the classic eBay site on my mobile because it was much more easier to navigate than the app. I’ve tried getting into the classic site but the app keeps popping in. I’ve even deleted the eBay app to try getting into the classic site but it reverts to the app version. The app makes me put off “window shopping” for wherever eBay takes me on the classic site. It’s not fun using the app for me anymore - I’ll use it but only when looking for something specific.😥,5
1539,"Good option for car parts and misc items: eBay is always one of my go-to's when shopping online, albeit I hate to admit I practically do all our shopping online these days. 
We own classic cars and between us and our kids, I maintain 13 cars. 
Many of our parts come from eBay as well as tools, printer ink etc. 
I've had only a couple of problems over the years and eBay took care of me. 
I've noticed that the majority of sellers that I deal with tend to be very personable and helpful. 
I do see some with poorer reps and I tend to stay away From those. 
eBay's rating system helps me to chose who I want to do business with. 
My only beef is the plethora of ""off-shore"" listings when you want to find certain items. You literally cannot sift through hundreds of identical listings. Say an LED lightbulb for instance. Too many listings to chose from. 
Overall though a great choice for our needs, especially since we live rural.",4
1540,"Difficult to use: 1st for SOME reason I’m having to sign in EVERY TIME I use EBay, and frequently when I’m just going to different parts of the site. No... your Remember Me thing doesn’t work.  I can NOT get rid of the “view the app” header.... even though that’s where I got the App from. And finally, it says I’ve only made 64 pitches in the last 3 years when 640 or more is the more likely number.  And where exactly do I go to read my previous messages to and from vendors?  

Like the site...  the App needs work.",5
1541,"Collections: I like everything except I wish I could put things in collections again. If each individual thing for sale had a little heart that when you touched it, it would bring up the collections list and you could pick what one you put it in and or make a new one and name it just like the regular eBay site, I would really love it and so would a lot of other people. Thanks for the chance to mention this. I would give it five stars if that option was available!",5
1542,"Seller: First off this is my first review ever. I must say Ebay your not living up to your potential on this app or even the regular website. To many people sitting around at eBay with nothing to do, so I imagine that’s why all the changes hmmm job security for them and nothing but a pain for us! I’ve been dealing with Ebay for over 10 years!  Every year gets worse. I hate to say this but my days are numbered with eBay UNLESS u get your stuff together Ebay! Don’t let those other guys ruin your future!",5
1543,"Mobile App With Minimum Functionality: The app should be made to match the desktop version in terms of functions, but it’s a far cry. For example. you can’t void shipping labels. The “manage shipping labels” link is impossible to access while using your phone, even from safari. Not just that link, but all the links that aren’t available on the mobile version and only on the desktop view will just route you back to the mobile view. What’s the point of even offering desktop view as an option if none of the functions if desktop are made available? The engineers should address this major flaw and actually design an app that allows sellers to use ALL their devises to do what they’re there to do: sell.",1
1544,"eBay is good, but could be great.: I have been a buyer and seller for more than 15 years. There have been so many changes, not all of them improvements.
Ebay wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for sellers, yet buyers who bid on items and fail to pay are free to continue that practice. Sellers seem to have no recourse. 

One other issue I feel is unfair is charging fees on shipping. I’m not clear on how Ebay justifies additional fees for shipping. Apart from providing a shipping calculator, what does Ebay contribute to shipping?",5
1545,"Invoices and filter: Would get five stars, but had to review finally. 

Still, after like 20 versions of people complaining, am unable to send a simple invoice from the mobile app. Why? I just don’t get it. Also, for like ten versions now, when I use the filter listings pullover once, the filter screen pulls over every time I touch the screen thereafter. Please put a “lock” option on the listing filter screen so that stops happening-its super annoying. Love the app, but please fix these two major irritations.",5
1546,"Good overall: Everything is good about this app except for one thing (and it really ticks me off). When you make an offer to a seller, and they counter-offer, you are not able to see your past offers...so I don’t know what to base my next offer on. When I’m making a lot of offers over several days on different items, I can’t always remember the exact amount I offered for everything. It’s quite frustrating and I have to get on my computer to check before I send another counter-offer. Other than that the app is pretty good.",4
1547,Items that do not arrive on the date indicated: I had bad experience and for 3 times the items do not arrive on the date indicated and I write and the seller and they tell me that he will not be available I will change and I do not buy more on Ebay and I will not recommend themI am disappointed with eBay and in 2 ovations I have spent this and I have written to the seller for more than 3 times and I have not received anything I know I will not recommend or buy more since I buy weekly on eBay but I will not,5
1548,"App works, should be as good as original app.: The original app was able to view all my lists. For the last year or so, the app and mobile site has had minimal features when compared to the full site. Only watch list available to be viewed, and only recent purchases able to be viewed, no old or archived purchases. This app is Avery stripped-down version of the full site, but it still works well. eBay, please all of the features of the full site available in the app.",5
1549,"Last update really stinks for sellers: I use this app for researching items to sell. Before the last update there was an option to sort by highest price only - now it’s shipping + highest price. That just makes it much more confusing. All I need to see is the items sorted in price from high to low.  Not to mention the fact that the shipping + highest price sort doesn’t work right. I’ll often see a really low priced item above a really high priced item, then one somewhere in the middle. The shipping cost comes nowhere close to making up the difference. PLEASE return the “highest price” sort option ASAP! And, if you could make it so the settings don’t reset for each search (like it was a while ago) that would be a great help as well.",1
1550,Great phone app: I pretty much use the phone eBay app all the time. I list sell items as well as bid and buy items it gives you all the tools you need to buy sell as well as notifications to when items sold or ending or winning items. Great app haven’t had any complaints other than I may have had it rarely close app while adding an item but it could have been a phone or software issue. Haven’t had any problems lately so latest versions seem good to go thanks.,5
1551,EBay is amazing !!!: I have been a member of EBay since 2010 and I have thoroughly enjoyed it and all of the millions of items to shop for. I rarely go shopping anymore. I love the security and the way they solve problems with any issue I’ve had. It’s a wonderful place to shop and most of the vendors are honest and fair and want a 5 Star rating. I would recommend this shopping or selling experience to everyone who has not experienced the fun and ease of trying it !!! Great place !!!!!,5
1552,"Love EBay: Have been shopping on EBay for years now! Because of EBay I have been able to find and complete several wonderful vintage collections, that I would have otherwise never been able to acquire. I have never been disappointed or let down with the quality service EBay offers! Any problem I have ever had, and mind you these have been few and far between, have ALWAYS been handled expeditiously and with great care!  Thank you EBay for offering such a great place to shop!",5
1553,"No longer shows fees: The app used to show how much it was going to cost to sell an item (fees).  Now, when selling there is just a button that says that by listing your item you agree to pay all applicable fee.  DO NOT LIKE THIS.  MAKES IT MOVE DIFFICULT TO POST SOMETHING TO SELL FROM MY IPAD.  PLEASE FIX!!!!!  I want to see what fees I will have BEFORE I post an item.

UPDATE!
Got a very nice response from EBay saying the app does not show $0 if there are no fees.  It only shows the amount if it is greater than $0.  They say it will be corrected in the next update.  I appreciate their fast response very much.  Very impressed.",4
1554,"Too much advertising: I have been using the eBay app for years now and with every update it gets worse and worse. The goal should be to let me see the things I want to buy, not the cheap crab they are trying to sell me. For those of use who still use eBay to find those unique items we can’t get anywhere else this latest update just makes our experience worse. I would love the option to just turn that stuff off, it is not like the company doesn’t have s revenue stream already.  Let me control what I see and I will go back to using the app, keep adding more forced advertising and I will simply go back to using the web site. 
Stop, just stop!",2
1555,"Ewww!!: If you love eBay and buy and sell a lot, this ""new updated"" version just made it harder...especially  for sellers.
Which is too bad because who likes to be Ball and chained to their desktop to do everything, cause that's what you'll end up doing as a seller.
As a buyer I'd like to know what genius thought it be a great idea to get rid of the ""grid"" option...so if you got a watch list, I hope it ain't long cause your gonna scroll half your day away keeping track of what your interested in....
The whole ""updated"" thing here is a dumbed down version of something that wasn't perfect...but you could function as a buyer or seller...NOW it just forces you to get home get off your  dumbed down app so you can figure out what the hecks goin on on your eBay account. As it stands I'll be using the ""old app""and not updating ios11..as I'm sure that's the reason for the completely New uploaded version of this ClusterF**K.

I love it when sellers place a Thank You card inside the box or a note with their information for future purchases.  And customer service support is always helpful whenever I’ve had a problem with an item.  I’m very grateful and satisfied for their quick response.,5
1557,"Amazing app...: i buy about 95% of my stuff through ebay because i never have to worry that the item wont come (or i will get my money back!) unlike paypal or other payment apps you have to use more frequently on other apps like facebook. Also very user friendly. ONLY DOWNSIDE IS: you need to use your social security number to SELL on the app, (its allegedly for authentication purposes) but if you are planning on selling and dont want to give up that kind of information, i would suggest trying something else.",4
1558,"Fix Search, Allow Seller Blocking, Fix AI: Why when I search does it not include all the listings in my results? If I search for something popular, sort by Newest, why do I see the same results over and over day after day when I know more have been created and a lot of new ones aren't being sold. 

Next, allow buyers to block particular sellers listings from being shown. There are countless sketchy and downright scam coin dealers that you guys allow to rip people off.

Lastly, move the AI Description elsewhere or don't have it completely wipe out the description I spent an hour writing because I accidentally tapped the AI Description button instead of whatever letter I meant to hit on the top row.",1
1559,eBay manipulating views of sellers: Are usually do not type many reviews but eBay stops reviews from potential sellers when he thinks that you have made enough money for the month trying to Your sellers account income on purpose. After talking for hours to customer service I’ve realized that eBay does it on purpose since there was nothing wrong with my account on the several calls that I have made in the past they determined that there was nothing wrong with my account so the only option available was that eBay is capping views for their own gain which is a very deceptive practice and just wanted to let y’all know before you decide to sign up for this deceptive and immoral company,1
1560,Feedback: Changes were made to leaving feedback and now it’s much harder.  When you see the feedback a customer has left you have to go to another page to leave feedback. And it doesn’t show the item they are leaving feedback on.   Do i int takes multiple steps now.   You used to be able to click on the item and Just click on feedback.  It’s much more complicated now.  Please review this issue.,5
1561,"It’s like doing business with the government: eBay makes it sound like anyone with an email can sign up and that’s true until you want to buy or sell… then you will need to link your Personal Bank account, provide a photo copy of your government issued ID and your SSN and for whatever reason they can and will withhold any amount of money you earned until you can verify all this information with them. 
That’s not all, before you ever see your money they will first help themselves to a fat 15-40% of what you sell before taxes. 
Their customer service team can do nothing more then regurgitate information that you can read your self.
If zero stars was an option.",1

1563,"ON THE BUYERS’ SIDE: I have bought quite a few items from EBAY and I will certainly continue doing that also in the future.
The reason is especially one: their statement that with them money back is guaranteed is 100% true.
Whenever I have bumped into a dishonest seller, in fact, with their help I was able to get all my money back.
Because of my positive experience I would advise a friend to buy on line from them any day of the week and twice on Sundays!",5

After a buyer refused to do what I asked  and didn’t follow the agreement we had , the buyer gave me a bad review! I contacted eBay support to get the bad review taken down and give the bad buyer a full refund but since eBay’s customer service is terrible, a bot decided it couldn’t be taken down after a minute of me submitting the request instead of an actual person! Many hard working eBay sellers such as myself  work hours on end to give the customer what they need and take all my money in fees! I have made EBay thousands of dollars for free through me! Use Etsy instead!!!",1
1565,DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!: WORST selling and buying app it there Facebook marketplace is much better. downloaded this app to try it out the first week I had problems and should of seen all the red flags. I was on the phone with eBay customer service for 3 hours and my account still didn’t work after that. I made 150$ in revenue but then eBay banned me from my account and I have no way to get my money!! I emailed and called nothing finally I received a email back saying it was time to part ways and they were sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing about my money it has been a month and a half still emailing because I earned 150$ and that is what I am going to get. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WHAT SO EVER SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!,1
1566,"Needs too many improvements: Every item purchased should have a print to PDF feature so when I order something for my work I can get a faster reimburse, yes I can make that in the PC/Website, but why not at the app? Second there is no way to give feedback to the developers from the app, thats why Im here, it gives you the option to go to the community  or choose from some ""how to use the app"" options but not actual ""contact the developers"" it would be better if I can make a PDF/print all what I have ordered with filters like year etc..",3
1567,eBay: I have a simple suggestion and if it’s already done then I just simply haven’t figured it out on my own… I think if the app would make it easier to communicate with the sellers or buyers in order to be specific with an item because I purchased an item and I was trying to ask for a  certain color of the item but I couldn’t ask for it because I didn’t seem to find a way to contact the seller easier !,5
1568,"eBay is the best place to buy something refunds are broken: eBay has the best prices. Easy to use. Sellers must have caution. Easy to get scammed without any way to leave negative feedback.  Even if you choose no refunds eBay forces them on you by controlling your money. 

eBay will be perfect when sellers can leave negative feedback and they stop taking the 12.5% fee off of your shipping cost. If it costs $10 to ship something and you charge $10. eBay takes $1.25",5
1569,"Very poor UI updates on iPad: Searching on iPad now shows a vertical list where one listing takes up the whole of the screen? And if you try to switch to a grid view you only see 2 listings per row opposed to the three or four you could before! This is silly. 

This is all after changing the two-column split view in the My Ebay page. Why is this screen now just a single list? It used to show you the list on the left and the page you selected (watching, purchases etc.) on the right. 

This used to feel like an app optimized for iPad with a great horizontal screen accommodations but they’re all gone! The app is so much harder and annoying to use now.",1
1570,"Quite possibly the most frustrating app I’ve ever dealt with: The app constantly asks me to sign-in. I enter my password and email, but it always says it is incorrect. Fine. I reset my password. If I close the app, the cycle continues…. Wrong password, reset, signs me out for no reason. Awesome.

Secondly, I’ve been trying to list an item for sale for 3 hours. I continue to get an error message that says “Something went wrong. Please try again later”. It provides no info on what is wrong. How am I supposed to fix the issue when I don’t even know what is wrong?

Absurdly annoying. I’ve never left an app review, but this app really cut the cake for most annoying, inconvenient and inefficient.",1
1571,"eBay: I have been shopping with eBay since 2009 I think. The stores are awesome and the customer service from the stores are great. eBay has stepped in for me a couple of times and thus I have been able to retrieve my funds. The commutation between eBay and the customer is awesome. I never had an issue. eBay is a good way to have small business here and buyers like myself purchasing goodies. Thank you eBay. 
P.S. please do not update the look of the application. It’s comprehensive.",5
1572,"It’s been great but now it doesn’t work: I try to submit a refund request when a seller sent me a bad part, they did not respond so I try to go through ebays “money back guarantee” so I type up my message and try to upload a photo of the defective part, app just goes blank. So I try to login on my computer, I put in email and password, 2 factor auth pops up telling me I should see a notification on my phone, this used to work now nothing pops up ever.",5
1573,"Too many fees: As a longtime member, I’ve come to realize that most things that are sold, buyers want everything for nothing. By the time a seller lowers the price enough for someone to accept the purchase, and shipping costs are factored in, then the fees that eBay charges for everything, and PayPal fees, you might as well be giving the item away and perhaps even lose money. I’m done with these selling platform apps and sites. Let’s not forget the hassle if a dispute arises within the transaction... don’t get me started!",5
1574,"eBay Rocks!: I love eBay! I discovered them late in life around ‘03 but became a member in’05 I moved to a remote town in ‘07 so shopping on eBay was so convenient I discovered selling and made a lot of money selling what I would have practically given away at a yard sale. Whatever I need if it can’t be found at Macy’s or Walmart it’s on eBay especially things out of season. 25/7 I can shop for my family, friends, church or myself. I have yet to not find it on eBay. In fact for convenience sake I will go to eBay first before anywhere else.",5
1575,"Surprisingly Negative Experience: I’ve been an eBay member since 2014, and I’ve got a 100% positive rating. I was recently notified by eBay that they removed one of my listings due to it being counterfeit. The item they claim is counterfeit was purchased by me, at a major department store, and the listing photo included the manufacturer price tag.

The message I received did not include any specific details about why eBay was claiming this item to be counterfeit, nor did it offer me a way to respond/refute this accusation.

Coincidentally, prior to receiving this message, I’d been considering discontinuing using eBay to sell on, as it cost me more to sell on than Mercari. This experience made the decision to leave eBay a no brainer. Bye eBay! Terrible way to treat a longtime customer.",1
1576,Thieves: My first time purchasing items on ebay and these purchases were over $700 hundred dollars and 30 mins after my purchase ebay emails me telling me i have to re-purchase my items cause it didnt go through. I check my bank account and it clearly shows that i have being charged for all my items. I call ebay and they tell me that their has being no purchases being made on my account. So whats really going on. THIEVES I SAY!!!!!!,5
1577,"Constant glitches: The app seems to getting soarer. It is hard to use because it glitch or crashes often. I have lost out on serval items because of it. Some of the issues I experience are: The app freezes and has to restarted when you touch pictures to get a bigger view. Anytime you choose more options and select one of the choices a new smaller screen pops up with the eBay home page with no options to exit, so now you are looking at a mirror effect double window. It also constantly gives the incorrect price of auction items, especially the ones the are ending soon. Watch items disappear. These are just some of the glitches that happen. The app is basically unusable now!!!",1
1578,App pros and cons: The app is very effective but when you relist an item that is good until canceled it will relist as 30 days automatically so that is a change that needs to be addressed.  Also a lot of times when you click on view item it will not come up...clicks But will not come up.  One bonus feature though is the app when bidding is delayed a couple seconds so when you did in the last second it has a little bit of lead time so you can get your bid in.,5
1579,"High fees steal your money: When you combine your ebay fees with final value fees the cost to the seller is quite high. Factor in shipping cost then your slim margin is almost gone. When eBay started out they were a great place to sell your stuff now it is pretty poor. Use letgo or offerup to retain more of your money. 

Another point is there are a lot of eBay scams and fake users. Add to that the PayPal scams.. forget it. eBay is no longer a viable option. I've been on eBay since day 1. I will only buy not sell anything there ever again.",5
1580,Changes in the app are a bit frustrating: I can usually adapt quickly to change but the changes on this are very rough. There is an incompatibility when I write the description on my laptop then try to edit it on this app from my iPhone.     The process does not flow as easy and it’s hard to find detail changes like returns and shipping cost.  I finally give up and finish the posting on my laptop.   Shopping functions work well.  I think I definitely like the old app better,5
1581,"eBay is not worth the headache!: eBay has a 90 period where if you don’t sell anything/ don’t reach a certain dollars, they hold your funds. You could end up waiting up to 21 days even after the item you sold have been delivered for your funds release. They have also stopped PayPal from releasing your funds, a company which they partnered up with for an “easier” process. Once you reach out to them, the hold time is usually a hour or more.",5
1582,"Add SKU to sold listings: I love your eBay app and I use it all the time as both an eBay Top Rated Seller Plus and a Buyer. In fact, I use this eBay to help me ship items. I do have a suggestion for an enhancement feature. Would it be possible to include the SKU on the Selling > Sold record. It would also be nice to have it listed somewhere when we are reviewing an offer. I include my cost of goods sold within the SKU and this information would be helpful when accepting, counteroffering or declining an offer. Thank you for such a great app.",5
1583,"Still The Best...: I’ve been a long time member and have made countless transactions on eBay without a problem. I did have to call customer service for the first time and the representative was very helpful and quickly resolved my problem. 
I’ve tried some other sites but I find eBay is the farthest reaching of them. The fees are reasonable and the transaction process is very nicely designed to allow good communication, easy shipping label preparation and post sale activity...feedback and tracking data.",5
1584,"Terrible update!: Since your last update the app is slower than ever, it just crashes, or I have to restart my iPad just to get it to open my messages or see a purchase as it stays on permanent spin cycle. Error messages are constant. When it finally works it’s great, but if I have to exit out of it for some reason I have to fight it all over again. Till it’s fixed I’ll just use eBay on my browser.

Before the update it was great and I loved it.",5
1585,"App has gone downhill: I have been unable to load my profile info since the last several upgrades on the App. There seems to be too many problems each time there is an upgrade. The older versions worked well. Please get the bugs worked out of this App since they are causing enough problems that I make my purchases elsewhere.

Update:Today, the App is working. I’m now able to upload my profile. I’m not sure what changed, but the App is working better than it has in weeks, so I change my review and rating.",4
1586,Latest Update is TERRIBLE for saved items/searches: You guys need to undo whatever it was you changed in the last update. My saved items and saved searches are jumbled and difficult to find/navigate. Also ended saved items are impossible to find. Whosever bright idea it was to change these things needs to be fired or even better maybe they should try using the app for a while before changing things to make app usage more difficult.,5
1587,"eBay: The sellers on EBay are almost 100% without fail, the most reliable and trustworthy business people I can imagine. The 5 star review is important to them, and they are therefore always striving to do the best for their customers.  The prices seem to be lower than most other selling sites, and I think one can find ANYTHING they might be looking for 
I really appreciate EBay. Finding what you need or want ANYTIME is so wonderful. Thank you for this excellent selling site.",5
1588,"Selling update is terrible: Selling functionality is especially and terrifically terrible. It is as if someone approached it with the goal of turning the mobile app into a crappy web app with just as crappy functionality. Way to lower the bar from what this app once was.

Shipping Suggestions are way off base with reality to the detriment of the seller. Settings aren't sticky between listings requiring multiple edits every listing (listing duration, shipping settings, locale settings, handling time - when it works at all and doesn't make me to use the website). Forcing on options like international shipping and defaulting off buyer restrictions are obviously pushing sellers for an agenda they don't need or want.

Do you hate mobile app users?? Who is scuttling this app and why?",1
1589,1 star as a seller: I'd expect nothing more from eBay then to not help a seller with a mistake that eBay made I've tried everything to fix this issue even somehow managed to call customer support to not avail. I've made this problem know to eBay and still did not receive any help with fixing the issue with my return address. As a result of eBay's unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and support the fees are not clear the chargers and absolute joke of a return policy l've decided to never sell anything on eBay from this point on and from the looks of it so have a lot of other sellers on this platform I have things get better for the sellers that stay but in know they won't,1
1590,"eBay is amazing: I’ve been using eBay since I was a child. I would “borrow” my moms card and buy rated M video games and other things my mom refused to buy my brother and I. We were severely punished sometimes but getting Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas in the mail made it all worth it. As In grew older, I started selling Jordan’s on eBay for a quick couple bucks. eBay is still an amazing website and it’s created a wonderful, easy to use app. Thank you, eBay! You’re here to stay!",5
1591,"Buyers can do whatever they want: Buyers can mess with your auctions however they want. Want to figure out a reserve price/maximum bid? Scare off other bidders? Place whatever bid you want, a completely unrealistically high one, then retract it days later. Want to torpedo an auction? Bid it up as high as you’d like then say you don’t want to pay. There’s no option to leave negative feedback, all of this is within eBay’s TOS. If you’re not a reseller/store this isn’t worth it for anything worth selling, you’ll get screwed over continuously if you’re just a small time or new seller and be expected to go along with any demands. eBay takes a huge cut for working against you at every opportunity.",1
1592,Why I gave 3 stars and not 5: This a great app if your a BUYER! As far as a seller it’s highway robbery ! The fees are outrageous ! I remember a time when you didn’t have pay taxes OR fees on eBay ! But them times are far behind us and I basically use this app to just buy and if I do sell unfortunately the price has to be high so I dnt loose money on items I’ve already payed for and paid taxes on! I shouldn’t be charged ! If I’m running a business on here I understand the fees but for a normal person just tryin off a few personal items at a good price for others is non existing anymore and it’s sad,3
1593,"Sold a bike a while ago still can’t get my money: Unfortunately eBay no longer cuts a check nor will credit an Pay pal account and I’m not a fan of providing my bank account info for deposit so unfortunately I’m out a bicycle and cannot receive my money for the sale.  Worse yet, I agreed to donate a percentage to a charity and thus they suspended my selling privileges.  I made a donation outside of eBay just so that the Charity wasn’t impacted.  Very disappointed with eBay -  would not have sold anything further anyway because there is no way for me to receive the proceeds with their current methods - I hope they resolve this some day.",2
1594,"Great Vendors: During the pandemic we discovered EBay had no customer service. ( Not exactly true, we talked with people where English was not their first language). After repeating our complaint, even writing it out, EBay never correctly identified our problem, nor refunded our money. Fortunately, most of the vendors will go out of their way to make things correct and we have no need for the poor customer service EBay offers.",5
1595,"Unhappy and I am a long term customer who sells a lot: Unhappy and I am a long term customer who sells a lot. The fees are soooo high, I am not making any money. eBay takes it all. 

Perfect products are being refunded because a customer selects a drop down they want just because of whatever reason it didn’t work for them. But it was what was listed. 

I also got restricted from purchasing because 3 items I had in my cart hadn’t been paid for yet, I was away, so didn’t know I won them, I paid for my whole order for the same buyer, but 3 of the items were cancelled because I was away. When a customer has purchased at least 30 items from a seller over a short period of time, someone at eBay should have noticed that first before making such a rash decision.  

But the sizable fees are the BIGGEST issue with eBay, making folks like me who have over $100,000 of product, to want to look somewhere else to sell. Don’t want to, been loyal for over several decades.",2
1596,"No Longer Alerts When Item Sold: I have been using eBay app for years what the website even longer. Over the last few months I’ve noticed that I was no longer being notified of my sales. If it weren’t for my bank app notifying me of a deposit or me checking my business email, I would be unaware that I made a sale. This is dangerous because it could mean I’m late shipping out the product to the buyer. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, triple checked my notification settings, everything I know to do to no avail. Please fix this!!! As a Seller receiving buyer notifications is my primary function for this app.",2
1597,"Bad for sellers. Non-transparent fees: I’ve been using eBay for years as a buyer only. It’s very convenient and there are lots of items. I figured I’d do some spring cleaning and try selling on eBay for the first time.

You won’t be paid for your sale what you think you are going to be! eBay has made their percentage very unclear until it’s too late. If you don’t like paying 12-20%+ on your item sell somewhere else. eBay is an old publicly traded company with limited growth potential so they prop it up by increasing fees.

Sell somewhere else! Now that I know that sellers are getting a bad deal on here, I’m reconsidering bring a buyer on eBay again either.",2
1598,"Listings do not save!: Worst app if you’re listing multiple listings in one post. I spent four hours working on a 250 item listing. By the time I finished everything and clicked save, everything just disappeared as if I did not work on anything. Literally everything go deleted. Not one of my variations were saved at all. I did not walk away from my MacBook Pro 2022 even for a second the whole time. I mention the laptop so eBay knows it’s not that issue. And my wifi is very steady and reliable I never lost it. Also, my laptop never shut down. Just making sure eBay knows. They need to hire better engineers to fix these issues. I would give it a lower rating if I could I’m done.",1
1599,"crashes / fades to black: THREE times in less than an hour! a few years ago, i had same issue. NOW ITS BACK, DOING IT AGAIN!
have to reopen the app. and worst part: have to start search all over again. ughhh. following ""similar items"" option is not an option because app opens up at home page. i was really on a roll - finally found an item similar to what i'd been searching for. CRASH TO BLACK SCREEN! lost the path i'd been on. this happened THREE TIMES. 
i finally had enough. closed, then removed app,from my desktop. i found many other auction-type sites. i love ebay, but im done wasting time. i'm not gonna beg an app to do its job",2
1600,"It’s ok: They keep removing  standard features and adding annoying ones at the same time. 

Prime example. Why can’t I check in my buds without 5 extra clicks? Why default to the list that contains every old offer and past auctions? Now we have to click on “bids and offers” see the list that contains 30 or 40 inactive items, click sort and finally I can see the items I’m actually bidding on? I lose track of my bids regularly and have missed out a hunch because of this stupid convention. Just let me see what I’m bidding on. I don’t care about other offers. 

Also why not give us the ability to create a shortlist ourselves of items we’re playing Ning on busying so we can separate that from items we’re just watching?

I get the sense that the app designers aren’t actually users.",5

I was hesitant at first worried about the fitment but this fits perfect thank you and delivery was expected in Jan-Feb but I already received it. Will be ordering another color from you again.

I recommend purchasing from this seller, very impressed thanks again.",5
1602,"Easy access to most features.: As a buyer the app is 5 stars. Easy to search, bid and purchase. 

As a seller it’s a 3 or 4 star. There are things that you still have to go to the desktop app to complete. Some features of the normal website that just don’t exist on the app. Such as invoicing and shipping labels in some cases. Overall it will work for your needs and give you easy access to your sales and listings. It definitely improves the listing process.",5
1603,"Ítems and prices better than the AMZ: It is much easier and more comfortable to buy on eBay site even the prices are better than on AMZ that's good.  Now the bad, the process to return a defective item is very bad. Escalade process?? Noooo, othet, you find very unprofessional and misleading sellers, for example FAST SHIPPING, they only send you the tracking number and you see that it does not progress, because they play with your need.  eBay should correct this because PRIME is going to WIN!!
Beware!!",5
1604,"Scammed by seller, no help from Ebay support: I bought two items from a seller, yet only one was sent. I contacted Ebay support but they sided with the seller even though the seller gave no correspondence to my complaints of receiving  only 1 item. I did not take photos of the small package I was given, clearly indicating not two items.. Folks should take pics as potential insurance…..
  Though I use Ebay all the time, I am disappointed in their Ebay Support because I was scammed by the seller. The seller never responded to my complaints, which I assumed Ebay could see as potential evidence? The gifts were for kids and they were disappointed to hear the second item never arrived from Ebay",1
1605,"Ebay has NO customer service: Ebay is not efficient nor user friendly anymore. Difficult to contact them on the phone nor chats. Loops you first into different categories and when ‘other’ issues is selected, loops one back to FAQ categories. Ebay deletes items without even reviewing whether the items comply nor not comply with their listing regulations. None of the items I was selling were undergarments nor socks. Ebay deleted the bundle of baby toddler shirts and pants. When I finally talked to a customer service rep, they admitted they made a mistake but they couldn’t restore the item they deleted. There are other sites for buying and selling. Ebay has NO customer service.",1

Also the Samsung is thrashed, but that’s not the point.  EBay did not even read the information that I had sent.  I want my Acer computer back, not some piece of other crap.!  My point is I want back the same product that I refunded.  You do it for the buyers side but not the seller.  NOT RiGHT!",5
1607,"Orders not arriving !!: Couple of my orders the last year have not arrived then when I tried to get a refund I was given the runaround and never the item that I had paid for finally I just let it go because they were small purchases I think one was $20 and the other one was 12 I don’t do a lot of shopping on eBay probably about six times in the last year but that being said that would be 1/3 of the items I had ordered did not Arrive. Don’t get me wrong I love eBay  you just have to be careful , especially with stuff coming overseas!  thank you!",3
1608,"Shipping options messed up: Doesn’t seem like you can utilize business options with the app, also for resellers seems the FED EX estimates are considerably lower than what you get invoiced for.  Their support is pretty bad (mostly foreign countries where it is hard to understand the person on the other end due to their poor English) and eBay as a whole seem focused on the bottom line as opposed to helping sellers and buyers help grow their company.  eBay surely fits into the category of a sustaining technology... they lack the vision or leadership to deal with future disruptive technologies.  I doubt this company will be in business in 5-7 years.  They are that antiquated in their methods and treatment of their community.",2
1609,"Wishing Sellers Were More Important: We are a non profit who employ women with barriers to employment.  This is a paid Vocational Training program called Second Chances.

Because of the way eBay uses algorithms and it’s stiff penalties for making mistakes, eBay holds the power to make or break a small Social Enterprise such as ours.

eBay automatically allows refunds on items just because the buyer says it’s defective.  Just recently a customer put the reason as defective and then commented.  Nothing wrong with the item, it just is too small.  We put all measurements in the description.  Now we are on the hook for all postage to and from on a $6.00 item.  Then EBay dings us for selling a defective product.

Not fair, eBay!!  Not fair.  Women are recovering from their past and given the benefit of the doubt based on their present actions.  Wish eBay had the same policy.

Director, Second Chances",5
1610,"Ludicrous discount suggestions: I am and have been an eBay seller for about 12 years. Not long ago eBay introduced a feature in which my store stock was examined by some type of algorithm or AI and I would then  be encouraged to “send a perspective buyer a discount offer.” This was a good feature; I used it and it it generated sales. 

But now it has changed and is no longer useful. I now receive suggestions from eBay to offer discounts on items as inexpensive as $5. In addition, eBay wants a discount offer to include free shipping for the buyer. Shipping my items costs $3.25. After the sale, eBay takes a fee and PayPal also takes a fee. So on an inexpensive item, this leaves me, the seller, with literally nothing.

This arrangement is good for the buyer, who gets a great discount plus free shipping. It’s great for eBay and PayPal, who get their percentage. But for small sellers, and other small businesses that are supposedly the backbone of America, it would quickly drive me out of business. 

So thanks eBay, for yet another tweak to your app that makes doing business for small businesses more difficult. 1 Star.",1

There’s also an item just sitting there not saying it’s shipped for over a month.  When I try to cancel, the system won’t allow me to do it.  I guess they plan on taking my money as well?",3

Then it just opens the app on the home page, it doesn’t take you to the link in the email. So lame. Why bother? I’m not going to hunt around for the page. So many smaller companies’ app connects to the link from the ‘yes’ click (passes it in the background so the app knows the specific page link to open), but not eBay’s. Truthfully, their app dev is really behind the curve in many areas and the whole site is being dumbed down, making it quite tedious for people who can think.",2
1613,"Handy but unstable: This app is handy but is so unstable!  It often stops syncing, and returns none/ zero of your listing.  Maybe it is okay for buying, but it is very unstable and turns to be useless and unreliable when you are a seller.  I hope there are other developers can come out better apps.

Like now, I actually am having 25 active listings, but this app shows one!  I listed 24 new items about 6 hours ago, but it shows only one in this app, which was listed 6 days ago.  Totally useless.",5

Gotta be an easy way to turn off vehicle filter right? Not on this app, only option given is to change model year.  Only way to get rid of vehicle filter is by removing H2 from the search which then yields every bulb size ever made.  Any $ savings overcome by the extra time wasted searching.",1

Very uncool! I don’t think this is properly thought out. I think that vendors who are selling new merchandise should be given one of these tax reporting documents, but people who aren’t running businesses and are selling off some of their stuff shouldn’t have to pay taxes on it!

I’m not saying you have to give the stuff away, but it’s pathetic that a seller will only come off their price $2 when they are already $40 higher than a similar item. I know, I don’t have to negotiate with them, but it’s abuse of a cool feature! eBay needs to do a better job.",3

1623,4 Star rating or less for listing items: I’ve been using the eBay app for a long time. It has went through many updates and changes. What I find is that it has been made more difficult for someone to add listings. How about fixing so we can just list our item rather than looking for one like we’re selling? Also you have made it very difficult to choose Free shipping. You have to hunt for it. Please and thank you.,5

But if for whatever reason, you have tension with this brand, the app and website Mercari takes the #2 spot after Ebay being #1 for go to online buying & selling sites.",5

Ebay supposed to have money back guarantee and all that, well I just had an order that I never received, never got my refund, I even contacted the seller no response. There is not even a place for me to tap on return or anything. Ya’ll need to fix this because it says I’m allowed to return until a certain date but then there is not button to press for returns? How am I supposed to return it then. I even “submitted my feedback” but ebay hasn’t done anything. I will take my business to mercari gladly",1

But when you spend a decent amount of money on brand new sneakers for them to come clearly used, and colors fading into the whites, soles coming apart, and they look for any loop hole to say “no we can’t re fund you” just be warned. All because I removed the authenticity tag to sneaker that should not have been authenticated in the first place and shipped to me as “brand new” I lost $300. If this is the case I wonder if they can even tell if the shoes are fake. Don’t make my mistake and remove the tag, but I’m sure they’ll find another look hole to keep your money.",1
1627,"Become Too Buyer Friendly: I have been a huge EBay fan for a long time but at this point they’ve become too buyer friendly.  They’ve enabled buyers to use negative feedback in order to hold sellers ransom.  Back in the day, EBay did not allow this sort of activity.  Now they have no issue with it.  A buyer can now issue negative feedback and then message you for a Venmo payment or for an additional item.  Claiming they will change feedback once payment is received.  Instead of EBay siding with the seller and removing the feedback, which is meant to extort the seller, EBay allows the feedback to stay and allows sellers to be extorted right and left.  BE CAREFUL!!! EBAY DOESN’T CARE ABOUT THEIR SELLERS ANYMORE!!!",1

1630,Good app for sellers but fix the pictures.: This app use to be good for the most part. It has a few problems but nothing bad. Now half the time you can’t even load unpaid items to send a payment reminder. Offer history only half works. You can usually see the history for old offers but not for the buyer on his second or third offer. We receive hundreds of offers a day so we can’t always remember what the buyers previous offer was and what our counter offer to him was so history is important. The notifications for viewing new offers doesn’t work properly and loading messages with the volume we receive is almost impossible.,1

I received multiple violations for ""pandemic related items"" that were simply office supplies. Scissors, envelopes, and printers. My account had a pending payout of around $30,000 and they kept it due to ""damages to ebay or PayPal"" I've emailed and called and they couldn't be more unaware of how terrible their automated site security system is.

There’s no counter offers or anything and when I think I’m about to actually buy something it gets pulled right under the rug by some anonymous person.

1637,"eBay has effed us again: As a seller with a perfect feedback rating, I have watched over the years a steady decline in the user friendliness of their interfaces whether as an app or as a desk top site. Each update, the bug fixes aren’t fixing bugs in the coding of the software, but rather removing features that are integral to the usability of the experience. It’s not remotely convenient to use eBay in any way, and this latest update proves that so concretely that I have all but stopped using their products. Corporate eBay is just as horrible as all of the other corporate indiscretions by other companies across the globe. It’s as if these people worked for Brawndo in the past. eBay, it’s got what plants crave.",1

Not possible in my Iphone version. Why? Home screen is a joke! No info, just suggestions. Oh, & removing PayPal is going to save me $$? NOT! Just raised final fees to compensate.

1639,"Grade A+++++ Seller Mistreated: Because of the prices of my products being able to be cheaper than other sellers on this market place, I was placed under suspicion. I would always have nice reviews until I received this 1 particular message and everything went downhill from there. eBay doesn’t care about the truth about everything that was dealing with the situation. As long as their customers have a smile, eBay is proud. How could they have for sellers a no refund policy but enforce a refund and on top of that, the product that you shipped out isn’t even what’s returned when the enforced refund  takes place. I liked using them for a while but now that time has run out!!! Goodbye 👋🏾",1

Terrible strategy.  This in combination with eBay’s refusal to take responsibility for address verification of buyers might be the nudge I need to delete the app.",5

I asked for help from customer service, they told me what to do, I did it, and then I was still charged for the item and didn’t receive the replacement. Nearly two months later, I finally got my refund from the seller. The customer service reps gave me contradictory advice and then were rude to me when I followed it and still got no results. You’d think they’d be a little better at helping customers, given that eBay is FULL of scammers who try to sell or buy things unscrupulously and then pocket the money. Don’t use this app or this service.",1

Days were spent driving around from location to location, with disappointment the likely result.  EBAY changed all that.  Now, finding that same rare item is just a few clicks away.  EBAY expanded my search area for rare items to  global proportions, increasing my ability to collect rare items exponentially.  Thank you EBAY!",5
1643,"Why is this so hard to navigate?: Overall, yes eBay let’s you sell things you don’t need anymore to someone who’s interested. The reach is impressive. 

As for the app (and the same goes for the website) it seems as if they designed this to intentionally take more clicks than needed. 

Someone asks about your item and two people bid. Is one of those bidders the person who asked about it? Good luck finding out. Have a bill to pay? Need to reprint a label? Want to understand the breakdown of your fees for the last few purchases? It’s all there, but you’re gonna spend some time trying to find it.",3
1644,Greatest app and products: I love using the Ebay app because of all the great products and prices that the sellers have . I love the fact that you can select different filters such as price and locations and even free shipping and more. I just love how they even recommend items that you search for and even the different prices so that you can chose what is affordable for you. I recommend this to anyone who loves to buy online and especially when it comes to buying games .,5
1645,"Confusing shipping label: Every time I deal with shipping labels by ebay - it is always a mess. For my item, I selected “parcel ground” delivery. Yet when do “print a shipping label”, it says “priority flat rate envelope”. So what is this? And the whole ui for this looks super confusing - first I see some postage, some total for it, then the delivery service, then total for it, then the overall total. What is all this? Super confusing. My parcel is pretty heavy and I have no idea how will it work out tomorrow at the usps office.",5
1646,"REALLY BAD in helping to fix HORRIBLE & dishonest sellers: If you have a dishonest and shady seller who is obviously doing their own bidding, EBay will do nothing to get involved immediately to help! This guy from China (Tennis-Buy) is obviously doing his own bidding but EBAY can’t help resolve. He put a fake really low price and just keeps driving it up until it’s RETAIL.
Really Rocket Science. 
I should have known better.
However, I’ve had great experience with some American sellers. Honest & transparent.
Again, what a shock (not).",5
1647,"Great but one suggestion...: So the app is overall fantastic but there’s just one thing, for the items that you have bought I would absolutely love it if there was also an estimated time (not day because the app already has that) for when the package arrives that would help a lot. Especially when your working and don’t want anyone to steal your package because that has happened to me before. Hope you look into this",5
1648,"Here we go again with searches repeating: Every few updates, the saved searches don’t “update” after you view them. So, you see the blue dot that signifies new items are listed; however, when you go to view those items, you also see the items that were new the last time. This will stick even after three, four times. Don’t want to have to go through what I have already seen before. Annoying when you have over 100 searches. 

I will try what I have tried before that has never worked - uninstalling/reinstalling. Usually, after the next update or a few days, it resolves, but why does this occur so often?",2

1. Photos showing as blanks after uploading (have to erase pics, reset app, and re-upload pics)
2. When writing the title in the “describe your item” box the title that appears on the listing page is 100% DIFFERENT than what I entered. 

These are not Major Issues for me, but they are annoying and throws my workflow off sometimes. Overall I love the app",5
1650,Issue regarding sold items reappearing for sale: This issue has persisted and I’m not sure how it initially began in the first place. I’ve used the eBay app countless times and lately I’ve been having an issue where items I have recently or not so recently sold will appear again in my Active selling tab. I don’t want to misinform those who may be interested in an item that has been sold to someone else. It would be great if there was an option to submit feedback/suggestions on the app it’s self instead of going through the App Store.,4

This only happens on my phone, not iPad where i now typically use it.  Other than this minor bug the improvement I feel is needed comes by way of the credit card. As a holder of an eBay credit card I find it honestly absurd that I can’t make payments, view activity, or do literally anything involving my account from the app.",4
1652,"Jm21: I love and live ‘eBay’ , I have since 1999. My only problem is when a situation arises, you have to deal with the other party first plus a certain amount of time before eBay can step in... depending on that  situation , the other is either gone  or has made a promise that he or she did not keep and you lose money . I have , many times and enough of it ! I still buy and sell on eBay but will no longer try to arrange the situation with the buyer or seller... i will go to eBay directly !",5
1653,"Sellers beware!: EBay is very ambiguous about the charges to sell items. It cost you more to list something then it does to sell.  I had one buyer who claim they didn’t get their product because I had a number wrong on the tracking. I fixed it and then they said their item was broken. I’ve sold a lot of items and have never had an issue except for one buyer. Of course, eBay will side with the buyer. Then I really lose money.  I am done! Please consider my story before using eBay!",5
1654,"Too many fees: Upset to receive my current statement and see the “shipping fees” on final value. I priced my items to sell. Raising the prices to cover shipping is NOT always the best practice. I feel eBay is dictating too much.  This has been a learning curve, and not a pleasant one. Why can’t it be kept simple?? A reduced shipping fee is offered if you print thru eBay and then taken away with a final value on shipping. Classic example of give with right, take with the left. Reconsidering any further selling on eBay at this time.",5
1655,"Less happy: I use this app for buying and selling. If I am rating the app right now as a seller it would be a 1, so I gave three because a year ago this would have been 5 stars.

No more option to select store category or update quantity of an item. Would be nice to have a sales tax field and ability to send an invoice to buyers.",5

1659,"Inconvenience every step of the way: Where to start.
Inconvenience every step of the way.
Full of fake profiles. Bunk Item details and countless information fields to fill out. You’re Forced to use PayPal- which is not always what people want. Even if you’re just selling you have to list you bank account details.
Dead-end link to “contact us” when trying to contact customer service or report any issue/fraudulent activity.
App does not support my location, nor is there a map that I can pin where I’m selling from. NO MAP! Redirects me to start a new posting from the mobile browser. Still no map to put my location. 
I know it sounds stupid but there is a bug that changes words in your listing title, Specifically the word “Nevera” (fridge) changes to “Dama” (old woman). Shockingly this did not boost my sales.
Items sold as “local pickup” alert you to “ship now!” but a direct message from the buyer has No Alert. 
Apps like “Let Go” are so much more convenient, snap pics, write a description, drop a pin on the map and message with the buyer in a normal chat screen, deal in cash.",1

I only have one suggestion the sellers who have a lot of negative feedback should have some type of penalty put on them yet they keep getting negative feedback and the seller always says buyers remorse and this is not always true. This is the sellers reputation and the sellers with a lot of negative feedback should be banned from selling for a certain amount of time and if it continues they should be banned from eBay.,5

I just wanted to sell three vintage twilight tshirts, but eBay PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED my account with no explanation, no way to contact them, absolutely nothing.

Every option you choose online leads you to a page that says, “HELP YOURSELF!!!” Because that’s exactly what they expect you to do.

The support staff has been good (yay!), but it’s a very inefficient system. I’m also disappointed that my items are stuck in limbo “sold” to a scammer who has not paid, and ebay has not enforced the sale. Yikes!! Seems like it’s time to add some features.

I said no way I’m I’m not going to mess with that. They said it’s so easy you’re out of your mind to pay more ! I said OK I’ll try. 😎 It took me five minutes to fill out my new account and to make my payment for the iPhone case that is 75% less than the store cost !!! 😃
OMG how do the stores make money when they have competition like this is beyond me !??? 👍🏼",5
1678,"Getting worse and worse: OMG!I just updated and regretted it yet again! Such a shame.. this used to be such a useable, reliable app. They keep adding features that provide no logical benefit whilst breaking several others that were just fine, gradually degrading the app.
The watch list now has another pointless filter taking up even more screen real-estate, saved search strings are still truncated, sort order still gets lost when you view other sellers items.. ""do you want to keep photos"" when selling a similar item keeps the photo whether you say yes or no... need I go on? C'com people, listen to your users needs and harden your app, stop fiddling around the edges and get some testing done before you release!",1

Cellphone devices these days are very powerful and capable of opening websites on desktop version , so if the app gives me limited access to the site the app becomes useless .",1
1680,"Sellers watch out when you list something!: In the app, if you list an item, EBay automatically activates the “best offer” feature in your listing. You have to turn that feature off every time you list something. I’ve had to go back to some of my listings and revise them. Such a pain. This updated app really makes it difficult for sellers to list their merchandise. The previous version was so simple, fast and the layout was easy to maneuver around in.",5

High insertion fees, seller fees, and, when you sell your item, you don’t get your payment until only the Lord knows when! After I get everything sold that I need to, I am NEVER messing with eBay again as a seller! I was speaking with someone dear to me, and who’s opinion I trust very much. And he said that he thinks eBay will be out of business in 3 - 5 years. I can only pray so if they don’t change. eBay shall receive their comeuppance!

1682,"Need extra option to pay sales tax for personal purchases to: Hi EBay 
I been happy with my eBay since 2012 and recently I added our church tax exemption . To my account because I make many church purchases. But the exemption applies to every item I buy - even personal items. That’s not right.  
I would serious suggest a option where I can still use my account to buy personal items and pay my fare share of sales tax. 
I was advised to open another eBay account. I’d rather NOT deal with yet another eBay account -  I’m holding off many of my personal purchases for now. 

I much enjoy my BJs account - at check out I’m asked if the purchase is business or personal - and sales tax charged accordingly - and I am hoping that can be a added feature in my eBay account - 
I already have too many online accounts. It would be very nice feature to have on my current eBay account. Thank you",4
1683,"New app forces you to use Good til Cancelled: With the new update, you no longer control how long you would like your listings to run. Once an item sells, you have to manual delete it or it continues to count against your allotment of free listings. Items listed with the app now no longer end and therefore will not show as ‘ending soon’, will automatically be buried under Best Match and will no longer qualify for the emails sent to potential buyers nudging them when a liked item is close to ending.
Even though this isn’t the case with items listed by PC, you are unable to revise an app listing by PC to allow ending times unless you first end the listing.
This has put sellers using the app at a great disadvantage under those using a PC.",1
1684,"Fake sellers, app problems: It would be better if you could block sellers from specific countries. There's a ton of cheap knockoff clothing from China, and with no way to block listings from just one country or region. 
The app has issues, too. There's constant notifications. I stopped saving searches and favoriting sellers because I'd get notifications when they updated, or even just something similar from another seller got posted. Whenever you're searching through eBay on the app, the app will close windows and force you to start your search over again. The filter options cause glitches while you're trying to shop, too. It's annoying.",2
1685,"October iPhone update buggy: crashes: The eBay app had been one of the more / most reliable ones I used on my iPhone SE (yes, it’s older but apple isn’t updating the smaller ones). But since the October 2018 update it crashes multiple times in my session. I guess that helps limit snipers but it doesn’t help monitor against them either. Is eBay really telling iPhone users to go back to their desktops?

Addition: after reading some other reviews I too would love to see eBay add some filter elements like minimum stars / % ratings or maximum negative reviews / max% of negative reviews (inside a certain time period or minimum number of sales or separate sales reviews from buyer reviews.",2
1686,"Much improved!: It’s been a while since I’ve used the app & there seems to be lots of improvements made. I like the play-by-play status updates on my orders and how quickly the sellers are getting things in the mail. (I live in Alaska and it was a common practice previously to have my order cancelled or shipping jacked up high because of postal rates. Alaska is still in the US and so all standard rates still apply.) 
Anyway, like the suggestions of similar items, and better keyword search 👍👍",5
1687,"Dishonest and furtive ways of adding to seller fees: If you’re a buyer, this app is fine. For sellers, beware that by using this app to sell, eBay can and will automatically change listings to fee-based conveniences like “Good Till Cancelled” and “Automatically relist up to 8 times” WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT and WITHOUT NOTIFYING YOU. There is no option to remove these options on your listings through the app; that has to be done on the website. Again, eBay will add these fee-based changes to your listing without notifying you that these services were added. You’ll end up wondering why your seller fees seem higher than normal if you were unaware, as I have been several times. Despicable behavior on the company’s part.  It’s dishonest and underhanded and worthy of a suit.",1

I also think it would be great if i could keep purchase history separate, because i do buy many of same parts or from same seller multiple times. Ive bought items in past and later wished to purchase another but could not find where id bought the from before. I would also not care at all to see any suggestions. I get on ebay because i know what im wanting to purchase or browse so suggesting things for me does not one bit of good.",3
1689,Seller and buyer protection: I really enjoy the eBay for selling and buying great items at discount prices. Unfortunately the seller protection does not work well. I am very honest seller. I describe items to details and photograph it very well. If there is a defect on the item I specifically describe and highlight it on my photos so the buyer can see it. But despite that lost Gucci sunglasses to dishonest buyer from Canada. I contacted eBay customer service department several times and filed an official complaint against that buyer but no one helped me with that.,5

1691,"No customer service what so ever: I have been a eBay user for years, buyer and seller. Recently, I sold an item that has been delayed by USPS for a long time( it took 8 weeks). So the buyer complained after one month and eBay took my money and refunded the buyer. One month later, tracking number shows that the item was delivered. I have been trying to contact eBay to get my money back since I did nothing wrong but NO response from all channels. I was not given the call back option anymore after my first complaint. All my other emails and feedback sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Only about $60 worth of stuff, but as a multi billion dollar company, you lost my trust!!!",1
1692,"Lacks transparency: This app lacks very simple transparency. A tracking system should tell you which facility it was ship and where the product is going (my address) yet it doesn’t. I couldn’t find the destination via tracking number. There just needs to be more transparency, since both apps have been around for a long time, there isn’t much of an excuse. Needing to go into a computer or on gross iPhone safari to verify my shipping address skyrocketed my anxiety. Anyways, I think its a very simple fix, genuinely disappointed and dissatisfied that the tracking number doesn’t provide basic information.",2

Also, why do some listings look different when trying to revise them? Love the median price sold feature but doesn’t show for all listings.",4

Almost everything I ordered was exactly what I wanted and the price was better than retail. One time an electronic device did not work. My money was promptly refunded. The seller was extremely concerned and made up for it asap! Things will happen. At least when they did there no run around and the device was replaced at no charge. I appreciate that.",4
1695,"Awful: This will be my first and last post to this feed.  eBay and its pirates (those who live and die by preying on new or inexperienced users) needs to reconsider its bidding options.  Putting a starting bid and minimum sold is not clear and can cause unexpected consequences as in my case.  

I placed a set of acrylic serving bowls on over a month ago and accidentally forgot I put the item for sale due to the length of time without a sale.  eBay decided to relist the item after the auction and ended.   I didn’t know this was going to be the case.  And to make matters worse one of those pirates (jwrussell214) swooped in under the cover of cyber-night and stole the item for .99!!!   

To make matters worse this jwrussell214 has demanded legal action against me should I decide not to ship the item.  

What is this space?  What has this become?  Not only will I not ship after today I will be closing down eBay and encouraging novice users to not fall victim of this atrocity that is an pre-rigged ai that scams people out of money so eBay can get it take.",1

I conducted a deeper investigation into my product and realize that it was indeed a fake so I ended the listing. I do not feel comfortable selling a fake item however, eBay has now since my account to collections for ending the listing early. After months of debating, eBay demands that I still pay my account and has sent my account to collections. They care more about making a profit than human ethics and morals!",1
1697,eBay iOS app functionality limited: For simple buy & big it works.  But recently learned the buyer controls are very limited. It basically puts seller at an advantage.  I think older adult buyers are at a significant disadvantage.  Here are the Web functions NOT available on the app (unless it’s really well hidden).  The help functions for “retract a bid” and “help with item not delivered”.  I also find that accepted bids are confusing.  I sometimes see the price higher than the accepted bid in my cart or two accepted bids vice only one.,4
1698,Fake Customers?: Someone bid on my item and sent me a message on eBay with their phone number. They asked me how much was the item after I assume they viewed it on eBay and should’ve known how much they bid on it. They then told me they would send me an additional $300 to buy and apple gift card to place in the package with my item because the item was a gift. They asked to pay me on PayPal and kept saying they sent payment but I never got any payment. They proceeded to ask me to send them screenshots on my mailbox on my email to prove to them I didn’t get confirmation they paid. I blocked their number and canceled the item.,2

They’re all the same. eBay knows this is going on and I see they’re trying to set up a spoof reporting system and alert their users about fraudulent activity, but it is just not enjoyable to use anymore.

1703,"Offers cannot be canceled and should be the option: If a buyer places an offer, the same buyer should be able to cancel the offer, but not the purchase, meaning if the offer has been accepted by the seller then and only then the seller can cancel the offer. 

eBay is missing dearly on this option and making the buyers when they change their mind for whatever the reason before the seller accepts the offer, like beggars to the sellers. 

To change a verbal decision (offer sent to seller) is possible in life and business (but not eBay👎🏻) but only and only when both party’s sign a contract (the equivalent to a seller accepting the offer) is when one party (the buyer) cannot change its decision and it becomes binding. Then only the seller can cancel the offer sent by the buyer and the seller accepted. 

I write this so that the person that reads it takes it to whoever is in charge of making this happen.

Now with managed payments, they’ve been holding on to hundreds of dollars of mine for over a week with more sales to end this week. No CS support at all. eBay get your act together because as soon as a fledgling company comes in to cut your throat, I’m jumping ship. What can I say? No loyalty to sellers? No loyalty from sellers.

Numerous times I try sending an offer or shipping and printing labels, only to have the app say the listing has been removed or not available right now. I refresh half a dozen times and it finally shows up. Using the app on my phone is great, when it works. Otherwise I have to go to a computer and fire it up, open a browser and get into eBay just to send an offer or print labels.

It’s a cool feature to include, but maybe include an option to turn it off.",5
1710,"Bias against small time sellers: It seems like they favor big time sellers and don’t care for the small time sellers. As time goes on, this platform is no longer a place where one can make a sell on a rare item and move on. I also dislike the dependency on PayPal and how when one cancels a transaction, for any number of reasons, one losses PayPal transaction fees. Fees are higher for sellers that don’t sale big time. It’s great place for items one has a stockpile to sell but for small sellers that sell every now and then, it’s just not worth it anymore. I’m bearish on the future of the platform that has a bias towards sellers based on selling performance, it isn’t fair. I will begin the process of delisting many of my items from the platform.",1

I see one item and scroll down 3-4 items and the same one appears, I then scroll down 3-4 more items and the first item appears again for a 3rd time? Why is that? If this is a built in feature in the search results then I would like a feature to remove it from search results as I am tired of seeing it and it is not what I am looking for.",4
1712,"UPDATE: Customer service rep fixed annoying issue: Very annoying terms that favor buyer. 

EXAMPLE: 
Was selling a pottery wheel. This item is pickup only because it’s 150 lbs. Buyer said after auction was over that he would purchase the wheel in a week because he wasn’t in town at the moment. I agreed trying to be friendly (and cancelling the order reduces your rating as a seller). A week goes by and the buyer never contacts me. Two weeks then three and no word from the buyer. So I try to file to cancel the order. But according to eBay it’s “been too long. You have to complete the sale.” I wouldn’t be mad except that they charged me 10% of the purchase price in fees ($80) without confirmation of payment from the buyer.

Dewana resolved my issues via phone. Very polite, kind, and took care of the issue right away after I explained my problem and waived the final sale fee. Thanks Dewana!!",4

My biggest complaint is that every time I try to list, or even relist something, I have to change all kinds of seller settings. For example, there’s no way that Best Offer should have to be turned off each time I try to list something. I never sell things that way, bc of all the lowballers out there. Why is the default setting to turn them on? Also, the auto-decline price for offers is always comically low. Why even bother? Very, very frustrating for sellers. Maybe it’s time to have an app just for shopping and an app just for sellers, bc this one has lost sight of sellers’ best interests.",1
1718,"eBay doesn’t back up the buyer’s: I purchased items from eBay that were absolutely fake and when dealing directly with the vendor, they trick you into changing your feedback for them and then when they lie and don’t refund your money, you’re just stuck on the hook and you can’t change your feedback back again and then they say they never received the return so they never give back your money. That’s why I don’t use eBay as much as I used to and only if I need to. it should be cut and dry.

4. Shipping through USPS is not fun, USPS has limited hours and long line to wait. Also it may lose items.
5. Message to seller on Ebay platform is lost, so the seller is not informed about issues.
6. The automatic Ebay assistant is a unreal engine - it continues send you back instead of providing updated and relevant information.
7. The account information is not accurate in sense which item is return.
8. Refund is issued only for a half of order and it is extremely difficult to find why.

1720,"eBay may actually save you more than a thrift store in long run: Very useful search feature so you can find what you’re looking for & even save a search.  The downside is that you pay for the convenience and shipping costs. 

 Even if an item is listed as free shipping, the Seller has no choice but consider that in the price because the Post Office or UPS or whatever doesn’t deliver for free. 

 However, it takes time for a Seller to find, list/ photograph, package & ship the item. 

 I find that it might cut down on impulse buys at the thrift store to just find exactly what you want on eBay instead of taking the extra time to hope you eventually find it at a thrift store.

1731,"Things aren’t just what they used to be.: Not sure what’s going on with EBay these days but customer service and follow up on ongoing issues are non existent these days.
Over two months a go I filed a complaint regarding partial refunds that I was issued by the sellers and I was promised someone was going to look into it and would be getting back to me. 
I have yet to receive an acknowledgment regarding my issues.
Things just aren’t what they use to be.",5
1732,"Great way to shop!: For me, eBay is a very convenient way to shop. It’s nice to be able to compare prices and sellers then decide what item and from whom ever to purchase from. eBay is also a place to get a great deal on used items. Unlike other online markets, eBay also gives you the opportunity to sell items. There are many other reasons to like shopping eBay. Go check eBay out and buy something.",5
1733,"BETTER EBAY THAN SOPPING: I find time everyday to take a look to whatever eBay posts on everyday DEALS  besides searching items i am in need of.  
Usually I am not looking for anything in particular, but mostI times find products I can use at low prices so I take advantage of Deals.
 More over, If I am looking for something with certain cost, I find on eBay a tool that can help me to find out whether or not to buy certain Item.
It was customary for me to shop around at shopping centers but pandemic times took away such activity, as a way of preventing sickness and browsing eBay became the substitute to that activity.
Last but not least, I prefer bay to other names that do same  or similar comercial activity and my experience doing business with it has being very, very rewarding.

1734,"Can’t add photos to returns: I’ve tried uploading photos taken and tried talking photos from the eBay app on the returns page and the app won’t allow it. No error screen, no uploading status bar… just won’t allow photos. How are we supposed to show that the seller sent the wrong item if we can’t upload pictures of it?? Is eBay protection sellers by making it impossible for buyers to accurately plead their case??",5
1735,"Horrible, does not work with IOS 15/iPhone 13: eBay is very behind on getting this app to work with IOS 15. I have a iPhone 13 and a 13 Pro and the app will not function properly any more, even after I deleted the app off both phones and re installed it. Whenever I go to my notifications page to look at an offer I received once I click on that offer to view it, underneath where I can except and decline I can usually click on the image of the listing and it will take me to the listing itself and it no longer does that which is extremely irritating. Of coarse Apple says it not a problem of theirs and that it’s eBay’s fault. Let’s get this fixed!!!!",1
1736,Love it but don’t have money  or get an honest answer out of someone: I purchased two statuses for my technique 1200 turntables I ordered orfonts I asked  the seller will they fit The orofont MK 2 you look at my invoice it says that question was do they fit the MK 2 orofont the answer is no they do not !!!! so I guess I’m stuck with a $41 bill for some parts that I don’t need thanks a lot for yourHelp and concern yes I might just ha Have to change stores what you guys did isn’t right cust serv. Told me to rest assured eBay has your back yeah way back….EBay garuntee,4
1737,"Ebay ROCKS!: I love ebay! I’ve been a seller and a buyer on ebay for almost 5 years. It was a little slow selling, to start, but it picked up over time. I mostly sell things that I don’t want anymore. It’s time consuming but it’s fun, especially when you hear the “cha-ching”, that indicates an item has been sold. 
It’s pretty easy to get started. Write accurate descriptions. You’ll probably have some disappointments along the way but don’t give up!",5
1738,"Easy scam for high priced items: The seller sent an item to my zipcode but not my address to provide Ebay with a fraudulent tracking number. (this releases funds to the sellers account when the item appears delivered)

I have not been given the ability to provide proof from UPS that said that the package was addressed to a different address than my own. eBay dismissed this case in 2 minutes (!) and after waiting 3 days to ""step in""....  It is insulting! 

I will NOT be making anymore purchases from Ebay period. This is a huge flaw and can be pulled off by anyone. But 100% preventable if Ebays CS department was at all competent and not automated by bots or terrible useless employees! DOWN WITH EBAY",1
1739,"Not good seriously: I have been using this app for quite some time now I’ve been buying buying and buying.
The passed 2 items I just bought were a scam been waiting since feb. 4th and the other said available so I went ahead with the order and just received a email saying not available? Just had to cancel my card and despite these transactions and I’m at work! Horrible app/sellers BIG waste of time & money!",5
1740,"Ease of use: I like this new system although at first it’s always a challenge but to navigate it is very easy I like the watch items inside deals if you dhow intreat and simply unwatch when you purchase what you would like to have! It is also faster to access list,history,etc. way better than before and last the new graphics are great thanks again for this fourm I appreciate your patience Happy Holidays stay safe!",5
1741,"Horrible: I used to have no problems at all using EBay and it was great for getting rid of old items and what not but now it has totally turned to garbage. I have sold two items in the past 30 days and still have not received the payout that they keep claiming to have sent me! Instead of using PayPal for payouts they are claiming to send them directly from their own managed payments but it doesn’t work! And get this I can’t even talk to someone to get my issue resolved, they have no customer support anymore!! What a joke. I have never been this frustrated with a company ever! Do not sell on eBay their is no support and with all the corner cutting they are doing as a company you will eventually need it.",1
1742,"Selling: Selling and buying has been a great thing in eBay. The only negative is when someone buys something and never pays or responds. I think they should be liable for paying when the seller realists the item on ebay. I’ve been burned a few times and it cost me, the seller when I relist the item when it should be the person who doesn’t. Also, there is not a “tag” that says buyer didn’t pay when you cancel an item.",5
1743,"Way to many app flaws: Love the amount of people, but that’s just about it. The problems in app or even on the website are ridiculous. From label printing issues to shipping info not showing up at all to payment issues, it has major issues. It is my last resort as a seller because of all the issues it comes with. Any other app I sell on is smooth sailing so I’m not sure why the most popular one has the most problems. Hope they can add things to make it more straight forward because I’m tired of using it and searching the internet to figure it out. In all honesty if there wasn’t so many buyers I’d happily delete eBay and never use it again.",1
1744,eBay has changed in a bad way: I’ve been a member since 2003.  I’ve bought and sold.  eBay has done such a disservice to sellers that I have stopped selling.  eBay calls the shots and basically the seller has no control over their own items.  eBay automatically realists and then charges the seller relisting fees.  eBay allows buyer to leave unjustified negative feedback even when the seller can prove that the feedback was unjustified.  I’ve quit selling on eBay and have started using Poshmark,5
1745,EBAY has it going on: I have been an eBayer for many years now I am a eBay junkie some people call me but I’m all right with that because when I’m looking for I can usually find it on eBay I wish that it was just a faster way to receive my items that would be my only disappointing feature of eBay it takes some time alone while before I can receive my items but overall eBay has it going on🏆👌🎯😛😎,5
1746,"Controller: I think EBay is controlling too much transactions, as in the store I have option to return, give it back, cancel my purchase after few minutes or few months, 
eBay is pushing HARD to buy to make money on us, not cool. 
If you control freak, you should also control more what is sold and in what condition, have sellers to be responsible for sold items, if they send junk, why we had to return it, junk ends up in the garbage, waist of time for buying people to have it ship, 
I’m trying to pull my purchases on EBay and found my self going more to other Websites. 
I have the right to cancel my transaction any time, EBAY thinks different, DONT LIKE IT. Or no return policy, what is that ? 
Overall I’m pulling my transactions as much as I can. 
eBay works for EBay , not for sellers or buyers.",5
1747,"Has a glitch: With the new “ sponsored” option for sellers one has to wade through all sponsored items before getting to any new listings every time you open app, even when it’s showing new listings all you see is same sponsored items you’ve seen for days,also currently when you open your bids and offers page it opens till you scroll down then it goes blank and “you have no bids or offers appears even though you have several",5
1748,"eBay app on iPhone is impossible to use: I cannot remove items from my cart. I also have items listed in US and Canadian currency. I live on the gulf coast, and my account address reflects this. I could possibly understand if the currency showed Mexican pesos, but Canadian dollars is a complete flop. There is no way, I can find, to change my settings to stop these items from showing up and clogging my lists. I have been an eBay user since 2010; I will be deleting the app now.",5
1749,Turn off the OBO and auto re-list: I’ve loved the app until it started to add an automatic OBO and re-list function. If you aren’t careful and turn off the auto re-list you end up paying money to list items if you are out of your monthly free listings. On top of that I can’t even use the app to turn the auto re-list off. I have to use the Web version to do this. Please make it so we have to TURN BOTH OF THESE FEATURES ON if we want it. If you do that the app goes back to five stars. Thank you.,5
1750,"One tiny flaw, otherwise I love it!: The app works great and is a pleasure to use aside from one defect that’s bothered me for a long time. Cleaning notifications from in the app is TERRIBLE. You swipe to delete the notification and it just glitches out or doesn’t work. Please fix how you delete notifications, it’s horrendously bad. It would be fine if it worked as intended but it’s so buggy and unreliably responsive. Also once you’ve fixed that, a “Delete all” would be amazing. Thanks!",5
1751,"Unmanageable: Every time you swipe to delete an item from your watchlist, or shopping cart or any list for that matter the app automatically refreshes and take you to the top of the list so you have to scroll back down to delete another item there is no way whatsoever to delete multiple items I want. I was trying to manage my watchlist and it could take hours which if you just log into a PC you can do multiple items at once Easily. Also if you make a bid on an item it apparently stays in your bid/offer list for eternity.. eBay has no way for you to remove that from your list. These are issues that drive me insane and have not been fixed/addressed for many years",1
1752,"Needs work: After the last update, items that were hidden are now randomly showing up in the app. From the app, there is no obvious way to hide them again, this is extremely annoying and makes it difficult to track current wins when stuff from the last year or two randomly populates the feed. FIX IT!!

UPDATE: July 5th update, STILL randomly populating hidden items, beginning to think these developers are incompetent bumbling idiots...",5
1753,"New update is a huge pain!: I used to be able to list an item very quickly.  The loss of the advanced seller tool has made listing an item a nightmare.   So much so, that I stopped listing.  

I used to be able to list a fixed price item for the time period of my choosing.  Now, I am locked into “Good till Cancelled.”   This automatically renews listings that I may or may not want to renew.  

Also, now my camera lags when I take photos.   Half of my pictures are just a blur because after the camera click I try to set up for the next photo and the last photo is still being taken. What is this, tin type?

Next, the photos used to upload very quickly and now I have to wait while each one uploads.  More time wasted.  

Finally, I am tired of “make offer,” being added to my listings.  I keep getting low ball offers on items that I’ve already priced at half of other sellers.  

If eBay wants to run my store, they can come list the items and send me a check.   If the new update doesn’t improve soon I’ll be taking my business elsewhere.",1
1754,"Please fix feedback issue: When I try to leave a feedback by using my iPhone X, the comment box will disappear, I have to blind type everything, because I can't see what I actually type, I have to re-type multiple times due to excessive amount of words. It's frustrated. The comment box will appear once I finish typing, but it will disappear again if I have keyboard pop out. 

I tried to re-install the app, but it doesn't fix the issue. Please fix this. Thanks",5
1755,eBay the only way to shop: My wife and I both shop eBay. Recently I’ve ordered and received a 12 volt heavy duty air compressor and a 4K generator. I just ordered a Hitachi framing air nailer. Everything I’ve ever ordered came in excellent condition and in a timely manner. My friends at eBay are a class act all the way. I highly encourage all my friends and neighbors to use and enjoy getting high quality products shipped with convenience directly to their home. Thanks again eBay!!!,5
1756,The Best place to go!!!: Ebay is the best place to go if you want something or need something to buy or sale. I am addicted to it for at least 10 years or more. I have dont most of my hobby shopping and Christmas shopping here at Ebay. It’s very easy to use. And it has everything anyone would need or want. I feel everyone needs to try Ebay out at least one time. And see for your self. And you also make money buying stuff off Ebay so that’s another plus Ebay has.,5
1757,"Digital crack....: I LOVE this site and this app....Maybe too much...lol
My wife dreads when the mail person gets out and walks towards the house because she knows that I've been shopping on ebay. 
I buy just about everything off eBay...It's sooo easy to use and convenient.
 Unbelievable range of choices, and I mean everything, easy to navigate, quick shipping and easy to choose your own preferences when shopping.....and lets not forget Ebay protection against unsatisfactory or dead beats sales.",5
1758,"Need to a pop-up to show new Saved button location: Thought the new UI removed the SAVE button, but it was moved to the filter bar that is only visible when you scroll. This is a really poor rollout of changes. Add a super short tutorial to show users what’s new.  Don’t misunderstand, a change in the button’s location was needed. The prior location of the Save button was incredibly annoying as my small fingers would hit Save instead of the back button.",4
1759,"Like the layout but buggy: I like the new layout, but the bugs are very frustrating. When I go into My eBay, sometimes it shows what I’m bidding on, but usually it doesn’t. When I had an item for sale and tapped on selling, it would show a 1 under active, and when I tapped on that 1 to see the listing, it said I had no active listings. The mobile site was fine.  Then when I was paid for the item, somehow the payment went to my contact email and not my PayPal email. I had to call PayPal to get that email verified. I still don’t know how that happened. Please look into this.",3
1760,"eBuy: I’ve been using eBay for quite some time. I was run on to its resources by customer who used to buy video games for her children and swore by its use and efficacy. Since then I have been a loyal buyer. Hence the quip I’ve only had a couple of faulty, sellers 99% of them remedied the situation even had one fault of my own where I thought I could purchase something and then I had to un purchase it and it was rectified with the seller great platform for goods and services",5
1761,"eBay has been satisfactional and has been keeping me out on my toes to look for New Products: 100% would recommend to anybody who is wanting to buy products or is the lookout for their next big purchase, so far it’s been the most truthful and honest app that I’ve been purchasing  items on, Go on and have a try, eBay is waiting for open arms to help their next customer buy their next big purchase!!!!",5
1762,"What happened to the search algorithm?: eBay is a powerhouse for shopping. But over the last few weeks, the search algorithm has gotten awful. Searches that used to turn up what I’m looking for with accuracy now have items that are utterly unrelated. Looking for travel posters and get…band t-shirts? Looking for books and get…shoes? I understand they must be trying to drive more sales somehow, but this is a really awful experience. The site is still useful but the app just keeps getting worse. Fix the search algorithms. People will probably buy more stuff if they can find what they are actually looking for, not some non-sensical recommendation.",1
1763,eBay easy money: Great money easy to sell on they take too much fees but provide an excellent platform and there is some bad apples who abuse the eBay guarantee but that comes with the territory. Overall  great experience just research the items you sell because there is always someone with knowledge to help you if you have it wrong . Also be careful reselling Jordan’s from thrift stores 40% are fakes so be careful the authentication system is not in your favor if you generally have a lack of knowledge . 3 strikes you are out rule!!,4
1764,"Money always on hold: They hold my money for 30 days, including the shipping the buyer paid…so that comes out of my pocket first. Then buyer receives item and MY money is still on hold. And why? I’ve had this account for YEARS AND YEARS…everything is verified, I’ve never had a problem or issue with payments, accounts, buying, or selling. I don’t think I’ve ever had a negative mark on this account!! Yet I don’t get my money even after the buyer receives AND reports that they have received the item. Seems like someone is stealing my money to make themselves more money before giving it to me. In no way should they be holding ANY money after buyer receives an item. That is THEFT ebay.",1
1765,Wish eBay had left the app I had alone: I kept getting messages to update then a message saying requires 14.0 which my iPhone is older and not compatible with 14-0  now the version I had is gone not supported and new update won’t work on my iPhone I’m not going to buy a new phone just to keep up with the updates most people don’t like anyway should have left it alone it worked fine until now.,5
1766,"Sneaker heaven: This is the only place I buy sneakers online now, since the addition of sneaker authentication it has made my life easier and they are more efficient than stock x or goat. Faster shipping, better authentication and also better shipment tracking. The fact that a market for sneaker has its own corner on eBay makes it just a whole lot better than one of the newer sites, also fees don’t kill you like the other sites.",5
1767,"Latest version fixes recent bugs: The latest version has fixed some recent update bugs, namely the description part of auctions listings can now be seen again, so at least the updates do seem to be making attempts to correct some issues.  It would still be nice to be able to send invoices (as a seller) via the app, but that's still illusive for reasons unknown.  Other than that, the app as the majority of basic functions as the main website.",4
1768,"DONT ASK if you want the TRUTH: eBay is trying to FORCE me to sign up for an option I do not want to use.  I do not want any payments going through my bank account therefore I will not sign up for that part of the service.  I am happy buying from others on here but I will not give out my ssn or bank info to anybody on the web.  If this means the end of doing business on eBay then so be it.  I enjoy the purchases I make through eBay (and I make a lot of them) but I will NOT give out my info for any payments.  KEEP THE MONEY for your own gain, it’s not that important to me, and call it a profit.  In this respect I would rate eBay a flat ZERO, but on the purchase side I rate eBay a 12 out of 10.",1
1769,"Selling process is trash: I get that eBay has a couple of steps for protection when selling like asking for your ssn to make sure it’s actually you, but don’t add all those extra steps if it’s not going to actually work. I got to the point where it says “review key selling information”, I click the button that says complete sign up and then I just get an error. The error just says “something went wrong please try again later”. That really upset because I’m giving very private info like my ssn and it won’t even work right. All that did was just make me worry even more about my private info being put out. So thanks a lot eBay I hope you’re happy.",1
1770,New messaging is great...but also terrible: Ever since you updated the app a few weeks ago and gave the new messaging feature. I hate it. The texting style is great. However if i need to click on the item as it shows on the top of the message it does nothing. So then i have to go and search the item to get to it and come back to the message. Also after i read messages they still appear in the notifications area. Please fix this! Its making more work for me when customers have questions about items to purchase or about an item that has ended. Thanks,2
1771,"LONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH EBAY: In all the years I have been shopping on eBay, I have only been disappointed a couple of times, although NONE of the occurrences were eBay’s fault.  They were very thorough @ making certain the resolutions were done to perfection, with NO follow up required by me.  They also have been ever vigilant at protecting my account information, also my Pay Pal account information, I guess it’s like dealing with a good friend!  Thank you eBay!",5
1772,Lack of customer service: I’ve been a constant buyer from eBay for almost ten years but after my last go I am completely done with the company. A shipment I had was lost and the only way for me to get my money back was for the seller to open a case which they never did eBay opened a case for it and closed it within 4 hours not doing their due diligence and I lost hard earned money and they simply didn’t care.,5
1773,"I love me some Ebay!: I have been using EBay for 15 years. With al little patience, you normally can find exactly what your are looking for at a lower cost than anywhere else. Many times you will find gently used products much cheaper than buying brand new, if that works for you. I am talking auto parts, not underwear!  In addition, after you have your payment type saved in my Ebay, a simple click and the item is purchased and on its way.",5
1774,"Supporting Fraud and Erasing Feedback: I’ve been on eBay for over 15 years, and have had decent service with them in the past. However, I recently purchased an item that didn’t ship for over 30 days (until after I asked for a refund). All the seller did was mark the item as shipped, included a tracking number, and I never received the item. I said since I’d waited so long, all I wanted was a refund. I was on the phone for over an hour, only to be disconnected. eBay decided in favor of the seller, and told me the buyer protection or whatever false sense of security wasn’t valid. I left negative feedback for the seller, which was removed. It’s not a fart in the wind to eBay, but I’m ending my membership. This is a joke.",1
1775,"Buying OK, selling terrible: Search & purchase functions well, but selling is un-usable for me. The problem is that I can save draft listings but it’s extremely difficult to find them later. I found advice online from eBay to try signing off and back on so your drafts will show up, and deleting and reinstalling the app. Neither worked for me. The only way for me to find my drafts is to hunt down a link from one of the seller articles, but there’s no way to create a shortcut to that page. Interestingly the page layout and appearance on that page is very different from the other pages in the app - it feels like I’m in a different app altogether.",2
1776,Easy breeze time saving: Since getting the app my eBay experience has improved greatly.  No more signing in and out then having to navigate to certain areas to either check the status of an item or leave feedback.  Everything is right there so now I even do a lot of my hygiene shopping on eBay instead of going to Walmart or ShopRite etc. I only keep a couple dozen apps on my phone and when looking at all of them it’s safe to say the eBay app ranks in the top three.,4
1777,"Can’t log in!!!!!: Can’t log in, their 2 step verification is dumb and won’t let me log in, I deleted the app cause I needed the space and when I reinstalled it, and tried to log in, it wouldn’t let me because it keeps saying a notification was sent to your device please accept it to log in, how am I supposed to accept it if I’m trying to use my device to log, the same device I’m supposed to get the notification.

Add something to switch it there to sms, or something!! Can’t call customer service or email or text them because apparently y’all close. Fix this issue",3
1778,"Needs updating: I dont know why the app has not been letting me send messages back to clients when theyve bought an item off of me . Every time i go to send them a message it doesnt allow me to install their user name in the body of the message it just has my user name and doesnt allow me to change it , hence it basically doesnt allow me to send the message because itll be like sending a message to myself . Please fix this ASAP so that i can reach out to buyers/sellers

1792,eBay is for me!: Love eBay - its a lifestyle!  Selling all the things i can - all the time - making money that I always need and feeling good about recycling items and getting them to use in their new home! Hate to see anything of use go to the landfill!  Reuse all u can- recycle what u cannot and keep things in great shape for the future!  Love you eBay - thank you eBay!  May we always have eBay forever!  I could not survive without MY eBay!  Thank you so much!!,5
1793,"Love their extra security in messages: eBay actually sent me a message warning me about a person that had sent me a. message about a listing of mine…ebay basically flat out said this person flagged us as suspicious and it’s unsafe if you message or make a sale with him outside of our secure platform. That literally gave me so much respect for them, with them protecting me like that and warning me I wasn’t caught off guard or tricked into anything. Thanks EBAY!",5
1794,"5 Star: I’m not gonna lie, in my past I hated buying anything from EBay but now… I buy things quite often! I even have my wife and friends buying things from there like dog food, computers, camping gear, shoes, tablets, my IPhone 8 plus and came stocked with 256gb more than you hear of now days! Lol. I love eBay and grateful that they have stepped up in a mighty way! Love that you guarantee your shoe products and computer warranty’s! That helps me continue to shop here!",5
1795,"Ebay’s buyer policy.: I’ve been shafted a couple of times by sellers who are out to deceive honest buyers. Although I filed claims on the items and negotiated with Ebay and the seller where as I decided to drop my claim with the promise of a refund so as not to hurt the sellers rating, EBay would not honor the deal because I dropped my claim against the crooks. So I did not get a refund after I sent the item back to the seller. So beware people. Ebay will not protect you in a case of dropped claims.",5
1796,eBay seller: Good place to sell new or used items the main issue is with ebay the fees are ruthless you have to jack up the price of your item the make nice pay because eBay fees .. they charged me $12 because the buyer I had an address out of the county but I shipped it in the US to his other address like makes no sense I’m petty sure that’s a way to still money from sellers not to mention the seller has to wait until item gets delivered for they release the funds so all the buyer has to do is says the box has something else inside now it’s a dispute with eBay needs to change a few things,2
1797,"SO slow, buggy, impossible to sort, busted: First, this app has become barely usable, it's SO slow to load or even register a tap. Second, it's always crashing in-app pages and resetting things. Help pages or even item descriptions suddenly go blank. Each time I delete an item from my watchlist it resets to a default sorting. Adding any filter is liable to crash all the other filters. Right now searched with results also come up blank. But eBay's also been letting sellers game a terribly designed new system for listings - making eBay an impossible place to search for anything anymore. Which is why I've started buying elsewhere for most things.",1
1798,"Was good until……: Nothing but problems with banking use. Naming my eBay user name the same as my bank name is absurd. On chat with someone for hour to fix and said use laptop not phone or iPad. No difference my user name is Jlpark0 and wish it to stay that way. No other place to put my account name separate from user name that I can see and don’t want mine n wife’s name as user name like personal non business bank account we have. 

If you know. Send me instructions but my monies are tied up so only choice is to close account and you can send me a check. I will wait for a reply as been an eBay user non business but personal for almost 20 years. 

Too bad but",1
1799,Just want to pay my fees: The eBay mobile app seems to always need to authenticate me like why doesn’t know me on my phone that’s a pet peeve I have with many apps eBay is not alone and apparently I owe eBay some money I’d love to push a button type in the number and pay them but I can’t do it on this app so I’m gonna have to go through my computer and log on and see what I need to do and probably pay them with With PayPal which is stupid,5
1800,"Review: eBay is Excellent to shop for the things I cannot find on other sites, iron on rose patches &  iron on names to make tee shirt dresses. Items we cannot find anywhere else and most of all prices are low but great quality. Plus more merchandise as it is needed. Thank you eBay for excellent work you do daily. After many years eBay is still in business which we as customers are great full for. Thank you  once again eBay.",5
1801,Annoyances aplenty: Home screen won’t load. Keep getting an oops something went wrong error. Also keep getting messages every month to update my information if anything has changed. Nothing has changed. I  confirm the information and a few weeks or a month later I get yet another message asking me to confirm or update my info to keep my account safe. Quit sending me emails and notifications to update my information. The app made me change my password because. I suspect this is probably why all the annoying messages keep coming but why not just ask me to change my password instead of being sneaky and annoying?,1
1802,"I Love EBay: I have been an eBay member for 19 years. At first I mostly bought items, I did transition to selling as well. I feel protected when buying or selling on eBay. A few times I have had difficulty, eBay has backed me up and made sure I got a full refund. I like having the extra cash for myself as well as cleaning out items since I have lived in my house for over 30 years. You can’t go wrong when using eBay.",5
1803,Opinion: I did eBay last year and got a lot of people that clicked on my items that said they were buying my items and then the items never sold. Seems like  having the same problem again this time. My sold amount for money keeps saying that I have sold this amount of money when I actually haven’t. Not sure why  this is happeneing but it is very frustrating.,5
1804,"Laggy, crashes every time I try to post listing: Never used the app version before, but now I know why. It is EXTREMELY laggy, it’ll freeze and/or crash EVERY single time I open the app. It only does it when I’m listing something, which is the only purpose I have for the app as I do not buy anything. Extremely annoying, at this rate I’d rather email myself the pictures and post via my laptop.. Also, immediately getting restricted is quite ridiculous; if I’ve already confirmed my account and info once, I should not have to be calling customer service just to unrestrict the account.",2
1805,You￼: I gave it four stars because of I am 63 years old and it’s hard for us to find the way to contact eBay we are having trouble with the seller. There used to be but A button that you could use to it disputeThey charge now you have to look all over the place to try to find it I know I ran into that trouble I wish they would make it easier for people when we I need to get a hold of eBay direct,5
1806,Lots of fraud on eBay: Lots of fake listings on eBay…ebay has lost control. I sold an item shipped it then eBay tells me not to ship item because it was an unregistered user! So how many rogue users does eBay have on their site…and these criminals have access to my home address now. eBay is to blame…no security..rampant rogue users…EBay needs to update their security protocol. Not happy that I am constantly being ripped off by fake users with fake ads on eBay.,5
1807,Good shoe!: Super cushioned. These shoes are bulky and slightly heavy. I recently had arthroscopic knee surgery on both knees and was in dire need of good shoes. I bought Brooks glycerin 19 shoes first then bought these for a change up. I’m pleased with both but overall I’m loving my Brooks over these as my go to shoe for every day use. I would still recommend these but Brooks glycerin 19 are all around better and more comfortable. I saved a lot of money buying these Hoku shoes here and I’m glad because I would’ve been dissatisfied in paying full price.,4
1808,"Awful: Doesn’t allow me to connect funds straight to my bank account forcing ke to go through pay pal. This is problematic because no matter what I do pay pal will not access my bank account. I also am unable to even see the exact amount I have on ebay but believe it to be around $175 sitting there that I have no access too which is absurd. Along with that I had a buyer claim he did not receive. UPS confirmed it was delivered to the address provided but ebay gave him/her a full refund anyway with out any real investigation to my knowledge other than seeing the buyer claimed they did not received despite my proof they did receive.

App is awful!",1
1809,"Professional service: This app is very well run. With their ebay money back guarantee i have peace of mind knowing that they have your back. Especially since there’s so many people trying to steal your money and sending you crap! 

Ive ordered over 50 things over all since i started with this app a couple years ago and have had no issues. 

Thanks ebay team for taking care of business the right way!",5
1810,Multiple Account Rapid Log In: 📱⭐️⭐️⭐️👍I’m a seller and buyer on eBay.  It would be so nice if this app had an option to log in to multiple accounts at the same time kind of like Instagram.  The Instagram app also allows you to receive notifications for all the accounts at the same time.  There’s no reason why eBay can’t do this either and would be very helpful for people who have multiple accounts.,5
1811,"Decent portal to the eBay market: The app is useful of course, but leaves something to be desired.  It’s difficult to track all of your bids in progress, or to view items that you bid on but didn’t win, after they’ve ended.
Countering and tracking live dialogue is easy, but some of the functionality is either poorly organized or absent.
I wish this app was more complete.
I also wish less screen real estate was devoted to advertising related products in some situations.",4
1812,"Shopping eBay Experiences: I consistently find quality merchandise at remarkable prices.  The sellers I have purchased from have honestly described their merchandise and are prompt in their arranging to mail out my purchases.  I consistently make eBay my “go to” shopping site for everything from books, clothing and even furniture, etc.  I have been shopping eBay for several years without experiencing any negative outcome of any kind.",5
1813,"Extremely inconvenient, terrible customer service on eBay‘s part: Communicating with the sellers is very simple and easy. They always respond. But when you want to cancel an item and there’s complications with shipping even though it hasn’t been sent out, it would be great to be able to contact and speak with someone from eBay to straighten it out quickly. This is not possible with the interface eBay has laid out. They make you jump through hoops of automation that do not resolve these issues. There is also nothing special about the prices. You might as well shop anywhere else online that has better customer service.",1
1814,"When buyers fail to pay: After a buyer does a buy it now and fails to pay or communicate, eBay does very little to help. When you list it again and want to prevent this same person from bitting again, eBay won’t act unless and after they do you twice. If your item does not sell, hard to stop eBay from resisting it again without your agreement. Just got a bill, not sure if it is itemized.",5
1815,"Ebay hates sellers: I been using ebay for almost 2 years. I used to be roomates with someone that got permanently banned from the app a while ago. He left a couple of months ago. Moral of the story is i tried to sell some items I had at home and got a notification saying I was banned for being in relations to the account of my friend. I talked to ebay about this nonsense and with 3 different representatives and they all said the same thing. I offered to show them documentation that I am not him but I couldn't get my account back and selling was not possible. They said to find another app, so I basically got banned for being friends with someone that got banned. This is absurd If you are a seller seek other apps please.",1
1816,"I can buy but not sell: It’s weird that EBay ask you to provide receipts of what you are selling and if you not provide them to them they ban you from selling on the site .
Buy they don’t restrict to buy so they make money.
Also during this pandemic times they allow sellers to inflate the prices of masks, gloves and respirators with no penalties to them so
EBay makes more commission money with higher prices of necessities.
Disgusting site",5
1817,"Disappointed, looking to report: Dealing with a case where customer/buyer has reported the item as not as described in description. Claiming the shoes aren’t authentic. Customer did this claim as shoes were bring picked up. In my listing eBay says I have up to 3 days with shipping and packaging. That wasn’t honored, buyer sends me a message saying they’ll drop the case once they get the shoes. Buyer has received them and still the case is open. This issue of the buyer abusing the buyer protection program happens all too often. My funds are currently unavailable due to the lack of help from this app and company. I cannot complete other purchases for other items that have been bought due to my funds being unavailable.",1
1818,"Junk Stuff Email!: I gave you my email address so I can keep up with the Stuff that I’m interested and for notices on my deliveries! But as if lately someone in your office decide to send me all sorts of junk stuff that doesn’t concern me nor interest me and you folks just keep loading my email address just like ALL THE OTHER SCAMMERS! Please only send me things that I’ve searched! Or I’ll unsubscribe , And I’ll just delete this wonderful app please stop unwanted email’s!!!!!",5
1819,Why eBay: Although I’ve only been on eBay for a short amount of time it’s been really frustrating trying to work with the app and website for that matter as when I try to pay for a certain item it keeps telling me that the seller or sellers aren’t accepting payment right now contact them for help and when I do it’s like it doesn’t even reach them and when I try to post this issue on eBay community it wouldn’t even let me saying I don’t have the core node or I don’t have the privileges to just try to find the answer to this problem and eBay still hounds me for not paying for the item when I can’t even if I want to,2
1820,"Love this service!: I primarily use eBay for almost every purchase. I see that there is more of a competitive aspect between sellers which leads to lower prices and better service for consumers. eBay has also protected me before. My account was hacked and the perpetrator purchased a 1oz gold ingot. eBay, recognizing that this purchase was out of character from purchasing history, locked my account up and contacted me. Outstanding. I will continue to use them as my primary “silk road” of commerce!",5
1821,"Generic app: The app is lousy because is doesn’t even show all the items I’m bidding or making offers on. It doesn’t show eBay bucks, or most of the options from a PC would show. When searching not all items with a match will show up, it’s like a basic search engine that doesn’t turn up all the results. this app needs more account options and needs to be able to show all of the best offers and bids I have out there!!!",5
1822,Getting exhausted.: I have on many occasions came across issues with sellers whether it be them sending the wrong items and refusing to refund it  or in this instance ignoring my cancel request and instead ship out my order. I try to resolve it with the sellers but they’re all rude and have horrible customer service. The thing I most have an issue with is the fact that it’s hard to get ebay to step in. I can not contact them to save my life because the screen always take me back to the “contact seller” screen with every press of a button. I NEED EBAY TO SEE THIS AND GET BACK TO ME BECAUSE THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.,3
1823,Ebay Rocks!: Been a member since 2003 if you know what your doing you won’t be disappointed with purchases. Key is communicating with seller before purchase or by going with feedback. Keep in mind products you buy may not always be the sellers fault especially if it’s new in box they are just reselling and not the company that makes them so put that to thought when leaving feedback. For most part seller will refund just send a picture or message.,5
1824,"Impossible to navigate: Currently has a feature where touching image results moves them across screen and searches for whatever you put your finger on.
It’s absolutely impossible to scroll without accidentally ‘grabbing’ a random result and reloading a new page. Honestly have rage quit the last few times I was trying to find certain items to purchase, as the search process has become too cumbersome. You might as well throw pop up ads every 5 seconds, as that would be just as helpful.

I’ll still use eBay, but not when searching for gifts or like-items; there’s other online shops easier to navigate.",2
1825,"Ebay Still Changing My Auctions Without Permission: Ebay has taken over my auctions and puts on make offers to them when ever they please! I have called and said i don’t want them and they put even more on now! The representatives lie through their teeth to us about everything and i have even caught them over charging me for fees i shouldn’t have. Ebay has became the school yard bully in my opinion!!
Ebay continues to change my auctions without my permission. Taking off my Pay-now when using the Buy-now feature, adding a make offer anytime they feel like it with NO permission from myself, I have asked them now on several occasions to not change my auctions and they just ignore me and do what they want.",1
1826,"App: What have EBay done to the app? If it’s not broken, Leave it alone..... I can’t take pictures, it says the app doesn’t support back camera with my iPad. Really.... So now I have to use my phone to take pictures and go to iPad to complete a listing. Can’t use my Note 8 to List an item because the app is messed up. This is so very frustrating. This company makes billions of dollars this should not be happening. Especially since I’m paying high fees to list items. FIXED THIS DANG PROBLEM...",5
1827,"I love this app: eBay is the best way to sell or buy any item you want to get rid of or that you need. I’ve been using eBay for 2 years now and it’s perfect to sell all of my old video games and such. The only flaw I find in the app is that the seller fee comes in at the end of each month, I wish that it was taken directly out of the payment when it is received. I will never use another app for selling or purchases, eBay is by far the most superior.",5
1828,"Improvements needed: When I became an eBay member, I could find absolutely anything I was looking for. Now, I feel there are too many promotions that get in the way of my shopping experience. Also, there can be so many items listed selling exactly or close to what I’m looking for, yet I have to go in and change the wording of my search several times. This is an issue eBay didn’t use to have. On the upside, I love how eBay is now holding its sellers more accountable and providing more protection for its buyers. What I have bought since this change has been of much better quality.",3
1829,"Ebay likes to anger their sellers: Stop changing my fixed price auctions to accept best offers! If I wanted to accept best offers, I’d set it up that way from the start. It psses me off when I have to constantly go back and change my selling preferences back to the original state. 

Also, why force me to offer 30-day returns if I don’t want to? Let me keep 14-day returns, or better yet, 7-day returns. Just one more way that ebay treats their sellers like carp.

I used to sell exclusively through ebay. Lately, I sell 90% of my items through other sites, often with lower seller fees if not free. It takes a little more work to manage my sales through multiple sites, but the less money I earn for ebay’s pockets, the better.",1
1830,"EBay app needs work desperately!: Recently I was notified by email to go to EBay to look at a notification. When I went there to ""my eBay"", the only item showing under active was the one that I had received the notification about that was ending soon. I clicked around trying to get all of my watched items to show up; they did not.

I also went to my purchased items trying to find out tracking information on a recent purchase. When I went to purchased items, it said nothing had been purchased in the last 60 days! Totally incorrect.

I called EBay to complain about this bug in the app.  They suggested that I contact the app makers through the App Store, which I am doing. I hope these are corrected.

If I were EBay, I would find a new app maker. These problems are inexcusable.",5
1831,"Slow selling interface: We use this app daily...huge staff full time.
It is very slow in loading pics and getting from one page to the next for selling.....server kicks out frequently.
Shipping pages should be easier to describe package size and weight. 
Category choices and forced item specs are really a waste of time since prior examples are common and fixing specs to search categories truly limits the search experience.
So much could be better.",5
1832,"More expensive than buying on desktop: Desktop website offers cheaper search results than through the app. A cheaper version of the product I wanted to buy on desktop was not shown on mobile app. I could see it under Recently Viewed in the app, but wasn’t able to pay for it, I got the following message: “Sorry, but this item uses a different buying format or payment type not currently supported by our app. Please complete the transaction on your main ebay site.” The price difference was almost double. No wonder new from azn is cheaper than used on ebay now. I rarely buy anything here anymore.",2
1833,"Could be better: I have had very bad experience selling on eBay. People are very picky and love to abuse the money back guarantee. eBay always sides with the buyer, so not only do you get ripped off for your money oftentimes your product gets ripped off too. 
I had shipped a phone to Peru and post office lost it in the mail. Buyer got a full refund. Guess who had to foot the bill and lost my product, which I used my own money to buy, ship, and pay eBay fees? Me, the seller. 
This isn't the first time. Seller, beware.",5
1834,"eBay App Review: I use the app to shop and to sell. I have found it to be quite simple and user friendly for shopping, searching, buying and paying through PayPal. 

For selling, I do most of my eBay sales on my smart phone or iPad as opposed to using my laptop, and there are several places the app needs improvement: 

For one, global shipping labels are not supported in the app. That's not very convenient as about 1 in 10 or so sales seem to be international buyers. 
Also, my store is not easily accessed through the app. I usually by-pass the app and go to the website when I need to put my store on vacation or reprint a label and just about any other action besides a simple listing or printing a simple shipping label.
I'd like to see these glitches fixed for sure. Until then I don't feel really enthusiastic about using the app.",5
1835,"Great shopping experience!: I have found eBay to be very user-friendly. It is my go to store for selling and buying. The policy in place is intended to ensure safety whether you are a buyer or a seller. The resolution team is fair and easy to use, if a problem occurs with a transaction. eBay and PayPal work well together. Downside: USPS mailing costs have increased in the last several years. eBay’s fees for providing a monitored risk-free shopping experience have also gone up.",5
1836,"EBay is fun!: EBay always makes it exciting and fun. It doesn’t matter if you’re buying or selling it’s always a fun experience and the auctions are the best! But… the best part is that there are some great people who buy and sell on this site. 
I sold an axe head (for restoration) recently and the person who bought it actually sent me a picture after he restored it and he said he was giving it to his son for Christmas! How great is that?
Thanks EBay!",5
1837,"No Way to Rectify an Item Not Received: I don’t know what sneaky policy eBay has that doesn’t cover two purchases from the SAME seller that had great reviews. I purchased during a window that the seller was on vacation. Fine, I waited. Of course this only lengthened the time and shortened my window. Long story short, I spent $10 on NO books, from discover-books who NEVER responded and eBay has no way for me to contact someone about the purchase. So who kept my money, if the order clearly still shows not delivered??? They’re marked ‘Shipped’ but I see that only the tracking number was provided, meaning they never shipped anything. Take some responsibility, EBAY!!!",1
1838,Let’s seller rip lots of people off with stolen NEW IPHONES: Bought my son a a brand new iphone for Christmas turned out to be stolen or not in system (SELLERS REVIEWS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT GETTING RIPPED OFF BY THE SAME SELLER AND STOLEN IPHONES) paying for a phone bill each month for a phone my son can’t use asked for a refund then seller said he can get it fixed and kept messing around till 3 weeks went by I had enough opened up eBay and seller had eBay case against me 😂 HES SELLING PEOPLE STOLEN PHONES because I didn’t send the phone back in the time frame out my money for phone and couple months phone bill and case and screen protector but it is ok never us EBAY AND THERE NO ENGLISH SPEAKING EMPLOYEES SIMPLE AS READ OUR MESSAGES I HAVE THE SCREENSHOTS OF EVERYTHING.,1
1839,"Broken: What do notification offers show up in bids/offers? Why can’t they be filtered out so I can see what I have BID on? Looking at saved searches tonight I see items listed in left column but I am not at to see the item in the main view on right of screen. Mobile app issues? using chrome browser things work correctly

Why do search result scroll up when I spend time looking at an item and/or drill down looking at a sellers other items? Every time I come back to the original search results I’m back at the top. It makes browsing search results VERY frustrating",2
1840,"Opinion: I really like eBay and have been a member and purchased many things for a long time. This is no fault or criticism of eBay but the last several items I have purchased from member sellers have been way missed measured and I have, sometimes, to battle with them to pay for return shipping. Just wanted to voice my concern. It takes time on the innocent party to resolve these issues and eBay needs to be aware.",5
1841,eBay has a new shipping algorithm that is awful!: Call why do they remove the ounces on my shipping?  I have been with ebay for 24 years.  I have a scale and meticulously weigh each item. Then ebay removes the ounces and when the buyer pays they end up paying less for shipping. I have to make up the difference. This is actually mail fraud. I complained and a foreign guy told me he would not help me because I was disrespecting him.  Thanks ebay. See you in court.,5
1842,"Versatile!: The eBay app allows me to purchase items. I might normally have to shop at several stores to find. I get a chance not only to examine the item before I purchase it, but compare prices, and even sometimes engage in a little bidding or negotiating with the seller. Items arrive usually in good time, and of course the further way the longer it takes. Generally items arrive in great condition. Very versatile app!",5
1843,"Always helpful: Any transaction I’ve ever made through E Bay has always been backed by their guarantee on delivery, or damaged products, or wrong items sent to me. Y’all have always had my back. No matter what you’re need, check out E Bay first. Anything, foods, clothes, medications, tools , Jewelry, musical instruments, the list goes on to whatever your needs. 
Try EBay first. Usually free shipping. 
Happy shopping. 20 + years of doing business with EBay.  Firsttaz",5
1844,"Fees: I used to love selling items on eBay when it was just a 10% fee for using eBay to sell my items. But now eBay has raised its rates/fees to 13% and that is not cool at all because it takes away all of my profit that I can make when I sell an item. That is why me and a lot of other people I know are not going to be using eBay anymore because if I do want to sell an item on eBay, I’m going to have to jack up the price of the item that I am selling and no one is going to buy it at that price, I don’t know why you jacked up your fees to 13% it’s just playing out greed. So me and a bunch of other people are going to be taking our business elsewhere.",1
1845,"Still the most fun...: EBay, after 20 years, is still my favorite place to look for things and buy them. There is an element of fun that just does not prevail on other sites. I have made some amazing purchases over the years. And even when things very rarely did not work out as planned, eBay came to the rescue. If you are looking for bargains or things that are rare, eBay is the place to start your search.",5
1846,"Ebay App review.: Great App! Easy to use. Productive searches. Easy to find or follow items. Direct delivery searches. I haven’t sold anything, it’s not my deal, but I tried once and it was easy and straight forward. Problems are easily addressed. 
    Only thing I could offer to make it better would be a way to delete or clean up watched items, or especially saved items in large batches, instead of one at a time.",5
1847,"Needs Easier Functionality: The one thing I don’t like about E-Bay in general is the fact that it seems to be primarily in solely set up for buyers, not sellers. navigating even on desktop version can be very hard if you don’t have it roadmapped. being able to talk to customer service is much harder than let’s say Amazons where it takes 10 seconds to find the agent. Agents with Ebay are almost always rude and very unhelpful to sellers. Overall I still love Ebay and what it is today, but it needs some serious improvements",3
1848,"Red flags or negative reviews: No matter how many negatives sellers have , EBay allows them to continue doing business as usual. It’s obvious EBay is in this for the money only. To many showing a picture of an item then shipping something else, then the seller wants buyer to pay the return shipping when seller is at fault  of bait and switch. Also sellers not having to stand behind warranties after the sale. My resent experience I wanted to purchase an item the advertised “ Lifetime Warranty “. When I pressed the seller for an answer they stated that there was only 90 day warranty and that they would correct the incorrect ad. Still reads “Lifetime Warranty”. eBay does nothing...",1
1849,WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS!!!!!: I used to like using this app but recently I haven’t. I bought a part from “Dura Solid Racing” and when I tried to send the part back for my refund they sent me a wrong label to use. I asked for a new shipping label and they told me to ask eBay. When I tried to call eBay I couldn’t find a customer service line!!!! There’s no email ANYWHERE on the website or the app. They try and direct you to some advice page but its no help. It’s like there NO ONE running the customer service department!!! I’m deleting this app and NEVER using it again!!!!!! I did try to contact the company I bought the part from and it’s like they don’t exist either!!! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DURASOLID RACING!!!!!,1
1850,"Can’t talk to a team member.: I have tried to contact anyone about fraudulent activity and all I get is an endless loop of automated responses that sends me to sites that can’t help and won’t get me in touch with anyone. 

My problem is that I purchased a item and payed for the item. The seeker then informs me he sold the item to someone else. He reports he has canceled the sale but now 4 days later I have no refund for the item or for the square trade 2 year warranty I purchased where they say that is not refundable because the item was shipped. What a mess and I am unable through automation to report this other than here.",2
1851,"Notification manager: I would like to be able to decide which push notifications I can receive. I like sales notifications but hate marketing notifications. I would like to turn off marketing notifications at will. I get audio alerts for sales, but never want them for marketing alerts. It’s an annoying interruption that intrudes on my day. Makes me want to delete the app or stop all notifications. It’s supposed to be enjoyable not annoying.",4
1852,"Sale promotions “ list up to 250 items FREE”: This ad is written wrong apparently…  this does not mean that we can sell items free. It just means we can list them free. First item I sold and I am being charged 145$ fee. I argued the fee and was told that it would look bad on my account to do that and it would be closed. Finally after 2 people,  I spoke to a supervisor who was only able to refund 25$ out of the 145$. Told him they should fix the flaw in the app instead of threatening clients with closing their accounts. Millions of customers and just one complains and they lose their minds about it instead of fixing the problem. Not satisfied with it after 15yrs with them.",1
1853,"Almost an amazing platform to sell on: Let’s face it, as eBay expands their fees upon people listing on the site (sellers) to cover losses from less people buying from their site (buyers) they end up losing sellers (core of eBay business). It also leads to eBay items costing more. This is what led to the rise and continued expansion of Mercari, Etsy, Etc. Critical mass of sellers could be lost, which would cause an implosion of general usage and value, which would be a shame because it’s otherwise a great place to sell items on.",4
1854,Need to make changes: I’m trying to sell on this app. I don’t understand why I have to wait 4 days for a buyer to pay up. Open season for scammers. I sell on other apps and it takes me within 4 days to send out the item and get paid. Everything else about eBay is great. I bought a lot of items and never had any problems and I didn’t wait 4 days to pay the seller trying to get there coins. eBay you need to protect the sellers and buyers from scammers. This should be a PRIORITY..,4
1855,"Items, Prices, and Deals.: The items, that I’ve been searching for, are surprisingly here on the web. The cheap low prices are very competitive, but much better than material goods that are easily breaking, which I neither bought nor gained on this website, by the way. The deals, such as 2 items for the price of 1, the free shipping is quite pleasing, and both the speed of shipping and delivery, are very quite promising.👍👍👍👍👍",5
1856,"Multiple buyers attenpted a scam: I got four offers on multiple top quality drawings and for EACH one, they ended up asking for a $200 gift card. And they sent whole paragraphs in an attempt to convince me it’s a good idea. Of course, this was after we were texting away from the ebay website because they had some “questions about the condition”. After the third time this happened I didnt even respond, I jus canceled the orders. Because I was getting so irritated. Even when I advertised I wasn’t going to include any additional items INCLUDING gift cards of any kind. It kept happening. This has not happened to me anywhere but ebay. Very disappointed.",1
1857,"Chuba Hubbard playing card: As usual, the selection process went extremely well, as did the purchasing process. The Seller has indicated a delivery date one week from today, which is not unreasonable. As an OSU Alumni, and a lover of Cowboy football, I have remained focused on Chuba as soon as he made starter. From the very onset, he demonstrated an incredible amount of talent. I’m extremely pleased with what he accomplished at OSU and just knew I had to have his card. Thanks to all!!!",5
1858,"Worst app ever?: eBays most recent app update is atrocious: there are numerous glitches on several iPhones I have tested it with, all with the latest IOS - iPhone 6, SE, and even iPhone 7 - unable to click on items, and various other problems that make browsing items and responding to messages basically impossible. Extremely slow loading times, and random error messages. eBay needs to fix their app ASAP!!",5

Beanies babies, they go fast and I am trying to make them a thing again. That’s a review for later though. Anywayz, eBay is magnifico. Just look up a common 90’s word like “autograph”. Just type it in an scroll. Trust me, you will feel like a kid again. An apple blossom flower represents staying young at heart. I am going to go look up that word. Then back to the chair of truths. Aka adulting.",5
1860,"Hmmmmmmmm ...: We know all we need to know about eBay. It is an excellent platform for buying and selling that has survived decades of competition, updates, features, and massive growth. eBay is a household name akin to the biggest brands on the planet, and yet remains easy to use for both advanced and basic sellers and buyers.

I would recommend only two things, with understanding of why it’s set up that way. One, collect seller fees at point of sale. Paying them at the end of the cycle is a pain. I know this simplifies things in case of return or lost merch. Second, lower the fees. I feel like I take home very little of what I sell. That is due, however, to the type of merch I sell. I sell items between $2 and $10.

I will not pretend to know all, and will not use any other platform at present, nor for the last 29 years.

Cheers!",5
1861,"eBay Support: I’ve been buying on eBay for numerous years when I had my business. I still make a least 25 to 30 purchases per year. I’ve only had 2 issues with items I’ve purchased. 
  I contacted eBay support and they resolved my issues immediately and one with a total refund back to my account. This makes me feel like customer support has my back, and they do. “That’s why I buy from eBay”.",5
1862,"Awful app. Awful service.: eBay essentially makes it easy to purchase using their app, and to list new items - both features that heavily benefit the company. However, it is incredibly difficult (or often impossible) to access necessary advanced features for selling. It is also impossible to contact the company’s resolution/customer service center when issues are encountered. 

Their search function is also heavily weighted toward “featured” items, which are often unrelated to the actual search, requiring additional time and energy to find what you’re after.

All easy fixes, but things that don’t benefit eBay’s bottom line so they will add the necessary features.",1
1863,"Top eBay fan: eBay makes it easy to search and purchase from your favorite sellers. Any time there is any sort of issue, each seller has bent over backwards to make it right. My favorite thing is being able to shop from charities. One suggestion... I would like to be able to search for sellers from specific types of charities and sellers that contribute a higher percentage of the sale to their selected charity. Thanks!",5
1864,Taxes starting oct: Taxes are now being added to all purchases which is the main reason I’m not buying and selling as much . I was a buyer daily and am now reluctant to to do so bc of this .This will hurt your business dramatically. I’ve spoken with tons of people and told me they’re doing different websites now bc of this . Also it’s ridiculous to tax shipping I didn’t even know that was legal . Taxes was never a thing before except for business people.,5

It doesn’t matter what you’re looking for EBay is the Easiest way! Plus shipping is super quick on most all products! Returns are easy and simple. 
EBay has certainly changed their policies from early years.

1866,"You can’t fix a broken system: For buyers this is a great platform to find good deals. For sellers it’s ridiculous. I had to repost my camera because the first time the camera sold to a scammer that obviously didn’t follow through on the sale. Apparently the majority of “people” that bid on it were fake accounts that were created the same day! And these accounts can go around and bid on whatever they want to with no repercussions. Of course I wasn’t stupid enough to fall for their text message scam where you message them outside of ebay, but I’m sure some unfortunate souls have. I’m just mad that there’s no way to scan for these jerks in advance. Instead I have to go through a long reposting process.",1
1867,"Good most of the time: I love eBay overall, but I occasionally have issues with payments. I do all my banking though a small local bank but they still support MasterCard. I always have more than enough money my account to make my purchase and occasionally I get rejected for no reason, even if I use PayPal. This used to happen all the time and hadn’t for a while, but did again today. It’s frustrating when you aren’t able to buy something and it’s out of your control, but other than that eBay is great!",4
1868,"eBay supports scammers: They have changed many policies regarding buying/selling. Now when you get screwed by a seller they can cancel your order weeks later without you the buyer being able to even leave them feedback to warn other buyers. eBay supports the scammers every time I’ve had a issue since these policy changes. Worse is you can’t even talk with eBay on it. They give you the chance to leave them your thoughts on the experience, but even then your feedbacks anonymous and they won’t even respond or tell you if anything happens... because nothing happens and these sellers keep their good feedback while dodging negative. Be warned eBay doesn’t want to loose ANY sellers so screw the buyers.",1
1869,"Enjoying eBay!  Nothing like shopping from home!: Recommend 2 improvements:
1) to ‘My eBay’ at bottom of screen when using the eBay App.  Recommend revising to take you to main ‘My eBay’ rather than the need to click on the back ‘<‘ icon repeatedly.
2) to ‘Bids & Offers’. Recommend adding the ability to remove or move items not won (or any offer/counter offers not accepted/expired) from the ‘Active’ section to ‘Didn’t Win’ section.
Thank you!!",5
1870,"Ebay Wont Let You Buy Anything: I have been trying to purchase items through Ebay however they use Paypal as their only payment processing platform. For se reason, after having calling them multiple tomes, verifying my ID, sending in bank statements, Paypal wont allow me to complete transactions because of their security system. Ebay has a major flaw in giving all control over payment to Paypal who cannot override their own system. I have called to reaolve this with Ebay and Paypal many times. Neither can fix it. As a result, I have lost out on items that I desperately wanted to purchase. Ebay needs to fix this and allow users to use a different system to make payments/purchases.",1
1871,"Horrible.  In desperate need of update.: There are so many bugs in this app that I spend half my time on the app looking for work-arounds.  In order to complete a listing, I need to use both the app and the online site.  The app likes to automatically populate my listings with information that is not accurate, and there is no way to turn this feature off.  It’s s huge waste of time.  Also: customer service is the pits.  The reps are not knowledgeable about technical issues and often offer false promises - they will say that a tech person will call me back, but the person never actually calls.  If you don’t already sell on eBay, save yourself the pain and choose another platform.",1
1872,"Why go out into the crowds when you have Ebay?: I have been using the Ebay app. For years now and have saved thousands of dollars on just about everything we need for car and home repairs to clothing cooking supplies. I do not like going into a mall or big box store and the Ebay app. Enables me to sit back, research and look for the best price and quickest delivery offered by exceptional vendors. If you are thinking of using the app, go ahead and jump! You will be surprised on how easy it is to use.",5

They gave me the seller number (who had also a very bad customer service), I have been stuck now for 3 days with no solution for my prob., the seller didn’t do a refund for my money & they even stopped shipping the item that I have requested. eBay didn’t take any action for my case.
I have erased this app from my phone & I recommend not to deal with them until they develop their customer service.",1
1875,"App update not user friendly: Once again I did an update of the eBay app and it is difficult to navigate. I was sent an email telling me that the old version would not be supported, so I updated and I don't like it. I'm going to do what I did before. I'm going to delete this app and then upload an older version that I have saved on my computer. I'll use the older version until he doesn't function anymore. Can't you just leave things alone?",5
1876,"User limitations: If you add a product to sell and need to delete it, the only way to do so is if you have a computer. I have called eBay Support in hoping they can help, hey can’t. eBay Support told me the only person who can is the person who listed the item and only on a computer. If you need to contact eBay you can call and talk to a person which is nice. But I’m currently deployed in Afghanistan and it is not feasible for me to call, so my best option is emailing them. Which you can not do on the mobile site. So unless you have a common problem you need fixed you have options to click on and “ways” to correct them. Any unique problem... good luck. Not impressed and do not recommend eBay.",1
1877,"Annoying: Update makes this worse, do not bother.  Keeps requesting to be reviewed.  Only change over last version, I looked at Bowflex weights and got a catalog in the mail.  So either Google or eBay sold my search.  I think people should be paid 20 percent of every sale of their info. 
New updates continue to decrease value and hurt EBay sales.  Companies are so greedy they have to use your information to place ads between you and whatever you want.  You can’t even read the description of an item now without wading through ads that are right inside the item’s description.  No respect for their customers, users or sellers.  I have stopped using eBay because of this app.",1
1878,"Make sure you enter your address correctly!: This service is too gracious towards sellers in that the seller can reject cancellation requests.

If you happen to enter the wrong address, and request a cancellation to fix it the seller can choose not to accept it even if the item hasn’t been sent. In my case, I messaged the seller immediately after ordering because, thanks to some sort of bug and not user error, my unit number and apartment letter had changed to something different on my address despite me not changing it.

The seller didn’t bother to reply for two days before denying the request, and they hadn’t even mailed out the item yet because the tracking ID hadn’t been entered. In other words, the seller denied the request so I could fix my address and still had the item in their hand.

This is despicable, and EBay needs to update policies to prevent this type of nonsense from occurring in the future. 

As for me, I won’t be purchasing anything else from this service in the future.",1

After all of this he opened a return case and eBay legit didn’t help me at all now they have him sending the item back and I lose all the money I made on it and I get a damaged item returned that’s worthless now. eBay didn’t help at all and I would suggest using another app or something else don’t waste your time",1
1880,Non payers!!!!: Please ! Can you set something up so that when non paying bidders don’t pay that they get removed from Ebay ? This is really hurting my business and it has been going on for years! I thought when a person placed a bid that it was a legally binding contract 🤷‍♀️ PLEASE REMOVE PEOPLE IF THEY BID ON 3 ITEMS AND NEVER PAY ... it’s BECOMING A JOKE ... to many kids are bidding for fun and it really hurts the sellers who need to keep listing items over and over again... PLEASE DO SOMETHING!,5
1881,Ebay is terrible: Ive lost money selling and buying items on ebay. I sent out items that I never received payments on. Customers did not pay me after items arrived and they would not respond to any messages. Ebay did nothing for me after countless calls. I purchased an xbox 360 from that was said to be tested and working. It didnt even read discs. Messaged the seller about it and they acted like it was my fault.. ive only ever lost money thanks to ebay.. will NEVER be buying or selling on here for the rest of the time im alive. I suggest you do the same unless you like taking risks. It baffles me there arent more 1 star reviews. Wouldn’t be surprised if half the reviews are bots.,1
1882,"Listing tool update has vanished: I love using the app to list trading cards for sale, and as of Fall 2023, the app rolled out an updated listing tool that made it much easier to enter in item specifics, add photos, etc. I was able to list items WAY FASTER than previously. 

However, after a couple of months, the updated listing tool just disappeared and went back to the old version. As a result, listings take much longer (ultimately meaning less seller fees to eBay).

The first person wanted to text outside of eBay, the second bid on an item and then claimed shipping was to high, and just tonight a person sent a counter offer and refused to send payment! eBay needs to do a better job of detecting scammers on their site! Also, sellers should not have to wait 4 days before canceling a payment that may NEVER come! That is a waste of time on the sellers part because someone who really wants the item could purchase AND PAY opposed to waiting 4 days on a scammer who really has no intention of making a payment! Do better eBay!",1

For a four star review:: The reason eBay has just a four star review is due to how intuitive the app is, when selling on the app there are some options that are hard to get to the first, after a couple uses it get easier.

There are many vendors that try to trick buyers, and that tool would help filter those products. For instance, when you search for IPad, there are lots of listing selling broke products or they list an iPad 1 as iPad Air. So, after careful review a post, the buyer could dislike that product and in future searches that specific result would not show to me again.",3

The beautiful thing about this is they don’t have costumes service and the saying you can chat online live with representatives and anyone respond, only computer. Is totally a scam.

If you have complaints, it’s difficult to contact s-bay. Example: on the hobo nickel site, fakes from China continue to be allowed. What I would consider pornography on fake Morgan dollars swamp the site. There is no policing. 

On rating, the postal service should also be rated. Items shipped with tracking can go missing for weeks on end. We can rate the shipper, but virtually all late parcels are due to the post office. They need to allow us to rate the post office.",3

Refunded purchase shows “PAY NOW”. Can’t do anything with this transaction. I returned and was refunded. Done. Broken item payment status on a non-interactive item for a completed transaction is more annoyance.

1908,"Down from 3 stars to 2... annoying to sellers: The app has different features than the site.  Do these teams talk to each other?  But the listing has to work no matter where you create it and it gets annoying when the app doesn't recognize a shipping method or won't let you see a field when you create a listing... but retains the data from a different item.  

NEW version chooses Auto Relist by default on mobile app where you can't see that it's selected.  So you waste your free listings on relistings of stuff you didn't want to relist. UGHHHH.  

The app will let you clone a listing -- but some fields of the listing are not visible (or at least very hard to find) in the app, and it will retain this information from the original listing on the new one -- not a good idea for fields that describe the item's condition, which will vary from item to item.  

Some new features are pushed hard in the app... too hard.  

Also, it is harder to escape the FAQ maze and get help when you need it.",2
1909,Not a happy camper: I totally hate that Ebay has  taken it upon themselves to automatically change my 30 day listing to “until it sells.” I also hate it that you want to automatically reduce my merchandise. Perhaps Ebay needs to leave the selling options to the sellers and consider dropping EBAY prices instead of trying to rob the sellers who are struggling to try and make a living. If you must put an option don’t make it pop on every one of my store listing! It’s time consuming and aggravating. I would also like to have more exposure that 10 or 12 per item. Thanks,3

AND you have to pay PayPal as well so you are getting awfully close to being taxed almost 20% of what you sell your item for, also with such a competition out there it is a horrible platform for sellers big and small. Buying on Ebay sure, but I warn you if you plan to sell-be ready to pay the man-and pay him a lot.",1
1911,EBay Developer please read: My past purchases show up in my purchased file for recently bought items. I can not delete these past purchases that showed up two updates ago. I already wrote feedback and deleted them. They all reappeared two updates back and I can’t delete them. I don’t want to see what I deleted. This is incredibly annoying. Please fix this in the next update. Other than this issue I love the app. Thank you.,5
1912,"Annoying app: The fact that I needed to type in a unique “nickname” for myself (instead of just my user name it first name) just warrants a 1-Star review of this app. My inbox always seems to have a new email, but it’s either something I’ve already opened, or more than likely it’s just more and more spam from eBay itself. I’m constantly being shown either bids that have already ended, or items I’ve already purchased, etc.  I’ve been an eBay user for about 18 years now, you would think they’d have a handle on app development, or at least improve it over time.",3
1913,"This would make it a better App: As sellers we need a breakdown of seller fees and what’s left as profit shown on the app somewhere. It would make my job so much simpler then having go to the browser and search for what I owe In fees. Be nice if it’s taken out right away like how PayPal  does it so that I know what’s left over in profits instead of it all being pulled out at the end of the month. Also, it would be nice to know when the same product that I’m selling goes higher or lower so that I can adjust my price to stay competitive. Thanks.",4
1914,"Mom to Princess of Quite Alot: Thank you Ebayers!

My purchase satisfaction is 99.9% since I have joined in 2004. I have a 26 year old Princess who also has autism. I have found her everything she has ever wanted or been passionate about and more—no matter how rare or impossible to find!!! I am OBSESSED appreciator about Mary Engelbreit’s ART which is always available for MY OWN grateful and happy Ebaying experience!!! I can’t imagine life without my Ebaying friends and associates that have also professionally packed and successfully shipped so many antiques and vintage glass I also have collected over the many years!! ...Always ever so ready to communicate and all Sellers have gone above and beyond to ensure a 5 star transaction. I’m proud to be a purple star! 
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
Thanks to all Ebaying Folks from this 
Queen of Everything!!
Warmest regards,
Laurie Lomba",5
1915,"Bait and switch prices: I have contacted eBay about this but they don’t seem to care. Most of the time when I am buying something, I would sort the search by low price to high (why pay more ?). The problem is that sellers add a cheap item with the product you want to buy like a touch pen with a phone case . The pen would cost you $.99 so that’s the price would see in the search for phone case too, but when actually try to buy it the price of the case would be $10. It’s completely up to the sellers and it is fair to let them set a price they want . But they shouldn’t be allowed to bait and switch prices like that.",2
1916,"Great unless you want to sell your car: Overall I do like the eBay app.  I don't like that I can't list or even modify a vehicle listing.  You cannot even add pictures to an existing listing.  It's like I have this super handy app for listing and purchasing stuff on eBay, and then it's worthless when I have to transfer pics to my computer and then upload to sell a car.  I can buy a car from my phone I just can't list one.  I guess technology has its limits!",5
1917,"Helpful but a few bugs: The app definitely quickly notifies me if I sell an item or win an auction. This is the most important factor so I can ship items quickly.  However, it will say I have multiple active items for sale but will not show any of them. It simply says I have no active items for sale when I click the link. This happens whether I log out, remove the app and reinstall or any other attempt to make them appear. To view or edit an item, I have to use safari on my iPhone. I wish this could be fixed and it would be amazing.",3
1918,Latest update - Purchase History: This latest update is not the best as far as purchases tab.  There is a new thing where it shows frequently purchased together after each item.   For someone who purchases quite frequently this is a pain to see this between every item.  Slows down the loading of the list.  I don’t think eBay is the platform for this as a lot of stuff on here is not some new item on the market.   And it’s very frustrating to scroll down the list now.,3
1919,"Where'd my purchases go??: I would've given this app five stars. I've used it a lot over the years. Today however and several times before, I would open the app to look at my purchases and nothing would populate. My watched items don't populate. My bids and offers don't populate. My personal feedback doesn't populate. A very frustrating bug that needs to be fixed pronto! Also, every single time I select the item location to be from the US only, I still get items listed that are from China. Every single time! I hope someone is reading this from Ebay… It is literally every single time! I don't want to buy from China!",2
1920,"Easy Listing Format on eBay: I sell on several different sites, but I really find that eBay has the most user-friendly listing site for sellers. Even if you’ve never done it before, you’ll find that eBay really simplifies the steps for you. Now you can also use AI for your descriptions. There are also some cool filters and formats that you can use for your photos. I highly recommended for selling and buying.",5
1921,"Some idiocracies, but rather pleasant: I have used this for a while, and it seems well built and not buggy. However, I have run into a few eBay idocracies which may cause confusion for a bit—as expected from a website something first conceived in the 90s.

The app is great. As much as PayPal is annoying, it makes this whole app far more usable. The seller/buyer interaction is not too difficult, at least on the smaller scale.",5
1922,"Fix the absence of the Request Total” link: The website allows buyers to place items in cart and then click “Request Total” link so sellers can adjust shipping.  

I have been waiting for you to put that on the App.  What is holding it up?  As a seller, the lack of it is wasting my time doing refunds and paying eBay extra commission fees on the excess shipping and State taxes being paid by buyers.

It has been long enough - Fix It.",5
1923,"Excellence all around: I’ve been using eBay for over ten years and the app has never let me down. It’s extremely user friendly and even when there are updates, I’ve never felt lost or the need to relearn anything. As far as usage goes, this is also simply one of the best sites and apps to sell or buy anything. It has so many users who sell a large variety of things. As the title suggests, excellent app.",5
1924,"PLEASE STOP LOGGING ME OUT THE APP: Throughout the day I am constantly signing into the app every single time I open the app. For whatever reason I’m being signed out every time I leave the app or it’s closed. Which means I can’t get notifications for items I’m watching or have bid on. I’VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR OVER 3 MONTHS NOW. I’ve deleted and redownloaded the app so many times, keep the app updated, etc. and nothing has fixed this issue. It’s beyond frustrating to deal with and I’m really thinking about never using the app again if this continues on longer and finding another app to buy and sell on after being on eBay since 2009. This is ridiculous. FIX THIS ISSUE!",1
1925,"My favorite past time. Lol.: Oh, let me start off by saying I work a lot actually from morning till dark in the summertime and in the winter time from early morning till dark but every single day I open my eyes and grab my phone and I check my eBay meaning on all different types of interest I have to say that when I open my eyes in the morning I look forward to looking on my eBay every day. Lol keep up the good work I love it.",5
1926,"Needs improvement: I posted a high end bag on EBay.  After several days of “authentication process it was sent back.  Explanation was that it was authentic but hardware had some scratches on it!  Can EBAY say “used”?  When I complained, I was told that the authenticater was “new”. I was able to get my Shipping paid back to me because of the complaint.  The bag, by the way was deeply discounted and was well worth what the buyer would have paid.",5
1927,I love the app but I have one issue!: This is the best shopping app I’ve ever used but I’m not sure what the problem is but every time I want to put something on my watchlist or you know when you click the little heart next to the item you want mine won’t let me I’ve went into my list to see if I had to many items but I don’t so I’m not sure what the problem is could someone please fix this issue.,5
1928,"Love eBay: I love selling and buying on EBay. I've been using eBay since 2000. I get really mad at them at times, but I go back every time because they are the world's market place.   I am hoping this terrible decision to tax every sale for the whole year over a $600 limit never goes into effect. It will ruin eBay and hurt all of us who have found a fun hobby and enjoying finding out about antiques, our collections, and good bargains. Fight 'em, eBay!",5
1929,Awful Update: This new update is ruining my whole business. Now when listing an item you won’t be able to tell how much or have an estimate of how much the shipping is going to cost. This forces you to list it as free shipping and over price your items so it will be harder to get a sale because you can’t compete with other listing prices. The other problem is when you get a sale you might think it’s gonna cost you a certain amount to ship and it could end up being 2-3x more expensive to ship. This recent update is awful and needs serious fixing. (Not to mention how hard it is to even list a simple item),1
1930,What has happened to eBay!: The latest update is awful! If you’re tempted do do it! You know how you have a list of items you search? When you pull it up it shows you the ones you have not seen? Well that’s all gone now. That is only one change but clearly the team that made this update doesn’t use the app. The single worst change to an app I have seen ever. I wish I could give a -1.,5
1931,"Extra Money.: Ebay has helped me make extra cash ! From selling things I no longer need. I’m going through my closet’s. Selling old and new dolls ,figurines. Just whatever I have on hand to help me pay a light bill, water bill, my cell phone and other living expenses. With inflation rising and the times we are living in is hard financially. Go through your house and start listing. If I can do ityou  can do it too!
Thank you EBay.",5
1932,"BUG! Saved searches don’t work anymore: Saved searches don’t work anymore: The app now randomly shows that there are new items that match saved searches, but there is nothing - it only shows items that eBay thinks could be similar. A serious bug - or eBay just trying to increase engagement… That would backfire: I am not going to check the app anymore if it a waste of time.",5
1933,Fix the view system and search algorithm for sports card boxes: The view system change is a joke and a way for you guys to force sellers to use the promoted listings tab to promote there items and ALOT of sellers have seen a big decrease in sales and views since you guys changed the view system and also the search engine is broken when it comes to searching for sealed boxes of cards I search for a specific year and product name and the sport I’m looking for and it brings back every sport and ever year and stuff that’s not even related when it comes to searching for sports card boxes eBay needs to fix these isssues and stop increasing final value fees,1
1934,"New app version is awful: Whatever was done to change the app is absolutely terrible. It used to be so easy to search for things and find exactly what you want to find. Now, trying to look up items I’ve sold in the past is impossible. I tried everything to find information on an item I sold in the past and I get nothing. This used to be such a good app but now it really isn’t user-friendly even a little bit. Whatever was done to change it needs to be changed back to what it used to be.i surely won’t use it to sell if it stays now it is.",2
1935,No seller protection: I had a buyer win an auction. The auction was a used item. It was stated as such. I gave the customer a partial refund and they still gave me a negative review after getting the product. Ebay barely looked at my case and said “We all have opinions” so now unfortunately my account will have an inaccurate poorly written review by a customer who wasn’t paying attention to the product they bought. I won’t be using the service as much as I used to because there are plenty of other options. It’s unfortunate but if they can’t support their sellers it’s the natural outcome.,2
1936,"Good for buyers, terrible for sellers: I sold an item on eBay and the buyer sent a return request due to the product being damaged. I accepted and sent a full refund back to the buyer. eBay then tried charging me an $85 fee which shouldn’t happen as according to their terms of service and their help page I should only have to pay a 30 cent fee for the initial listing of the item as I get a fee credit from me giving the buyer a full refund. My account is now suspended and debt collectors are harassing me saying I now owe $165. Never using eBay again for anything. Facebook market place and Craigslist are better anyways for selling. FBMP has no fees for listing and selling items.",1
1937,Best market app ever: I have bought many things for far less than MSRP on this app as well as found many items brand new and sold from large retailers. It’s a dream because the best part is if the seller doesn’t ship the item or violates their listing in anyway then they don’t receive your money and as long as the item had eBay money back guarantee on it you can get every penny back. That means you can purchase without fear and enjoy your winnings!,5
1938,Love it: Whether buying or selling it works well. The only suggestion I have for eBay is fix the mandatory returns when a buyer lies. No returns means no returns. It should be unacceptable for someone to say it didn’t match the description or it didn’t work when it clearly did. I am not a store. I cannot eat a $50 item when the customer opened it and it ends up they bought the wrong item. Can’t sell it as new anymore.,5
1939,Stop turning on best offer: Stop turning on best offer after items are listed a few weeks or so.   It’s totally frustrating having to come back and turn it off when I’ve noticed you do this. If I wanted that turned on I’d do it when I make my listings!   Seriously though.  You make sellers want to delete and not return when you pull this nonsense and I’ve had my account for many years!!!,5
1940,"The best retail experience!: EBay is a wonderful way to connect with sellers, shops and stores around the entire world. Great communication ability, eBay guarantees and the absolute best prices has made eBay my number one choice for everything! I have bought art, jewelry, medical devices, luxury shoes and clothing, pet supplies, even live orchids. EBay has stood behind every transaction and the sellers are just wonderful. I could not be happier or more loyal. Thank you, eBay, and all of your wonderfully helpful employees. 👍",5
1941,"POOR BUYER SUPPORT: I’ve been an eBay user for over 2 years now but the amount of support I’ve received as a buyer has been very poor for the past 6 months. I’ve received multiple damaged items and EBay has not supported my complaint cases or even allowed me to leave valid feedback to warn other buyers to beware.

I am currently in the midst of another purchase where the seller did not correctly list the item by name AND description. I am waiting to see if I can get this issue resolved. If not, I will be no longer using eBay as a buying or selling platform

I recommend to other using alternatives where buyer and selling practices are more reliable, either locally or by other online platforms",1
1942,"Great place to browse: Even if you're not looking for something special you can pretty much always find an interesting item at a great price. Sometimes you stumble across the most incredible finds at amazing prices, which I often compare to Amazon....people are selling new or lightly used here for much cheaper!   Then you are stuck in the world of  EBay for the evening, bouncing from one site to the next, shopping form the comfort of your very own sofa. Dog in lap. Wine in hand. Perfect.",5
1943,Never email the seller.: I purchased one time from one seller because I did not receive my item. My PayPal account was reimbursed. I immediately starting reviving Chinese pornagraphic emails. I am still getting them today and I don’t know how to stop them. They must have sold my email address to others. I wish there was some way to stop this. I know exactly who the seller was. They are the only seller I ever contacted.,5
1944,One time upset: I really like eBay. Love shopping at home. The only thing when my mama passed away. I sent a message to a seller to see when I could get a dress to bury her in. Time was a big factor. So I sent a message to the seller and told them to call me and I would explain. I had NO intention of not buying off eBay. I wouldn’t do that because I like the guarantee you get with eBay involved. That really upset me. I was treated unfair on that one thing.,5
1945,"Flawed auto-fill features ruin experience: I need this app for easily adding photos to my listings.  I’ll create a listing on my desktop/web version of ebay, save a draft, then open the draft on my phone to add photos. Whenever i do this, the app KEEPS ON CHANGING MY PRICING SETTINGS!!! It likes to suggest different prices for my listings and changes them (sometimes adding a ‘accepts offers’ option). It’s a massive headache and makes everything take forever. There’s even a bug that occasionally force closes the on-screen keypad when you try to change the price back. Very aggravating. Also, inexplicably, the draft interface/view layout will change mid session. PLEASE FIX THIS TERRIBLE APP AND MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER.",1
1946,"Fix this!: I have two eBay accounts one for buying one for selling. Why can’t you figure out how to link them together. I didn’t get a notification that somebody had made an offer on an item I was selling. I don’t sell much so I don’t login to the selling account much.
 Ebay has room for improvement. 
Also I do everything on my phone. I have 100 items in my cart and I can only delete them one at a time it takes a long time. Why can’t I select the items to be deleted all at one time?
 I’d like to have the ability to watch items without running out of room. Why do you cap the number of items I can watch?",2
1947,Years of success!: I can genuinely say that eBay is the best site out of every other which may run along with. I’ve been with them for years... I’ve invested so much money and they sure make sure I am one of their values costumers. From the very first time with them they have shown me nothing but 🤩equal opportunities and 🤨honest deals. I’ve tried other AppStores to buy EVERYTHING I need but they DO NOT HOLD weight as eBay. Not by an inch. THANK YOU EBAY!!! I’ve been with you guys since 2k12 & I’m NEVER leaving you. 😍,5
1948,"Recent version is horrendous!: I’ve sold on eBay for over 10 years. The app was wonderful until this most recent version. I have almost 200 listings and when i need to scroll through my listings i have to wait for the app to load after scrolling through every 20 listings or so. No additional information is given from previous version to this one so it is strictly a developer issue. Please change this back. Very frustrating! 

I’ve always rated the EBay app a 5 star product until this most recent version. I will be more than happy to change my rating and update the review once this is fixed. I do love selling on eBay but despise this recent version of the EBay app.",1
1949,"Good, but major flaws: Pretty good app overall, but has at least two major flaws. 

1) have to press on a saved search AT LEAST TWICE to get all the available items that meet the search criteria. When you hit the search the first time, you only get a few results. It takes hitting the search a second time to get all (presumably) the results.

2) when selecting search results from the daily emails, the app stops working after three or four selections — it doesn’t call up the item.",4
1950,"Absolute worst customer service: This used to be one of my favorite apps but that has changed drastically. I've sold things for several years with no problem. That was until it began glitching on me. It said that I had sent a package when the label had not even been printed off yet. I was given a hard time trying to fix it and tried going to their ""help"" menu which did nothing for me. Finally, I tried calling them. After an hour, I was still on hold... after it projected that I wouldn't be on hold for longer than 23 minutes. That's what really got me. Ebay failed me. How is everyone supposed to wait over an hour to talk to a real person?! What kind of service is that?!",1
1951,Authenticity: I had A lot of difficulty with stuff that’s not authentic so far you’ve been very helpful and I believe the people should be investigated they don’t even have the logo on the one side of the necklace and they’re making a bunch of money. And I will continue to investigate them myself they’re not slandering my name All they have all three of them are selling fakes this week and they will continue to do it we have to week I’ve been researching and watching them,5
1952,"Poor delivery rate navigation for sellers: I lost money on a sale because after posting a few items where buyer pays for shipping so that the buyer has options, a subsequent listing defaulted to seller-pays-shipping. The screens did not clearly indicate this. My item sold and then I realized I lost money. I went back to figure out what went wrong and I had trouble finding the option for seller vs buyer paid shipping. I’d like eBay to cover this loss. It was only $6 and not worth calling on the phone let alone waiting on hold. Since figuring that out, the app has been okay but only mediocre. I have not tried buying anything yet so can’t speak for that.",2
1953,"Collector not retailer: Not a friendly site if you list single items that are not unique, at least different at in condition. 
Between eBay fees and PayPal fees it costs about 20% of the sale price PLUS  the same for the shipping charge. 
That being said, they are the only game in town that works. You can at least get something. I’ve tried eBid and things don’t sell. In a lot of cases they don’t even get looked at. At least the item gets views and usually sells on eBay.",5
1954,eBay is may favorite selling app!: I have been using eBay for many many years. This platform has allowed me to purchase some amazing things that tend to be difficult to find. Ebay has also been an invaluable resource for my auctions! The platform allows buyers from all over the globe to view my auctions increasing potential sales! I love EBay and will continue to utilize this platform for the foreseeable future.,5
1955,"False positives in saved searches: Saved searches in the app show the number of new results since you last checked. But searches with no new results often show a number (1-3) indicating new results. When you click on it, the app says “no results in this category, we’re showing you results in other categories.” Or “no results so we’re showing you results matching fewer words”. 

The number on the saved searches page is misleading.",4
1956,"Thankful and grateful: For years I have been waiting for such an app. I didn’t know it existed or at least had very little idea I have heard it did to my son with me to my storage in the country and showed me how to look up my things. I’m so excited that it’s able to help me with, a great majority of the things I look up and for the things that don’t register is fine. I’m sure it’s just a matter of time thank you all",5
1957,"Reliable Messaging is a Bit Clunky: My go to app for online flea market experience. Protection is in place for both bird and seller which gives peace of mind especially shopping for used items. Buyer should still be alert. I’ve been scammed. 

eBay at one point updated messaging feature to be more chat like which I greatly appreciated! But then they changed it back to the clunky email style which was not intuitive for responses. Please change it back.",4
1958,"Can get suspended for no reason: If I could give it no stars I would. This app is ran by bots that don’t help when it detects a mistake. Never used the app to buy anything mostly just created an account it to compare prices. Once I found a product that no other site has, I decided to contact the seller to see if that specific product still has a specific version of it. Few mins go by and boom Permanent suspension. Few mins after the suspension the seller tries to get in contact with  me. Can’t reply back because I’m suspended so now I’ll just delete the app. Tried asking the bots for help but the same basic prom pts that don’t help at all. Not worth",1
1959,"Communication: I have an awful time trying to send messages to sellers. It’s like the eBay app thinks that you are trying to do something behind their backs, so they block emails and texts. I have been trying to send a message to another seller and I have re-worded it 10 different ways and eBay still won’t let it go through. I am trying to communicate about a payment. I’m not saying anything wrong or trying to sell anything without it going through eBay and paying their exorbitant prices. This happens a lot and it’s frustrating. I don’t have the time to sit here and keep trying to send messages eBay needs to fix the app.",1
1960,"Love Selling On eBay!: I love to see items that still have life left in them be able to be used by someone that can use them. eBay makes this process extremely easy.  I started selling on eBay about three years ago, I believe, and the whole experience has been wonderful.  From listening, to selling, to shipping it’s made super easy for the novice seller and the transactions couldn’t be any smoother!",5
1961,"Great platform for scammers!: I’ve been selling with eBay for 7 years and I’ve finally had it with this company. They allow scammers to run the show. I had a buyer purchase a $100 game and then file a false return by sending me an empty box. Then eBay sides with the scammer buyer and refund the money at my expense. No one at eBay will listen and I can’t get their attention. Maybe this will been seen by the right person at eBay. Pathetic business model seeing that they charge you 12% to sell from each item, plus a base fee, and make your items invisible unless you promote items for 4% or more. Then just to get stuck sending buyers free stuff.",1
1962,Good people: For the most part the people on eBay are good honest sales persons. Every issue I’ve had has been resolved by replacement or refund. The eBay staff assisted in one refund where I was still waiting on product a year later but I really wanted the product mote than a refund and was willing to wait. Eventually the seller stopped responding and eBay stepped in for a full refund. So how can I complain. Thanks for a fairly safe store.,5
1963,Best site for purchasing: eBay has always delivered on items that are hard to find in sites. Customer service is top notch and they are more than fair when it comes to handling disputes. Paying for products with PayPal is another benefit that they offer. When you buy through PayPal they also back you up because they have a secondary account to verify your purchases. I just really love eBay.,5
1964,"Jewelry Authentication is killing our eBay sales: We should be able to opt out of the authentication program if we offer returns. GIA is failing some of my items due to clarity (which is an opinion) and carat weight (which is also an opinion because they are not weighing all the diamonds in the jewelry). This is hurting our EBay sales. And the buyers have emailed me and tried to buy the item outside of EBay because they still want the item. How much money is eBay losing due to this, and shipping costs that eBay is paying. We OFFER RETURNS. The buyer can take it to their own jeweler and have it authenticated if they want. I am a GIA Graduate Gemologist. My opinion is just as valid as a worker at GIA.",1
1965,"Where’s the Buy Now or Add to cart button?: Since the update,the Buy now and Add to cart buttons are not visible on the app. I have been using this app for almost 7 years and never have had problems purchasing or buying from this app until now. Have a lot of items saved but can’t add them to the cart because there’s no button for this feature! Correct the update  🤨🙁",5
1966,Inpressive: Website navigation is very user friendly! Purchases easily made. If needed refund handling is exceptional. New to eBay with this activity of purchases. Rating of 100% on two sellers I’ve purchased from is 100% accurate in my opinion. A seller I worked with rated 98% was beyond that from me. Will continue to use eBay for specific hard to find antique items for family gifts. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️(my rating of eBay),5
1967,"Fees are a Rip off: eBay has become your forced business partner and not your business enabler. Their profit sharing fee structure is outrageous !!! 12-15% on the total sale including the shipping price ?!?!? WTH??? They are out to gouge us all. Signs of a struggling business model. I understand that many sellers are huge businesses but there are many like me who are occasional sellers like the good old days when eBay started. I purchased a lot of eBay shares a long time ago believing in their business model. I just sold them today after experiencing how it is to be a seller. Between holding my money hostage, fees, rigid communication protocols with buyers etc eBay has lost its original identity.",1
1968,App: This new app is so hard to figure out finding help is almost impossible and to try and get a call back from eBay bc if you chat online they will end a message bc they are impatient when sending a message so it’s so hard to contact them took me almost 3 days to figure it out I had to ask some one on Facebook for help when before it was so much easier this new version isn’t that great this is probably why customer go else were they want better customer service than they have now it’s hard to file a complaint on a seller and don’t even give you and feedback on it basically just sweep under the rug,1
1969,"Really upset about a recent bid I tried to win: There was a bid for an action figure that I wanted and realized there was around 30 seconds left for the bid so I raised the price from $0.99 to $2 and then it told me someone bid $2.25 so I tried to raise it by $4 but by the time I did that the bid had ended. When I looked at the bid history it said that the person who had bid $2.25 did that 5 DAYS BEFORE and even though I just saw the figure that day, it showed it at $0.99 and one bid, when I looked at the bid history there was me and one other person less than a minute apart from each other and the person from 5 days ago 

So instead of getting the figure for $14 the next cheapest option is $30 

Al because the bid price didn’t update 

But besides all of that (sorry, I really just needed to say it to get it off my mind) it’s actual a really cool app and is great at what it does",3
1970,"Can’t use because it requires IOS 14: I have an old phone and it’s actually glitched to the point where I can’t even update the IOS Im stuck on IOS 12 and EBay has dropped support for my os version effectively making the eBay app useless. On safari, eBay also doesn’t work as the buy it now button doesn’t do anything and adding an item to my cart says “{""success"":""false"",""message"":""Session has expired - Please click here and add to cart again.""}”.

If you “click here” it brings you to a page that says they searched everywhere and cannot find the item. It doesn’t matter what the item is it can be literally anything.",1
1971,"My shopping head quarters: I love shopping at eBay because I can get most anything I want there. Most often the price is right. EBay notifies me of any attempt at fraud on my account. This happens once and it was caught my eBay because they noticed I always pay with PayPal. On this purchase someone was trying to pay direct with eBay. I have been a customer for many years, and I never have to leave the house.",5
1972,Do not use eBay: Do not use this app to sell. You’ve been warned. A person bid on 12 auctions of mine for 1300... They didn’t pay and they let them keep their account (after I turned in EACH auction ) and bid on my auctions AGAIN and not pay AGAIN. So I’ve been held up over a month now. This is a true story. If you sell people can buy all your items and not pay and then you have to wait to give them a chance to pay so it ties your money up. YOUVE BEEN WARNED. plus they recently sided with a buyer and I had no returns on my action. So if you like selling things and never getting money for them. Use eBay. I recommend a different app to anyone who is honest.,1
1973,"Comfortable doing business.: I’ve made many purchases via eBay. Never a problem with some purchases from overseas and totaling thousands of dollars. 

I do check the sellers ratings before buying to minimize any problems. Buying thru eBay you do find some  great deals and also products that come from outside the US that may not be available locally. We picked up some glass tube wall sconces from India that are very unique. Do you homework and feel free to purchase.",5
1974,"Kinda Needy: After being asked to write a review about this app somewhere in the neighborhood of 500,000,000 times I’ve come to the conclusion that you’re coming across a little “needy.” I’ve rated you before and you’ve asked for reviews before. Are you really so insecure you have to keep asking? Seriously, you’re just as good as every other app and you should be proud of yourself. Please get a life coach and stop insisting on affirmation.",5
1975,"Unable to get a refund: eBay is a great way to sell and buy merchandise, for such a reasonable fee you can reach the entire country and other countries as well.
I do have a gripe because I was unable to get a refund because EBay wouldn’t let me print a return form outside of PayPal, consequently I returned my order on the USPS website and had to pay double the original postage fee. I still haven’t received my refund and I’m not able to contact eBay about this issue. Not good",5
1976,Im having a little trouble deleting my saved for later items.: Every time I remove some from the saved for later list the page always refreshes itself and brings me back to the top and then I have to keep scrolling back down every time to remove another item and it gets a little annoying sometimes. I hope this problem can be fixed.,5
1977,"Buying is great, selling is a pain: Being a buyer on eBay you can find alot of gently used items at discount prices with buyer friendly eBay policies. However, eBay is NOT seller friendly and has little protections in order to protect sellers from liars or crooks and further more, eBays fees on top of payment accepting fees from PayPal and shipping costs really make eBay a poor deal for someone trying to get a return on their goods. Especially if the item is large and expensive to ship to some far away land. Overall 3 stars. 5 stars for buyers, 2 stars for sellers so 3.5 stars would actually be more appropriate.",3
1978,"Scams happen: I have years of experience and I’ll tell you it’s 50/50. Ebay has it’s pluses and minuses. I have both made thousands of dollars off of eBay and also lost thousands due to fees, goods damaged by eBay, scams among other things. I can tell you right now that it can be a handful to deal with but you’ll make more money off the items you sell there then you would on craigslist or at a consignment store. Within the past month eBay has refused to follow thru on providing me a refund after I was scammed, had inaccessible customer service and destroyed a historic mint condition art print.",3
1979,"TERRIBLE for Sellers: eBay will ALWAYS side with the Buyers which means Sellers will always lose their money thanks to eBays 100% Satisfaction Policy. Even if Sellers provide proof that their Buyers are lying eBay doesn’t care and will side with the Buyers. It’s like they never even read the case reports. To top it off, Sellers can NEVER leave any negative feedback for Buyers but Buyers can leave negative feedback (even if it’s not true) for the Sellers. Enjoy losing your money/products on eBay Sellers!",5
1980,"Paid a sellers fee on a refund: A few months back I sold an item for roughly 870$ ish.  The dude who bought the item DAMAGED my item and claimed he got the item that way.  Clearly he did it with a push pin.  I’ve been on EBay since the early 2000’s and never had a negative feedback, thanks for having my back.  So whatever, next time I’ll take photos of every single millimeter of an item..  the big issue is I was still charged the 10% fee.  80$ bucks or so..",5
1981,"Misleading and greedy: I lost my job because of disability and sold a bunch of electronics for cash I desperately needed. I was aware going in that there was a 10% final value fee, but I wasn’t aware of the massive transaction fees with ebay and paypal to get you the money along with tax. When I received payment for my items I had about 10% already deducted, so I thought this was the seller fees. I used all the money I got on things I needed and then a month later I get slapped with a $60 ebay bill for seller fees when I don’t have any money to pay it because I used it all thinking I had already paid it. Ebay has become a greedy company that takes massive cuts hidden in print so fine nobody can read it.",1
1982,"BEWARE!!!!!: I had used eBay for years both as a buyer and a seller with hundreds of high ratings and no negatives.  I recently decided to go back to selling some items and my account was hacked.  I found the person who hacked it and eBay will do NOTHING about it!  

Their advice was simply to open a new account. Thus, my ratings would have to start all over again.

This is extremely troubling for both buyers and sellers, so everyone should take notice.

This means anyone that has worked hard to build a reputation over many years could have it taken away in an instant and have to start all over again.  

In addition, the purpose of having multiple high ratings is to give buyers and sellers confidence, along with trust which is meaningless if someone can simply hijack someone else’s ratings and take credit for what someone else had earned. 

I will no longer be using eBay and until they can change their policy I would encourage others to do the same.  

If you want to take a gamble and utilize eBay, do so at your own risk!",1
1983,"An exceptional online retailer: For as long as I’ve been an eBay member, all the way back to January 2001, I’ve always had an amicable relationship with the eBay website both as a buyer and most often as a seller. The user-friendliness with regard to creating my auction listings, despite changes to the template here and there over the years, has nonetheless remained intact when it comes to selling my items. I thank you ever so much, eBay indigenes!",5

The site has the entire world at your fingertips so fear not, place that bid and beware of the last second snipers!!

From shopping to selling some things you don’t need, eBay has your back. Till then. bigtomscience",5
1985,"Still needs mega improvement: I have gotten used to this app which I hated as an update to the previous incarnation, WHICH WAS PERFECT, but it is still lacking all of the previous app's fabulous features ... 

1. Any kind of flag to show that you have already consulted an item or are already watching it  (the previous app did this with a nifty turned down corner or a banner) 
2. Seeing all of your searches visually in a grid instead of a written list, how annoying and time wasting.  
3. The ability to see everything you are watching in a grid with the categories above instead of the total waste of space with the categories on the side.  
4.  How about a dark theme?  

Believe me I would be more active on ebay and buy more if any of these were implemented, and I can't be alone in this!",5
1986,"Horrible: Came back to ebay after several yrs of non use because of getting ripped off buying or selling, with no protection either way, first 2 recent transaction I did were a scam, and I really did a lot of work picking a seller with a good rating that had what I needed, but here we are two weeks later, items paid for, delivery dates have come and gone, no contact from one seller, ebay does nothing, second seller conveniently out of the country at the moment and not able to ship item, ebay does nothing......???    Give it a year maybe two...ebay will be gone and another superior company will appear and be much closer to amazons policies but do what ebay does,.... and all will prosper.....",1
1987,Overall great application: I enjoy the application but there is one thing that bothers me a great deal. I am unable to set the parameters of my search and then type in a key word to help narrow it down. As soon as you type anything in the search bar it searches the whole site without the previously selected criteria. So if I am looking for an antique and click on the section. I then click sculptures and want to only see jade sculptures. I can not type in jade in the search bar without loosing the search in antique and sculptures.,4
1988,"Very handy, but doesn’t save description when listing.: I love the app.  So handy, I don’t need a computer to list items.  Just beware if listing a long carefully written out description that you save it first.  I spent several minutes describing an item, only to have it all disappear when I closed the app.  Upon reopening my draft (a nice feature), the description had defaulted back to a copy of the title.  My work was lost. ☹️",5
1989,What a mess?: eBay has not evolved their product for years. They allow scammers to participate in the auction because they are afraid of losing accounts. They rather have millions of fake accounts than thousands of clean and well intended customers. There are so many flaws in this service that I am not surprised that people don’t want to use it. One example of the many flaws: I purchased an item with a guaranteed delivery in 3 days. 4 days after my delivery due date the system is still displaying that the item is within the guaranteed delivery date. One week later and after refusing to accept delivery I still don’t have my refund. Fortunately my credit card company stepped in to help. What a farce!,1
1990,"Shipping Assistance: I bought some dishes from an elderly man in Florida. He is in assisted living. The terms were pick up only. So after I found out they were so far away from Houston, I would just have them shipped. Well, the packing & shipping would be over $600. Is there any discount for eBay or is there any suggestion to help me. I want the dishes & the gentleman said he would keep them for me but would like them picked up by Christmas. Kind regards, Patsy Perry.",5
1991,"I expect better from E-bay!!!: My issue with this app is that you can't clear the cart!!! If you find a better deal on the same item...you're stuck looking at it; in your cart! With notifications!!! 
   You have to call e-bay and you don't know how to categorize the call for help! It's a mess! And while Speaking to Lori she says ""have you tried accessing E-bay through Google Chrome? You won't have this issue""! UNACCEPTABLE!!! Fix the error so I can shop...through the convenience of the app!!! 
   Just beware adding items to your cart!!!",4
1992,"Horrible search Experience with new update: I love the new app update. Although, the biggest complaint that I have is that when you search you accidentally drag pictures. I understand the reasoning for doing this. It allows you to search for a similar product by image.  It’s very distracting. I tend to lose my train of thought and I stop searching. It’s a great idea, but very annoying. I think sellers will lose sells, because of this feature.",5
1993,"Communication has improved but......: In the past I have found that communicating with eBay directly has been difficult. In the last year it seems to have improved specifically with questions concerning web issues.
I would like to see them continue to improve the web as I feel it is extremely ambiguous work with.
A Chat room for questions and answers would be a marked improvement. 
Thanks",5
1994,"A++ app for collectors: I buy a bunch of stuff that needs verification to have value. Any other site I always sit nervous waiting for my package hoping it’ll not be a knock off. But I never feel that way when buying with Ebay. 100 percent verification guaranteed or you get a refund. That makes buying autographs, shoes, memorabilia, and clothes a lot less of a hassle!! Didn’t think Ebay would be any different but it’s by far the best IMO.",5
1995,"Photos freeze app! Needs to be uninstalled to unfreeze!: Well, now it has been a year, and on ANY iPad I have tried, it needs to be uninstalled and then reinstalled at least once a month. The photos freeze and will remain that way until the app is uninstalled. So, evidently, nobody really cares. Pity. It used to be great until an ""upgrade"" over a year ago. Then it started crashing and freezing. It no longer crashes, but it freezes when I attempt to look more closely at the photos of a listing. Thank God for the eBay standard website, which I often have to use when the app freezes. This is REALLY tiresome. I cannot recommend this app. If I could give it no stars at all, I would.",1
1996,"Image Search Needs Work: Great app! I usually use this app to track prices of collectibles and tchotchkies that I've saved over the years. One thing that I have seen is that the camera search feature needs improvement. It always gives me results worse than when I only search the name of my item(s). I would also like to be able to see a preview of my photo before searching for obvious reasons. Other than that, great app! - Anonymous",4
1997,"Sellers AVOID AT ALL COSTS: Fees are astronomically high. As a new seller if you sell any high value item they will lock your account. After you submit EVERYTHING they ask of you to establish yourself as a “high value item seller”, they will unlock your account only to lock it again once you try to submit a payout to your bank. This new lock on payouts is a 30 day hold. My items were delivered to the buyers 27 days ago and I’m still unable to access a single dollar from the $1,000 worth of items I have sold. They will allow people to bid on auctions and when the auction ends if they do not pay, eBay does absolutely nothing to the person.",1
1998,"App won’t load.: For the last two weeks, the app will not fully open and load on my iPhone. When I launch it, it begins to load, but never picexelates and the screen remains unloaded. What’s going on here?

Then, I received an answer, from my iPhone, a message of which I am to pass onto the app developer: the EBay app doesn’t comply with Google’s secure browser protocols and has been cited with an authorization error. Whatever has to be done, should be done so expeditiously.",4
1999,"FIX ALGORITHM: FIX. YOUR. ALGORITHM. In order to have your item that’s being sold to even be VIEWED you need to pay extra for the promotion. It’s absolutely ridiculous that you guys have changed the algorithm in order to get more money from us sellers. It used to be so much easier to get more views and sales without the transaction of promotions. A strong 2 stars because it is great to buy from, but selling is a nightmare. Places like Facebook Marketplace have it correct with your listing going to the top from most recent rather than a random drop in a strong list of competitors that pay to promote. 

FIX. THIS.",2
2000,"Why?: They did it again.  The app now erases everything when you start a new ‘Leave Feedback’, making it a real pain.  They did this once before, then reversed it because I’m sure they realized feedback decreased.  Well, guess what!  I’m not leaving any more feedback until they correct this error.  It’s a shame to punish buyers and sellers for eBay’s lack of thought when designing the app….but that’s what they did!",5
2001,People who don’t pay when they win: People are allowed to buy things and not pay for them with no consequences. I am unable to leave negative feedback and have no recourse when people don’t pay for an item that they purchase. This is wrong Ebay you need to do something about people like this that bring down the entire reputation of the organization,5
2002,Change: I don’t know what can be done but y’all gotta do something because I stopped using along time ago because I got robbed and there is no compensation for user like if it went missing ig that just what happens no how about help ppl get something back like it was trade of goods and I basically just got took for both parts I know it isn’t eBay’s fault but delivering not on a set day user have been told Is eBay’s fault earlier is not always convenient for ppl but yet I’ve order much from u guys and only got like 1 things years ago,3
2003,Nothing but Issues: I had an eBay account for about a month before they permanently banned my account. I used the app the sell things for my reselling business. All clothes and shoes. I sent a legitimate pair of Yeezys to them for authentication and they deemed them as unauthentic because they were missing a tag and box. Apparently they are have negative brain cells because the next day I got a notice saying my account is suspended and I needed to contact them to get my account back and running. I did that and they told me my account was permanently suspended and it was a permanent decision. eBay needs to do better. All I got was trouble and my time wasted with this platform.,1

Hundreds of good deals i had on ebay but this one burned me bad. Shame on you ebay for letting this happen. Where i live we don't do sketchy stuff like this. Ill probably still use ebay but let it be known they dont protect you from fraudulent low class people, so really be careful who you buy from.",5
2005,Selling on eBay: I used to use eBay to sell my odd and ends but every year the selling fees just kept getting higher and higher now the fees are absolutely ridiculous. It used to be fun winning bids and selling finding good deals but nowadays they have taken the fun out of it I mean how many millions do they have to make off the site I rarely sell or buy anymore to to those issues so for that my review is negative sorry eBay,5
2006,"Stop Forced Updates: I’m fairly certain a Forced Update is validation of a individuals wages/salary because No One Needs an Update that will force you to spend in the case of Apple thousands of dollars upgrading hardware to accommodate your software update that no one needs in the first place.

Get a Clue eBay and Knock It Off.",4
2007,"Regarding ""Best Offers"": When a potential buyer makes an offer in a product and the seller sends a counter offer, there's needs to be a way to still revise the product(s) without having to wait for 48 hours. Ebay shouldn't ""lock/put on hold"" your product(s) just because the seller sends a counter offer. The seller should still be able to make any changes (revise) his/her product(s). Most of those potential buyers the make offers, the seller never hears back from them, yet the seller product(s) are locked - can't revise the product(s) for 48 hours. That's stupid...just saying.",2
2008,"Annoying pop ups as a seller: If you’re selling items on eBay, avoid editing or listing through the app.  It has pop ups asking me to use easy pricing any time you touch a listing. 

(For those of you who don’t know what easy pricing is, it automatically lowers the prices of your items periodically and without your permission. )

They don’t give you an option to say, ‘no’ or even, ‘don’t remind me again’ instead the only option is, “Maybe next time.”  

How about ‘Maybe Never in a Million Years’??? 

300 listings later and I’m still wasting time clicking “maybe next time” after every listing. 

Also not to mention the annoying suggestions that an item might not sell and telling you to lower the price.  Which by the way, I’ve raised the price instead on these listings and they’ve sold. 

There’s more, much more, however, since I have to spend my time tiptoeing around the minefields they’ve created in this app, I don’t have much more time to go into detail.",1
2009,"Dressmaker patterns: I learned that my obsession of buying patterns and collecting them have more of a value these days. It’s a bit daunting looking at  lots, but there is a speed into browsing on the internet. Those patterns, even used have a value. I’m tired of scrappy paper tote bags, and decided to sew nice ones that are washable and sturdy. The same holds true when shopping for clothes to get quality made. I have discovered a new money maker too!",5
2010,"Fast: One word explains it, when you need it, you get it, FAST only negative is try to order. It’s probably fine with young people who know how to use a computer but for us old guys it’s a nightmare. Come on eBay make it easier for the old guys like MidwayUSA. Take some lessons, you will profit by how MidwayUSA is doing there no hassle checkout. If you got a cc in good standing there should be no reason to complicate things. Just saying.
But if you need it fast and generally with no freight eBay is da bomb. Lol",5
2011,"Great app, great products. Some sellers ruin it though.: 90% of your experiences with eBay will be safe and secure, quick and easy. But there is the occasional seller who refuses to respond to you or ship your item. In that case, eBay always has you covered and refunds you (for probable reasoning). I’ve been using eBay for probably 3-4 years now and it’s my preference over other sights, I’ve only had an issue with a seller maybe 2 or 3 times but it’s frustrating enough that I can’t give a 5 star review.

I only wish I could give zero stars.

Too many failures and eBay doesn't care. No matter how many times you call and complain they have no intentions of changing back to the old workable app. That's why I'm sure they noticed I don't sell on eBay anymore. It's why I rare buy on eBay any more because if they're prickish enough to blow off my reviews and not listen to me as a person then I guess they don't need a little guy like me.",1

I then had to go through my credit card to finally get resolution, because I had so little confidence in PayPal and eBay to sort it out correctly. eBay is in theory a great platform to sell and buy from. The problem is there are so many scams and unethical sellers. If you have any reservations, just use next door or Craigslist instead of eBay.",1

Witch future let me know the real eBay can not and won’t protect you. I’ve been calling and calling eBay . You can’t reach a real person. Smdh this whole site needs to go and I’m going to find a way to make sure this happens to nobody else.

It has inadvertently routed items to my old address (one I hadn’t used in 4 years- & I never got EBay to say they were responsible for it), deleting shopping cart items takes 2-3 tries, it many times says I need to pay for 1-2 items when I’ve already paid- & I’m one of their best customers. I do use it- but I hate it. And it never, ever, gets updated. Makes me think there’s no God-",5

While scrolling through items for sale, the app thinks I want to copy each image and search by it. It’s new search by image feature is WAY to sensitive and unneeded. Just by scrolling ALWAYS takes me off my desired page and sends me to a unintended “searched by image” page. This search by image feature needs to go or AT THE LEAST be able to be disabled by the user so we can actually shop.

Those of whom I’ve bought from are so motivated to keep a 5 star rating that they truly bend over backwards to help solve any problems you may encounter.

PLEASE STOP AUTOMATICALLY SETTING RIDICULOUSLY LOW BIN SETTINGS ON MY LISTINGS WITHOUT SELLERS APPROVAL!!! Some items take a little longer to sell than others and I understand the logic but if I set something with no offers, I do it for a reason. Lastly, make it easier to send messages. It’s way too difficult to communicate with buyers and sellers on the app. Please fix these issues.",2
2022,Worse customer service ever: Ebay buy protection is a joke. I was told buy 3 employees including a supervisor different information.  It took me a month to receive a refund for my money for a defective part and they were on the sellers side for the entire process. Also you can’t speak to someone in the US. All calls are routed to some other Arab speaking country so when they say I will transfer you to a supervisor you really have no idea who you speaking with.,5

2025,Poor Customer Service options. – Accessibility.: Customer Service is very dysfunctional and not user-friendly one bit! Especially for a disabled person that needs Accessibility items and actually needs to talk to somebody to correct or assist the site. I have made purchases from several years ago and I no longer have the history assessable to me. This goes beyond the three years that shows. I don’t shop much on eBay anymore due to the fact of the poor service. And the difficulty trying to do a re-order on something from the past.,2
2026,Buying and selling is easy: I love to buy and sell on eBay. As a seller it’s the most affordable way to have access to millions of customers instantly. The format is streamlined and easy to work with. eBay set the bar for other selling/auction sites. As a buyer I can find just about anything here. Just type in the description in the search box and WAL’LA!!! All items come up. I truly couldn’t asked for a better app.,5

I’ve tried to express that without success. But now I get a chance for my review. Is that intuitive response or coincidence?

2029,":/: I like how there are a lot of options on here, especially the vintage stuff. The thing I don’t like about this app is that it is very outdated; when I find something on google from ebay and then search that exact item into the search it is nowhere to be found. Also sometimes ebay just likes being wonky and I would search something and no results show up at all even though my search was very vague and there were no filters on. I really wish that ebay showed the date of the listings posted and when the seller was last active.",2
2030,"Reputable: I’ve been an eBay customer since 2019, purchased thousands of items. They are a fantastic company that’s stands behind their guarantees. Purchased my 3rd car from their platform just this weekend, seamless. When I did have an issue with a seller some time back, they took care of it for me. Don’t hesitate if you are on the fence, I was too at first, but they have controls in place to ensure a pleasant experience.",5
2031,"Best app to shop and sell on: I would like to say that eBay has been the easiest app for my to use. Customer support is the best, they respond quickly to your questions and concerns. Selling on the app is so easy to do and easy to see if anyone purchases your products. Shipping is the easiest to do, you can charge for shipping or not, I recommend free shipping it gets more people interested in your product.
Thank you,

2032,"Can't Filter Out Nor Report Asian Scammers: EBay won't let you limit you report asian scammers selling multiple items with the same photos. I was shopping for a bass guitar and there were 5 listings of the same bass using the same photo for each one. EBay won't let you report them, or least they don't make it easy on a tablet or phone. And I want the ability to set eBay to ONLY show Continental US listings with a GLOBAL setting. I don't want to see them AT ALL. The only way to avoid it is to set it in your saved searches, which is a waste of my time. EBay doesn't want to do anything to filter out scammers. They just want to collect their listing fees.",1
2033,"Sketchy sellers: After being ripped off by a few sellers I left eBay not willing to use the platform for a while. I came back hoping that things were clear it up only to experience issues on a recent transaction making me feel like things aren’t completely resolved with eBay. There still are sellers who portray themselves with 100% positive feedback so you buy from them only to get a negative experience from them and you’re right back to those horrible days you experienced, and you don’t want to use the platform anymore. Thanks a lot eBay!",2
2034,A great way for a single mom to make money: I love. eBay I do not like they fact that no seller support is available to me. I love the business model.  I hope to go far on the app. I am just praying for seller support in situations that require it. I always take care of my customers. They are so appreciated. I am disabled and have a hard time walking. So this gives me the ability to earn money while taking care of a teenager.,5
2035,"Selling on eBay: If you are interested in selling I would simply say don’t, since their partnership ended with PayPal getting payed has been impossible, eBay currently holds a few hundred dollars of my sales and will not release them to me. I have called multiple times with people who have assured me the problem has been solved without any resolution. Their call center has furthermore been completely un helpful. This has been going on for months now, they even recommended I open a new checking account, which I did, and they still could not confirm it. At this point I just want my money and to take my business to any other site.",1
2036,"Who needs FB when you have EBay!?: I did away with my FB account a few months back. It was just sucking up too much of my time. Funny thing is… I find myself enjoying simply browsing on eBay. Either my saved sellers or searches or recommendations from the feed. I mean, at least there is pay off at the end of a browse. I save items, purchase, return if need be. It’s a win win situation in my eyes :)",5
2037,Functional -easy to learn: I like the app better than the desktop version for functionality. It’s easy to navigate and accomplish tasks that are confusing with all the options present on the computer. Only complaint is not being able to re arrange pictures and after the update I had to go reconfigure my shipping preferences on desktop. It’s quite easy to use.,5
2038,"NUMBER OF LISTINGS: For the new update, EBay has taken off the function to see how many NEW and USED items of listings there are. This makes it WAY more difficult for sellers! Why would they do this???? Now when you look up an item that you are thinking about selling and you go to the “condition” option under filters, it just says “New” and “Used,” WITHOUT showing the number for each like it used to. This needs to be put BACK ON. This makes selling WAY more difficult. Come on seriously. Help us out here. I cannot figure out why they would take that off. This kind of stuff makes people not want to update the app.",1
2039,"EBAy is a Scam don’t buy from them: I bought an item that unbeknownst to me was returned by the post office without informing me( thanks Lou’s DeJoy for ruining the post office) I contacted seller and did not hear anything for 3 weeks but after a month eVay said it was too late for them
To help me even tho they knew the seller had the item AND my money. I spoke to 10 different lying customer service people and eBay would not help me. Despite decades as a loyal member and tens of thousands of dollars spent. If you have an unethical seller scam you don’t expect any help from eBay they too are scammers. I am closing my account don’t do business with eBay you will be sorry. They don’t help buyers!!!",1
2040,Ease of transaction is great: We love eBay. If we had to buy the software for all it does and the bookkeeping system and the shopping cart it would be in the high thousands.  We would never be able to afford the advertising budget that allows us to reach millions. I do custom holsters and belts and would like to be able to talk directly with customer by phone rather than text but I understand.  EBay rocks!,5
2041,"What a Great app: Ebay changed the way we make our purchases. It has opened the world to us and it’s easy to buy and sell.  I really like how fast it brings to you the products your searching for and it doesn’t seem just to favor the sponsors.  While you will see a sponsor sell what your looking for which I like, that’s a good thing because it keeps people honest when pricing their product.",5
2042,"Hard searching for things: I used to like ebay well that change. With more & more thrift, reuse, second hand stores online, ebay needs to fix the app to an easy way to search for things unless you know exactly brand, model, color etc. Maybe somebody in the company have to use other apps like Mercari & Poshmark to mention two of the omes I use. Ebay people need an easy way to shop ! Thank you",5
2043,"EBay is a scary place to shop anymore.: Too many vendors who are not in USA, cheaper merchandise and very slow shipping. Sell to USA use USA SIZE CHARTS!! Then all the scalpers and scammers who have worded their ads strategically to hide that the sale is a piece of paper and not the real merchandise. Very evil taking advantage of parents trying to get the one thing all of their kids want for Christmas. Using Bots to get every piece and marking it up 200%.  Then stealing buyers money with a picture.",5
2044,Be careful !!!!: Make sure you have a legit item within a month. If it’s a fake and the seller was able to fake you out for 30 days they are now protected by eBay. You will no longer get any refund and eBay won’t do nothing for you either. So be aware of ebays 30 day policy. It protects the buyer for 30 days but protects the scammer after the 30 days is up. Save the headache and buy from anywhere else but on eBay,5
2045,"Selecting Photos broken on new update.: I recently received the latest eBay update on my phone and now I am not able to select the correct photos I specify whether I am trying to sell an item or contact a seller about a picture. I have problems attaching the photo, instead of it choosing the photo I specified, it uses something very old from my camera roll. 

I am on an iPhone X on iOS 12.4.",5
2046,Helps pay the bills: I started selling on eBay over 15 years ago. It helped me get my wife through college when we needed it and when we just needed a little extra coin for diapers for our son. I really don’t know what I would have done in those early years of my life without the help of this selling platform. Many thanks eBay from the Jones’ and to many more years of fruitfulness to both.,5
2047,"eBay: As an online shopper they are one of the best sites for finding everything you need, I’ve never had an issue with a seller that was not quickly resolved (after I learned to NOT give feedback till item received and any issues resolved). 
As a seller, it’s perfect in that you can choose wether you want the item sold in the us only or world. Not to mention their policy for sellers, protects everyone.",5
2048,Transactions won’t go through: I just started using the app after purchasing a few items. I liked everything they showed on this app and have been trying to purchase  more items but the transactions won’t go through. I’ve entered the correct information on my card multiple times and every time I check out it says there’s an error. I’ve erased my info and reentered it and still won’t go through. I’ve updated the app and deleted and that also didn’t work. It just frustrated me so I deleted and looked somewhere else. I’ve also reached out to customer service and didn’t get back to me. Until this app is fixed I’m done with eBay. Sad to say,1
2049,"Top Notch: I’ve been a buyer on EBay for many years and it is my go-to site for great deals and a smooth buying experience. I love the eBay app and am so grateful for all the money I have saved over the years from many great eBay sellers. The management team at eBay has always done a great job with the website and resolving any problems (which have been very few for me). If you need ANYTHING, check eBay FIRST and save a bundle!",5
2050,"I won the bid on items sold out!: It happened to me twice. I won the bids and paid for the items right away, just to be notified item had been sold out.
I got the money back the first time. 2nd time, the case is still pending! 
My issue is, if you win a bid and dont pay, they will make it difficult for you to shop. Which is correct.
What is wrong is, if seller states item is sold off upon winning the bid, no action against him! WASTE OF TIME..",5
2051,"Image search is horrible...give use the option to disable.: Image search accidentally activate every time i scroll thought 100 or more items.  I would never want this feature, but 100% of the time it has accidentally enabled, it searches for something completely unrelated.  At least allow me to cancel and continue where I was.  Its junk and unwanted. I would never want to search based on an image.",5
2052,"Limited functionality: First, the limited functions in comparison to ebay online are annoying. Secondly, when I’m listing items on the app now, I have to open a listing with the quick listing pop up and then close that out and then reopen the listing with the full app listing features. This is a waste of time. I don’t ever want that quick list popup. It just gets in the way. You didn’t used to have that popup in the way.",5
2053,"Good app, missing select & delete button in cart: It’d be less time consuming to have a select option in the cart, so when you have too many things in the cart, but you only want to buy two at the moment (the other things you may want to add to your watchlist so you don’t forget them) you’ll be ready and set for even the busiest of days and sales. 
 
Please add these: 
• A Select/Edit button in cart on the left hand corner, where your able to select which ones you would like to buy at  the time out of all the stuff in your cart (can get cluttered overtime).
• A Delete button in cart on the right hand corner, to select which ones they can remove from both the original shopping cart & save laters.

This would likely impact things in a good direction as it’s also very convenient and helpful for both parties.",4
2054,"China: I’ve have learned the hard way that when buying dresses or skirts from China, you are gambling with your money. You’ll spend $11 but then you receive whatever you purchased, you may have waited maybe a month or two, and it’s not going to look or even come close to looking like what you bought. Then you get ahold of the company and they offer you the magic words “please don’t leave a bad review, how about we give you a $3 dollar refund?” Don’t fall for it people. Buy from reputable shops. Not shops that bait and switch, because exactly what they are doing!",3
2055,"NEW UPDATE GARBAGE....CHANGED MY MIND!: My first review on new update is below.....but after complaining to eBay, I received an email telling me that the counter for new 
Items is now at the bottom in the middle of the screen...not as convenient, but at least it is there. They also fixed a huge sorting problem, so I’m going to have to change my opinion from 1 star to 5. Thank you, eBay!!!

The last several updates have been chipping away at my eBay experience. This last one takes the cake!

Now, when I pull up a saved search, there is no “number of items” on the upper left hand side. Therefore, I have no idea if I’m looking at NEW TO ME items or ALL items.....which could be a difference of thousands of items, depending on what my saved search is.

Hope they are reading.........",5
2056,eBay please fix your app: I will like it much better when they fix it. What they did to the past purchases on iPhone where I no longer can hide previous purchases from month/years ago is just wrong.  The user should have control over this. Same as they do on the pc based version.  And they seem to be in no hurry to correct their mistake. Please just fix it.,5
2057,"Easy to  use: Reliable, user friendly + 1 stop shop. My only constructive criticism would be based on the “sellers section” needs a bit of improvement, provide more options when listing a product through the app, provide more “ad description features”bring back turbo lister in an app form. I find my self starting a new listing ad on the app only to have to pause everything and finish off on a desktop or laptop.",5
2058,"frustrated with lack of function and lack of “classic site” mobility: On a very basic level, particularly for buying, the app is great. Most functions work fine. As a seller, however, the inability to use all of the seller functions and/or switch to the classic site and make it stay are maddening. Why can’t I reprint labels? Why does the label page disappear if I move to another app on my phone then come back? Why is the layout so different than all of the formats I’ve been using for 20+ years on my laptop?",4
2059,"Buyer allowed to keep my money after item never received and went back to seller: The tracking showed item never received and seller got the item back in mail but Ebay let them keep my money and their product. I did not send back!
I tried to buy another game for my son and Ebay closed listing after I paid and now I’m out a second time for the same game. I should have bought at store. Would have been cheaper than getting ripped off twice from Ebay. 

Checked sellers feedback and a couple of days after this happen to me... it happen to another person. I let Ebay know but nothing done a second time. They love people that do others wrong.  I can’t even open case on the money I lost from the item they closed. What the heck!

I don’t trust them any more.",5
2060,"Bad app. The old one was much better.: The title say all. This is a very bad app. The old one ( that one is no longer available and removed ) was stable, easy to use, always there.
This new one is available only HALF OF THE TIME I try to use it. The navigation is terrible. The ended items in my saved list are completely out of order. I have an idea.......bring back the old one......Thanks.
Steel crushing almost every time I try to use the app. What a piece of junk.",5
2061,I love it: I love this app. It has saved me a lot of money and not only that but also saved me from getting $1500 scammed from me. So I’m still fighting the situation but only cuz eBay saved me by making sure they didn’t get away with it and they even helped me figure out how to use the app and always fast on responding. BUT how can I get the classic mode on my app so I can reply straight to messages instead of having to go through the website every time?,5
2062,"Great Platform: I’ve been a registered user for almost 20 years and eBay has made leaps and bounds in that time. Listing items is a snap and you can find so many unique and unusual things which are unavailable anywhere else in the world. It’s a fantastic resource to sell and buy cool stuff. A suggestion to update the app would be to make collections available because there is a cap of 198 items you can watch at a time. Other than that, eBay is awesome! Great work guys!",4
2063,"Not so impressed ...: Do not find this app as user friendly as prior app.
Have trouble scanning in tracking numbers, have had to enter manually. Prior app scanned immediately. do not like view of ads, prefer gallery view. 60 day total -sales tab - should be on a pop up for privacy. When posting items for sale- app does not disclose fees during preview or listing item. Not so impressed with this version, it's actually quite horrible , NOT AN IMPROVEMENT.",5
2064,"NEVER A PROBLEM: I price shop before I purchase and usually buy from eBay. Their  credit program through PayPal is very useful and I've never had s problem.

You need to be careful and read everything regarding the product you are looking for. Products on eBay range from used, refurbished to brand new along with the warranties.  Also read the delivery time carefully and how it is shipped. As long as you use these guidelines you'll be a happy eBay shopper.",5
2065,"First Timer: I have never used eBay and didn’t really know how it worked. Shame on me for not researching to learn how to use eBay! 
I wanted this purse but was afraid I wouldn’t win the bid, so I bid on two other purses that were similar. Well, I won the bids on the two that I bid on in case I didn’t get the one I really liked. LOL
I’m finding this site easy to use, finding lots of great stuff, and learning that I need patience. 
I’m still buying!!",5
2066,"Wonderful to use EBay: Since the years have passed I have purchased several items from eBay. One purchase was to go to another state to collect a mantle for my Victorian home. The transaction went very smoothly. Also, if I had a problem with a seller, or I didn’t receive what I had paid for; eBay looked for a resolution and helped get my money back or the item.  I really like using eBay.",5
2067,"Combine shipping issues: The only thing I wish it would do make it a little easier to combine shipping on the app because sometimes it won’t let people invoice and I can’t figure out why. Good times at works so then I have to go back in and manually refund money. Especially if someone buys a bunch of buy it now’s, it won’t combine the shipping so I have to go in and fix it. That’s my only issue I’m having.",5
2068,"Complete trash: eBay customer support is terrible. I opened an account to sell a few items and eBay just notified me that my account was permanently suspended. No reason or explanation why. I called them to get more information and the rep only repeated himself saying the account was too risky and no additional details can be provided. It is insane, I understand they monitor and assess risk but it doesn’t seem they have a way to appeal or at least give the option to provide an explanation or further information. Furthermore, they stated that any future accounts will be also suspended. Stay away. This is a common practice and they don’t care. Good luck.",1
2069,"Greedy seller fees.: I am utterly disappointed and frustrated with eBay's seller fees. The rates are exorbitant and seem to increase without any reasonable justification, taking a significant chunk out of my profits. The lack of transparency in how these fees are calculated is also a major issue. It feels like eBay is exploiting its sellers, who are the backbone of its marketplace. What's more, these high fees do not come with commensurate benefits or support services. The customer service in dealing with fee-related issues is dismal, often leaving me feeling helpless and ignored. Overall, eBay's seller fees are a major deterrent to anyone looking to sell on the platform, and they significantly diminish the overall selling experience.",1
2070,"Problem after update…: I enjoy using this app whenever I need to order something, it’s my go to app, however after the latest update a couple of days ago it’s not working properly, I had ordered an item that was supposed to be delivered today and according to eBay it wasn’t even in the same city yet, only reason I knew it would come is because I have the USPS mobile app on my phone and that’s how I found out, anyway the item was delivered, I received it, but as of right now according to eBay the item still isn’t here, please fix this issue!",2
2071,"Too little responsibility demanded if sellers: I buy items daily from eBay, but very often run into the same problem. The majority of times when my purchase is an auction item I’ve won, and that item is below market value (say a baseball card worth $10 but I won with a bid of $5), the seller simply messages me saying “sorry I lost the item” “the item has been damaged” “we’re going to refund you instead of shipping it”. I understand these things happen but eBay should stop sellers from using it to protect themselves from taking a loss. They put the item up for auction, they could have set a list price instead.",1
2072,Just keeps getting better: eBay is really my saving grace sometimes! So easy to find almost anything! Watching the growth of the years especially in the Authentication department lol I’m a big big SneakerHead so small things like the Authenticity guarantee along with other great features have kept my coming back to eBay! Oh yea! If and when you do have some type of problem!!! eBay has your back 100%,5

The seller is new, with a zero score, but Ebay hasn’t stopped this person from selling on eBay even though he didn’t mail the item, and Ebay let the seller keep my money on top of it?? Some money back guarantee Ebay!!!",2
2074,"Glitch: I was making a purchase. When I hit confirm and pay, the screen said whoops something went wrong. I hit the X in the upper right hand corner. The app returned to the confirm and pay.

The seller said I couldn’t cancel because they have been shipped, which turned out to be a lie.",5
2075,My eBay: I have been using eBay for several years I find that almost all the sellers give a very accurate and honest opinion of the products prices are very fair and competitive most of the shippers have very good customer service and almost every item I purchase is free shipping I do recommend Ebay to anyone looking for almost anything if you can’t find it hereThey don’t make it yours truly workhorse 2748,5

They made me wait and wasted my time! The first agent said that I’ve to wait 1-2 days for the seller to respond, after 3 days I’ve contacted them then the second agent told me TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH! So i decided to keep my patience and give them one more chance. So my last agent read all my transaction with the two previous agent, then guess what they’ve said?! They said that they can’t really help me!!! They said I have to deal it with the seller since it’s the Ebay policy! Don’t trust this app anyone!",1
2077,No respect for sellers: I have been using eBay close to 20 years. Just had a buyer give me negative only 7 hours after winning a auction and paying for item. Said they gave me negative for not shipping out sooner (seriously???) was at work and wouldn’t be able to ship till following morning. Also was fearing this maybe a scam since negative was given so quickly without me even shipping. I canceled the sale and reached out to eBay. They did nothing said I have to keep the negative feedback even though I didn’t sell my item to the disgruntled (scammer) buyer. eBay does not protect is sellers or just doesn’t seem to care about possible scammers.,1
2078,"Shipping & type sale: Great app. Only a few issues such as shipping....too many choices and doesn’t allow you to place a flat rate or any unique rate but tells you to go on line to do so. Also, won’t let you change type of sale, say auction to buy now unless u leave app and go online. Finally, trying to do things on a tablet is not the greatest for your description because there’s no way to make yours stand out, it’s only one text one way",4

You take my money and have no way for me to contact EBay when I need to?!?! No you don’t have a open link of communication to buyers and sellers when they need Ebays assistance!! Your just laughing to the bank taking our hard earned money...... spineless money hungry pigs! That’s how I really feel! Coming from a EBay that rates 100%!! EBay your a Big Zero! For Ethical Business practice!!,1

So felt good.  I gave five stars. They did help and solved my problem that what one thing I got to tell you. That eBay have total everything you can find what you look for !,5
2081,"Terrible customer service on the call, but some sellers are good to buy from: The customer service support people where really grumpy and judgemental with me, when I was only asking a question about something I wanted to know, like an eBay giftcard for me to buy from sellers in another country in the eBay USA site. There absolutely needs to be new employees working for the customer service, when they need to be patient and not be grumpy/judgemental to customers. 

But, I’m happy to buy the things from the sellers though, even though you must watch out for some shady people on there.",2
2082,"Package lost: I have not received an item sent through FedEx and, because FedEx inaccurately marked it “delivered” in their system EBay automatically refused me any help and closed my refund case .
Due to Covid appears that FedEx does not require their drivers to collect signatures so packages showing “delivered” are in fact not. EBay did not update their procedures and if package shows “delivered” they automatically close the case so buying on EBay became risky and a gamble.",5
2083,New version is not customer favor.: eBay has changed everything in favor for them to make even more money and sellers get less. Sellers have to pay more to sell. Less profits for sellers and way more increase for them. Plus now they need your last for ssn and your bank info. Since they go threw your  bank not PayPal. To much personal info for absolutely no reason other then a hidden reasons. Recommend not using Ebay since their creed has taken priority over being a user friendly selling and buying app. It’s a how can we charge more and customers get less. Time to delete and go with their competitors.,1

This is obviously a glitch and it’s extremely annoying to us sellers who use our phones to take pictures for an ad. I find myself fighting with this for minutes repeatedly sending the request over and over and over again until it finally just works right, which is almost never.",1

Been a customer of EBay for many years now, my primary shopping place for what I can’t get elsewhere. I Love EBay!",5
2088,"Terrible App For Sellers: I already reviewed this app, but somehow it magically disappeared. This app is extremely buyer biased and overall just there to mess with our selling. 

The support is always on team eBay or buyers. I have many problems with eBay selecting its own options for MY listed items. I will select OFF for a feature I do not want on, and then eBay will just go back and turn it on. I have NEVER shipped Internationally and now all the sudden it edited EVERY SINGLE LISTING of mine saying that I do, when I SPECIFICALLY said no when first listing my item. The app is sneaky and just overall wants the sellers to fail. If there was another app with this big of a platform, I’d be using that to sell instead!",1
2089,"Fraudulent Auctions: EBay is behind the times. They allow fraudulent auctions and don’t restrict accounts of those who are proven to have done them. I just had someone cancel an auction I won because they didn’t like the final price. Payment had been made. They clearly stated that this was why. I contacted EBay and was told there was nothing they could do. This person continues to sell with a great rating. A separate issue - but they also allow price gouging during the pandemic, which is illegal, and say that they can only limit accounts one at a time if they are notified (which is not a simple and quick process). They need to update their interface to resolve these issues.",1
2090,"Can’t deliver a gift because eBay. Doesn’t evolve: I want to buy a iPhone and deliver it to Peru for girlfriend mother. eBay should charge a extra fee so they can take it from the seller and deliver whatever in the world. I won’t care if they had a clause stating if the product or item is not received they are not liable I would be ok with it. As long it’s delivered and stuck at so mail office. Or do deliver to post offices only and the gifter shows there id and picks it up. Evolution is key in business. Especially when you wish to grow, make more money and compete with others in the industry.",3
2091,Vary happy shopper but?!?: I’m very happy with eBay. My only complaint would be to do with the confirm to buy before you can see if the seller takes PayPal credit. I currently have an order I’m trying to cancel because I thought the seller took PayPal credit and they didn’t so now I’m stuck waiting on them to respond to the cancel request. If I would’ve been able to see they didn’t take PayPal credit I wouldn’t  have confirmed to buy,5

I always know I have financial security in that I’m not constantly giving my information out to different people and I always get what I expected out of my orders.  I have only had like 2 instances when I bought an electronic item and it not function correctly and just messaged the seller and within moments they were messaging me back and going above and beyond to correct the issue.,5
2093,"Mr: Hi I had some good experiences but still not satisfied sometimes when you save and item than by the time to finish your selection it’s sold. Some companies don’t respond to your messages at all. 
Also you can be looking for something,after you write all your details or items description the Ebay app will take you to something you didn’t like and it is at the check out or sometimes after paying your money that you realize and it’s over. Many times I wrote a message about wrong or bad items but never got an answer.",3
2094,"eBay app: irritating format: The app for eBay has irritating changes from classic. When you do a search, the results unnecessarily repeat. You have to look at same items shown multiple times in results. You also are forced often to have search performed in exact same manner when you try to commit new search, it forces you to utilize previously selected search filters. “Offers” notifications are terrible. I like eBay but their new format is not as good as the previous.",4
2095,"Cannot see number of views anymore: Being able to keep track of how many views each of my items was receiving made all the difference in how I sold. If views were low, I knew I had to try something new to increase them, tweak my listing a bit... but now I cannot see this important data. For all I know, I'm the only one who has seen my most recent listing. There is nothing to track now. I feel like I'm selling in the dark. I hate this.",5
2096,"More access please: Needs an option in settings on the app to set your account to away instead of logging in through the desk top which is still confusing to find. 

Needs to save all my settings in selling like international shipping. 

Wish there was an option to leave negative feedback to non payers. eBay doesn't allow sellers to leave any bad feedback which is how non payers / scammers are continually scamming more people. They should be kicked off eBay after 3 non payments in a row. It's getting ridiculous that half the items I sell aren't being paid for because scammers are bidding on them.

Wish they would have a button at the bottom of a listing to view the sellers other items instead of having to click on their seller name and then click on items for sale. Too many steps. It should go back to how it was before listed at the bottom of the listing.",3
2097,"Wait? Am I following, or Saving My Searches Now???!: Dear eBay, 

This is an “Update” reminder for you to PLEASE fix: 1 - The odd repeat of consecutive listings that, OMG, YOU STILL HAVEN'T FIXED!!? And, yes, I emailed you back twice, when you requested further details! So again,  what’s up with that??  PLUS, please tell me what the H E double hockey sticks is STILL WRONG with your app(athletic) that continues to freeze the screen of my iPhone 6s and now X, when I zoom in on an image??!! Everything else on my phone continues to run normal, BUT if I want to use eBay, I HAVE TO SHUT DOWN MY PHONE, THEN TURN IT BACK ON to access it. But since that’s a pain in the “app”, I frequently just skip eBay for awhile! 

Maybe you want to fix that? That sure would be nice!❤️",1
2098,"Very unreliable lately: I've used the eBay app for years now, multiple times a day. I cannot tell you how many collectibles auctions I have missed out on in the past few weeks because the ""My eBay"" section won't show all of the items I have marked to review. Under each items category it will tell me I have ""x"" number of items in that section (Example: 45) and there's multiple categories, yet only displays like 27 TOTAL items on my list. Several disappear daily and never appear under my ""ENDED"" tab either. I'm very disgusted with the way the app allows me to function in my searches and organization.",2
2099,"The latest version is barely more than crippleware: I have had the eBay app on my iPhone almost since I bought my iPhone 3G. Every version has been less and less useful, culminating in this latest version which allows me to search for items and bid on them, but I cannot see the status of the ones I am winning. At least not on my iPhone 7. What’s wrong? Is it too much effort to put a damned link to see the items I am bidding on? It USED to be there. I used to be able to see the items I am watching, too. Apparently, I don’t need to know what I am bidding on until I win them and have to pay for them - or did you make that functionality invisible, too?",1
2100,"Buyer to seller: I've been a faithful consumer of eBay and all it offers for over a decade - actually two decades. Just two weeks ago, I decided to give a go to selling. I began listing items that were just in the way our taking up unnecessary space around my house.... Now, I am hooked! Ebay is not only the place to be for great buying, it's also a great way to make money off the stuff you want to get rid of! Now, I just need to find a larger mailbox for packages LOL",5
2101,"Good for buyers but unfair to sellers: I've used Ebay for years as a seller and a buyer but as a buyer I feel we,the bread winners for Ebay are treated unfairly in that we get burned constantly by dead beat buyers and WE
are not allowed to leave negative feedback on their behalf as they ARE able to do to us,that's just NOT right,so C'mon Ebay and get off the politically correctness of ""if you can't say something good you can't say nothing at all business"", and make US, the Sellers/ your profit makers feel appreciated.",5
2102,"room for improvement, still: the eBay app has greatly improved over the years, however there are still upgrades that need to happen and problems that should be addressed. my primary complaint is that you're unable to create, edit, or relist items with variations. this is no small thing; it's time to fix this issue. additionally, the options for font, color, etc disappear on the app. other than that, i find you can do most things on the app. thanks, eBay!",4
2103,"Search Error On Newest Update.: Great overall application. I love the interface of this update. But there is an error with the application; specifically in regards to searching products. The app does not allow for searches to be specified or filtered. It is incredibly annoying and absolutely ruins the eBay experience.

2104,Li'l Ron: I've only been using eBay for a short period of time. But I'm dangerously hooked. I love the competitive aspect of the site. It’s fun and aggravating at times. I hate losing on a auction. I've been outbid with 4 seconds left on the auction. I really don’t like the shipping charges. They can’t be ridiculously high. Pay attention to the shipping charges. That tells me people are making their profits on shipping charges. Other than that it's pretty cool.,5
2105,"Scammed And EBay Will Not Help: The seller set delivery date way ahead of eBay’s coverage so when I tried to file a claim for a refund because nothing had been shipped , eBay’s system said I could only put a claim around delivery date . The delivery date comes around and it says it’s outside eBay’s coverage, like what??
The seller after a month got taken down , seller was filled with bad reviews from customers he had scammed as like myself.
I Always Buy Trading Cards Here On EBay So This Is Troublesome to say the least . I’m scared to buy more cards if eBay’s coverage is being worked around by scammers",2
2106,"Needs serious work: Literally can only save one listing to my watch list. When I go to save another listing after the first, it keeps showing an error where it says I can’t add another to my watched list and to try later. I close the app, restart it, go to add an item to my watch list, but it still says there’s an error. Also, and this is very annoying as well, I can’t remove items from my watchlist without another error message popping up. These issues need to be fixed asap.",3
2107,Great app an website: I’ve always bought things on eBay sometimes you get the scammer which eBay does a good job preventing them but they make sure resolve the incident quickly an it’s also very simple to sell things on I’ve listen my first item for sale an was amazed how simple it was an they made it explaining everything you need to know upon listing a item an how to ship them love eBay,5
2108,"TERRIBLE GLITCHES NEVER SOLVED!: This is one of the worst seller apps I have ever used! After I i’ve listed several items, the app always says that it needs specific information that I already entered in the listing. After listing the correct photos for each sale item, I go back to the app a few minutes later & there’s an incorrect photo that has been put in the place of the correct photo for the item. Sometimes the App lists the same photo for up to four different items. No updates to the app have fixed either of these problems. I will have to update all existing listings & enter new listings on the eBay webpage.",1
2109,"Always sides with the buyer (always): Doesn’t matter if the buyer knows the item is broken or even if you state it’s just for parts, if the buyer says the item isn’t as described, ebay will force you to refund their money.   Ebay can also force you to refund their money AND not force the buyer to return the item.   The buyer can also return a different item and Ebay won’t do anything about it.  Thank goodness their are still decent people using EBay.  Thank you to all the good people buying and selling on Ebay.",3
2110,"**IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD**: I was a seller and have been a buyer in the past and the system is not set up as easy as you think!!
1. If you buy or sell it’s full of scammers people trying to steal money!! 
2. If you sell any item but remove it you’re charged!
3. If you don’t have an item listed somehow someone will be able to purchase it. Then when u go to cancel it. eBay will charge you and you will lose all the money the person paid for the item with making no money!

2111,"Offer image glitch: Now, when you receive offer from seller, if you click on the image to view the item anew, to make a decision, it doesn’t let you. It keeps staying on same offer page. You have to completely get out of screen and find the item in your “watching” list. I hope eBay fixes this annoying and time wasting glitch.",5
2112,"Permanently banned from eBay for no apparent reason: Three days into creating my account I received an email saying that I was permanently suspended. I tried to contact customer service but all they did was send me long script of nonsense. “We cannot disclose any reason”, “the decision is final and cannot be reversed.”
eBay is very arbitrary with their platform maintenance strategy and it’s just frustrating because it sometimes shut out innocent accounts like my incidence.
I am honestly fine with my account being suspended once since it might just be collateral damage of trying to eliminate scam accounts, but not being able to create any new account is UNACCEPTABLE.

BYE EBAY.",1
2113,"What happened to eBay customer service?!: The lack of being able to communicate with anyone at eBay is outrageous!  I missed a defective merchandise return date because of COVID demands on my job (80-hour work weeks due to staff shortages).  They closed my return, but said I could keep the item as if it were good news!  That was it; no one to discuss or reinstate with…the end.  Hey eBay - if you think stunts like this don’t harm platform goodwill, you’re sorely mistaken.  Oh and thank you for making me pay return shipping costs on another item that was misrepresented.  You are not what you used to be.",2
2114,"Top Notch Customer Service: Ebay has the greatest customer service. even when i’m using the chat option, the every agent i have ever chatted with has made sure that every issue gets personal attention. they are very thorough no matter the size of the issue. which makes me never hesitate to order off of Ebay. If ur not satisfied they will do whatever needs to be done to make it right😁",5

Hey, developer. When I remove an item from the watch list, the list redraws and takes me back to the top. This is such a lazy rookie interface error. It doesn’t jump immediately to the top though. No, first it correctly condenses the list, then for no good reason it thinks I need to get back to the top. Let me help you. STOP after the list condenses. DO NOT redraw the entire list. Please.",5
2116,"Great app BUT…: eBay has been a great app for me usually. But recently (as in the last couple of months or so) I haven’t been able to add things to my cart. I get an error message saying “cannot add to cart l, please try again later” or something like that. Well, I try again later and it still doesn’t work, I have to manually search for the item I want every time. 

I update the app, still same problem. I’m giving this app 3 stars cause it’s a fairly large problem for me. 

Otherwise though, absolutely LOVE eBay",3
2117,"Payouts: I love eBay so much, but I am not a huge fan of the new payouts. The app used to use PayPal, and I was happy to avoid the many fees when they announced they were going to stop using the service. The problem is that eBay still takes those fees out, and it takes so long to get paid. This also leads to problems with delays in shipping. I wish the app used Venmo or another service that lets buyers/sellers have more control of their money and speeds up transactions.",4
2118,"Everything: I have been a eBay customer since 2014, I have found everything I want and not any real problems, maybe a few but eBay has taken care of them for me.

Thanks go out to E-bay.” Good job”

2119,"Heavily in favor of buyers: I tried to sell my apple watch and encountered a problem where I used the recommended shipping method from ebay whose tracking turned out to be not available in the destination country. The tracking is lost once the item is out of the U.S. and the buyer requested a refund, therefore I didn’t receive the money while never getting the item back. I asked help of ebay but they never listened to me no matter how many times I explained how unfair it was. In the end my messages to ebay were completely ignored and I had to give up. It’s heavily in favor of buyers. There are many similar incidents apparently too.",1
2120,"Member since 2010: I have been a member since 2010 and have been through all of the changes EBay has implemented.  I like the way it is now because of the options I have.  I do have one issue, and that’s sellers being allowed to put just United States as location.  A lot of times, I like to order from the closest place and believe the sellers should put actual locations on their listings.  Thanks, Karen",5
2121,"Higher fees, slower payments: eBay continues to charge higher fees and now payments take days, weeks or even a month to receive. They ditched PayPal which made my funds immediately available to purchase other items on eBay or even items at brick and mortar stores with the linked PayPal debit card. 

I’ll continue to make purchases on eBay but my selling will take place somewhere else. 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻",5
2122,"App suggestion: The app is infinitely better than the desktop site IMO. I’d like to recommend the following change:
 
Please include a “do not show me this item again” option. For those of us with saved searches, there are often items that pop up in the search results over and over. For efficiency’s sake, it would be nice to block those items from showing up in subsequent new item searches.",5
2123,"Super: I love eBay b/c I can list multiple items at a set price and not have to deal with always having to re-list all the time. 
It’s also a thrill when something sells and you get the Cha Ching ! 
When someone has a question you are able to answer quickly and efficiently because that is another notification sound! 
On top of everything I set my price and get my item sold!",5

Either way Ebay is a fabulous resource for these items.",5
2125,"Steadily Improving: Having used EBay over 20 years, I have watched it steadily improve and meet new challenges that faced it. We would love to see 1 more improvement. EBay needs a rotating volunteer peer review group to monitor and challenge some of the digressions into reproduction and incorrectly described merchandise. There are foreign fakes and a large group of unknowledgeable sellers who could benefit from some friendly guidance. I, for one, could share knowledge gleaned from 40 years of experience collecting British jugs",4
2126,"Not what it once was...: I became a user when it first started.  eBay used to be people selling to people usually right here in the good ole USA.  They got so big allowing companies to sell, China to sell & basically it got out of control.  Last 4 orders I have placed said they were coming from California or New York & they came 2 months later from China.  Since I can purchase new from the factory cheaper than I can on eBay I AM DONE!!!",5
2127,eBay user for life: eBay has made my life easier. I’m a do it yourself kind of guy so when I need parts (auto or home) I find them easily and at a good price on eBay. And I usually gets the parts on or before expected due date. If I have a question for the person or company I’m buying part from they answer quickly and that’s great because time is important to me. Keep up the good work eBay!,5

Have been shopping with them for prob 5 years and have never tried to get money back until I did not receive my package. I even called the mailing company and told them I never received my package. They couldn’t help me. I also contacted the seller and they refused to send me another one or refund me. Lost $100, but like I say, this is the first and only time I’ve ever had an issue with them.",4

But what if I want to only see results from China? Or Europe? Or somewhere else? Also, you can only see purchases back to 6 months or a year. Maybe I need to reorder something I bought 18 or 24+ months ago. Why put limits like this on your customers eBay???",5
2130,eBay is such a life saver.: eBay completely helps me to sell all my products I create and customize. If it wasn’t for this website I wouldn’t have sold even half the stuff I’ve done. My only complaint is that it does take too much credit/experience to receive your money quicker and get it off of hold. I feel like if you have made at least 5 sales and have had great feedback that should be enough on its own.,5
2131,Holds: Was not aware that they hold your funds for their use on most of the sales you make for up to 21 days. I have been a member for 8 years with only top ratings and none of my sales are credited to my PayPal account in a timely manner. They even hold payments as small as $12. They currently have use of several thousand dollars of my money even though the buyers are enjoying what I have sold them...delivered in a timely manner without complaint.,5
2132,Economical Wonder: I have been an eBay member and user for over 10 yrs. I can say without reservation if you’re looking to buy an item and check the rating of each seller and their feedback you’ll always find a good deal with a reputable seller aside from the fact your item will be delivered to your door often in a very few days. This app is a wonderful tool to facilitate that end with user friendly navigation. Enjoy!,5
2133,"I lovvvvve Ebay but ...: It always tells me I have toooo many items in my “save for later” and “watch list “ its very unorganized and annoying  .

I’ve already made my own folder for school, technology, make up, shoes, & home decor of things I want to purchase .",5

2138,I Love eBay but...: I am a fan of eBay but lately I have been getting messed up orders back to back and that gets a little irritating. I don’t like giving negative feedback but sometimes it has to be done so the sellers will step up their game in seller quality items! Also label the items that have glass inside of the packaging (Fragile) in hopes that the package will not get tossed around. I had a mug that was delivered broken and I’m still waiting for a refund!,5
2139,"eBay App: One problem with eBay.  Unfortunately, some people like to scam...  some buyers will always try to scam eBay users when making a purchase, especially high value or electronics.  eBay has loop holes that support these type of people to rip off good eBay users with long standing all positive history.  eBay will need to adapt there rules and regulations to eliminate these types of buyers...  until they do, there will always be some people that take advantage.",5
2140,"Lovey it!: I have always been impressed by the eBay App as a seller and buyer. It is more intuitive than the desktop version, just a few less features. Every time I hem and haw about cost of doing business on eBay (and make no mistake it is costly with some annoying policies like paying final fees on shipping), I remember how well it runs and easy shipping is. My items can have very good margins so not a big deal for the ease and simplicity of a high functioning App! Thanks",5

Bid retraction should be a feature of the mobile app because you aren’t following every little detail on the go and if you do catch a mistake or a item description that doesn’t match the picture, well, better rush to the nearest desktop before the seller accepts and locks you into a binding agreement. Additionally some sellers spam your inbox after declining a counteroffer. Make it a feature to block or ignore these people!",1
2143,"Wonderful and so easy. But: I’m not getting any notifications sounds. All my alerts are on, I’ve done everything posted to fix it but still no sounds.

2144,"Limited functionality: If all you need to do is bid on an item you already have in your watch list, them it’s ok. I guess. 

Otherwise it’s crap. Searches yield less and different results from desktop searches - completed & sold searches might as well not even be an option for how useful they are, with hundreds of items being left out of results and selling functions can’t be saved from item to next so you always have to make sure you set your shipping settings every time. 

Better to use mercury or other browser than this poorly designed, limitedly functional app.",2

She was talking lowed and all she did is like I was a criminal and she is the judge .., But never mind I just want to know who is playing with me ?I would like to an upper management to call me and talk to me as I am a human and deserve to be treated as a human and not like an animal where the lady treated me .

I really like not having to mess with the payment options for the buyers and really appreciate the ease of being able to print off shipping labels right from the app. Anything f to make my life easier and convenient when I’m trying to get things done, I’m stoked for. Great app. Good job eBay!",5

However I can’t seem to resolve an issue that I have and I have tried for days to find a phone number for customer service. The only thing Ebay seems to have are ai’s and someone else who tries to resolve it but tells you to file a separate complaint. So currently I would say always read neutral and negative feedback back on Sellers, if too many are saying the same thing move on. It will not be worth the trouble.",2
2149,Love eBay but wish the search was more definable: eBay is great and I love to be able to search and find things I need from all over but the search engine is difficult and needs more options in order to find the item you want without having to look at everything you aren’t interested in.

2155,"eBay protects scammers.: I was selling an item. A eBay user asked me to trade for an item of slightly greater value. I agreed to trade. our chats took place on eBay. I called eBay customer service to confirm that it was ok. They said YES. I sent the item and got a package without what we agreed on via our discussion in eBay messages.  Then the account blocked me so I reported it to eBay who said they’d investigate. eBay reps all told me they can’t help me. I asked for the persons name so I can sue, they WOULD NOT GIVE ME THE INFORMATION I NEEDED SO I COULD TAKE LEGAL ACTIONS. eBay is ok with users reporting scammers and won’t investigate and have the user in question or make sure it gets settled. if you’re an eBay user you aren’t protected.",1
2156,"Downgraded upgrade: Unfortunately I am quite dependent on eBay to get the collectibles that I collect, and their search parameters have gone down the toilet. Ever since I updated the app, location-based searches now are globally changed to whatever the default location I have set, and the same sponsored results show up across all my searches As new search results for things that are completely unrelated to the actual search. Seems now is the time to start seeking alternative options to keep track of what I am looking to buy regularly on eBay.",2
2157,"Not transparent/ bad customer service: they will quote you a number for shipping and then retroactively charge you whatever they want. i was quoted $20 and they charged me $60. contacted customer service they were very nice and said they would refund me. money never showed up. called again, they said theyd look into it. again, weeks later still nothing. just total dishonesty all around. i’ll never sell on ebay again.

the platform is also essentially a haven for scammers now. when you recieve defective merchandise you essentially have zero recourse, and the ratings system doesn’t work like it used to either.",1
2158,"Controlling: The issue I have with eBay is all the restrictions they have when “eBay” feels you are performing to there standards. I have a 98% customer satisfaction rating. I am not a business I’m just a person selling cards and stuff I own from my possession and collection. So if I don’t feel like selling something I own that’s worth more money for way less then it’s value then I should be allowed to pull my item, with our penalties. But eBay does and if you do it they will limit you on how many times you can sell and never lift the restrictions. I recommend selling your items somewhere else if you have other options.",1
2159,"Banned for no reason: A use bid on one of my items then messages me that they didn’t know it was a womens shoe so if they win,  they don’t actually want the shoes. They wind up winning of course and I cancel the order. I repost the listing and a few days later get an email that my account was banned. The most offensive part is the copy on the email makes it sound like all this work was put in to investigate my account and they don’t take it lightly. But it’s so clear this was automated and no human payed any mind. Glad there are other platforms like Grailed out there with actual customer service. I’m done with eBay, what a trash experience.",1

This is so far the best platform for online buying for me! 100% recommended!",5
2163,A-bay best app for buyers: Been a eBay member for over 15 years now.  Probably the best app/auction site of all.   Lots of protection for buyers which is what I am 99% of the time.  But from what I hear E-bay is not a good auction site for sellers.   I hear that profit margins are lower and in turn has forced sellers to look else where to sell their goods.   Hopefully eBay can figure out some sort of middle ground so they don’t keep losing their sellers to sites like FB.,5
2164,"Ebay: Ebay is awesome,it has so many items that are usually hard to find and very expensive, but with Ebay I find the things for such a great price. The sellers are responsible and are active towards the customer’s complaint and gets the job done. The customer service is also great as well. Very helpful when needed. All in all I’m very happy with Ebay. I’ve had some great experiences with Ebay and I hope to for many more in the future.",5

I imagine it’s doing this every time a new item is listed that matches my criteria.  It also does this on the watchlist when I delete an item - instead of me continuing down my list, it puts me back to the top every time which makes it very hard to manage my list. Frustrating! Please fix this!",3

Weeks after he received it he is now saying it’s not as described and it definitely was.

I had perfect feedback and have been selling on eBay for many years and now this scammer left me a bad review and my feedback is 94%. Again, he is not giving any information to back up what he is saying and this is having a very negative affect on my ebay selling. It’s very disappointing that ebay and PayPal would size with him based on the facts of the transaction.",1

I provided 100% evidence that the movie was swapped plus it was unsealed and damaged and eBay still decided to refund the buyer on my behalf. I’ve been selling with eBay for over 12yrs. I never thought they would make such an unprofessional move to a top rated seller. I’m extremely disappointed, furious & sick of eBay’s unfair decisions. I would never recommend anyone to start a business on eBay!!",4
2171,"Be aware of app deficiencies: After a situation with trying to apply a eBay coupon to a purchase, I was advised by Aldo at customer service that the application has a number of limitations that are not clearly disclosed. While I have been using the App for all recent purchases, he recommended to use the Website - which I found strange as during the conversation he made frequent references to the app limitations, and frequently recommended using the Website. 
ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE APP AND AN EBAY ISSUED COUPON SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE APP DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO TO THIS. EBAY CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL NOT ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES WITH ANY BACKDATED CREDIT. INSTEAD THEY WANT YOU TO MAKE A FURTHER PURCHASE AND ONLY USE THE WEBSITE.

You can provide stellar shipping, price, products and shipping and your lucky to get one out of 20 people to even bother to leave feedback. Ebay fees are creeping and now they just adding tax.  If a seller wants to return a product (that is new or exactly as described) Ebay automatically places a freeze on the money.

You as a seller are unable to send an invoice from the app, you can never change “Item Details” from the app, the app automatically makes auctions “good till cancelled” on “Buy it Now” type auctions, and you cant revise it afterwards! With most sellers using Mobil devices now, A seller should be able to access EVERYTHING that is available on the “Classic Site”... I still use it but it’s only because that’s all there is....",3
2177,Glitch on the relist: Still love this app but recently Ive found that if I have an item in need of a relist when it lands in the section where it prompts you to lower your price with one button it doesnt actually relist the item when you agree to that lower price.  These items are stuck in limbo for me at the moment.  Also finding that the auto relisting and the manual relisting on unsold items is quite arbitrary and I cant find the setting to determine the outcome.  Please help and get your 5th star back ebay.,4
2178,"Unavailable options cost sellers without their knowledge: The app changed without forewarning by charging sellers without their knowledge. I am reporting the following to the state attorney general and encourage others to do so as well. 1) When using the app: By selecting Buy It Now as a listing type, the only duration option is Good Til Canceled. This means that the listing will be automatically renewed a number of times, and Ebay will charge a fee every time if you don’t have remaining free listings. 2.) An auction style was set to auto-relist without consent.  These hidden and **unchangeable(!!)** settings unfairly charge sellers without consent  or knowledge. I am reporting this to the state attorney general’s office and encourage others to do the same.",1

Ebay forces you to use the ""good until cancelled"" option instead of choosing 30 days. You cannot edit it from a browser to 30 days either. You have to watch closely or they automatically put best offer option on and you are automatically accepting half the price. There is no toggle to not accept buyers with strikes against them. There is no option for a bullet edge on paragraphs. They automatically put your postage price in the listing. Everything has changed for the worse. Bad bad bad. No longer using it.",1

You start something on the app get 3 steps into it and nothing happens , no warning or instruction you do a web search to find out you have to use the desktop site. It’s easier to search for help and you get better results on the web vs the app. All in all it’s a shame to even offer such a clunky app.",5
2181,Selling On eBay Is Amazing!: I can’t say enough about how much I enjoy buying and selling on eBay. The Help Desk has fantastic customer service skills. They listen and solve. What more could you ask for? They also seem to enjoy their job which probably contributes to being s helpful. The reason this aspect is so important is that there are so many unusual things that can come up buying or selling. This makes the process easier. Thank you.,5
2182,Great app needs some work: The eBay app is a great way to stay connected with what is going on. From bidding to shipping to watch list. The only thing I can't stand is how you can not initiate a conversation. If you click on a seller you can't send them a message. The only way to contact someone is either purchasing the item and contacting them that way or going onto your computer and submitting a question that way. Very inconvenient,5
2183,How do I get the free $20 coupon that I was promised on my next sale of $10 or more?: I have enjoyed buying on EBay for the last couple years. Just started selling in the last month or so... two things I'm unsure about though... Why haven't I been receiving my profits from the sales I've made? AND where is the fee $20 coupon I was promised if made a sale of $10 or more? I like EBay... but what's the point if I can't access the money I've made???,5
2184,"Inspiring and Exciting: Those two words come to mind when I think of eBay as I joined quite a few years back. I am just a buyer for now.♾ inspiring as I see so many different stores from all over the world and people who really work so hard to build trust and put love into what they're selling. As exciting I imagine, selling my jewelry and my artwork one day. It's also exciting to buy and to do auctions.

2185,"Shady shipping practices.: To start off, the app itself works fine. Also as a buyer I’ve had no problem, however as a seller I was recently cheated out of about 16 dollars. eBay charged my customers shipping, then went ahead and made me pay roughly 8 dollars each shipment. So basically they stole my money. I did talk to customer service and was able to sort it out, however it’s completely unacceptable for it to happen in the first place. 

Do better eBay otherwise you’ll loose people to your competition.",3

Then less than two weeks later, my account is permanently suspended. I did not make a single sell, nor did I do a single purchase. I even set up my bank account with this account. I identified myself. And no one at eBay can tell me the specific things that I violated. I’ll take my business elsewhere.",1

I continuously communicated to the buyer and provided her the tracking#. I used the UPS shipping label through eBay and I didn’t not see or get any notification about signature required (over $750). The fact is eBay will take 12% of fee no matter what buyer reports for a refund. UPS showed it delivered on 10/22 and the suspicious buyer opened the report on 11/10. The result was I need to fully refund her + cover the eBay fee. I was using eBay over 10 years and I’m DONE here. I WILL NEVER NEVER USE eBay. I hope you guys will lose more sellers :)",1

When you choose to erase your “recently viewed” items, they appear again on the home page next time you open the app, so your history is really never being erased. This is bad for privacy reasons. 2. If you hide past transactions once they are completed, they reappear on your purchase history after 60 days and there seems to be no way to get rid of them, going back YEARS. So again, this is bad for privacy reasons. If you don’t want someone to grab your phone and see what you’ve been looking at or buying on eBay, avoid using the app.",1

I have spent hours on the phone trying to get 2 separate refunds. I have lost time and money as well and my patience trying to get this refund. Now I am out nearly $200 and I have wasted hours of my time, the least I can do is write a bad review for this whole ordeal. Please have better customer service when you deal with unknown used items and unreliable sellers.",1
2197,eBay: eBay continues to improve! I like the fact that just the net proceeds from the sale is deposited into my account it makes it easier for tax time. I understand why eBay charges more commission when the sellers rating is lowered because what the seller does has an affect on eBay overall and eBay has to protect its reputation and the seller will do the right thing if they are being punished financially.,5
2198,"Terrible!: This app, at least on my iPad, is the WORST! Every time they supposedly do an update, it’s more like an uptown. The notifications are hard to delete, they go one by one, sooooslowly…can’t find or categorize purchases that still need feedback. So many freezes, glitches, and errors. Can’t pick the page # of your purchases anymore, I do many transactions and need to be able to categorize. Miss the “ classic” version of the app, can’t get it back.

I wasn’t happy. Previous to that, a Chinese paper lantern seller ripped me off and closed out their account. eBay kept my money. One more time and I think I’m done with eBay.",2

More than once I have bought damaged and or defective items. If they are from China give up any hope of a fair deal. They insist you ship it back to them which costs three times what the product is worth and you lose no matter what you do. Twice, it was you US Sellers.

Worst experience I’ve ever had and I’m gonna dedicate anytime I have, telling anyone who will listen to never, EVER use eBay.",1
2217,"Saved searches are a mess: I have several saved searches and I am getting false indications that new items are available. Many of my searches are hard-to-find items. I will check daily and the app indicates that there are anywhere from 12 to 99+ new listings on these HTF items.  When I check, there are zero items available. It seems like a big organization would be more diligent in testing their app updates or at least fix the issues quickly. This issue has been a problem for too long.",2
2218,"A dying site that doesn’t protect its sellers: eBay is on its way out and has been for the past five years. Its app is next to useless. You can do nearly everything you need to buy or seller items via web. The only thing you’d be missing is eBay’s endless notifications that come via email even if you have unsubscribed. The ebay app also asks you to rate it every 5 seconds because it simply can’t leave anyone alone. Well here’s my review! 

I’d like to note that eBay does nothing to protect its sellers from malicious buyers and negative feedback that is received even after issues have been resolved.",1
2219,"Search defaults overriding my desired searches: I want to search ALL CATEGORIES for many things.  I search for a specific player’s trading cards and eBay DEFAULTS MY SEARCH TO THE LIMITED CATEGORY OF TRADING CARD SINGLES.  I change it to ALL CATEGORIES then save the search, however every time I click the saved search IT STILL DEFAULTS TO SINGLE CARDS CATEGORY.  This is beyond lame and frustrating.  I was looking for a Ben Cooper Halloween mask today - the search defaulted to the HOLIDAYS category.  I changed to ALL CATEGORIES and saved the search yet when I click after it still defaults to HOLIDAYS - this is very limiting in my opinion and is a horrible way to provide the saved search function! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!",1
2220,"Not Placing a High Priority on Sellers: Quality Control needs more guidance, accountability and transparency 

When requesting for additional information beyond a very general and vague explanation

Had a VeRO Unauthorized Item Policy violations regarding the item being counterfeit

Noteworthy that the product’s logo was not the violation and many other similar products are posted in eBay.   eBay representatives stated that they place a high priority on the words of Corporate Office with few specific details 

Different story if the buyer stated that the product is counterfeit.  Since I own the product and not representing myself as an authorized dealer, this manufacturer seemingly has other agendas

Maybe in the future; eBay would provide EQUAL accountability from Manufacturer and Customer",5
2221,"eBay doesn’t give help: Lately, I have had problems with items not coming on time! So, please try to fix that. Also, lately I had a problem with a seller posting an item which I brought and I never received! I contacted the seller many times and he told me that I didn’t pay. I did! I tried to contact eBay and I couldn’t do that at all. It didn’t used to be that way. You would help to resolve the problems. I brought for someone else and my bank help with the money problem! eBay I know you can do better! So please try for your customers!",2
2222,"eBay signs me out constantly: I’m giving the app a 3 star review due to it constantly signing me out. I have uninstalled the app, reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, cleared out my cache and cookies, used a two step sign in and changed my password. I’m getting irritated since I use this platform to buy and sell on a daily basis. With that being said I’m giving eBay a 5 star review and rating because it’s help me out with my business and it’s easy to use.",4
2223,I love my EBay app!!: It makes finding the best deal so easy. I just hop on and get what I'm looking for. From everyday things to unique vintage finds. Most of my favorite pieces of unique jewelry and clothing I have gotten on EBay and with the help of this app. I am notified when someone offers me a better deal on something that I've been watching and also when auctions are almost up... It is really great! Thanks EBay ❤️,5
2224,"App is great!. Some sellers are not.: I have been using the eBay app for many years to both buy and sell.
For the most part I found the app very easy to use. however, we are searching for Adam purchase be very specific in your search.
Also, make sure the pictures that are posted are the item they are describing.
When the day is done I really like the eBay app.",5
2225,"eBay got me for $1000: Ebay just allowed someone to keep my item and then refund them the money! I lost almost $1000.

The customer said the laptop seemed damaged upon arrival and ask to return it. I agreed but after a week  of not shipping it the buyer contacted me an said he would just keep it. We canceled the return but eBay said they where investigating it. After 2 months they decided to refund the buyer and the buyer doesn’t need to return the item? What???? that’s all? I’m out $1000 and didn’t receive my laptop back! It’s that easy to scam someone and eBay seems cool with that. Long as they get there money they don’t care",1
2226,"Love eBay: As a seller, i love eBay. Easy to check on analytics, shipping is easy and straight forward. And now, they’ve really made an effort to improve the looks of sellers stores, a lot of customization now. Wish the fees where a little less and wish some of the other sellers knew how to price their products a little better instead of low balling their prices just to sell faster.",5
2227,The best app I’ve ever used: Oh my god this eBay app is so great I’m so glad that I downloaded it I’m so thankful for my god my dress and my base and then everything else that we can do and if we don’t even know what we have to do the next time we do it I won’t understand what we had to do the whole time and it was all inside of us and our brains in our minds are on connected no the banks are going again,5
2228,"My Favorite App for Clothes and Shoes: I love using ebay for second hand shopping. As an avid thrift shopper, I’ve found so many great things on here ranging from real tree camo pants, authentic nike dunks, and juicy couture sweatsuits. Although I use it particularly for second hand goods, there is a lot of unused things on ebay too. You can find anything you need at a reasonable price. The only thing I don’t like is the way you communicate with sellers.",5
2229,Disappointed: Very disappointed in the changes to categories in 4th qtr. All year we have been adding all those required listing things and now you change them around and we have to do it again. You put my mugs in a vase category and plates in bowls etc. It is a MESS and it just isn’t worth it. Listing on poshmark and Mercari is much easier and takes much less time.,5
2230,Scammers: I love eBay but dissatisfied with people fake buyers who want to ask a question through a text message just to get your contact information and fail to actually purchase. I’ve had to cancel two recent listings as a result of these bogus offers. I do not and will not respond other than on eBay but once the bid or offer is accepted it is time consuming to have to cancel.,5

1. User No response from server (H403)
2. Oops! Something went wrong. 

I’ve reset my phones network settings, deleted and re-installed the app.  Occasionally, I see a white background with grayed out pics and text.",5
2232,My compliments on eBay: eBay is excellent and so is PayPal working with them I can get a return if I need it and I am safe I like that also the other thing is is that they are hardly ever make a mistake the only thing I wish they do is ask for my physical address if they send things UPS I have a general delivery address can’t send things there. But other than that they are excellent thank youGrandma know.,5
2233,"Easy!: I love the Ebay app. It’s so easy to use. I can set my searches and get notifications. Easy to buy too. (My husband thinks it’s too easy🤣) If I have a problem it is has always been resolved. For example if I accidentally bid on something or the purchase was not as described by the seller. I have used several repurpose apps and EBay is by far the best. I realize you can buy lots of things but I am a clothing and shoe girl!
Keep up the good work!",5
2234,One bc I can’t give it 0: eBay used to be one of my favorite apps but I can not support a company that enables cancel culture. The fact that eBay is removing Dr. Seuss which has been in publication for over 80 years but will continue to sell Nazi hate publications on their site as well as memorabilia shows me the double standard of trying to appease extreme leftist. Cancel culture has gone too far and has become a joke. 2/3rds of the American people do not back what is happening with censorship or publication. We are very close to losing the right to free speech in the form of published content. You will not gain a single penny more from myself and hope the majority of your customer base will boycott as well.,1
2235,"Makes Life Easy: I never miss any notifications. I can easily respond to buyer questions, make purchases, and post items. I can manage my search notifications and watched items. I have no complaints. I almost prefer the mobile app over the desktop browser version. I know I use the mobile version more frequently for sure. Definitely recommend it. Glad to have it. Thanks ebay!",5
2236,"Sellers still need help with deadbeat  bidders: Small business or low sales folks can’t make money if deadbeat bidders are trolling freely. A lot of time is spent waiting for payment and may hold up an item for to long m, while back up bidders fade away.  If we go to Walmart we buy an item. If we buy online we pay for it immediate. Bidders should have to pay immediately just like any online purchase.",5
2237,"Great deals everywhere you look!: In my opinion, the number one online store for games, movies, and absolutely everything in between just make sure you check out the sellers history and ratings! My only regret is not shopping on eBay a lot sooner. I’m shopping now though and have already found and bought some really great deals! Thank you eBay so very much!",5

2239,"Does not work on earlier versions of iOS on iPads: My eBay app stopped working on this iPad over a month ago.  I have not been able to receive any updates since and attempts to report the issue seem to fall on deaf ears.  I can use other auction software on this iPad so I'll switch to them instead.

Sorry eBay, you're not fixing your apps and I don't need excuses, only action.",5
2240,"A great marketplace full of hard to find items: I’ve been a user of eBay for 18 years, I believe, and the scope of sellers and products (especially new or unopened products) has only continued to expand.  The services and reliability have also improved with reminder emails and Best Offer capability.

During the COVID period and staying  at home, I have actually utilized eBay MORE than usual, especially as a Buyer.

And the Saved Search feature has been wonderful in my ability to find tennis shoes that have been discontinued for 6-7 years.  EBay does the work, I get that email saying a pair has been listed.i buy them at excellent value prices and I have been able to keep 1-2 in inventory.  Fantastic experience.

Thanks eBay!",5
2241,"Public self service: Acceptably exploring your deepest desires in public has never been more convenient. 
Who cares that I spend hours searching for a phone case that will truly be a tangible personification of my inner self.

Now if you’ll excuse me I need to look for bargain basement vintage clown ceramics to terrify my family, my friends, and most of all myself.",5
2242,"Tricky wording in the Coin department .: Very EZ to spend a lot of money .  I found it user friendly . Not to many deals . Sellers try to trick people with tricky wording , especially in the coin department .  So my recommendation , to who ever reads this . STUDY every word s a seller has listed . A picture can be very deceiving . And you will save a lot of heartache , aggravation . And I think doing that You can find some decent stuff . Everyone wants top dollar . So  bid when possible. Thankyou . Jimmy C",5
2243,This App is trash: Fix this app or delete it from Apple Store. Too many gross flaws to list. I have to keep deleting and reinstalling because it freezes within pages in the app every single day more than several times a day. The app development is slothful and lazy and straight garbage . I’m not giving anyone recommendations to use it or waste space on phone or tablets downloading or you’ll have curse words for doing so... Wish I can give you zero stars because one is extremely too generous...,3
2244,"Reando’s Review: Ebay is absolutely wonder because it allows sellers quick and easy access to buyers and has been a great way for me to find all sorts of items at great prices. Ebay is also one of the best shopping sites that offers great customer service, fast shipping for many items and secured shopping. I would certainly recommend Ebay to anyone because of the above reasons, Thanks!",5
2245,"Cheats: I have been on both sides of the aisle.
When I sold, if there was a return I promptly did it.
When you have a dispute and the seller is insulting, offering you 80% less than you paid, giving you ridiculous suggestions to prove the item is defective then that seller should be penalized.
I do not like buying from other countries. My experience has. Even as stated above.  I do admit when this got escalated eBay stepped in and took care of the problem.   What happened to us choosing the regions we want to buy from?
China especially is bad for returns.a v
And why do these sellers that have the same item as everyone else have it way over the value of the item?  That should not be allowed.  eBay is a very large company and can afford to pay people to check every item and be approved for price.  
eBay could do more improving on how they work and add regulations that stop several things sellers and customers see and turn in to eBay.",2
2246,"Best app: Please never change the eBay app. It’s so incredibly convenient to keep watch on bids, watched items, purchases, tracking numbers, and browse items endlessly all in one app. I get notifications when an item has shipped, when it’s arrived at my door, and when a seller/buyer has messaged me. It’s allowed me to maintain a perfect eBay rating because of how quick it’s made my responses and transactions. And no crashing or bugs. An A++ app!!!",5
2247,"TERRIBLE!: I’ve been on eBay for 11 years and like many other reviews I see on here, I agree that eBay is the worst reseller site out there. ZERO seller protection, buyers have found ways to scam sellers out of money and you’re letting them do it. Got news for you-sellers are the reason you are in business, so keep this up and you’ll be bankrupt before you know it. Had a buyer say the Kate Spade Wallet I sent her was counterfeit while it had all the original authentic markings on it. eBay did absolutely nothing in my defense. Canceling my account if I ever get my wallet back from this scam artist buyer! I’ve never had issues like this on Poshmark or Mercari-it’s worth the fees they take to be protected.",1
2248,Sellers beware: I’ve been with eBay since 2005 and I’ve always had good things to say about eBay. Until today sold an item to a customer saying I do not except returns she opened a case and eBay refunded her money and I have to pay the return shipping? I lost almost $300 on the sell. With having to pay the shipping to her and to back to me? This to me is absolutely crazy on large items I do not offer a return shipping because of the shipping cost.,4
2249,"Updates make horrible experience: The latest update has made listing on the mobile app almost impossible & definitely not user friendly at all. It doesn’t allow for elaboration on the condition or the store category. If you list a BIN, the default setting is to allow buyers to submit offers so you must go back & deselect every single listing. The update is irritating and makes selling quite a chore.",5
2250,"Useful Service: eBay has been very useful to sell things that deserve more than garage sale prices. The improvements they have made in listing, communicating, shipping and uploading pictures makes selling very easy. That being said, the fees are on the high side to try to make any money on an item and then they encourage you to pay for the shipping out of your pay which at times hardly makes it worth to sell. Overall it is useful to me if I use eBay carefully.",4
2251,"It Continues to be Such a Pleasure: Ebay means a great deal to us and has for many years. Whether we are selling or buying, ebay is a fair, easy, and enjoyable marketplace. 

You can part with items knowing that they are off to where they will be used and appreciated. You will find both shopping and buying are quite satisfying. Find or sell your next terrific treasure here on ebay.",5
2252,"Stop changing and removing preferences and options. Go back to the last version!: Stop changing the look and feel of the app. You've ruined the selling portion of the app. It never needed any changes, but you went ahead and gave it a new skin. You removed multiple options (immediate payment/ buyer requirements/ and others that you could put in the app). You want more people using your app, add to it! Give us all the options! Now the loading of the app is 3-4x slower within ""selling"". Stop changing the skin of everything and just stick with what we are all used to. Give us the option to revert back to the old style. It worked much better anyways.",1
2253,"Lots of good features.: Enjoy the promptness of postings, searches, and sales. 
However, when searching, the photos 
of the searched items are way too small. Photos of only one Seller are easily viewed; all other sellers of that searched item are too small photos -- only if you click on every single listing, do you get a decent-sized view of what you might want to purchase.
 eBay staff are quite helpful, if you have questions or concerns. 
The Seller Dashboards are too detailed and complicated. A simpler navigation and fewer details would be nicer.",3
2254,"eBay makes it too hard to get them involved when things go wrong: I’ve been having problems with a seller for months. An expensive item arrived broken.  I did everything they asked me to do to process their insurance claim, and I have yet to receive replacement.  throughout this whole process, I have searched diligently on every part of eBay’s platform, and cannot find a way to get eBay involved in this transaction. It would be nice if they made it easy to get their help.",3
2255,Seriously: eBay is in decline for several reasons. One significant reason is their fees and charges to do business. Selling low dollar items is nearly impossible due to the outrageous fees one must pay. Then you couple that with PayPal (owned by ebay) and it takes all the profit out. They will pay the ultimate price and go out of business unless they begin to give the little guys a break.,5
2256,My joy in Life: eBay brings me many hours of joy.  I love to check in and see what sellers have to offer.  It’s my go to place when there is something not easily accessible to me in nearby retail stores.  I can find just about any and everything on eBay.  Many thanks for a positive experience.  I’ve been shopping and occasionally selling here for years.  It is a 5 star rating from me!,5
2257,"Please fix the bugs!: Use the app all the time but there’s been a bug around quite a while… when opening an item on your watched list, it removes the heart or watch indicator on the item. If you close the item and go back to the list and don’t notice, it removes it from your watch list and if you don’t remember the specifics you’ve lost it. I guess I could go to recent items, but its a pain. Doesn’t happen all the time but frequent enough that I am writing here about it.",3
2258,"Don’t spam notifications. Keep it what people actually care about.: Don’t spam notifications. Keep it what people actually care about. I literally install this app and block notifications due to spam. Please only keep the default notifications limited to what we should know alert wise. A better way would be to make it so limited that while we use the app, you can suggest notifications along the way.",4
2259,"My how eBay has changed: Haven’t used eBay in a few years. Used to use it frequently and it was super easy.  This time it’s like applying for a secret clearance in order to sell. I tried listing an item and eBay wouldn’t let me list it until I gave them a copy of my drivers license, date of birth and SSN. Then I had to link a bank account which is normal in order to get paid.  eBay said I would receive a small deposit with 48hrs and never did. I never was able to successfully create a “new” account so I have up. I use other listing services.",2
2260,"Baralt5757: Been shopping on EBay for 25 years. They have everything you need and everything you cannot find locally or online. They have the best prices for clothes and designer items. They have the cheapest prices. Stopped buying from China, not only because of the Covid, but they have poor quality products. The clothes are irregular and small, electrical items are faulty.",5
2261,"I once had that!: It has been fun finding so many of the items my family once owned. The greatest gift I gave my mom was a whole set of dishes she was given on her wedding day just to destroy everything except a sugar bowl. I matched the set on eBay from that one sugar bowl and presented it to her and my dad on their 50 anniversary. This was priceless. Mom and dad have passed away and I divided the set amount my three daughters. Thanks,",5
2262,"New make offer - fail: I don’t like the new make offer “upgrade”.  I don’t like that you need to enter payment info before the seller even accepts the offer. I also understand why it sends me an email stating that if they accept, my payment will go through. It is confusing for the buyer and I feel it will keep people from making offers and this will hurt sellers.",5
2263,"The best online market: I have been buying/selling mostly buying on eBay for almost 15yrs. They actually just thanked me for being a loyal customer for so many years. They stand behind their clients wether they are buyers or sellers. They do their investigation in depth & in a timely manner. I really cannot think of 1 complaint about eBay right now! 
In 15yrs I can count the amount of issues/situations I’ve had with other subscribers on 1 hand. (Not many)
Each & Every time, eBay has handled the situation well, and promptly..
100% Satisfied as a 15yr. Client/Customer of eBay.. I can’t think of anything that eBay needs to changed , adjust or modify..!

2265,Latest update needs bug fixes: No longer shows when a favorite seller has items for sale. Watched items no longer pulls up details of the auction. Just specifies “buying options” and the when select it just says “seller doesn’t ship to USA” and this is one of my favorite sellers. Tried to uninstall and go back to last version but not possible. Sad,5

2267,"NO SELLER PROTECTION. YOU’LL PROBABLY LOSE MONEY.: I updated my information via the app multiple times but it was not updated on via all platforms. This cause me to lose money as a seller when a buyer returned merchandise to the wrong address and I was unable to retrieve it. Ebay’s customer service was able to see that my address was updated but said there was nothing that they could do to help retrieve my sold merchandise. The item was returned to the buyer after I, as a seller, processed their refund. The only way I became aware that eBay had not updated my information was through USPS tracking. I also had to pay seller fees on this item.",1
2268,eBay is a wonderland.: If you ever wonder about things.....look them up on eBay. You will be amazed how some items you never thought existed actually do. And those items can be acquired. eBay is amazing. I just wish EBay had a 1 800 # when customers get ripped off. EBay is no where to be seen when that happe 1 spend thousands of dollars a year on EBay and now I can not get on. Why!!!,5
2269,"Improving: Recently went to sell something for the first time in a few years. Since it had been so long, I had to do a manual identify verification process which involved eBay calling me to ask me some personal questions. While I was initially annoyed at taking the extra time, looking back now I’m glad they took that extra step to provide strong identify verification.",5
2270,"Use it all the time… not quite perfect: I LOVE EBay. I shop on it every single day and find some of everything. Only thing that needs improvement is the list feature.

On the computer you are able to arrange items in your watchlist into custom, more specific lists. You cannot do that on the app. Once I am able to do that it will pretty much be perfect!

Thanks.",5
2271,"So easy to use: I have a physical store and come home.  While I am at home, eBay lets me know when I have a sale or a question from a customer.  I haven’t set up a computer yet at home.

I can also list and revise with the app.  I am new to this app and feel it is only going to get even better!! Thanks eBay!!!",5
2272,"sellers beware ! Terrible fees and hidden charges: So i was pretty frustrated that an item that sold for $750 (costed $500) got eBay a nice profit of $150 and left me with $50 (it had a listing fee of $50 and said that the fee will change based on sale price which is acceptable but it’s not that the fee was changed but an entirely new fee was charged)...
I took the loss on it and decide to just no sell on eBay again but then today (2.5 weeks later) I got hit with another fee of $50 ..... Honestly so tired of it I might just dispute all of the fees in their entirety with my bank, for sure this $50 one at the very least.

When I tried to buy a graphics card for $300, the package never arrived after three months, I opened up a case to get my money back and closed it when the seller agreed to refund me. He didn’t, and since you can’t open a case again, I haven’t gotten my money back. When I tried to sell some old tech, the buyer attempted to pull a gift card scam and have me buy a $500 gift card and send them the info, and they’d send the money after. 0/10 would not recommend eBay if you are interested in actually buying or selling something.",1

This means I make fewer eBay purchases as a result. Disappointing!",5
2278,"Best match changed eBay: Unfortunately best match automatic search option took away the unique and amazing character of eBay. It allowed the big box monopolies to take over the private small business domain and made eBay not special anymore.  Now it’s not eBay anymore but just a clearing platform for big box stores to sell their overstock at a tiny discount,  but there is no more variety or interesting items that kept me looking and enjoying the site.

2279,"Can’t even use the app to use the app?: When I was registering online on Chrome, the website told me that I couldn’t register because of some java thing and told me to download the app. After downloading the app, the exact same thing happened; telling me that I can’t register because the app itself couldn’t run Java.
Now I have to get my computer. If I can’t use my phones web browser to register to eBay and I can’t use the eBay app itself to register to eBay, what’s the point of it?

2281,Stop updating and ruining the app: STOP PUTTING OUT TERRIBLE UPDATES!!!!!!The only reason I even do anything on eBay is because of the mobile app. But every time it’s updated there is some new bug that didn’t happen in the previous version.

When I went to print shipping labels for my sold items yesterday I got a message notifying me that the app no longer allows you the option to print your labels. Why in the world would you do that? I don’t have a PC so how am I supposed to ship my items? The mobile version of the website also has no printing option. 

Also, please remove the auto accept offers setting when relisting items. I do not accept offers and I have to manually go through each item and turn it off. It is ridiculously time consuming and tedious. Please let people opt out of this. It is a tremendous waste of my time to have to do this when I didn’t ask for it!!! 

I was also going to mention how you can’t print a packing slip from the app but it may be a mute point now since I can no longer ship anything through the app altogether. 

Please get it together!",2
2283,SELLERS PLEASE READ: There is a lot of scammers that will offer more than the regular price in ur mind your like you’ll take the money then they will say buy something then they will send u the money. They scammer I encountered told me to use my own 400 dollars to spend to buy sumthing for his boss and send him an extra 100 for shipping. After that I knew he was a fraud I was selling him a new Xbox with a lot of games he wouldn’t give me his address or atleast send half of the money.,5
2284,"Great app, buyer protection is great: Whenever the seller decides to not ship my item, ebay always steps in and gives me a refund.

The quick crediting of my paypal for refunds or for sales enables me to purchase more goods from ebay faster.

Love the shipping, pricing, and quality of product on ebay. Has better or comparative pricing to other online merchants and usually better selection on more niche categories such as video games, vinyl records, or figures. I’ve ordered 100s of vinyl records and they are always delivered in perfect condition, which surprises me because out of the 5 times i’ve ordered a vinyl record directly from an artist, 2 times the vinyl record was slightly bent and required flattening out for a week under a weight to work properly.

International orders are a breeze with ebay too.",5
2285,"Ebay customer service: I asked Ebay to eliminate a purchase that the seller was not accepting payments for and even though I told them I contacted the seller asking to accept payment, of which was verified by Ebay they told me I have to wait a month and if he still does not accept payment I would be listed as non payment. This is a black mark against me even though I tried in vain. Why not list the seller as a non voucher instead.",5
2286,"DICTATORSHIP APP!: I use to Love selling on eBay, it was convenient and easy. Now the app has totally take all of that away! It’s much more of a Dictatorship feel now, all control over your listings have been lost. The app makes far too many suggestions and even takes it upon itself to apply options without your approval. Most of which are nearly impossible to reverse or remove, and to the Sellers is Absolutely unfair and uncalled for!",5
2287,"Reliability, security and fluidity. Please keep up the evident dedication. Thanks EBay 👾: Maybe one constructive comment worth bringing to your attention, in my opinion, when outsourcing customer service please train on professionalism via contacting sellers on your behalf. I was quite embarrassed by one message sent to a problematic seller who further harassed me after the representative contacted him without using an official eBay response. Other than that kudos and pat yourselves on the back :)

2288,"e-Baying for fun!: The best site online for sheer fun is e-Bay. Making money from a hobby like this one, enjoyable and convenient, is icing on the cake. 

I love how easy it is to list an item, and how conveniently the listings can be revised. eBay keeps in touch beautifully, always letting me know if my pricing could be adjusted for a quicker sale, or reminding me how much time I have to ship a package once it’s sold. 

Most fun of all is profiting from sales which fund my own buying. I can keep up with new listings from my favorite sellers, or items I collect, brands I love, or something I’ve searched for, such as a gift I’m  trying to find. 

This is the best organized site online, hands down. I truly want to thank eBay staff and designers for their contributions to making my life so much more enjoyable. 

Longcrl",5
2289,"New update makes listing items more time consuming and has removed important features: The redesign has made listing items for sale much more cumbersome. Photo uploads and minor modifications to listings are significantly slower, and there is no ability to block buyers with multiple unpaid item cases. The old app was far from perfect, but this update has gone backwards. Stick with the old app for as long as you can.",5
2290,"My source for EVERYTHING: Whenever I need (or want) an item, no matter what it might be, Ebay is my first stop. I’ve purchased everything from cellular phones to tires and wheels for both my vehicles off Ebay. I have also sold a number of items on Ebay as well.

2291,"Ebay: so versatile!: Ebay is great for so many reasons: finding one-of-a-kind items, stocking up on your favorite “whatever” product that was JUST discontinued, buying Christmas decorations from (for example) the 50s that you adored as a child but never thought you’d see again, and on and on.  I’ve even found my favorite brand of clothing, in my size, tags still attached, for about 10% of the retail price. 😊 Suffice to say, I love it - maybe a bit too much, as my bank balance can show!",4
2292,"eBay: eBay Is a little silly. They continue to remove items that are against their policy's which is extremely frustrating. I sell items to collectors, mainly Militaria but other items too. Recently eBay put my account on a 3 day hold because something was offensive. Well I’ll tell you something. Maybe instead of reporting an item that offended you, maybe you should keep scrolling instead of crying about it and having to go find your safe space. Grow up and move on. 

So eBay and people who get offended just grow up. If you see something you don’t like keep scrolling or go cry about it to someone in your safe space corner! 

Have a good day.",1
2293,"Update Fail!!!!: Big mistake allowing my iPhone 6S to auto update the eBay app. Since it happened I can’t see the number of views my listings are getting. Always set at 0. Deleted it, reinstalled. No change. 
I use my app all the time. Am now worried from reviews that buyers are having a hard time with purchase transactions. eBay claims that more than 50% of sales originate from mobile devices. If so, this app needs to be fixed. Pronto!!!",5
2294,"Ebay doesn’t care about its customers: I have had so many bad experiences dealing with ebay. It’s takes forever to get them to resolve issues with sellers. The last time I purchased an item on eBay, the seller sent my package to the wrong state. When I tried reaching out to eBay, they said they would not refund my money because there was tracking on the package and it was delivered. This makes no sense to me! I am now boycotting eBay!!",5
2295,"Unanswered Questions/Offers: As a long time eBay shopper, I usually enjoy the experience, but every now and then I run into a seller who just ignores my offer or question. I would like to see eBay develop a way to encourage sellers to respond to all questions and offers.

I also would appreciate notice at the end of a watched item’s listing as to whether or not that item sold. I can tell that only on auctioned items now.",5
2296,"Doesn’t refresh: Mostly works well but there are a few annoyances. When the listing you are watching has ended, it will remain in the “watching” queue rather than going to ended. Also, items that are delivered will still show “shipped” rather than updating to “delivered”, even after restarting or refreshing/updating.  Many of the issues I are similar, and have to do with refreshing the preview screens/listing with accurate information (time left in auction will say 6hrs left even though there is 20 mins), etc.",3
2297,My Ebay Experience: Hi my Ebay Esperance W still use it because it is probably the Best way for me to find something and see it from many different sellers. Problem is Most sellers are not selling stuff they have in stock. So now it takes much longer for me to find what I am looking for. And rarely do I find a Seller with good enough Feedback to trust. So Sad I am now stuck with a Bunch of Bad Ebay sellers making Have a bad Reputation. I really miss my Good Ebay days.,5
2298,"Not reliable to be used as a seller account ..!: Whenever I try to check my listings,when I try to open the page it says (you don’t have any listings yet..). I have to keep on trying for a couple of times or close the app then reopen it again multiple times,then to finally show my listings to appear there and sometimes still doesn’t show it (depending on its mood on that day).

So frustrating..",5
2299,"Old Ebay was better: I like how Ebay was set up a few years ago, it’s gotten harder to navigate if you’re a seller and it feels like seller rates are next to nothing where buyers get away with everything. I think eBay has to revert and go back to how it was a few years ago. It made the sellers a lot more demanding than harder to get along with. I also feel they should bring back payments other than just PayPal, I liked it when postal money orders were still around for payment, I can ship at the same time I cash the check!",3
2300,"Greatest Place to Shop!: I love eBay! eBay stands by their policies and they look out for their customers. I've been with them long enough to know.  I've seen them in operation from both sides as a Buyer and a Seller, and eBay believes in doing things the right way. They have a high integrity, they're dedicated to their customers, and they are professional from every aspect of their business. There's no better online place to shop than eBay.",5
2301,Mandatory Unlawful Tracking: eBay requires tracking to use their app now. That’s ridiculous and is an egregious bypassing of apples new policy. Update. Still unresolved. Now it requires the complete disabling of privacy toggles with the new privacy update for the entire system. This includes apps not even run by eBay or relevant. Give stars for the motivation to write to my congressman to initiate investigations into eBay and Apple and privacy law.,5
2302,"E-BAY is Great: I use E-Bay a lot. When looking for out of date items, I can always count on E-Bay to deliver. I also purchase a lot of clothes as well. You can check the seller’s record, communication is awesome, prices are great and you can negotiate and delivery is always on time. Overall one of the very best on-line stores I have ever used. I have used for years and will continue to use. Thanks E-Bay for doing it right.",5
2303,"Are you kidding me??: I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with the app's ill-timed user survey. As I was right in the middle of bidding on an item I'd tracked diligently for an entire week, a survey thoughtlessly interrupts the process. This led to my bid not being placed and me losing the auction! This is an unacceptable situation, compromising critical moments in the auction process. It's high time to rethink the timing of these feedback requests. We're here for auctions, not ill-timed surveys!",5
2304,"Bans you if your stationed overseas: I created an account, added my home of record address as a billing address and my APO address as shipping. Then when I purchased my first item it permanently suspended my account. When inquired on why no reason was given other than it’s policy not to tell you. So lost over $300 because eBay thinks if you a soldier stationed overseas you must be fake, and will never let you purchase them again. Also forget on knowing why even if you have proof of everything being legitimate because they don’t care and won’t tell you. Then hang up. 100% don’t trust them is overseas.",1
2305,"Selling Flaw: I am a seller. The problem I am having is when I have multiple of the same item, the system will allow my store to sell more than I have on hand of that said item if the purchases are made before the items are shipped. I then have to refund the buyer which is a strike against me. I am now below standard and most of it is due to this problem. I don’t know how to fix it nor do I know how to contact eBay to to discuss.  Any help from this review would be appreciated.",3
2306,"Scummy: I’ve only sold one item, and for starters it takes forever to get your money after you sell your item. The main issue for me was the scan promoted listings. When it tried to offer it to me and i opened up to the window to read about them it didn’t say anywhere that it would take out a VERY large fee for this promoted listing. $80 in my case, the regular fees they take out were pretty large as well. I expected them to take some money but I didn’t expect it to be this massive and they don’t communicate it with you at all. I sold my item for $625 and only got $430 of it absolutely absurd.",1
2307,"Getting onto eBay: Being that I have many devices I always have trouble getting onto eBay. None of my passwords work they may work for some but not for others so I unfortunately have to get on as a guest and sometimes I don’t want to make the effort and consequently I’ve passed on hundreds of items that I would’ve normally bid on, otherwise eBay is wonderful",5
2308,"Great Products to Buy!: I almost always shop on eBay for smartphones, tablets, accessories, and shoes at reasonable prices. Most of the products I purchased from eBay were in good to excellent condition. If I have any problems with my purchase, the sellers and customer service representative resolve my issues quickly with refunds or replacements. I highly recommend eBay for your online shopping needs.",5
2309,Value: Over the years eBay has provided great value for a huge variety of items. The sellers are generally honorable and professional. After using the service to purchase as well as sell myself I have been very pleased with my fellow eBayers. Even though things don’t always work out communication has transaction by transaction given me confidence to continue.,5
2310,Difficult to use: I’m an eBay seller and it is very difficult to use. I have been trying to put this bank account into the app and it just says that there has been a problem with the verification of the account. I have other apps that I sell stuff on and I haven’t had any problems. eBay is just too complicated and hard for no reason.,5
2311,"App is great, but new messaging feature is buggy: The app is just great... a very pleasurable experience.  However, eBay has a new messaging experience, and it's VERY buggy.  The typing dialog box will just disappear randomly.  Sometimes, the text you've typed will come back, and sometimes it won't.  This is my experience on both my iPad Air (3rd gen) and my brand new iPhone 14 Pro.  Not sure why.",5
2312,"Website Issues Wrecked Business: I spent 2 years building a nice little side business. Then I moved. Seems simple, but eBay won’t let me update my address. I’ve been calling in for a month pleading for help with no luck. Sadly my profitable side business does not work if I can’t purchase things. They haven’t offered the first thing to offset my loses. eBay has 100% killed my business.",5
2313,"Fake Accts: So far I’ve had 3 buyers in just 3 days offer full price for an item and not follow thru.  In addition, 2 of the 3 wanted me to call or text them with some questions they have or want to discuss the item.  I replied kindly, that I only communicate they eBay messaging.  Therefore, I’ve not heard from any of them yet!  I’ve resisted each item. Sadly, not a good experience other than a learning one!",5
2314,"A last resort at best: I only use eBay because it is the most poplar platform for online sales of used products. However the anything handled by eBay itself (ie refunds, claims, dealing with dishonest sellers etc) is terrible. Although it is a incredibly profitable business, they will do everything in their power to not spend a dime on making things fair for you. 

They are (or were) a partner with PayPal, which has been in trouble in federal court for unjustly freezing individuals accounts, which technically “legally” gives them the opportunity to use others money. 

I highly recommend avoiding this companies as much as possible",1
2315,"Horrible Design: I can’t even use the phone app to shop eBay.  Far too cumbersome.  Click on a listening and rather than easily seeing all the information about that auction and the seller, you must sift through tons of garbage you didn’t request.  If you’re going to force the user to see things they didn’t request, then at least push all the extra items and material to the bottom of the page.  Also, here’s a novel suggestion. Why not make sure the added garbage is st least remotely related to what the person is looking for.  Frustrating and insulting to one’s intelligence.",1
2316,"Good For Buying: Two stars, because of buying. Zero stars for the selling aspect. Mobile listing could be much more streamlined. However, it wouldn't matter, because the fees that are charged are theft.

I hadn't sold on eBay for a while, and I wish I went a different route to sell my items.

I was charged a final value fee on taxes, I didn't even collect tax money. That's a loss. I was charged a final value fee on calculated shipping cost. That's a loss. Then they have a variable final value fee of the item, where they can just decide to take 12% or 15%, or whatever they want. ~$310 in sales got me ~$208, and only ~$35 of it was shipping. Scum I tell you.",1
2317,"eBay: I’ve had some great customer service and some not so great. I guess it’s with who your dealing with when purchasing items from sellers. When I get my items that I’ve purchased I do leave a feedback on my experience with the seller I purchased from. But, all in all I’ve had great overall customer service and it just depends on the day of who I made a deal with. HAPPY SHOPPING!!!",5
2318,"Love Ebay!: I absolutely love Ebay!  The app is so user friendly.   Items are easy to find, easy to bid/make offers on & easy to pay for.  I appreciate the ability to track my purchases.  You guys have been rocking it forever.  I was a customer when you first got started.  Took a long break & fell back in love in recent years.  I browse all the time & have found so many treasures.",5
2319,"Where the duce are the shipping labels?: I just sold something, and the shipping label link in the email opens up the browser version.  There's nowhere in the app dedicated to shipping labels, and even on the page for the sold item, there's nowhere for the individual shipping label.  I guess I have to set up my computer to print it off.

Pretty much everything else feels like the website well-translated onto a phone. Few complaints anywhere else.  Otherwise satisfying to use.

I love the notification jingle :)",3
2320,Seller rating defective rate: I think it’s busier to explain why an item was defective to eBay or Why item was canceled. I don’t see any way to do this I just see it looks cut and dry that if it’s canceled or if it’s removed it shows on your feedback instead of being able to explain why the customer caused an issue or there was an issue that is easier to be explained to a agent then just getting a derogatory mark on your seller dashboard.,5
2321,"Previous Version MUCH Better: There are many new features which don’t give me the same user experience that I liked before this latest release.  Like others have stated, customization is a big deal to me.  The share item selection does not work at all.  The suggestions/similar images doesn’t factor in the filters selected.  As a matter of fact, the filters are reset with adding or subtracting search words.  Having to reselect filters can be quite irritating.  Sorry eBay, this version is less than optimal for me.",2
2322,"Good when started but terrible customer service: Been a member since 2010, usually purchase 2-3 things per year, upon trying to sell an item I got suspended indefinitely cant use the platform anymore. When asking why they reserve the reasons, after building a profile for +10 years with 100% positive feedback they do this for no reason. (Trust me I’ve asked more than once) 
This is definitely a platform I will no longer use even if they decide to lift the suspension, no customer service number only email and chat only. 

This type of behavior will ruin your platform. I will use facebook marketplace for exactly the same purpose.",1
2323,Excellent Service & Concept: Has really improved my life selling on eBay and it’s an excellent community. I’m glad it’s giving me an opportunity to also share some of the products I use for back issues w others at low prices and the system is user friendly:) Great experience and I hope I can improve eBay as well w my store. What an amazing concept to improve people’s lives and empower them through commerce.,5
2324,eBay app: I use this app on my phone all the time.  I take the photos and can crop and edit right on the app.  When something is sold or paid for you get a notification works out great! I am from old school eBay where you had to upload the photos to your computer etc. this is a dream. The only thing I have to go on the computer for is my account and that is safer to pay you bill etc.!,5
2325,"The only things I want: I want a function to search individual sellers pages, instead of just scrolling forever.
And I want it to be easier to contact eBay directly about bad sellers. I’ve been waiting on a seller to reply to me for months about a product he has failed to ship. I need to get on my pic and look up how to contact you guys directly. It’s annoying",5
2326,"Customer service communication.: My favorite part of a eBay was the ability to speak to customer service representatives but the last couple times I’ve tried it did not happen, there was no option. When will I be able to speak with customer service representatives again? It was great to speak to a human being over the phone and they were excellent problem solvers.",4
2327,"Sometimes quirky: Often I would choose “Sell Similar” when I try to list and some of the settings do not copy over. One case in point is that I charge $5.95 for shipping plus $2 for each additional item. I had 12 of the same item sold and the extra $2 did not copy, so the person paid $5.95 for all 12 items. I then had to contact the person and try to explain that the eBay app messed up. They were not happy. Talked to some others that use the app and they said phantom things happen to them too....",3

2329,"Question for devs: App is really good and stable, I'm only missing two things:
I cannot find my dashboard to keep up with my fees and power seller reqs, why do I have to use the website for that?
Also, when I'm looking at my ""Selling"" page all of the listings show price and underneath it says +shipping, but it's painful to not be able to see if it's free shipping (I pay) or additional (buyer pays)

2330,"eBay Support & rules: I started using eBay to list a couple items for sale and it lasted one week before I realized how backwards and old this platform is. 

It’s full of scammers and lowballers in addition to a non existent support team. The prompts for support are a cheap way to not pay additional employees to help people. 

It’s been a week since I reported fraud and got no response. Now I’m subject to a fee because of wanting to close my listing/account. 

I reported the user, filed a claim with my listing, and the platform still forces me to keep my listing and not delete it. A prompt came up saying I owe $160 because of fake accounts sending offers.....talk about a scam/no protection to a seller. I can’t block someone who keeps trying to provoke me as they keep sending low ball offers. 

No wonder all the other selling platforms are being used more, I feel like I went to a bad neighborhood on the internet and avoided getting robbed twice with no police (eBay) to help.",1

2334,"User-Unfriendly On Purpose: The app is fine for buyers, but a nightmare for selling. Ebay is trying hard to shove certain listing options, like accepting offers on auctions, down the throats of sellers. The app constantly defaults to those options every time you make an unrelated change to the listing or when you re-list. It is a huge time-waster for sellers to constantly change the options back, and enay does not allow you to do away with those defaults. Trying to grind down your users like this is not how you sell features.",3
2335,"eBay supports fraud: This isn’t only about the app, which is mediocre at best, but the rampant fraud supported by eBay.  Too many sellers list fake or counterfeit products ranging from cosmetics and accessories to even charging cables and adapters.  What’s more is that eBay allows sellers to delete listings even after they’re purchased — thus preventing you from writing any feedback.  There is also no enforcement taken against sellers of fake products and no avenue to use proof when trying to report frauds.  You support this behavior by using eBay and getting screwed when your products fail just because you were trying to save a few dollars.  STOP BUYING FROM EBAY UNTIL THEY ADDRESS IT.",1

2338,"Another Astounding Failure: Yet again, eBay software writers have created another astounding failure for eBay app users. Unless you are an eBay stockholder, you will not benefit from using this latest version of their app. It is primarily updated to provide yet more opportunities for eBay to make more money off of buyers & sellers, by forcing sellers towards listing errors, omissions, inaccuracies, unreasonable listing prices (that benefit eBay, and cost the seller). It is now more difficult to view your listings efficiently, or sort to most recent (GONE!), replaced by a shallow, unsubstantiated notion of what sellers want/need.

Forcing incorrect information on my listing causing confusion to my buyers or forcing me to cancel loose my followers and relist.  Lastly 10% is egregious.

Good luck finding how to pay the eBay invoice. Which came long after in the form of a collection notice. It seems to be a common problem because when you give up and search the help section they tell you your total due which doesn't match the invoice. So good luck finding out the reason you owe money. 

Better pay or you are going to collectors.

During the selling process if you want to deal with a potential buyer, the messaging section of the app is half email half message. They block most communication in the fear of people making outside the site deals. 

When we decided on a price it was impossible to edit the total to include free shipping so I had to reimburse the buyer via cash included in the shipment. I got charged a fee on the overcharge obviously. 

Like I said nothing is impossible but this app tells you otherwise😢",1

I used to watch auctions and sometimes you could see the same bidders bid up an item but never buy it. That move took away a good thing for the buyer.

2348,eBay: I love the iPhone app much better. The msg system works better and its much easier to update items listed for sale. But I'm an eBay junkie and spend a lot of time on this site. i do have one complaint. that is i’m not able to sort out brands i don’t want to see. this app has been updated many times but this is a feature i would love to see work again.,5
2349,"New version: Downloaded new version after notification that old version will no longer be supported. Very ""buggy"". Purchase history frequently says no purchases in last 60 days (I have 3 items on the way). Made another purchase a few hours ago. Still not showing up when the other purchases DO show up.  Hope they fix this issue. 
ADDENDUM: 1 week later still using 2 versions of app.  New purchases taking up to a day to show up in new app.  Search feature no longer works on old app.",3
2350,"App is easy: And very simple to use. I haven't had to use my computer for anything in months. The app is great.

Only thing I'd change, sometimes you need the PC version to see something or do some action, the app should have a feature where I hit PC and it takes me into Safari or Chrome in the PC Version in case I needed to use something on one of those screens. It would be able to take me to the same screen in on but the full version, and I'd already be signed in or verified because the app would have directed me there. 

Then there is a button on this version that says Mobile and it pops right into my preferred mobile, be that my phone or tablet. Make it easy for me to use it in sync and on the go with my PC or MAC. 

Just a thought.",5
2351,"TOP NOTCH APP: Fantastic and convenient! Really helps streamline eBay sales efforts & shipping while on the go. Sometimes being able to sit down in front of a computer just isn't an option. 

The only critiques I can offer is that it would be nice to access both eBay store vacation settings and have the ability to mark buyers listings/purchases to remain anonymous like you can on the official eBay website. 

Great app! I give it a 95%!",5
2352,Jannett845: In the years that I’ve been using eBay I’ve only had a handful of if that of concerns. Every single time eBay protected my purchases. I have spent thousands but saved as much. Thank you eBay for your care of your customers. The sellers are just as trustworthy. Breakages will always happen but the replacements cannot. I appreciate those sellers who take care to pack so carefully thank you.,5
2353,"Miss the old format: I guess if I used a computer instead of my phone to shop I could (?) still see and use the old format for shopping.  Everything was much easier to navigate and find in all categories.  If you look at my buying records you’ll see that I’ve nearly quit buying on eBay since the change.  I used to buy many times a month and now I can go a year and not get anything-it’s all to hard to find.  Even within one store I can’t find what I’m looking for.  If there was a way to see it the old way on my phone, I’d be buying a lot more-and far more often.",1
2354,"Easiest method for determining which seller to buy from!: eBay let me look for the Desktop PC for me; especially letting me decide what options, operating system , and hardware to that I want!   Using their wishlist to lump like built PC’s together; so that I could “Fine Tune” my PC.  This was faster than some of the other websites!   Plus being able to use PayPal made paying much easier too!",5
2355,"Unsolicited Offers Make Me Crazy: If I search for something and may want to buy it, I put it in my watch list.  If I don’t want it, I keep searching.  I get dozens of offers for items in which I am not the least bit interested, and it is time consuming and frustrating to decline them.  If I don’t want it, I don’t watch it.  And there is no way to talk to eBay about this.  i have tried repeatedly.  The automated assistant doesn’t understand the problem and will not connect me to a human.  Argh!  I spend a lot of money on eBay but this may cause me to stop.",2
2356,"Be careful as you can be restricted without warning on any subjective policy: The restriction process is unfair as it can restrict WITHOUT ANY WARNING, so BEWARE. And many “policies” are subjective and not black and white. Otherwise it can be fun to use, but their “Back Office Team” is not accessible to discuss cases. I was considering becoming a seller on this platform but I’m wary now and may seek services through other platforms. It’s a shame. Very disappointed.",5
2357,So easy to use and such great profit: Love this app! We lost at least 7 things a week an typically sell between 7-10. The app is easy to list - take pictures - find profitable items and pricing and they continue to make even more user friendly features. Though we have become more of a seller - it’s still an awesome place to find deals to buy.,5
2358,"Listing demotions: eBay has taken two of my listings Down in which I feel we’re not accurate to the policy 

1. Chaos serial killer and natural disaster card collection was taken down which buyers are heavy in collecting and still have listing and sales from other sellers 

2. A custom made card was taken down that I listed as an error card because when I purchased the card from an eBay seller I received a wander Franco card in a slab that said Aaron rodgers. This seller is an authenticated artist and was a legit error card",3
2359,"I was scammed: Who would have thought that eBay would have sided with a possible scammer over its customer.
I purchased an item that never made it to my address. After reaching out to the seller and eBay, eBay concluded that the item was delivered because the seller has a tracking number that proves it, after i contacted fedex with the tracking number, fedex was pleased to tell me that the tracking number the seller provided to me didn’t have my name or address on it, yet eBay conspired with the customer to take my hard earned money like it was nothing. I’m really hurting because i paid for my item willfully.",1
2360,"Enjoying eBay: I use eBay for the majority of my shopping. Each time I purchase an item, I find myself satisfied with my purchase. There isn’t much effort involved, and the items that can be purchased are seemingly endless. I would recommend eBay to anyone, and in fact have done so many times. I hope you enjoy this review and your experience on eBay.",5
2361,"Ebay Has Been Taken Over By Scam Artists And Ebay Assists Them With Dumb Policies: A guy bought a computer from me and documented that he broke it.  I showed the documentation to eBay whose policy was that I had to refund it even though he documented himself breaking it, and that then after refunding him I could try to collect the money back from him on my own.  Buying on eBay is ok, and fantastic if you’re a professional scam artist, but never sell anything that you can’t afford to just throw away.  The scammers want expensive items that they can keep, re-sell, AND get a refund on.  eBay will try and pass the total costs onto you.",1
2362,Shipping costs: The shipping costs often are more than the items purchased. I do not bid on many items because of this. Now we have the government with their hands in our pockets by charging the buyer sales tax?! As an eBay customer for many years I am ready to say goodbye to “no good buys”. You allow a seller to cancel a bid even though buyer has already paid. All they have to say is that it “broke” if they think it didn’t sell for enough. There should be a penalty to the seller for this.,3
2363,"eBay steals from sellers: The percentage of sale fees you take from sellers is way too high. Worse yet, eBay straight of steals my shipping fees. Never once have I printed a shipping label from eBay, I hand write everything on my packaging, yet eBay takes a high percentage of my sales, plus all of my shipping fees! What give you the right to take my shipping costs when I do not print labels from you!? You have no right to steal that shipping fee from sellers. If you address this with customer service, you just get nonsense rhetoric in return. The new payout system is also a joke! Unfair and dishonest practices are about to make me abandon eBay completely.",1
2364,"My Experience: This was a beautiful shopping experience!!! I was able to get both of my great/granddaughters exactly what they wanted for Christmas/Birthdays because my 2 year old will turn 3 on the 13 of this month and my 4 year old will turn 5 on Jan. 3. This was pleasant and affordable!! I absolutely love it!!

Thanks for making it all so easy to shop. A great big Thanks to all the sellers and/or vendors!!! You guys ROCK!!!",5
2365,"App makes everything more work: We are a small family owned business trying to sell on eBay. 
First the app was fantastic and very easy to use. 
Then all the sudden every time we would try to post something new it tells me my return policy isn’t valid and I need to select one. Okay, no problem except IT IS selected and has a green check mark by it. 
We now have to get onto the computer to finish listing anything new. 
If we select “sell similar item” and do a new listing that way, we do not have to get onto a computer but if we try to just post something, no matter if we even go into the return policy and reselect our option, it tells us there is no policy in place. 
It is not always possible to do “sell similar” without changing the entire listing so it turns out to be the same amount of work as getting onto computer to finish the drafts. 
Very very frustrating considering it didn’t use to be this way.",1
2366,"Accepted offers.  Receiving payments.: Someone offered me a price on an item.  I accepted their offer.  They then declined to make payment due to “me being too new”.  If someone offers an amount for an item, as a buy now price, that money should be taken from the buyer IMMEDIATELY, similar to the buy now feature.   If the offer is accepted, buyer gets paid.  If not, the money is returned.   This “sale” cost me lots of time that was unnecessarily wasted because of a bad customer, and poor sale programming.  Please fix this and implement cash grabs in this scenario.  Thank you.",2
2367,"Soooo many scammers: I have attempted to use eBay to sell merchandise and it is nearly impossible. My items will get offers and then I will receive an email from the “buyer” asking me to call or text them about the item… EVERY TIME. Scammers want you to ship the item before they pay. I don’t understand why eBay allows 4 days for buyers to pay, they should be required to pay as soon as submitting an offer. 

So meanwhile I’m waiting for payment from the “buyer” and my item is shown as sold and I can’t have it listed for someone to actually purchase it. 
I give up on using eBay, Mercari is much better.",1
2368,"eBay is the way of bringing lost memories back: I am very great full to have eBay in my life, eBay has caught up all the great value items that where lost in time that I remember during my youth, and purchasing these items vintage items has restored my past in a great way. eBay is so well organized that this is a must have in every one’s life! Thank you eBay family thank you 🙏 Myron Jacobs",5
2369,"Good service: eBay is always on top of things, they notify me when a bid is about to end, when someone sends me an offer, what’s related to my searches and when something I’m watching is sold they show me what similar items are available. They protect my profile and payments. I trust eBay and they have always come through. Definitely worth using.
All glory be to God",5
2370,Lots of subpar products and nearly impossible return practice on bad products: I purchased an electronic part for fridge and was not compatible. I wanted to return it but had to have PayPal account even though I was not required one for purchase. I have purchased an X-ray machine and luckily it was a good buy. Now I purchased a “ fake” compression sock for my wife but due to the horrible return practice I will have to discard it.,5
2371,No fair: eBay by itself is great the problem is is that when things do not get delivered and you cannot contact the seller and you paid for the items and you do not get them and nothing is resolved and you’re still out the money I have paid for many items in the last two years that I have not gotten items as much as $300 and other smaller ones so I am not pleased with the financial security or go after the seller to get your money back guarantee,3
2372,"Greatest experiance ever.: I literally buy almost anything on ebay. Ive been able to find pretty much anything im looking for from shoes,cell phones and sporting gear. I almost never go to a mall or an outlet so for me is very convenient if i could i would buy my groceries on ebay those seem to be a little over priced but once im able to buy a grocery item in bulk ill most likely buy it. Thanks ebay.",5
2373,"Good tool: This is a great tool to have if you use eBay a lot. I am a little sad that I can’t blow up items without actually clicking on them, and also it seems that I’m having a more difficult time finding precise items in the search engine. It is pulling up a lot of unrelated products that I didn’t see before I downloaded the app. Otherwise it is a good app.",5
2374,"eBay App review: I’m in the market for a used sports car; preferably a convertible.
I find that the “Watch” option is a practical way to follow specific car bids. You’re able to only follow those cars that fit my budget, and know the location of the car confirming it’s really an option for me.
I’ll continue the process until I find the right car for me.
I’m a huge fan of eBay for ease of use and finding great values.

2375,"Where are all of my purchases?: The latest update, July 2021, limits the number of items to view in the purchases page. This is ridiculous. The purchases pages is how I track shipments and those items requiring feedback. 
I did contact them via the help menu. They showed me one item and suggested I use my computer to view all. True, I can view all on my computer. That isn’t the point. Why have an app if it isn’t completely functional?
Fix it. Please.",3
2376,always been satisfied with my order.: eBay is the best way to shop online for just about anything that you can think of! I have purchased many items from eBay and I have always been satisfied with my order. So I have definitely have been recommending the eBay website to my friends and they all have had a good experience with it.,5
2377,"Better Way: I prefer big screens to actually read descriptions and view photos, but the eBay app is so much better organized than the computer presence. While inputting to sell, the more cluttered desktop app remains the more detailed and best place for that function, but the small platform app like for the iOS products makes viewing and buying far quicker. That may be by design, and if so it works.",5
2378,Need to make an arrow back bar when searching: When looking for items an arrow back and forward would really improve this app and cause a lot less frustration. Having to re enter the search  over and over to continue looking gets tedious. If you arrow back twice you lose your search. Then you have to start all over.,5
2379,Crooks: I just have a comment about the price gouging. These people should be ashamed. Taking advantage of people during this pandemic. I would never buy a can of Lysol disinfectant for $50 . Everyone that is doing this should lose their ability to sell these items. There’s too many for me to contact . Maybe E Bay could do it. They know these people are desperate and will pay anything.,5
2380,"No dark theme integration.: Apple dark theme has been around for quite a while. But ebay app still not supporting it. This is an app people use day and night, it would be very helpful to get the dark theme integration.

Also, app works as it should most of the time. But I’ve been needing to close it a reopen it ever time I refresh the saved screen. Because after a refresh, the first saved search is not accessible.",5
2381,"Entertainment purchasing: Likely the website on which I spend the most time. It is not shopping though more like a game. I like antiques and thrift shops so compare prices to eBay. Also great for finding things you can get absolutely nowhere else. Cars as well, best resource for vintage everything.

2382,"Hard to search: I was looking for a Christmas item and had no luck using the eBay’s search. Then, I searched Google using the same words and in the same order. The item was in the search results and supposedly on eBay. I never found it, even using the link in the photo and description. My daughter used her phone, typed in the eBay search using the same words as I had and in the same order. She found the item and was able to put in a bid. It was going to be her Christmas gift. What’s up eBay?",3
2383,"Sellers are becoming increasingly unreliable: I keep buying things that (a) are not authentic, even though they’re described as “real,” then (b) take weeks to get to me—even after (over)paying for shipping, and (c) are described as being shipped from the U.S. when they are really being shipped from China or Indonesia. These bootlegs are intolerable. More and more, I do not receive any seller contact (despite sending messages). I feel like I’m shopping on WISH or Craigslist. You’re not holding sellers accountable for terrible service, and trying to rectify problematic purchases takes weeks (when there should be an expedited way of getting money back for falsely described shipping fees and goods).",1
2384,Great store until they started with all these fees and taxes: I like to say that eBay is one of the best websites to buy anything from . Until they started with all these fees and tax’s . Free shipping is not free anymore because the hit you with the tax’s and now if you sell anything on eBay you don’t get the whole amount eBay takes a % out from you I don’t it’s fair for us to be paying all these fees and taxes and then they take a cut from your sale..,5
2385,"Good place to find cool items: Very good place to find some cool items. 2 suggestions: when buying, thoroughly review the item and seller, and if selling, don’t be a cheapskate where you pulled it out of the bag and had it in your shelf and you call it new. No. It’s not new, it’s used. But tell them you never did much with it, or whatever. Just be honest and you’ll get a fair price, and be careful and you’ll find what you’re looking for.",5
2386,"Selling on eBay: It may be easy for the younger generation of people to adapt easily in our computer driven world, but I find it frustrating at times to navigate error free. However eBay has provided excellent telephone support that will walk you through any problems you may have, and they do it without complaining. This helps take a lot of mystery out of the process and in time you can learn and enjoy selling.",5
2387,Extremely frustrated: As of late I have found doing business with Ebay to be less than an ideal experience. The last two transactions/purchases I have made have come back to be from “fraudulent account “. Somehow there needs to be better vetting or qualifications for the sellers accounts.  My money gets tied up for weeks before a refund  is issued. I don’t think I will be working with Ebay any longer.,5
2388,"Love It But It Still Has Troubles 😟: eBay has really come a long way. I have visited other apps that try to measure up to eBay but they always fall short!
Buying is so much better on eBay.
However, after the past two updates when you tap on an ended item the picture covers half the information so you can’t see whether someone bid on it or not???
Fix this because it’s very annoying!",5
2389,"Difficult for sellers: New eBay app is not conducive for sellers. Very difficult to list from app when it should be a breeze! Trying to add a best offer FAILS at least 8 times out of 10. You turn it on, and it turns itself right back off!! Shipping options are horrible, you can’t just select your shipping preferences, you have to accept the “suggestion” and then go in and change it. Even when I do all the work on the computer, save as a draft and just use the app to add pictures, it STILL defaults to all this nonsense and deletes the shipping AND best offer option information I added on the computer. A total mess. Bring me the old app back!!",1
2390,On or near my 15th anniversary: My relationship with the EBay way of purchasing things has been tremendous.  Be it Kiwi Fruit Trees to cars and a 36’ Diesel RV every transaction has been both fun and an adventure.  This is a tiny spread of the unique merchandise I bought on EBay & I’ve only be dissatisfied fewer than 4-5 times in thousands of times I’ve gone shopping in Ebay.  EBay stands behind what they sell they want happy customers.,5

I did a search on Google for an item, it showed the listing and when I select it, it takes me to the eBay home page in the app. I simply wanted to see the item so I deleted the app, selected the item in my browser and it took me directly to the item listed in eBay.  After multiple missed auctions and forcing me to view items from searches in Safari to be viewed from the app (not even viewed- I have to submit a new search and then scroll to find), I deleted the app. 

Unfortunately, sessions expire in the browser as well on mobile.",1
2392,"eBay counterfeit items: eBay seems to be loaded with people selling counterfeit items ! 
The one that I see a lot of is counterfeit Tommy Bahama camp shirts and Hawaiian shirts! Also pro sports team gear ! There are countless others as well ! So Buyer Beware !!! 
The sellers on eBay all seem to be more concerned about telling you how great they are and how there feedback record is so wonderful, instead of giving a detailed description of the item they are selling so the buyers are well informed First and foremost!  That’s why you hear terms like Sleezebay  describing how business is conducted and how eBay does not concern themselves with keeping their site clean and free of these sellers !.  
They only care about the Money !!",1
2393,"Unable to list items -  Blank! Nothing! Nada!: Sick and tired of this useless app.  I’ve been trying to sell using this app but it won’t let me complete without putting shipping service and when I clicked that option no shipping services shows, just blank!  This is the worst app I’ve ever used!  How could developers didn’t catch this issue?

Also when you try to view sellers profiles, it won’t show anything it’s just blank.  I’m sure it’s not my iPhone causing this issue as it’s also happening with my iPad.

Please try listing some items using mobile app and see it for yourself.",2
2394,"Only game in town: If you are selling collectibles eBay is the only game in town.
 Everyone complains about the high cost of auctioning things on eBay plus they're cut on what you sell it adds up. You can actually sell a lot of small items on eBay and go into debt. But for now this is what we have. 

Ebay, you should lower your costs. One day you'll be replaced.

I sold thousands of items on eBay and due to having the flu was delinquent in sending a few out. Those people complained and EBay stopped me from being able to sell. This is FOR LIFE! There isn't a review board. 
I believe it's so unfair. Even murders get released without getting life! That was in 2014. They should allow people like me to get back on and sell!",5

All of the essential features that you need are there and the mobile app never feels like a roadblock to my eBay experience.

Otherwise, if you use eBay a good amount there is no reason to not have this app.",4
2396,"Only good as a buyer: eBay is only a good selling platform for buyers. Sellers get 2.9% fees from PayPal, which is the only receiving payment method. Then there’s another 10% eBay fee once a month from every on of your transactions. I sold a video card for $400, and a month later, long after the money was gone, I get over charged for a random  $40 from that transaction. I refuted the charge, without knowing what it was at all. So the charge is currently under review. eBay is a scamming platform to sellers. They take enormous fees, then place the largest fees not at the time of the sell, but whenever their monthly quota is due. Stick with Facebook Marketplace, or anything else for that matter.",1

Well it was like $94, in the store. eBay sold it for $24 it came from England. Tired of going from store to store, always look first on eBay. Never, ever had a problem, one time a Doll came broken, I notified the seller, bingo, refund. Lots of nice people selling good stiff. I just might start my own eBay account, no harm, no foul.",5

The app has tens of bugs and mis-functions regardless of the hassles and mistreatments, eBay itself has for first-time sellers.
I has the worst experience using and working with eBay so far. As a customer you have to deal with a lot of discrepancies resulted from their very poor customer service and lack of professional account management!
On the other side, when you give them a call or having them call you, you get zero response for the issues you had and they just put on a hold forever with zero response!
Overall, their entire business is broken!!!!",1
2400,Why did you make thing worse ?: The old selling platform was flawless! I tried to sell something recently and all the options are gone. So you can either auction style or buy it now with best offer together. So people just low ball you with annoying offers. You just keep pushing.

2401,"Ebay does not back their Sellers: Ebay does not back their sellers. I know there are scam artists on both sides of the coin but when you sell albums that were never opened and the buyer opens it all they have to do is say something is wrong and they are always sided with. Then as the seller you get back a used copy. I am not selling anymore sealed vinyl. Be aware of eBays policies all they care about is the 10% they collect from everyone’s sold items, and then again what do they have to lose.",4
2402,EBay Saves You Money: I love eBay and have been buying from it for years.  I can look at anything and still get a big selection without running around my town shopping.

Also couldn’t cancel an order 5 minutes after purchase and receive email 2 hours later can’t be cancelled because it had already shipped. Mind you this was at night with a US seller.",4
2404,"Slow minor changes that shouldn't happen with this company: EBay should hold itself to a higher standard.

2405,"Beware the Shipping Calculator: 1st the positive:  this app makes it super easy to list on ebay.  I love it for that.  However, I have noticed that it will not retain the shipping changes.  More than once I have noticed that it went back to the default setting once it was listed.  I am now in the habit of using the app to list an item,  except for the shipping, saving the draft then switching to my computer to calculate the shipping.  It doesn't do it all the time but enough to really drive me crazy.",4

Nothing has been done. I am always told that I will get email within 24 hrs but no emails have been sent to me. No one has a clue why my account is restricted. Yesterday I was told it can take 9 months to close my eBay account. eBay has a habit of referring a customer to various CRs and still none of them can provide a solution. I am so frustrated my eBay account is practically USELESS all because of their mistake that they won’t acknowledge!!!!!!,1

Another bug… can’t email seller through app, have to go open a browser and message that way. 

Another issue… sometimes won’t let me like an item. Have to add to cart then log in through browser then find in cart, open, then like it.

Another major one… what happened with conversion message threads? Can’t find conversations anymore with the back to old school mailboxes.",4

2411,"Confusing and Convoluted: The app on a basic analysis operates fine however, between the seller and buyer experience I have found the application to be immensely confusing. It also does not lend itself for easy feedback, or customer service as it will direct you towards Q&A and FAQs, and automated chats before leading you to do a record line for help or email line. It also provides very little benefit for sellers, and puts a lot of the burden of relations on the seller.

I have ordered about 4 different things from her they come so quickly and again I can’t say enough on how she packs everything to protect my purchase.,5
2413,"Found better prices for things needed for our rescues: We have taken in 15 different abandoned rescues Dogs & Puppies so we need best prices possible as we have to continue to pay ourselves for their care. 
I found few much needed items for them at decent prices. 
Every penny saved makes it easier to be able to continue with things they need.",5
2414,Why I shop eBay first: eBay has been my go-to department store for 25 years. I have loved eBay from the very first auction. I can look at a gazillion of whatever I’m looking for from around the world. I am always happy with the outcome. I love shopping from home all hours and it comes to my door. I can find anything and everything there. There is nothing else like it. Thank you!,5
2415,"Ebay just sided with me as a seller: Omg Ebay sided with me and I’m a seller! Never in 14 years of selling on Ebay have I had that happen. I had a rude buyer and I want to block them, and Ebay said they were rude and trying to extort from me by threatening negative feedback even when I accepted the return. I was shocked! It wasn’t about money, just an arrogant know it all buyer that thinks they can do whatever they want! Thanks!",5
2416,Changes in mobile app poor: I don’t like the changes made in the mobile app. You can still select link for other items for sale under seller but not able to search loke you vould before. You can select seller store to search but items that were listed in items for sale not always found in the store???,5
2417,customer bought my laptop and returned a similar laptop: This is a ongoing problem with ebay.  Be mindful of no rating accounts that question about item. Then purchase with another account. This is full on fraud.  I took the hit on the loss of inventory and money because I do not want to lose my ability to sell. That’s life i guess. I will send to administration.,5
2418,Need to better job protecting: Need to do a better hob protecting the honest sellers. Some people just try to cause problems and it makes things difficult. When feedback reflects a seller being excellent they should be protected more. It is getting ridiculous the amount of people that complain and that bid up  multiple items and never pay. Crazy.,5
2419,"eBay app is getting better everyday!!: I have been using eBay more than decade. I have see huge differences in the app performance and interaction on a whole. However, the website has been a little annoying I had difficulties buying products on the checkout page and couldn’t pass the catch.

Had to use the app for the transaction.",5
2420,"Great except for “Share This Item” button on iPad: I love using the app on my iPhone and iPad!  The one issue I have is that the “Share This Item” button/link does not work correctly on my iPad. Every time I click it, a mini balloon shows near the top but that’s it. 

However, it works great on my iPhone. 

If you can fix this issue on the iPad, it’s an easy 5 star rating for me!",5
2421,"Not happy with new update: I use the eBay app for buying and selling as i prefer this over my PC. Why is now the selling tab shows me a pointless tips and hints menu that I can’t get rid of? I used to click that tab and I could list an item, view listed items, and view schedules listings along with other things. The only way I can view this is if I go to the website on my phone which still will redirect me to the app most of the time? How can I view my listings and scheduled listings?",3
2422,"App changed 😢: I’ve been buying things off eBay for about 20 years & at one point was addicted to winning auctions & then I switched to mostly “buy it now”. But someone has “messed up” the app! Now it freezes all the time! And that’s my biggest complaint so far. I just want to do like I’ve always done…search, save, & purchase. Don’t “fix it” if ain’t broken…",5
2423,Best app ever: eBay is amazing you can find anything on here and this is where I go to find a bunch of sports cards and stuff for my mom and dad I give this app a 5 star it is amazing so I don’t have to go to the store and look for packs for hours I can just order them and get a lot. And this is the place where I get Mother’s Day gifts and Father’s Day gifts same with birthday to install this now it is amazing.,5
2424,"Make compatible with older IOS: Used to love eBay, have bought and sold here for quite some time now.

Just went to buy an item and learned that my phone will no longer work as they require you to use IOS 13 or later.

Why would you want to hurt the sales of  yourself and other eBay salesmen and women but mandating such a phone update. Who knows how many thousands of users will no longer be able to use the app. Guess no more eBay for me until my upgrade...",3
2425,"Horrid service: Sold an item and shipped it, was then informed by the buyer that eBay had sent me the wrong address on the shipping label. eBay refused to help in the matter. Purchased an item to which a glitch popped up saying I had not paid for the item. This caused me to purchase TWO of the items instead of just the one. Again, eBay refused to get involved in canceling the order.",5
2426,iPad for eBay: On both my iPad and my iPhone I cannot view my purchases made. It goes blank and then I get a systems error....so the problem becomes that I have a hard time tracking my deliveries especially if a seller doesn’t upload a tracking number . This has been going on for quite a while and I’m actually surprised it hasn’t been corrected.,5
2427,"Money back guarantee is a fraud: I did not receive the items despite the fact that USPS shows they were delivered. Opened the case with eBay and they wouldn’t refund me despite the so-called “money back guarantee”. There’s no way of contacting eBay either to explain I simply did not get the items. Will order from Walmart marketplace moving forward. To everyone else: know that if USPS looses your package, you will not be refunded and eBay will require “proof that the item was delivered to the wrong address” or a “police report” which is pretty much not a possibility for $20 of purchase. Also need that it’s a business that chooses to save $20 rather than a returning customer.",1
2428,"Too geared toward sellers!: A well thought out program that seems geared towards the seller. It used to be able to find out the selling price of a ""best offer"" sale. That made it easier to ascertain the market value of the the item. Instead, they allow the seller to hide this info., making it impossible to track the market price of an item.",5
2429,"Pretty ok, I guess: Froze twice while constructing a listing. The second time, I had to shut off the iPad and restart it. Never could figure out how to show that the shipping cost is included. It had a stock photo of the item I’m selling, which I would keep, but after adding my own pics it was gone and I couldn’t get it back. Other than those issues...",5
2430,Need to fix your selling drafts not showing up: You’re supposed to improve the app when you do an update so why in the world would you take your saved drafts off the app? I’ve spent the last 20 minutes trying to figure out where it is and apparently it’s not on the app anymore. Are used to be able to start a listing and then easily go to my phone and transfer the pictures to the draft I was working on and then finish it out on my computer. Now every time I go to the app under selling all it does is give me a tutorial instead of showing the draft that I’ve already saved on my computer thanks Ebay:(,1
2431,Everything I want at one easy to use site.: I’ve been a member on eBay for 10+ years and have used it to build a large variety of motorcycles and four wheeler plus other mechanic vehicles. I have also bought tons of Xmas gifts at great prices and am very happy with the usability and ease of navigation through the site. Will continue to stay loyal to eBay and all it’s members.,5
2432,"eBay: ebay is my “go to” online shopping site. Customer service, and communications are second to none. I have personally been shopping eBay for 10 years and have had literally “0” issues. Though I have not sold any items, purchases are extremely painless. And the eBay policies and staff have your back as well, so buyer confidence is unmatched.
Thank you eBay.....
P. Giddy",5
2433,"a for new sellers: I just got the app and i liked how easy it was to set everything up and start selling. However, within the first 2 days of using it, I’ve got nothing but fake offers from scammers leaving there phone number and saying to text them to arrange payment. I went along with one to see what would happen and the person said the payment was sent but all I had received was an email from a fake paypal support address. can’t even sell my items without being harassed by scammers and ebay taking no action.",2
2434,"Perfect app and easy to use BUT one issue: I would definitely give this a 5 star, the app is great but there is one issue. I am NOT getting notified whenever I get a message, when something ships out, etc etc. YES, my notifications ARE ON for the app, all of them. But in order to see who messaged me or if something is shipped I have to go into the app and click on notifications, otherwise it won’t notify my if my phone is off or I’m on another app.
PLEASE FIX AS I MISSED A MESSAGE FROM A SELLER TWICE already THANKS!!",4
2435,Good app for buying and at listings!: Good app for buying and looking at your listings and everybody else’s listings but sometimes it’s frustrating to list items on the app it changes the title sometimes it sometimes changes the the least you will take in on the offers and it sometimes changes the shipping costs after you already set it so you are better off if you want to list an item to go to the official site and list your item there! That’s why I give it a 3 star rating. So they need to work on their app.,3
2436,Address issues: I have sold thousands of dollars through eBay over the years but had moved about 2 years ago and updated my address through the app. It gives you one option change primary shipping address but this won’t change your return address. I had an item returned to my old address as a result and East told by the customer service specialists that this app was only suggested for buyers and not for sellers and that I am out of luck and our $100 now because I only changed the option given to me the Primary shipping address. So I am no longer an eBay customer hope the $10 was worth me going to Poshmark and Mercari,1
2437,"No accountability when there is an issue: I will never buy from eBay again. They allow seller’s who lies to customers to continue cheating their customers. When you try to call them, you get the run-around. The Resolution center is a joke. There are times the issue is more complicated than just being able to return an item. They do not make it user friendly to get any help. To make matters worst, if you try to give the seller a bad review to warn others of the shady practices, eBay will take your review off. I have learned a valuable lesson.... never again will I buy here and will make sure my friends and family do not, either.",1
2438,"About to quit eBay all together: This app has gotten rid if several features that used each time I posted an item for sale. And now it has several very deceptive pop up questions each time you try to sell something that may lower your price or starting bid without your knowledge. There are still multiple bugs that won’t let me revise an item unless I go to my computer instead of using the app. And SELLERS BEWARE, if you do revise an item on this app it will change your starting price/bid without letting you know it. I know I’m writing a review of this app, but in reality I believe this is how shady eBay as a company is fast becoming.",1
2439,"Stop trying to micromanage my listings eBay!: eBay, I’ve been selling with you for nearly 10 years, but I’m about to make the switch to Poshmark. Im so tired of your default settings that you always go back to if I’m not paying attention. If I want to offer free shipping, then let me! Don’t make me go back into the listing multiple times to change it because you think you know better! And when you auto-relist, you need to keep my original settings! Stop with this make an offer crap! It was turned off in the original listing and you sneakily turning it back on when an item is relisted is BS!! Let sellers sell the way they want to sell!",1
2440,"Can’t Live with out!!: I can’t express how much I Love eBay!! I buy new and used it really doesn’t matter. Out of all of my purchases through out the years, I would say my success rate is about 98 percent!! From clothing and shoes to sporting goods and furniture!! Life would not be the same with out you!! Thank you eBay for always being there, whether it’s day or night,cold or hot,or any where I’m at in the world shopping at my fingertips nonstop!!❤️",5
2441,"Just a great place to buy anything you need.: If you need help they are only a phone call away.  I purchased a tractor and paid for it with wire transfer from my bank.  
(It was several thousand dollars) it was never shipped to me, reported the seller and filed claim and in a few weeks they sent me full refund.

I just can’t tell you how happy I am with the way eBay is set up and how they will step in to correct any problem..
Jimmy",5
2442,I love ebay!: I have been a fan for years. I always find great stuff on ebay. They have almost anything you could want and I love the Make an Offer feature when the Buy It Now price seems a little too high. The only thing I would change would be seeing repeat items under the same search that are the same exact (same seller) listing. It slows me down when I’m on the hunt for merch! Hahaha.,5
2443,"Watch List and Ended List disappeared!! Called eBay, no help.: Not happy with new update. I have an I-phone 6plus and a I-pad and my watch list and ended List have disappeared from both. I have signed out and back in multiple times and have deleted the eBay app and reinstalled multiple times and nothing has worked. I've been an eBayer since 2007. I called eBay and they could not help. 
When will this be resolved?!!",5
2444,"Get rid of the web version when checking mails.: The app is great. Its fluid. Scrolling and going through items is all great. But there’s only one problem. When you check the offer mails in the mails, it opens a web version of the app within the app. And thats quite frustrating. Its slow and not as stable as the app. It needs to be open to the app itself. And while checking the offer items it would be really nice to see it opening in the app itself rather than opening it in a web version.",3
2445,Very limited phone application: Phone app needs work. There are a ton of things that you can’t do on the app that you have to get out the computer for. Sometimes it doesn’t update & wont let me do simple things like print shipping labels. I expect much better from a company that collects money by allowing people to sell their own stuff online. Ease of use should be the number one priority. I guess until a valid competitor appears eBay can get by by being mediocre.,4
2446,"Love it: People are people , so you have to be on guard to get a quality deal but my over all experience has been great. So far I've only had small problems with a few purchases , and the sellers go out of there way to make things right . Another time I did have to get eBay involved I don't know if the person passed on or what but eBay fixed the problem , what more can you ask for 

Thanks 
Robert",5
2447,One sided for buyers: eBay has taken buyer protection too far for people who want to be a shade tree mechanic or part time seller.  Decisions are made in the buyer’s favor to avoid disputes with credit card companies instead of being made correctly. The fees have gone up in the market has gone down because eBay has driven away sellers of unique items with constantly changing formats and policies. Stop fixing what’s not broken.,5
2448,"I want to hug the team that created this app.: I used to procrastinate and never sell my old stuff because I hated the process of using my pc. This app is so simple just snap a couple of pics with my phone and type in descriptions and boom done. 

I look at all the small items I would normally give or throw away in storage and in the last year have made over $11,000 using this app. 

Amazing! I love simplistic easy to use apps!",5
2449,"Ebay has some failure.: Ebay and Paypal has some failure or trick between them. You can buy something protected with ebay and if they retire or cancel the item that you buy and you need to claim a refund, they tell you to open a case and when you try to open it the system says you can't open a case for a cancel or retired item and referred you to Paypal and Paypal do not respond and if respond they referred you to ebay. Classic!!!",5
2450,Not bad could be improved: Some functionalities require the app to close down and open Safari. This should change all functionalities should be within the app so there's no need for opening Safari. Some features such as copy and paste don't work correctly. Are usually read my messages using Siri by selecting a paragraph and letting Siri read it for me. This functionality works ON and OFF with this app.,5
2451,"Shady Sellers: I'm a long time ebayer. In my experience the sellers post items and eBay removes it. Sellers may sell items that are not anything like the listing. Sellers may sell something and then take their time mailing, or use the slowest cheapest postal service possible. There are no regulations on Ebay for sellers as far as consistent listings and shipping. I would never recommend Ebay. You will only get a refund from eBay if the item is not as listed. 
Customer service is pretty good. The sellers are the problem.",4
2452,Make extra $: eBay sales helped fund my second honeymoon. I had lots of hand me downs from friends and family and selling on eBay has been a great way to clean out my house. But after banking every profit I finally saved enough to take my husband to Paris for a week! I love how easy it is to post an item and that eBay helps edit your photos and ad for the best results.,5
2453,"Ebay needs an improvement: Most of EBay’s site works well, with the exception of the “Contact Seller” area. I would prefer to contact the seller if I have a problem so they can have a chance to fix it without getting a less than positive review, but can only do that via phone, which is what EBay offers. The “Contact Seller” goes back to the item that was bought and only lets you make an offer!",4
2454,Love the app but keeps lagging: I have a full shopping cart and wish list or save for later I wish you guys would up that count but eveytime I go to look at my cart on ios and go to cart it is super slow and laggy even when I try to press the X but everything else works fine I’m not sure what that is but please look into this it’s been here for a while ever since you guys added smooth deletes to your cart.,4
2455,"Why do these updates always result in a slow down in sales?: Literally days before you do an update or as you’re working on them and the day that you do the update sales literally slows to a crawl will be on a streak we’ll be selling lots of items and then all of a sudden an update and boom no more sales no more offers it needs to stop.
Can you fix that?",5
2456,"Love this app! Just one thing!: Hello!, I love this app it’s just that I have tried to change my profile picture several times now and i choose it and it pulls up my picture in a circle with a grid and then it goes back to the profile screen and then i can’t press any buttons and I have to just restart the app! Please could you fix this? Thank you!",5
2457,Saved searches not as accurate as before: Not sure what happened recently on the backend but I have a lot of very specifically worded saved searches and lately I’m being fed a lot of “matches” for my saved searches that are very generic and don’t meet all of my search terms. It didn’t used to be like this and it basically makes my specific search terms useless if I’m being fed a lot of partial matches to the query.,4
2458,"Saved search not clicking easily: Open app, My eBay, Saved. On this saved search tab, when I click on any of the saved searches, they never click through the first time. It always takes several tries of tapping on them. It works better towards the right side of the screen but still not very reliable. Whether it shows a little number in blue circle that there are new results to look at or not. Just some feedback. Love eBay!",3
2459,"Great site for great products: EBay allows me to find items which I would not be able to find otherwise. Most of the vendors on the site have decent prices, and it is fun to check out the variety which changes every day. The purchasing is easy, package tracking works great, and the products I’ve received were as advertised.",5
2460,Can’t See response to feedback on app!!!!: Been an ebay seller/buyer for 23 years. Have outstanding feedback. Their have been a couple of instances where I have had to follow up on buyers feedback. Recently Ebay changed something & now the response to feedback is no longer visible on the app!! Can only see responses to feedback on PC!!! eBay please fix this!!!!Frustrated long time Ebayer. :(,5
2461,"DO NOT UPDATE, TOO MANY BUGS: LIKE BUTTON NOT WORKING ON NEWEST UPDATE: I’ve had the eBay app on my iPhone for as long as I can remeber and have never had a single problem, until now. On the most recent update the like button doesn’t work AT ALL and the app feels more  glitchy all around. Please fix this!! The like button is how a lot of us eBay user keep track of items we are considering to buy.",5
2462,"Fantastic Experiences: eBay has become my preferred shopping center. All sellers have been extremely truthful, reliable and above and beyond.

The few returns I’ve had went without a hitch and refunds to my credit card. We’re fast.

Congratulations to Ebay and all the retailers that make Ebay and themselves a success in the country we live in and all around the globe who use Ebay in commerce.",5
2463,"1 recommendation: I like everything on the ebay app. EXCEPT. Every time I search, I have to reset my LOCATION search to US ONLY. If I wanted to buy from China, I would choose that. I dont think it should go to default every time you change your search, it should to default to US and if someone wants to broaden their search, they can. Or, at least make it a setting.",5
2464,"e-bay: Best site EVER - to get the Unbelievable: I am an avid collector of rare. vintage & iconic items across many product lines. Bottom-line, I am so glad  e-bay continues to  evolve for better & better systems - safe transactions with state of the art anti-hack software & assurance of comfortability from thieves & scams. That safety must continue to keep e-bay as the leader in       e-commerce uniqueness. Please keep up the best platform that is truly a win-win for buyer & seller!!!",5
2465,"LET ME CHANGE MY BANK ACCOUNT!: First let me start off by saying this app needs a serious update, allow me to explain. I am a seller on the eBay app and everything was going fine until I switched banks. Now I am unable to change my bank account due to a bug, which tells me that there was an error changing my bank account. It then prompts me to enter my old bank account routing number, which keep in mind, I don’t have anymore. On top of that I have money on my account that I cannot cash out due to this bug. Support didn’t really help much either, and I am out almost $500.

Thanks for nothing eBay.",1
2466,"A great way to keep it all moving!: I’m very happy to have the app because I am often running from one place to the other. I am a seller of over 20 years so having access to my eBay wherever I am is important.
It’s often that I am away from my studio that I have the opportunity to send somebody a best offer and by the time I get back to my studio, it’s paid for.",5
2467,"The best way for do business: Thanks Ebay for do business word wild. The people need more access to good prices and good product. The biggest interest of word doesn’t work for people, but when you have a mechanism or tools for work in your favor the people have best service. 
Thanks for all and go for more and increases the universe of product and access. There is the goals.",5
2468,I like the app but don’t like the company: As a seller I feel that eBay overcharges you for everything. They are trying to nickel and dime you for every cent they possibly can. It’s somewhat pathetic if you ask me. You will be charged an “eBay fee” for shipping and taxes on top of the item itself. They are somewhat scandalous and make it very difficult on your profits. Don’t even trust the shipping prices that they have already set up because you’ll end up having to pay more out of your pocket.,3
2469,"Russia: I hate this update. But more I want you to deplatform all Russian and Russian made products. I have a FB petition with $1.2 million signatures. Ukraine should be promoted heavily. I'm NEVER going to buy anything Russian ever but especially Russia. I know it's not the people but it is. They don't believe there's a war. We need to convince them. Maybe say ""due to the unprovoked war we can no longer in good conscience support Russian products nor can we guarantee shipping. Therefore service is suspended.",4
2470,"Ebay's cut is high, and hold $: Ebay held my $ for 2 weeks even though my buyer gave excellent feedback score.   They got a $300 cut from a big sale and then held my money gor over 2 weeks.  I also had to relist 3 times to get that sale.  There are other platforms to sale on, without these hassles.  Ebay about to go the way of Angies List when they used to charge huge membership fees:  Hello Home Advisor.",5
2471,"An Enviable Library: As an avid reader, knowledge curator, writer AND homeschool parent, I cannot say enough good about eBay.  I have managed to create an incredible library for ever subject and concept for grades 6-8. 

In addition, I’ve purchased some excellent historical books that are out of print or build on one of my many hobbies.  

People can actually learn things from the description alone; helping you select other books to organize a reading schedule.  

What also makes eBay the first place I check is the price.  Depending on the use of the book, I can make the best budget friendly choice when selecting a book. You can even list your favorite vendors. eBay is my favorite place to shop.",5
2472,Had a trip to Mexico phone was hacked: Had a trip to Mexico phone was hacked.  I’ve sold with many other websites and if I every had this happen and came back to my account I wouldn’t be surprised with a fee I owe for not seeing a sell.  Wasn’t even given a confirm sale option.  No wonder eBay seems to be dying that Nickel and dime with fees to stay a float.  Than when trying to contact customer service horrible.  Even trying to pay fee was difficult and glitches I don’t trust this company and will be deleting account as soon as possible but can’t till the fee I paid processing goes thru.,1
2473,"Run away.  Sell and buy anywhere else: First the UX and UI is from 1985. I feel like I am rewatching an 18 year old Matthew Broderick on a Commodore in War Games.  Half the buttons don’t work, help is nonexistent, the app is the least workable app I’ve ever seen.  Then the company takes advantage of and steals from sellers by holding money for 30 days even after buyer confirmed receipt and satisfaction.  And the shipping they use is some sort of absurdly cheap usps which eBay’s marks up but which means the goods travel for weeks and get damaged along way.  This company is awful.  Facebook marketplace is 10x better as are many many other sites.",1
2474,"Very well developed application.: I really enjoy how it is laid out. The task bar on the bottom of the app is well made for simplicity sake. I think people should use the application more often, my main complaint is the lack of selling, and buy features to check pricing that area still being implemented. I hope in the future I will see more price checking tools to go with my app. Other than the trivial things, it’s great.",4
2475,EBAY is straight trash now!!!: Old system not perfect but this new one is trash. Money takes forever to actually get in your hands mean while they send messages buyer has paid send item now. I still don’t have the fund eBay does and mostly like using the money to make more money for themselves while in there possession which is my money it’s my item the person bought. But I’m not sending out item until I get the funds. By this point it’s been days. I personally people stop using it and cause the company go under. They deserve it 100% I can’t think any lower of them as a company!!!,1
2476,"Love eBay, don’t love it being made unusable until you update.: I feel like this is the second time in the past two/three weeks where I try to go use the app and it won’t let me in until I update it. Then once it’s finished updating, I’ve forgotten what I was about to search for in the first place. You can’t click out of the pop up, it simply just won’t let you browse the app until you install the update. Most apps let you update at your leisure unless it’s a major update. I love eBay, but this is so clunky and weird.",2
2477,"Need help... doesn’t exist anymore!!: When I am selling and purchasing through an app, I expect to be able to speak to someone if a problem should arise. NOT ON EBAY, NOT ANYMORE. I spent over an hour trying to find a way to get through to someone for help with a purchase I made. It literally does not exist anymore. The only thing you can actually speak about over the phone, well to register a complaint, is a fraud line. There is no such thing as customer service. Absolute Bull!!! I will never use eBay again, and I beg you not to either!  If you have a problem, it will cost you, literally",1
2478,"Old Timer: Have been a viewer and once a seller on EBay for years . Have always enjoyed the many items that are sold and what people ask and sell there items for ! Shipping costs and taxes have did a lot of damage to selling but if you want the item you buy it ! Enjoy seeing descriptions and different interpretations of what items are . Anyway if it’s not fun don’t do it ! Ebay is a fun place for me !
Thanks",5
2479,"new payment process: I’ve been with ebay for 20 years now. Always recommend and speak highly, the new payment process is the WORST. I thought it was bad enough when tax on used items was added. This new payment process is no good, it takes multiple days to get paid. Paypal was WAY better. To make it better, it’s more money per sale, nice.",5
2480,"Sellers nightmare: I know eBay is the #1 reseller but if someone selects “buy it now” should pay automatically.  This app is a buyer’s dream and sellers nightmare.  You made an offer but yet you never pay, how does that make sense.  This is the only app that’s like that. People should pay automatically.

This app is so simple compare to the site. My only problem with the app is I can’t see my bill.",5
2481,Feedback lacking.: Longtime user 100% feedback. My feedback count would be much higher if everyone I sold to left feedback. It seems More than 50% of buyers fail to leave feedback. It would be great if eBay would automatically leave positive feedback if none is left say after 14 or 21 days after delivery Or when ever the time expires for leaving feedback.,5
2482,"Best for resales: Been on eBay for years, and I’ve found many positives about the app/website, but if you’re interested in rare or popular stuff be sure to always be careful about being scammed as is in most places on the internet. 
I’ve found many good deals and only had one gone south which was a bad judgement call, but that why there’s a rating system... that is... mediocre... but helps the best sellers at most.",5

Save your self a headache I sold a computer upon buyer arrival - the buyer returned it and said it was broken during shipping. However, the item was missing hard-drive, key board, mouse. I placed an appeal and eBay declined it. Also, when issuing a refund ebay charged me 2x for the refund. When I called and sent them my back statement of the double charge they refused to admit any fault and continued to ask me to send proof. I did send the proof and they still ignored me.

2487,Constantly messes with listings: I have been using the eBay app for a month now and have had so many issues with it at this point that I’ve been considering no longer using it at all. The app constantly changes things from listing prices to shipping methods to package weights you can’t seem to ever get it to put in the correct values. And once it does don’t expect it to stay that. I’ve had a number of listing listed at 100 or more change to 10 or 30 once I hit done. They need to get this under control as it cause an issue with a buyer already that was extremely stressful and shouldn’t have happened in the first place.,1
2488,"Payments: I’m very frustrated bcz all of my payment methods like PayPal, Debit and checking were denied and stated that I needed to try another payment option. I don’t understand bcz all of the above methods are valid and numbers correct???  I tried to buy an iPhone and was on the site for almost an hour trying to figure out what was going on??? I eventually added a credit card, my friends since it was going to be his, and it went thru immediately. I have enough money to have bought several iPhones so that wasn’t an issue. I’m just wondering what I did wrong or if it’s something on ur end??? Just wanted y’all to know about this issue. Thanks Jenn",1

2491,"Don’t handle issues well: So I bought a gift for my girlfriend and I never received it. They showed that it was delivered. I did a police report and told them that I didn’t receive it. I talked to the seller and eBay customer service about it and they must have thought I was lying cause they told me that I couldn’t get my money back. I told them that I have a police report number and report, but they were so rude and was basically thinking I was lying. I would never buy anything from them again. I do not want to business with a company that would say 100% customer satisfaction because they ignore all the customer that aren’t satisfied.",1
2492,"eBay , great fun and investment: For about 15 years I go to eBay for new and old items to buy. My hobby of collecting Diecast hot wheel Corvettes was taken to a new level. I keep updated on new items and value of what an item is worth. eBay makes you a smarter buyer knowing what the market place will pay for new and older items based on the demand for the item. This is a hobby for me but if I look back on my collection it was a Great investment!",5
2493,"Pretty good: Never had an issue. Notifications can be a little off.  I still don't understand why when I want to refine search results and view sold items I have to tap ''more"" then go to sold items.  This should be near the top or not require a second tap.

Also - when I view a sold item, I shouldn’t have to tap it again to get to the actual listing... that’s what I’m looking for.

Finally, it should be simpler to look at a seller’s feedback.",4

There is no support documentation for how to address this issue and no option for help or resolution once I am stuck on the sending authentication screen other than to send another message.

2495,"A Review of an App that Let Me Review: I had made a purchase a while back, and just today, I got an email requesting me to review my product. I went to review my product through this app, and its format felt like a last-second thought, as my keyboard, itself, would cut off what I was writing, so I could not see my spelling errors until I put the keyboard away.

This is just one example, but I’ll stop here in hopes that this one feature and be updated.",4
2498,"Keeps going downhill...: As an avid eBay user/seller, I use the eBay app quite frequently. As eBay continues to make changes to the app to upgrade the user experience, the glitches continue to increase. It is extremely slow now when trying to add photos to a listing, the drafts page does not show that the drafts even have photos after adding. I have also noticed that some listings don’t show the correct amount of time left on a listing.

2499,"Complete Garbage For the Seller: BEWARE!!! If you are a seller, make sure you review your posts, as this EBAY APP will put their own pricing, BIN durations, as well as other options. 

I am forced to use my home computer to post and repost my auctions & BIN. If I use the EBAY APP, I find additions & changes that I did not apply. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have!

I have written to APP support multiple times and they have made no effort to change things back to the way they were. We should be entitled to make are own choice of options. As I said in the title: COMPLETE GARBAGE FOR THE SELLER!

It is usable still if you use it for buying only. 

(1) APP will automatically put in their own pricing
when posting auctions. 
(2) APP won’t allow you to pick duration of how long your BIN will run, installing its own duration. 
(3) APP will apply “Make Offer” including an acceptable price for Offer acceptance. 

If you post anything for sale using this APP ... MAKE SURE YOU REVIEW YOUR POST COMPLETELY AFTER IT IS POSTED!!",1
2500,Pretty good: I really use this app a lot! But I do wish it could totally remove the need for the PC version. For buying it’s pretty handy. The issues are when your selling or having to do anything with a claim/case some of the options just aren’t on the mobile app to correspond and react properly for the claims. But I’ve been an active member of EBay for about 13-15 years now. They’ve worked hard to earn my trust!,5
2501,"Change it!: I have been an eBay customer since 2007. I have a problem with your location preference option. When I choose “ North America only”, I do not want sellers from China’s items being included in my choices! I have continually had this happen to me.

I constantly scroll through lots of results quickly and keep finding myself 2-300 results deep and accidentally drag something to the top. There’s no way to go back to where I was in my results without re-searching and then scrolling all the way back down.
If I wanted to search for something similar to that item, I would just search. There’s no need for this stupid drag feature that’s ruining my searching. At least make it something that can be disabled.",1

2508,"Not enjoying Ebay.: Just got a notice from you that the $220 transaction I just tried to do was somehow a scam.  Tried to undo the purchase through your system and was directed to ‘sign in’ even though I was already signed in.  Can’t recall the latest password for you guys so the system is basically stuck - I can’t do anything more with Ebay until I make up a new password.

Finally went to the PayPal website and cancelled the payment there.

For an old guy who just wants the thing to work without complications, your system is - to put it mildly - frustrating.

Yeah.  I’ll make another password.  And probably try again to buy the carburetor I need.  Hope I don’t get involved with another crooked transaction.

Not a happy camper.

The mobile app is convenient and website is detailed and the layout is awesome! I’m a #1 fan and loyal customer!!,5
2511,eBay needs to have people to answer the phone: eBay needs to have real people available to help on the phone.

Fees are a fact of life, but for this instant access it is definitely worth it.",5
2517,MOST SH+T Ever: Okay first off there customer service bot is a absolute dumb mistake. What can we help you with… Be careful with what u say cause they’ll tell u to go to there website. But it says “tell us what u need help with so we can get u to the right person” yes the right person all right! Secondly the new managed payments your better off just taking your business elsewhere. Can’t even link a account!!! Had to refund two buyers because of this stupidity of a so called company. All because they wanted to save a dollar and add to profits. This will be the fall of eBay I promise you that. PayPal will trive and eBay will fall without PayPal! :),1
2518,EBay sales and listing: I appreciate having an eBay store. I like being able to list quite a few items a month. I like being able to email an issue and get a response. I’m not sure if it’s an automatic response. Doesn’t matter. Sometimes you just need to be heard. I appreciate that. I am sure someone reads it eventually. EBay rocks - for me as a seller AND buyer.,5

Yet they charge around 13.5% per sale, even tho they claim it’s only like 12.5% but they charge it based off the price plus taxes and other fees. Then subtract their cut from the pretax price. This results in a bigger cut from the seller. I recently sold a $750 dollar laptop and the charged $101 for fees( not including shipping). I just don’t see how they can justify making $101 dollars off my sale for doing pretty much nothing.",2

Their app technology is always improving for the better and makes for a great consumer experience. I’d recommend to anyone before buying an item to check eBay first!,5
2527,Very poor customer service: eBay uses only postal addresses for physical addresses and the small town I live in the postal service does not issue street addresses and everyone has to have a PO Box. eBay will not let me sell on eBay because the postal service does not recognize my physical address called customer service and they were no help what do ever in fact didn’t she didn’t want to waste her time to even understand my problem. I will be closing my eBay account if they will only allow me to buy items and not sell. Very very poor customer service use Etsy instead!!!!,1

2532,"Complaint and Resolution: Hello,

I meant to give the app three stars.

It’s generally is good however not for the complaint/resolution part.

Last year I was informed of a fake seller incident through a do not reply back type of email. Following that I raised a complaint after navigating the non-user friendly section and I haven’t received the refund until today.

There is no email to reach you on nor there is a possibility to have a chat with a staff member as mean for a human communication like other e-commerce platforms. The listed questions and answers are limited and rigid. 

The complaint/resolution part is a critical one yet handled very poorly constituting huge downside for eBay.

Looking forward to receive the refund and seeing positive changes in this regard.

Kind Regards,

I wish I had the time or space to enumerate all of the problems with this new version, though it would probably be a waste of my time.

2550,"Sales on my eBay site: Love using EBay to sale my items! I was using Marketplaces’ platform for the last 2 years & about 5 months ago wanting to see how my sales would be like on EBay. I’m so happy I decided to try EBay, my sales are so much better and your platform offers so much more to get your items out there. Thank you so much EBay 😊

Thanks again

2551,"Forced best offer??: When I updated the app recently on my mobile phone, I’m now forced to list buy it now items with best offer option. The only way to remove that, is by listing the item at a ridiculously low price. That’s ridiculous and annoying. In the past, I would’ve rated the app 5 stars but not after this update. I price my items fairly, often with free-shipping. The buy-it-now price I list the item for is what I want. Nothing less. This change has made the app annoying and trying sell my stuff a hassle. Please return “best offer” to a choice.",2
2552,"New version has more bugs than improvements: Since uploading the latest update (iPad app) I've had nothing but problems. After signing on I no longer have my saved vendors available to me or my most recent searches. I have to type in my search topic, scan through the items and hope to find one offered by one of my saved vendors, click on it and then hit the icon to have it saved. THEN... when I go back to where the saved vendors should be listed I find them back once again. This is crazy! You have screwed up a working app and need to go back to where you were. Please fix it... and soon!",1
2553,"The Original Flea Market: eBay is a great place to find just about anything unique new & used. From old phones to art to musical instruments, eBay has a fair way of obtaining these items (I prefer Buy It Now) & excellent customer service if something isn’t as described. I’ve been a fan since the early 2000s & I hope to always have the app on my phone. Thanks eBay!",5
2554,"EBay is The Best: I am a full time reseller who has dabbled on other aps.  EBay gets me the best results.  I get multiple sakes per day when other aps deliver a couple a week.  Yes, the listing work is more detailed, but that is to help the buyer and to weed out lazy listers who don't want to be bothered detailing important things like messurements.  The ap is easy once you learn it.  I can run my business from anywhere.",5
2555,"Threatening to take my sales numbers away: Ive made you tons of money through buying and selling. The fact you’d even want to do harm to my ebay says alot about your companies morals. I pay insanely high taxes to you. Also, its awfully weird my views go up when i add new items and only then. Its clearly set up that way by Ebay and is a gross business practice. Wish there was an alternative but your monopoly is too strong. Hope you rich ppl are happy while we struggle to sell things dear to us on your site. You must fix your ways or someday you will be losing sleep over Ebays decline.

2556,"Timer on auctions doesn’t work: It seems like every time eBay updates their app, it gets more problems.  The latest is that the countdown timer on their auctions is off.  I’m about to hit at the end of an auction and there is 10 seconds left and immediately the auction ends and I don’t get to bid. This cost the seller money because their auction doesn’t get bid up higher and it causes me to lose the opportunity to buy an item that I want at a good price. eBay’s fees are absurd. If you’re so proud of your platform that your going to overcharge sellers on your fees, at least provide a platform that works!",1
2557,Looking for something: I have found just about everything that I needed from car parts to things for my power wheelchair and everything else all you need to do is look then you need to make a deal on the price or look for someone who is selling for the price or make an offer and see where things go.,5
2558,"GREAT FOR BUYERS RUN IF YOUR A SELLER: As a seller you are held by the xxxx . Almost 13% fees and i’m aware those increase with underperforming sellers. If a buyer wants to return an item for any reason he or she may without actual reasoning. Even on those “returns not excepted” items and Buyer ALWAYS wins. 

Ebay International shipping lost my package. I sold it, shipped it to ebay’s warehouse. Buyer submitted a claim never received sure enough tracking states it’s been at their warehouse for over a month. ebay’s final resolution was to “refund the buyer because your package is on the way back!!” It’s been 40 days no movement no package is on the way be real. So I was out $180 and My product.

Continuing that ebay’s seller customer service is quite literally non existent. Just some forums on ebay’s website nothing more. You can contact a live chatter Bot though!!

2559,"My Go To...: I am on eBay at some point everyday. I’m an eBay addict! Whenever I need something I always come here first. I can’t believe all the deals I have gotten on here. The app is easy to follow, so I get frustrated like I do with a lot of other apps that don’t make sense or don’t work. It’s never gets frozen on me or disappears. Totally recommend this way of shopping to everyone. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️‼️",5
2560,"Rip off scum buckets 🪣: Sold a pair of jordan 5s and almost got half way across the nation and the ignorant eBay authenticity guarantee ruined my sale over that it didn’t have a size tag in one sneaker. Which I understand completely. But can’t you just tell me ahead of time what the rules are so I don’t waste the buyers time and my own and all the people that are shipping and handling it?? 

Thanks 😇😇",5
2561,"Listings: I really love eBay but as of late people are making it less enjoyable by the way they list. For instance i search car parts and save those searches. Let’s say I look for L88 parts. When you search that 1000 come up, none are L88 parts. People just add that to their listing to get traffic. 

It’s everywhere. I hate it. I wish you guys could fix that.",5
2562,Scammers: Just disheartening that Ebay doesnt have more protection for sellers from scammers who say they they received damaged goods when the picture of the item shipped was in good condition. You can plainly see the item was intentional damaged by the buyer and they always refuse to return item.  I think its a bate and switch scam going on. It has happened several times to me and ebay always sides with the scammers.,5
2563,"Disappointed: I was charged for promoting, I have never promoted anything, when I try to contact eBay, it’s one of the most frustrating things! It’s another country, I don't understand sometimes and the reception quality makes it worse, I got hung up on 3 times. It used to be better, why is it getting worse to communicate….money right?",5
2564,"Fake buyers and full of scammers: I can not believe the amount of fake accounts/scammers have screwed me over. Listen there is NO REASON a buyer should ever message a seller stating “I have a few questions, please text me at fake number or email me at fake email” outside of eBay. It’s actually against policy to do that. Then when notifying the buyer to PAY suddenly the account is gone… yeah eBay do better and stop wasting people’s time. 

I’ve tried talking to support and they are useless!

If I could give ZERO stars I would. It just reminds me why I stopped using eBay years ago. Never should have tried it again.",1
2565,"Frustrated buyer: I was making offers and counter offers with a seller.  My final counter offer was accepted and when I went to pay for the item it said, “ this item was sold and is no longer available.  I have sent several messages to the seller and they are not responding.  At this point I want to cancel the transaction.",5
2566,Loyal customer since 2009: I enjoy purchasing of eBay sellers but don’t understand why some of them give a option to bid and when you do they bust your balls over $10 what’s the fun on that. They will play with your balls over $3.00 so why even post “or your best offer” if they won’t even try. Love eBay but need to stop your best offer. I don’t see the meaning on that,5
2567,Great experience: So far I have had a great experience I just wish that the shipping date would be included before I made the orders from now on. That way if I was to move I wouldn’t have to worry about items sitting at my old apartment. It is hard to get a hold of someone in customer service at E-Bay and that will be the reason why I don’t use eBay anymore,5
2568,Responding: I ordered something recently and in the past I was able to get ahold of someone and get results or at least know what was the next corse of action. All I know now is that I’ll be able to know something by the ninth. I spent the money on the item and now I have no idea if I’m going to be refunded. It’s a horrible feeling to know that I don’t know if I’m going to be able to buy something and my money could be stolen.,4
2569,Terrible customer service: How do they not have someone you can call and speak with on the phone for issues selling and fees being double charged. What a headache it’s becoming to sell on this platform. Their online chat is horrible doesn’t get anything accomplished. Payouts were put on hold no reason given I need to wait 5 days??? How can no reason be given and their be no one to speak to about it. What kind of system is this where eBay can do what they want without reason. Many other platforms where you have the same protections and guarantees to sell on.,1
2570,"No help: Good luck getting any help from eBay , very disappointed, I received a broken mirror and all I get is ,sorry tracking shows you received the mirror , I have replayed at least 10 times now , yes the mirror arrived ,,,,Broken , still get the same reply back , they obviously do not ready any of the comment section. Broken ,broken ,broken , how hard is that .",5
2571,"Disgusting scam of a website: Horrible website, awful treatment of buyers and sellers. Customer service will treat you like crap if you are unfortunate enough to have to call for help.

2572,"Format and layout: Strolling all the way down a sellers page just to contact them and there's no quick link to select for contacting them. It's as if you're sending them an email instead of a message once the link is selected. The eBay app itself is outdated and needs reconstruction. Also, the search for low to high price range doesn't work. It still puts the high price range first.",4
2573,"This is how you loose sellers and buyers.: If it were possible to give negative stars, I would.

 This platform gives me the ability to leisurely shop and post items for sale in a relatively safe and secure atmosphere!

2575,"Great App just need few improvements!: Great app, user-friendly and interactive. It could improve a few things. For sellers, it should able sellers to change quantities for listings with variations. Also, it should have the the promotion options such as coupons and markdowns. Lastly, sellers should be able to see more data and statistics. But all-round great app!",5
2576,"Great cape!: Got this for my daughter and she loves it. The quality is great and it is a good weight without being thin. The seller was awesome and communicated quickly with me when I realized after submitting my order that I had picked the wrong color.

I was home at the time of the alledged delivery, and I have two cameras covering the front of my house. They said they checked with Fed-Ex, and though there is no signature, it was delivered. Then they claim someone may have taken it. I have no recourse. They have it set up where I can’t even deal with Fed-Ex on the matter. I asked about the EBay customer guarantee, but it seems to be a marketing ploy. Because EBay abuses it’s customers this way, I will use every opportunity to warn everyone I possibly can. To treat me like I’m trying to lie to get a $20 backpack is sad.",1
2580,Must have: This paint sprayer is worth every penny. if you have any kind of big paint job ahead of you invest the money in this it’s well worth it.

2582,Sims Buyers are Scammers: I’ve been a seller with eBay since 2018 and they should do more to protect their sellers! I’ve been scam several times with people saying they didn’t get their items knowing they have just to get they money back and eBay sides with the customer and leave the seller without item or payment and we just have to settle and that’s not right,5
2583,"Need to fix: I like using this app but every time you remove an item from your shopping cart it takes you to the top of the website and it gets tedious having to scroll all the way to the bottom every time you remove an item from the shopping cart. 

Also the limit for having items saved for later is 100 and that should be more",4
2584,"eBay messed up again: They keep making bad moves and still survive because they have a monopoly on this market. The latest update brought a variety of bugs and bad changes.
1. The watch list goes to the top again every time you delete an item
2. You can no longer customize the name of your saved search, it only shows up as whatever your search parameters are (for example I used to put a price next to the search so I knew what price to look for… no more now)
3. The saved searches are showing a bunch of garbage that isn’t remotely close to the search (for example I search for X-Men 94, it shows Bill and Teds excellent adventure dafu…)

I am sure I could find more, but these are the most annoying. Yet I keep having to go back because there are no other options. Isn’t there someone that wants to get rich by doing it better?",2
2585,"Star light: eBay is my addiction to uplifting myself and meeting wonderful sellers who really work with solving your concerns. I can’t think of any app that doesn’t have the unique style of letting you casually browse “when ever “ convenient for me.

I will continue shopping! Thank you eBay!",5

“Kindly send me a PayPal money request or PayPal invoice or get back to me with your PayPal email so that I can make the payment without delay.” 
And it’s getting annoying at this point. Add a feature to report these sellers or put keywords on alert so that your software picks these cases up faster. It’s happening to often and it’s not okay.",2
2589,"Phone is in my pocket and the app buys me a $2000 bike: I’ve been an EBay member since 2001 and I enjoy buying and selling. Yesterday I had the unique experience of buying a $2000 item while my iPhone was in my pocket. After some back and forth, the seller cancelled the transaction. Isn’t there an additional step that could be installed to prevent an accidental buy? I decided to delete the app altogether, then reinstalled without signing in as a compromise. I hope EBay can look into this, I can’t be the only one to have experienced this problem.",3
2590,"App works great! However....: ...I’d just like to submit a suggestion. Sometimes there are discrepancies with the delivery because sometimes the seller does not have a tracking number to provide. In these cases, while I may already have the item, the app sill marks it as not delivered. This is quite the loophole I can see many abusing. Please fix this, eBay, perhaps by implementing an “Already Delivered” or perhaps “Mark as Delivered” button!",5
2591,"eBay is a scam, made me homeless: If I could give negative stars I would. 
I tried selling an iPhone on eBay twice in the last month. First time the buyer bid at the last second and messaged me a couple minutes later canceling. The second time I tried to sell it the buyer received the phone in its original box and with SIM card 
They decided they didn’t want the phone 
Sent it back without my original iPhone box and without my SIM card and got a full refund. eBay will not compensate me for the buyer stealing my things and now I have been charged overdraft fees and selling fees I should not have been. 
eBay refuses to help. 
I  disabled and can’t work and trying to sell my phone for $150 has so far cost me $300 and loss of my personal property 
Because of this I will be made homeless on the first of the year because I will not be able to pay my rent.

It’s very frustrating especially when I’m looking thru long lists of items. I’ll have to reboot the app and start the search all over again, and hope it doesn’t crash a second time. 

Like all eBay users, I need to use the app a lot. I wish it was more stable.",5

We are stuck and could not change it until the forever lasting however many times the app will auto-relist the item.

For me, this site has been a treasured",5
2595,"Everything is perfect except....: I love everything about the app but please revert the format of the active items back to how it used to be. Now the views and watchers are under the item rather then on the side and the box for the item is significantly larger.

2596,"PLEASE STOP THESE SCAMS!: I think this app is great but one thing, YOU CANT WRITE 1 STAR REVIEWS!!!! When I tried to give a seller a one star review it said go talk to the seller. This app makes money off of sellers which is a good business idea except they don’t do anything about sellers selling fake and ripoff stuff. They only profit off of people selling things and taking a portion of it. When I contacted the seller via email he said, “Oh your lying and you only are scamming me.” Please stop this now! They banned me from one of my accounts saying I committed fraud on an item I sold because I gave a one star review. Maybe if you check sellers I would be more than happy to give this app a five star.",1
2597,"eBay is the best!!: I enjoy buying both new and preowned items on eBay.  By knowing what sizes I wear in what brands I can always get super deals.  Their seller ratings are most helpful in choosing the reliability of a seller as well.  And then for those rare occasions in which a seller won’t refund your money when their is a valid reason, eBay always stands behind the buyer.
Super organization and a safe site on top of all their other great qualities.  Carol",5
2598,eBay app: The eBay app is very easy to navigate but I don’t like that it doesn’t have a send invoice tab so you can combine shipping easily if shipping to the same person buys more than one thing from you.  I also don’t like the make offer for less than you’re asking.  I always turn that feature off but i would prefer you opt in for that feature rather than having to opt out.,5
2599,Messed up!: I love eBay. But for the fact that a seller can make you commit to buying an item and then they don’t ship to PO Boxes is messed up. I had that happen recently and now I have asked several times to cancel. The seller responded once saying it was canceled. But the item is still in my cart. eBay won’t do anything about it. I have to keep calling back until a strike has been issued and they will take it off since I have contacted them. But they won’t say anything to the seller. I think I will stop ordering on eBay.,3
2600,"IPad app: Every time i open this app on my iPad it takes me to the App Store to update before opening. Unless there is an update every day there is a definite problem with this app!
In fact I had to open the app from an email and had to update and then when I went to do another simple task i had to update.
Truly a pain especially when this glitch never happens with the app for the iPhone!",5
2601,Ebay customer service / Not Safe: the seller sent the wrong product but the eBay buyer is not able to protect their rights. the seller did not mention the dead pixel in the description when selling the product. when I turned on the monitor I was in a great shock and the withdrawal request was canceled. and I've had a few problems I've bought before I do not recommend it is not safe .No more,5
2602,"Ordering from EBay: I would rather buy from EBay than anywhere else because the sellers always pack and ship my items with great care. When I’ve ordered from the big store websites, 95% of my items were damaged or destroyed. Also, if my order is incorrect, the EBay sellers fix the problem where the big stores have never even tried.",5
2603,"Hmmm: Why is the app updated most of the time things quit working or it’s missing?? Some times and I mean sometimes it’s a good update.. but seriously, I would click my feedback and open the item the feedback was left on and leave the buyer feedback. Now that option is missing?? I have to go to sold items and scroll until I find the item... what a waste of time???",5

When I buy items, I bid & purchase all at the same time, but EBay is freaking out because I’m doing ‘too much’ for them as a ‘new customer’.

So, it’s been a TOTAL hassle to contact them on almost a daily basis, but so far my purchases have been ‘pretty much’ worth it.",5
2605,"Feedback: 1) Please make the time left on the items a little bit larger.  Print is quite small maybe people would respond faster if they knew time left was.  2) I put “US only” in location filter,  In the list of items still has items from china and other non-us locations for sale in it.  How are these stores evading location filter?
Otherwise enjoy app thx",5
2606,"Final value fee missing: I will take away one star for now because the old version of the app used to show the final value fee, but now this version no longer shows the final value fee when I try to list new items. It’s frustrating not knowing the fee (or if there even is one), so I have to log on to Ebay on my computer to double check, instead of seeing it in the app.",5
2607,"The app is only as good as the service: eBay has lost it’s original mandate of making it easy to buy/sell hard to find things online.  However it’s concern for people transacting out of the platform (and their commissions), they have made it very difficult for people to communicate.  That and now taking payment in-house shows their cavalier attitude towards longtime customers.  I hope eBay will be able to deliver buyer/seller protection Paypal is able to provide.",4
2608,"It’s good but it can be great: It’s good but limited and lags behind the site on a desktop at times.  Also when you do normal shipping actions it’s fine but this app can’t manage your shipping for crap.  You have to use the desktop site.  If this app could at least launch the desktop site for items you can’t do on the mobile app I’d give it 4.5 or 5 stars if it could do all the extra features of the site 

Still it’s great when listing items",4

Contacted eBay and let them know about situation, they handled issue correctly and gave me a return label and refund back for item.",5
2612,Offers to Buyers change for the worse!!!!: This most recent update took away my ability to send offers to buyers in the usual way. You can only offer a percentage off instead of an exact price. This is terribly inconvenient as a seller. Please fix this back to the way it was or give options between the two!!!!,5

It seems like eBay just let’s me look at all the stuff I can’t buy or add it to a list I never will either. Not many people download the app to browse man. Like dude I just want to buy things why are you making it so hard? Trash.",5
2614,"Worst Platform For A Seller: Do not sell on here. eBay does not care about you, I’ve had 5+ times already and I’ve only been doing this for a few months were the buyer wants to return and item because it “doesn’t fit”. Even when measurements are provided or size is clearly listed you have to be stupid not to see it. In every case eBay will not care what you say and give the buyer money back and item shipped back every time. Even when you have “no returns” no point for that to even be there for a seller. Go to Poshmark or something else if your looking to sell online.",1
2615,"Overall great app: After the new update, I’m having trouble with automatically adding the tracking number and notifying the buyer that the item has been shipped. Also, not a fan that I no longer have access to sending out bulk offers to a group of watchers. Other than that, it’s an easy to use platform for all sellers.

I did nothing other than make my account yesterday. I didn’t buy or sell anything or do anything against the rules. This morning I check my emails to find that my account has been suspended because I am supposedly a “danger to the eBay community”. I’d like to know why this has been done and I’d like for you people to fix your mistakes. And I want to apologize for being such a dastardly danger to the eBay community by making an account.🤨,1
2618,"eBay does not side with sellers: Extremely dissatisfied with the customer service experience and how poorly they handled my case.

Unresolved issue that has been on going for weeks. I was told by eBay representatives that they would side in my favor for my case at least five times by different people and also received an email confirming this.

However, I never received a refund and also got charged additional fees after a return was made. The buyer sent me back a damaged item and somehow I am on the hook for this. The box was returned broken and now worthless. I am now at a loss for the item and additional fees.

I have been a long time member of eBay for over 10 years and due to this experience with this case, I will no longer be buy or selling on eBay again or even recommend anyone else to do so.

The supervisor even admitted that you can buy an item, use/damage it and return it for a full refund.",1
2619,"EBay is fraud: Purchased an item from eBay, the seller sent that item to the wrong address. Asked for the refund. Was told by eBay that my item shows delivered on the post office website. Explained that the address they have sent it to was wrong address asked to show prof. Gone to the post office got a copy of the shipping label with the wrong address. Sent it to them and nothing happened. Still don’t have my refund. EBay is falsely advertising that our money back is guaranteed. 

Next week I will close my account and delete this app and return all the items I bought this month.",1
2620,"A well thought of operation.: It's very easy to do business here. Everything here is handled with respect and professionalism. What I like the most is that there's a written solution for every question to do with buying, selling, shipping, money transactions and handling of customer issues.
Excellent customer service is also on display here.
Whether buying or selling, it's a breeze.",5
2621,"GREEDY!!!: eBay has shown me why it’s no longer the leading app to sell from. 12.9% fee for items sold PLUS an additional 9% if you want to boost the item/items?! LOL!!!!!!!! Yeah, EBay doesn’t get my business anymore. I canceled the order and told them to find me on Mercari where the fees are a lot lower. Saved me almost $200!!!!! So avoid selling with EBay! They think they’re entitled to 20% or more of YOUR PROFITS! That means you’re making a sliver and sometimes losing money off your items you’re selling! So thanks EBay for showing me a customer since 2014 how greedy you’ve become. Peace out and enjoy being last!",1
2622,"Tracking info outdated: My biggest issue with the app is that the tracking function for purchases doesn’t work well. The information is often over a day old (shows my package is still at a major hub, rather than out for delivery as confirmed by the UPS site).  
Also, when I clicked on Copy to get the tracking number, it only copied about a third of the number, making it utterly useless. 
Doesn’t anyone test their software anymore?",3
2623,"Thankful: It was a nightmare to me every time I had to go to the store and buy clothes shoes and everything else until I tried eBay. I’m very happy because not I only find better prices but stuff that stores departments don’t carry.
I strongly recommend you to buy on eBay, you’ll experience the easiest way to shop free of risk and free of charge to return stuff.
Sincerely; Leticia",5
2624,"Unnecessary restrictions with managed payments: As a seller, I find that eBay managed payments still needs work. If I ship items with the US Postal Service, then eBay deducts postage fees from my pending payout from the sale. That’s the way it should work all the time. Problems occurred when buyers (or I) opt for UPS or FedEx shipping. eBay doesn’t deduct those shipping fees right away like it does postage. Instead eBay does the following:

1. The entire payout including amounts owed to UPS or Fedex are deposited into my bank account within a day or two,

2. eBay notifies me that shipping payment is due, but not to worry, they’ll take it from my bank account In the next 3 business days,

3. The very next day(!), eBay restricts my account and notifies me that I won’t be able to list anything more until I pay up those shipping charges. (Sigh!)

As a seller on eBay, I find this process asinine and entirely preventable. Get busy developers and fix this mess!",1
2625,"eBay high security: I’m not sure what eBay has done last few years as Ive been off of it. Trying to get back in, I had to make a second account as I couldn’t update my first one. But that failed as well.  So I was able to get back into my first account.  
My mother, who has absolutely no idea about my second one for 5 mins has her account banned. They told her there’s a high link from my second one to hers so hers is restricted because the second one is. High link??? From what? I don’t follow her or searched for her items on it. Plus, my first one is active but not until I get it deleted",1
2626,"Praying with Jane: I’ve been a fan of Jane Austen since the PBS Masterpiece airing of Pride and Prejudice in the 1990s, enjoying Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and my favorite Persuasion. 
I am likewise a collector and reader of devotional materials that provide me a way to daily spend time with Jesus. 
Rachel Dodge in this thoughtful and wonderfully written devotional gives the life influences and spiritual perspectives that Jane used to create her charming characters, endearing them to her readers even more.",5
2627,PayPal no more for the seller: This made it hard on the seller. Waiting on payments. Fronting shipping expenses before collecting. Syncing bank account to eBay. Happy with the system (despite fees) until this happened. Please go back to the rapid receivable money like when a seller got the money in his PayPal instantly. Most people sell things because they need the money right now. Not days or weeks later. eBay can help struggling people pay bills by selling items fast. Bring that comfort back please,3
2628,No customer service.: The customer service is practically non-existent. If you have a problem with a seller and need to talk to a live customer service person you can forget it. You are screwed. No-one to talk to. Their automated CS link was broken. I could not send tracking info for my return because the link did not work. I was finally able to work the problem out with the seller.,4
2629,Ebay bucks: My ebay bucks usually expire because they are not easy to get to and I pay for my purchase then it’s too late. You should make access to ebay bucks balance on the payment page. If you are going to offer ebay bucks make it easy for the buyer. You know.......more sales...less roaming around your site to find them.,5
2630,"Ebay suspend accounts by wrong decision.: Without any reason ebay blocked my wife account, I’m sure without any real reason just automated thought make them take such decision, and customer service don’t want to listen even when human answer the way he/she write without any emotion ( ebay pay them salary and they block real accounts which can give them money ) not professional I’m sure if only one of responsible person from ebay do real checking I’m sure will find alot blocked by wrong decision such as login from different IPs or have forwarding shipping address, which both 100% legal.",1
2631,"Do not sell here: Why would anyone sell here when Mercari exists, they have lower fees, and Ebays customer service is just completely unprofessional compared to Mercari. Ebay is also notoriously known for hiding their customer service even though it’s not too bad now. Terrible company, terrible experiences X10. For example, if a customer cancels an order. You are stuck paying the sell fees, and shipping. But Ebay grants you to list it again for free! 🤣 it’s seriously a joke get away from this place.
Mercari > Ebay
My parents sold with Ebay from the beginning,  grossed millions in sales, and they have clearly fallen. Stay away!",1
2632,"I’m suspended for what?: I made an eBay account to hopefully buy some things that I couldn’t find easy. My first thing I wanted was a bottle of cologne. I looked and then I looked at some gaming stuff. That’s it, I turned off the app and went about my day. Purchased nothing sold nothing and next day got an email saying I was suspended permanently. I tried to appeal or at the very least know what I apparently did wrong but they contacted me back saying they can’t let me know. I am frustrated at getting suspended permanently but I’m more frustrated at it happening because of some reason that I’m not allowed to know.",1
2633,IOS 13 required!: I've been using this app on my old iPad for years at this point. And now i can only imagine that it will crash and be buggy from now on due to the most recent update requiring IOS 13. I don't know if this is eBay or Apple's fault but could you be any more anti-consumer? Forcing someone to upgrade their device just so they can get the best app experience is just plain scummy. And i use this app more than any other shopping app. I assume its only a matter of time before support for my device is abandoned completely and it becomes unusable. Thanks a lot eBay!,2
2634,"Limited features for anyone: Cant do everything you need to from the app. Interface is clunky , had an issue of having a watched auction alert come up and went to swipe the notification away and actually triggered the buy it now. At this point I was not able to confirm YES I want to buy it now. I had to contact the seller and ask for them to allow me to cancel. eBay customer service could only repeat their cue card of answers and unable to see or understand the issue.",3
2635,GGR: Ditto....Ebay has been a good experience for me since  I'm  now  a shut in and can't shop on foot at stores.  I was  able to do  my Christmas shopping on ebay this year.  This means a lot to me and  the ability to shop is  entertaining as well.  I feel secure on ebay and confident that ebay's  stringent rules  protects me from  fraud.  I copied this one for me because it fits a all my concerns as well.,5
2636,"Always keeps saying that my items have not been paid for: Whenever I sell something, Ebay for some reason always says that my item has not been paid for. If I try and go to report it, it says that it has been paid for. Ebay please fix this. Also, why do I have to wait a month to receive my money?? So stupid.",5
2637,"Too many bugs/glitches for such a popular app: Way too many glitches and bugs for a program so widely used. I reported a couple bugs via calls to customer service and reps could care less. One glitch I see now is that in adds I create as buyer pays shipping, the app will sometimes show “you pay shipping”. This is just one example of a confusing bug.

Another bug.  The other day I got outbid and the price was way over my highest bid, yet the item kept showing up in my list saying I was winning The auction at the higher amount than what I had bid...  

I could list other bugs... does eBay test their software??",1
2638,"Great shopping resource: I’ve been shopping on e-bay since ? Along time ago. Most of the sellers are honest and sell good products. There are the occasional “not so good sellers” and if you run into one of those E-bay always tries to be fair and help in anyway they can.
I can always find reasonable priced products that are fun and unique. I buy most of my Christmas presents on e-bay. They have everything.
Thank you E-bay for years of enjoyment.
Warmly,
Carrie Edwards6jw2",5
2639,App limitations: It’s bizarre to me that there are still so many limited functions in the app as a seller. The biggest problem I have is fake accounts that don’t pay. They send a message along with their “purchase” with a phone number and then never pay. eBay needs to make it MUCH EASIER to report this. Currently it isn’t reportable through the app at all. The way it is now it is easier for sellers to ignore it and let the account continue rather than reporting it to eBay for removal which is why it’s flourishing.,3
2640,"International Market: What can I say? eBay connects me with people from all over the world, without which I’d be stuck with only America. An international market where you think, “well, someone will want this!” Just wish the fees were 5% I instead of 10%. After eBay and PayPal take their cuts, you’ve got about 80% of your selling price. Which is better than not selling anything at all, so eBay is a win.",5
2641,Surprised: I. Surprised we still have to add the META link for our items visibility and have to check it often to make sure it is still active. There are many glitches to the ebay app and really why is that? Just makes it harder for sellers and even makes you think twice about posting for sale on eBay when there are so many more venues to choose from. Sad.,5
2642,"Simplified interface with limitations: The app is like the express version of the desktop site, however, making it impossible for users (especially eBay sellers) to access important account pages via the app is incredibly frustrating. You can’t even browse the eBay website on your mobile phone without it constantly wanting to convert the page into the “lite” mobile or app interface. Someone should really look into this for those of us users who are constantly on the go & cannot always be on a desktop.",2
2643,"Worthless Garbage: It's slow, it doesn't actually refresh when it claims to refresh, and in many cases it just opens the browser site in a mini web browser anyway rendering the app useless. I've missed out on two bids now because I'll increase my max bid, think I'm winning and do the classic ""refresh every minute"" thing, only for it to end and lose because the bid raised without showing on my screen. This is the most worthless app I've ever used because not only is it easier to just use the site on my phone in the browser, the app itself sends me to the browser a quarter of the time. Don't waste your time.",1
2644,"Too many buyers with zero reviews: Have fun selling something then have a buyer say they found the item cheaper somewhere else and decide they don’t want to pay. Ebay always sides with the buyer and kets them do whatever they like. Have your auction say no returns? Ebay allows the buyer to return the item as if you, as an individual as the sane as a BestBuy. They are a terrible company.",5
2645,"The eBay case decisions favor buyers, not sellers: So this buyer opened a return request saying the product is missing parts. I always post detailed pictures of the products in listing to let the buyer inspect what they are getting prior they make decisions to buy. In spite of this he claimed missing parts and requested a return. I asked eBay to step in and they, within 1-2 minutes, automatically authorized a return with the shipping on my expense. This proves that they didn't even review my case to take a proper decision. Such a bad experience with pre- processed generic customer support. I will not recommend  selling in eBay where you have no seller protection.",1
2646,"Latest version is awful  !!!!: This latest version is awful for sellers. All the features I don’t want are turned on and every time I list an item I have to turn them off one by one. Cannot list anything other than “list till sold or canceled” . Sellers listings  are displayed in huge format, only three per screen, and impossible to quickly scroll down. Everything freezes up when scrolling. I could go on and on about how awful this version is. - please redo. Please take off all pre-checks. Instead of checking the selections, everything needs to be unchecked first- awful! Awful! Awful! - zero stars.",1
2647,"Ebay: Have been with them a long time and I one issue. But the bottom  line the stand by there customers I love shopping her. Most people are scare of shopping on line. I was too but Ebay change my mind. A great and safe place to shop. I look at the reviews which are a big help to me. I ran into a lot of sellers I say 99% was good people. Thanks ebay it’s been a pleasure you guys and girls, ladies and men Rock!",5
2648,"HATE THE NEW VERSION: UNINSTALLED THIS AWFUL APP!
They screwed it up again! They finally got it fairly usable and then they messed it up again.
If you list BUY IT NOW there is no way to choose length of listing...it makes it “Good Until Cancelled” by default so they can force you into relisting automatically. (Remember when they made Automatic re list default and they were forced to change it?) It is all about their trying to sneak things in to make them more money! 
Maybe I don’t want to re list?
You also don’t have any “buyer requirements “ choices again which can cause a giant cluster ***k if you don’t sell outside of the US. (Many of us do not like to cause it is a nightmare and not worth it)
I am warning you... do not list using the app until they fix it. List them on a desktop version only browser (you should try one, they help avoid all that is wrong with mobile versions of websites you are forced to use on an iPhone) or use your computer...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",1
2649,"Broken User Experience: App is like the website now. Mixed design metaphors, inconsistent behaviors and broken features. It’s not all bad, searching is still quite powerful and the selling options are generous. Unfortunately, Ebay dominates the online auction space so it would seem their motivation to create the best user experience possible isn’t all that high. 

Oh, and while your reading this Ebay staff, please fix the broken purchases hidden filters on the app.",4
2650,"They’ve completely ruined this app: Over the last few years this app has been getting worse and worse. I save a lot of searches, probably like a lot of people do, and you use to be able to set filters for those searches so you wouldn’t see the same crap over and over again. But now its just a crap shoot when you open a saved search. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",5
2651,"Sniping: I do not like that eBay allows a bidder to put in a winning bid in the last microseconds of an auction and does not extend the bidding time. The way it is currently set up, none of the other bidders can respond and therefore have no chance to increase their bid. When a bidders snipes the bidding time should be extended 5-10 minutes to allow other bidders the opportunity to respond.",5
2652,"Buyer review: I stopped buying Seiko Watches from sellers on EBay. They were selling me poo. Then I had to go thru many hurdles to get my money back. Now I just buy other stuff. Coffee machine,tripod, and some speaker components. I did learn about the watch world. Only collect the expensive watches. There is a fool born (SUCKER) everyday. Research and enlighten yourself about the item you want to purchase. Knowledge is everything.",5
2653,"Email: My rating will go up if A. There’s a clear cut way to contact a member of the eBay staff... The “contact us” link is a joke. There’s no actually customer service email or forum to contact you through. Just a series of questions and so called answers. And B. You stop limiting the watch list. My watch list maxes out of the time, and it’s illogical on a number of levels. You should want your customers “watching” as many items as possible because it means more sales for you. Please fix this in your next update.",3
2654,"Truly awful: The worst app on my phone - slow to load and filled with spam. It only has about one quarter of the functionality of the full website, and even more annoying is how you are often sent to this lame app while in Safari (thanks for nothing). App doesn't work well with saved searches, still doesn't recall notes entered in browser version, has no way to reach eBay messages, and had too many bugs to list here. If you are a serious ebay user you will curse this abominable app. Those who praise it here are eBay plants or seriously stoned.",2
2655,"NSURL and other connectivity errors: Recent versions are buggy with internet connectivity when resuming the app. I keep getting ""NSURL"" errors when it resumes, and then attempting to see detailed item descriptions fails with ""you must be connected to the Internet"" errors. The only way I've found to resolve that is to kill and restart the app.

Also, switching to the app from an iOS notification fails to open the item mentioned in the notification.

Please fix these silly errors, eBay. They make this supposedly mature app appear fragile.

--------

Spam and stupid notifications

I have been an eBay member for TWENTY YEARS and have sold just one item in that time. Spamming me in your app as frequently as you do with ""special offers"" to sell stuff is therefore unwelcome. You can do better than that.

Telling me to hurry up and bid on auctions 22 hours before they are ""ending soon!"" Is unhelpful.

Increasing the badge count for those things is likewise nuts.

Other than that, nice app.",1
2656,"Wish I could give negative stars: I hate this app and I hate eBay. I say this as a 20+ year seller. eBay takes our money ($10’s of 1000’s per year) and puts less work into this app than a simple tiny game dev working on their own does. The only changes they ever make are to make things more complicated, stupid, or difficult.  They turn the spout on and off on your listings so this week regular sales next week nothing. Search is completely broken. Just. Awful.
  
I’m done with you. Done. No more.  A seller revolt is coming and it’ll be the end of eBay. I’ll enjoy every minute of it.",1
2657,"Amazing finds: There’s so much on eBay. And the app helps find anything you want, keeps searches, and wishlist. Previous and current orders are available. Payments and communication with seller is flawless. Pretty much like the website but in a mobile format. I love it. Especially being able to out something up for sale via the app. Such a timesaver!",5
2658,"Excellent app: I love eBay!  Especially because I can find items that on no longer in production, like shoe companies that have gone out of business.  This is my go-to store, where I can have the comforts of things that I used to wear in the past!  I am so grateful for this site. I have even found some holiday gifts for kids and adults, it saves me a lot of time.",5
2659,Would never recommend to my worst enemy: Sold a 500$ interface on eBay and the buyer received it. A week later he complained about a ding on the corner of it (was a brand new interface  and impossible to have been damaged). The guy filed a claim for a refund and eBay charged my bank account without my permission and refunded him while also letting him keep the interface lol. Worst company ever. I mean ever. Will never deal with them again and will make sure nobody I know uses their services again. Worst website to sell items by far. If I could give it negative stars I would. AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COSTS,1
2660,"eBay: I love to shop on EBay . Very great products , an when u purchase something they keep u updated about your order shipping an where it is also when it’s been delivered.

I search eBay first before any other site to purchase items I’m looking for because I usually find the best deal on eBay.",5

I put an offer on an item and went to sleep, the next morning when i woke up i was negative in my bank acount and charged an over draft fee.

Looking forward to leaving this app for good . eBay doesn’t care about the app or it’s sellers . Company line “we’ll tell IT” and it never gets fixed !",2
2665,"I enjoy using eBay: I am constantly reassured eBay stands behind products some - I two separate cases eBay contacted me to reassure me that if I had problems with item purchased from a seller they would stand behind representations of seller even if seller didn’t —- that gives me great confidence in purchasing through eBay - which I do a lot of - in both cases I was able to resolve with seller but I felt eBay’s involvement made that happen

  That's my 2 major issues with this platform other than that it's ok.",4
2668,E-Bay App.: The “E-Bay App.” is extremely easy to use and there are so many options like your “WISHLIST” for ONE (1) example to make everything easier & more organized for your use! I honestly now NEVER use the main website to shop on E-Bay because the E-Bay App. is just so-SO very much easier to use in my personal opinion! I honestly have NO issue giving the E-Bay App. a review of FIVE (5)⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️out of FIVE (5)⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stars!!!!!,5
2669,I was told by customer service that “even a ret**ed person can do it”: I recently had my account locked for no apparent reason. I called customer service and was transferred to a woman who kept talking over and yelling (actually literally yelling). I was then told “even a re**rd can do it” and that “even an autistic person can figure it out”. I recorded the entire conversation and will have to post on social media to show how this mocks people with special needs. This was the worst conversation I’ve ever had with customer support. This was after being a seller for nearly 7 years with around 800 sales.,1
2670,Cancelled an order due to no product in stock.: eBay has always been right there for me over the years.  I am old and retired now.  My husband is retired military and many things were broken over the years.  Access to eBay made replacing them so easy!  They are quick to step in and make sure their vendors and buyers are honest!  What a great company! 😊,5
2671,Cash out: Good platform to reach interested buyers. Don’t like that they take 13% of every sale and base it off not only sale price but that plus tax??? I feel 7% is fair and more than cover their operating expenses and also give them profit. I disagree with them adding 13% on top of tax already paid to government. A simple computation of tax collected from total of their sales to be sent to feds. Does not need to be marked up again for platform benefit??,4
2672,Seller cancels order eBay still withdrawals money from account: I won a bid the seller canceled the order within minutes. I checked my account it was pending and then with another five minutes eBay withdrew the money from my account over $500 Friday. It is now Monday and the money is still not in my account with an order that was canceled by the seller.,5

2674,"Disappointed: With all of the new guidelines it’s not as profitable to deal on eBay. I sold a pair of shoes on eBay and by the time they took their fees for selling plus taxes plus shipping and then some other fee, I ended up with hardly anything for my shoes that I paid a lot of money for. 

I look for alternative ways to sell now days.

Sorry eBay it’s just not the same anymore.",5
2675,Better than the local store: Anytime I need an item I have learned to check eBay. Most of the time it’s there and cheaper than the big blue box store even! Sometimes I can get two of the item cheaper than the local store. Shipping is fast. By the time I really need to use the item it’s here! Almost everything is guaranteed or they make it right. It’s AWESOME!,5

When bidding on items to purchase there is people canceling my bids many times says view reasons in bid history and can never find bid history. Happens at least 4 times a month if not more. But when lost my phone for day or 2 and was alittle late on payment red flagged me for who knows how long very one side especially since spend 1000’s each year with eBay,2
2677,Thank you...: eBay is one of the most beneficial ways to shop; giving so many options and as well so many items and categories to choose from. They have worked with me in the past with grievances with seller’s and have been able to work out any other issues thus far. Will continue to shop .,5
2678,"Stuck in time..: Been a seller here for over 10 years and I can say that in the past decade eBay is really just behind the times in a lot of things. While they are the leader in global buyers the clunky listing/app/offers/lack of bundling/lack-luster customer service/lack of seller protection has made me head over to other platforms… really hope that after 3-4+ years of “attempting” to streamline paying issues they can get it figured out… this is an on-going issue.. eBay, when will you sort this out?",2
2679,"If I could give it zero stars I would: Ebay screws over their sellers and takes their money, makes it impossible to get payments that are on hold, and has the WORST customer service I’ve ever suffered through. I have now talked to over 5 separate representatives attempting to resolve account issues; each one was in a hurry to get off the phone, entirely unhelpful, and almost impossible to understand.

Most of the sellers can truly be trusted.  I have had some great experiences in the past with sellers.  Especially the ones that back their products with accurate information.   Good job,5
2683,"Works as it should: I personally have not had any issues with the app. It’s obviously not the same as using the desktop site, but everything that I need to do on the go works as it should. I can check on the items I have for sale and get a quick idea of what is going on from anywhere. No complaints.",5
2684,"Finding Rare Books: I am a writer. I was secretary for my class in high school, Class of 2006. Ever since I have been writing in libraries. I pretty good at finding books in libraries but less good at finding things with Artificial Intelligence. I therefore talk to everyone that I see—conversationally. Is there a good way to find a series of key-words particular to book-finding? Some kind of jargon key?",5
2685,"Cleaner than website but missing features: The iOS app stills lags way behind in features, though at least it’s usable.  Examples: Notes on items; lists other than Watchlist. (For the latter, they miss a golden opportunity to make it easy to move items between lists, by having selection logic already there, but having Delete be the only option, as opposed to Move to Another List. Someday they might even figure out it’d be useful to have a Trash list, but I digress.). And the only way to give app feedback is still only to complain by writing bad reviews, like this.",1

Then it decided to rule in my favor, before telling me to get lost, and that I was the one committing the fraud because I was contesting the charge with my credit card. I will be filing mail fraud charges with the federal government, the attorney general, and in addition, they lost a customer of 20 years. SCREW EBAY - ITS A SCAM.",1
2687,"eBay is Great Shopping for Specialties: I like shopping on eBay as it seems endless the possibilities of selections.
The only thing I don’t like is some sellers won’t ship to a post office box.  That is my sole source of reception by mail.  I’ve had that be so since 1978 and have encountered many difficulties with shippers.  
I love to shop on eBay!
eBay is the gold standard for variety online shopping.",5
2688,"Latest edition stinks: Why did EBay feel the need to change the app viewing of saved items? Now the pictures are so small, you have to click on it to see what it is. Besides the huge blank page setup, it’s a fail. Besides why do they keep changing things for just the sake of change. I wished they would just leave it alone.

Also, no one asked to have the phone # removed, now you have to contact them through Twitter or email. Bring back the 800 number to talk to a live person.",2
2689,"I’ve had better: Nagging me to rate the app and not allowing me to dismiss the message permanently earns you three stars. Seriously this is one of my least favorite practices from developers so I’m rewarding you accordingly. Sure, it doesn’t do much to change the overall rating, but if you keep pestering someone for feedback, don’t be surprised when they give it to you. 

“Is everything ok?” “Did we do alright?” “Is something wrong?”

This is the app version of an insecure boyfriend/girlfriend, eBay.",3
2690,"Great marketplace.   Could be better.: Always a great place to sell and buy used sporting equipment.  

However, eBay needs to do a better job of discouraging bad bidders who win auctions with no intent to pay.   It wastes sellers time and money and ruins the experience for all buyers.

The obvious solution is to bill credit card automatically when auction ends.  Other websites do it already.",5
2691,"Website problems: I LOVE buying on EBay, but as big as they are you would think they could stop screen freezes. I’ve researched this on line and everyone says it’s an old problem, you have to delete and reinstall app to fix it. It only happens when you want to look at an item’s picture. Irritating.",5

It does not put them in the selected order, I’ve had to load the images one at a time to get them in the correct order.

I just want what I paid for!! I tried clicking on the thing that says “call” ebay but kept taking me to home page and I tried to repeal but keeps taking me somewhere else and it’s just frustrating that got my money taken away and couldn’t even get my item so thanks ebay!",1

I have been eBay seller for years and would love nothing more than to stick it to PayPal and finally be rid of that parasitic garbage payment system.

2696,"Huge infuriating design flaw for mobile buyers: Automatically sets your input bid amount as your maximum amount, causing an error when you try to bid any higher. UI does not explain this function clearly and will cause you to lose the auction. Very crippling to any mobile eBay user trying to outbid a computer user. Do not recommend the mobile app for this specific reason, for last second bidding wars anyway. Alerted customer service of flaw, as this was my first time using the auction function versus the buy it now option; they deny any responsibility for the error and instead repeatedly blamed me for the auction loss. Great job guys.",1
2697,"Trash: eBay has gotten so ghetto! Rude, ignorant sellers. Scammers/spammers galore. Outrageous fees for actual users, no enforcement for those who renege on auctions. Also slow to process refunds from scammers who clearly haven’t shipped purchases. I’ve been a customer since 2005, now it’s gotten to be a last resort for me. User beware! I can hardly shop due to spamming categories & having to scroll past hundred of t shirts listed as costumes! Not to mention foreign vendors pretending they’re in the US and selling knockoff items using stock photos! Stick to that OTHER app that allows photos in the reviews. It’s much better. The fact eBay refuses to catch up is proof they’re complicit in such scams.",1
2698,The new updates make this app difficult to use: I don’t like how you have re-organized the sold item information- I can no longer quickly and easily see what the customer paid when it is time to ship the item. The new updates make selling on eBay a chore instead of fun and quick like it used to be. Can you fix this to make it easier to see all of my shipping/sold/paid information at a glance?,4
2699,Can’t search sold listings.: I messaged there iso team but obvious no response or action. They removed the search feature on your personal sold listings so say if you sold hundreds of items and you needed to relist one of them you can’t find it with the app. The active listings you have they do have a search feature so like say you needed to find an item and change the price. Before doing any updates always save a back up of the older version they keep adding so much info in the new feature that’s garbage but since it requires masses to change or get eBay to change you will just have to live with it.,1
2700,"No good: Worked great until the last update.  I sell on e bay every day. Now the app doesn’t communicate with my camera while listing - just goes to black screen and freezes. I have uninstalled it twice , I gave it permission to access camera twice and still crashed when I try to take a picture of the item. Need some help here ASAP",5

Finally have where the weight can be added but then it will not let you choose a shipping service ( ex first class , priority , UPS ) GET WITH THE PROGRAM . Takes forever to do one listing correctly thru the web browser .",5
2702,Terrible customer service: I have been selling things here and there on eBay for a few years now and it’s never been a problem. But recently they refunded someone money because they said they didn’t receive the product I tried talking to the person and to eBay. I had proof that the person had signed for the item from the tracking number. But eBay still told me it wasn’t good enough. So now I am out my product and money. I would not recommend selling on this website unless you are very aware of who you are sending your package to. Because eBay will be no help when your item in stolen.,1
2703,"Don’t update: If you’re an ebay seller who lists mostly on mobile don’t update.

Even after weeding through 20+ scammers that eBay doesn’t help filter. Then they proceeded to charge me OVER 10% ($92) of the final price after not even seeing $50 from fees already taken out. ($8 just from PayPal) Overall I lost $242 from selling a product I got $880 from before fees. I would’ve raised the price if I had known so much was going to be taken out. 

I haven’t had problems buying on here, but after this I will not be buying OR selling on eBay again.",1
2705,"Latest Update Poor on iPad: Don’t get it with apps. Developers must sit around every day thinking up changes to make just for something to do. Geez, if everything is working OK, go invent something for someone else for crying out loud. Latest update results in ended items page displaying poorly. Only half of the item description shows for ended items making it difficult to tell if an item has been relisted. Guess app developers do this purposely so another revision is needed. Job security in the IT world.",3
2706,"Auto Relist?!!: The latest app update is defaulting to automatically relisting auctions (and charging me the listing fee) after they end. Even if the original listing did not have this option checked. There’s nowhere in the app to turn the auto relist option off either. I have to log in to a desktop or desktop site to manage my listings individually to uncheck the auto relist box. Absolutely ridiculous! This didn’t happen before so I don’t know if it’s a scam to try and make them a few extra coins or not, but I will no longer be using this app. I can see a lot of angry customers and possibly a lawsuit stemming from this one.",1

Wow, EBay has absolutely outdone themselves with this new app!",5
2708,"Greedy and sneaky!: As most know, ebays fees are just ridiculous now. 

Sneaky because these slim dogs tried to cheat me out of 3 thousand dollars claiming I owe them when they had my money on hold. Meaning, they had my 3K they never returned and then said I needed to pay them another 3K. So 6K out of my pocket due to their errors. It took MONTHS to get my money back to a point where I was one day away wasting money on a lawyer and trying to fight ebay and probably would have lost anyways. 

They made Mistake after Mistake and left me out to die. If I hadn’t made 65+ phone calls all lasting around 45min or sometimes over an hour .... I would be out 6 thousand dollars and the worst part is they treated me like I was the thief. 

Never again will I do business with them. They already rob you just from their listing commission but god for bid if you have a transaction that has to be returned. Good luck eBay night just own you. They never protest sellers, knowing so many buyers are full of crap.",1

It makes buying so much easier with navigation bars that are easy to follow, it has everything you need to bid, look and compare.

2718,"Overpriced, stopped accepting Amex: eBay has become bloated and WAY overpriced. I feel like their whole game plan as a company is to keep increasing fees until the company collapses because people are going elsewhere. Asking for basically 20% commission is absurd.

The final straw is that they are going to stop accepting Amex which is a CLEAR sign that they are scammers. The only reason businesses don’t like Amex is because they actually stand up for their customers when they are taken advantage off.

A big red flag for eBay being an abusive company is them no longer taking Amex.",2

I spend a lot of money on eBay so your support teams shouldn’t cut out old versions and limit what generation device I use to buy products from, which builds you revenue. Foolish. 12 year member outed by your updates on my main device I use at home due to forced to update to an OS IT CANT SUPPORT. Not cool.

Great app otherwise.",5
2748,"eBay is #1: I’ve been shopping on here for years‼️     I buy everything from this site because it has been so easy to buy the things I need.
Honestly, you can find gifts for people during the holidays or for any special occasion. I mostly buy all of my vitamins, make up, and clothes from here! I’m Very happy that eBay has everything I want❣️",5
2749,eBay is great!: I love eBay! It’s the best place to find items that you need at an affordable price. Their prices are usually lower than most competitors and shipping is most often prompt. I’ve only had one issue with a seller and eBay quickly remedied the problem. Contacting them was slightly difficult but other than that I really like eBay. And would recommend it to everyone. 👍🏼,5
2750,"No protection for sellers, eBay does not care!: If your a seller you have zero protection. It doesn’t mater what customer service tells you, you have no protection at all from anyone scamming you when you are a seller. Buyer can claim the item is not as desicrbed as either we back or file a return within 30 days and u will have to pay for return shipping and thycna send back a different item you probably sent and eBay will do nothing to help the seller. eBay is trash... PayPal is super trash. Try mercari or another selling platform hat actually cares about they’re sellers and protecting them from scammers! If i could give them zero stars i would",1
2751,"Just started and ready to quit!: I became a member over the weekend and instantly found many of my collectibles that I started bidding on and placed in my cart, after 4 bids and 2 items in the cart, I rec’d a statement stating that I had too much and I needed to buy something immediately so I did and removed items from my cart, I could not do anything g with items o bid on as the bidding wasn’t over for a few days.  I found a piece that I do dearly wanted after that but it repeated that I had too much and needed to buy something, I could not even make an offer!  BIG, HUGE mistake on your part eBay as I have money to spend and you blew it!",1
2752,"Why I won’t sell on EBay: I enjoy buying on EBay because I’m a good buyer. I’m not trying to get something for free or scam the seller. That being said, I will not sell on eBay again. 50% of my buyers are trying to scam me and EBay always backs up the buyer. Most recently I’m out $150 because EBay said I must accept a return. Gave the buyer his money back out of my PayPal account but the buyer never returned item so he got it for free. Thanks EBay. (Sarcasm)",5
2753,"The most convenient and efficient way to shop: I used to dread going going shopping because I’m not a fan of long lines and rude people. I can remember times when I went shopping and had to stand on long lines, registers freezing, people holding spots for other people on line and rude cashiers. And now that I’ve found eBay I don't see the point in physically going to a store to shop anymore.",5
2754,"EBay’s review: Overall eBay to me has been a good platform to sell my products on. I love The mobile app and original site to work with.
I wish that the mobile app would have some of the stuff that the original app has. Sometimes I still have to go back-and-forth between apps. As far as giving returns to make it easier on the mobile app just a few buttons it would be great I guess you guys will figure that out. I really really like eBay Thank you for the opportunity and happy holidays.",3
2755,"A slow death: As a seller the fees are getting to the point where I don’t make any money after the “free shipping” they almost make you do. Shipping is also getting to the point where a person can drive it there cheaper. Now ebay makes you have a return policy. So the buyer can now try out your item and return it within 30 days....that’s neat. So I am no longer a top rated seller after 20 years because I don’t offer a 30 day return period..... eBay is a buyers site. There is very limited protection for sellers anymore. So, in a nutshell, I do very little on eBay anymore.",2
2756,The best: I shop a lot eBay I love this app makes it easy for me to be able to get the things that I need and want I’ve had just a few problems with it other than that not really too many mostly just the sellers to advertise something and you don’t receive your product that’s not even his fault and that’s only happened three times in almost 20 years,5
2757,"Updates are making it worse: I used to love this app and use it frequently. More recently when selling an item, the listing defaults to allow offers at half your buy it now price. Even if you turn offers off before listing, eBay will automatically turn them on if your item doesn’t sell in a short amount of time. This overall system doesn’t do anything but result in a plethora of unwanted offers. I know what I want to get for an item and if I want to allow offers then I’ll turn them on. Please change it back.",2

2759,"Not having enough information: eBay is Great, but at the same time, still has a few problems.

2763,"Waltmat sellers: I don't like eBay so much because there are sellers who trick us into thinking that we are buying from their store when in fact the products come from Walmart. A great example is: organic wet dog food, those who sell these products come from walmart. If I wanted to shop at Waltmart, I would go shopping there. Sellers should put a description of where the products come from. 

Hey ebay, the app doesn't  blocked users, it has the blocked user and messages options, but after ""blocking"" the user, they can still reply.",2
2764,Buyers app not a sellers: I’ve made a fair amount of money on this app but I’ve also lost money. I’ve been burned on multiple occasions when someone claims they didn’t receive the item that was posted or they hadn’t received the card yet and eBay gives back the money. Now you’re out the item and the money. The fact you can’t leave a bad review on a buyer but you can a seller is crazy. I’m also not a fan of eBay taking such a big cut of my profits. I won’t be selling anymore items on the app. I’ll have to find another way to sell my cards in the future.,1
2765,They charge the seller for sales tax: eBay gets a percentage of the payment you recieve for selling you item. Which makes since. Even though it’s  way too high at 13.5 percent. That’s not the problem . The problem is that they include the sales tax in the calculation when figuring out how much the buyer has to pay. That’s a shady way of collecting even more money from the little guy just trying to make ends meet . I’ll be taking my buisness elsewhere until they fix this. I can handle a high upfront fee . But when you try to trick us by including the sales tax your just being dirty !,1
2766,Happy camper: It may take a few extra days but doing a project getting parts at 1/3 of local supplies is well worth the wait for the savings. I can do more because I’m saving so much.

I never received the item by November, asked for refund/dispute it was past 6 months, EBAY SERVICES FOR REFUNDS/DISPUTES ARE WORST in handling my case, i talked to different customer service people, but they did not do anything!!! Now FRANCOSTUDIO17 still out there scamming and that has to stop! Now i have to talk to our bank and get my refund, they want me to give evidences/screenshots of all transaction because  “ EBAY DOES NOT HAVE RECORD ANYMORE BECAUSE ALMOST A YEAR!” that’s impossible and does not make any sense!",1
2768,Keep having to log back in: I’ve had the EBay app for many years but only recently have came across this issue every time I close the app and reopen it I have to sign back in after reading online with other people having problems I uninstalled restarted my iPhone and reinstalled it still no change still use it every day but it’s just annoying,4
2769,"Many technical issues after update please fix!: After the most recent iOS app update, now I cannot send offers! They are grayed out and will not let me select them. All offers will only work from eBay website. Tried fresh install of app but same issues persist. In addition, now importing photos only works from the app, not the website, which makes it very cumbersome having to switch back and forth just to make a listing or send an offer! Really slows sellers down!!! Please fix!!!",2
2770,"Saved Searches Broken: For a really long time, I had email notifications for my saved searches which was really useful. I basically only buy plants on eBay. Recently, instead of exact matches to my saved searches, I get any single word match. For example if I saved the search  ‘Phalaenopsis amabilis’ I would get 6-7 new ‘Phalaenopsis’ that I don’t want. Today I woke up to 8 emails for saved searches and not a single one was actually something I saved",3
2771,Fix Return Shipping for customers to choose their own: I have been using ebay since 2008. its very strange ebay now doesn't let you choose your own option for return shipping. Item I purchased said free returns. I was then charged $12+ for return shipping when I used to be able to return items free or on my own terms for $8 usps ground advantage ect. ebay is now making at least $5 profit off of returns which is not honest and makes me want to support ebay less. and nobody likes the 15% seller fees on sales either.,2
2772,"Simple and Effective!: I have been using eBay for many years now. I have found over the years that the app is very easy to use and reaches masses upon masses of people looking to purchase specific items. Additionally, it is a great place to search and find most anything.

Highly recommend this app and thankful to have this at my disposal.

Thomas",5
2773,"Please add ability to message users that make offers: The app is awesome except for one thing missing that bothers me frequently.. 

When you list an item buy it now and give the best offer option…the ability to message a potential buyer who makes an offer is missing from the app. This is possible on the desktop/classic mobile site but not sure why it’s not on the app. 

Please add a contact button to resolve this. Thanks!",3
2774,eBay love this app: I absolutely love eBay. I have had very few problems with any of the stores on eBay and if I do have a problem with a product the sellers have always been quick to replace or refund. Always read the sellers policy on refunds or replacements. I have been using eBay since 2009 and wouldn’t be afraid to order anything from them!,5
2775,"Run…don’t walk away…: The process of making a bid is not very easy, especially when the seller is not clear on bidding. Takes 6-11 days to receive a item from seller, the charged shipping is usually half of what is charged and requires a refund from the seller that usually takes 20-45 days and a charge back from the issuing bank. If you open a claim, the seller becomes aware, rude and disrespectful for the rest of the process. This is not the experience I was expecting from a professional billion dollar company. So next is to write a review and hope stuff changes.",1
2776,"Fraudulent sellers ! Buyers beware!: Beware: I’ve used eBay for years with no issues. Recently I had made a purchase for a cellular repeater. After placing the order, I read the fine print that they were only sending me a CABLE, and not what was in the listing or picture. I requested that the order be canceled. The seller said that they would cancel the order. A few days later, the seller denied the cancel request. Instead they provided tracking information for a random address that is not mine. eBay customer service WILL NOT REFUND ME. eBay makes it impossible to get your money back.",1
2777,"E-Bay App: I have been a member since 2002, Must of my purchases are done on the go with my over priced I-Phone. I buy clothes, car parts, watches ...

I can't remember the last time I used my laptop ....and I avoid the hassle of going to the store or the rude clerks at the local auto parts store !",5
2778,"Saved Searches: Yet another feature broken in an unneeded update. Almost every update of unnecessary changes results in breaking the working, existing version. Why do employees feel they need to preserve their jobs by updating things that aren't broken, instead of fixing the countless issues reported on their website?

After weeks of contacting customer service to be told they can do nothing, my only option is to pay for a lawyer to go after this criminal as eBay has no protection for sellers.  I will be closing my account and hope this review will help others second guess selling anything of value on eBay.",1

Thanks EBay Shawn’s Chevy",5
2781,"Updated are AWFUL!!!!: We use the app to see quick access of were items are when they ship as we have issues with our post office not scanning them ASAP. With all the updates you made the app is now clunky, not user-friendly and no longer provides the information that we relied on. We’ve been an eBay user for almost 20 years and the last year of updates have made us question the system.

Please stop all these updates and start asking your users for direct feedback before launching all these “tools” that are WORTHLESS!!!!!!",1
2782,"Atrocious: Sell your items literally anywhere else for a fraction of the fees (eBay now charges sellers 13%), and offers zero seller protection and you aren't even able to call to contact an agent now. Everything is automated garbage that runs you in circles so you cut your losses and lose both the item you sold and the original payment. When a scandalous buyer decides to fraudulently file a return or chargeback. I'll stick to selling on Instagram, and Facebook Marketplace, or even just throw my things away rather than waste both my time and money on this thieving application.",1
2783,"Why I shop at EBay: EBay has an abundance of vendors that allows me to purchase an assortment of items. They are always there to help with vendors that are not serving their customer with the upmost honesty and respect. They will solve problems that are in need of their assistance and may resolve the issue instantly depending on the gravity of the issue. Overall they truly love and respect their customers in my opinion.

Neise",5
2784,"Hidden Fees For Sellers: I ended up selling a very in demand electronic on eBay and the experience was awful. First the app itself wouldn’t let me list it the way I wanted, then it wouldn’t let me take the listing down, then my inbox got flooded with scammers trying to sucker a new seller into shipping the item off to a new address, then eBay itself screwed me over with so many fees and nonsense that in the end it would have been cheaper for me to return the item rather than sell it on the 3rd party market. 

Absolutely horrible experience on this app. Never selling here again if I can avoid it",1
2785,"Fees are to High: Honestly believe the only winner is eBay, fees are to high for what eBay actually provides. 12 - 15 percent is to excessive and I have turned to other apps to sell locally. Most of the products I sell often get so few views that you are forced to used their optional offers like ads to stay competitive which often adds another 2.5 to 5 percent. They also never charge the shipping label right away often have a charge weeks after I have already shipped the item. 

It impacts small sellers and buyers all together with these type of fees, it hikes prices for everyone.",1
2786,Good app: Amazing app to buy things. Very useful for me and the concierge service for me has always been so amazing. It’s such a peace of mind that I have that I can order something I know I can always have my money back if it’s not the way I expected it on the listing. Very beautiful in terms of how it works. I will keep using eBay and most likely use it all my life.,5
2787,"eBay review: Hi, I have to say. “dealing with eBay is definitely a five star experience, I’ve run into several different issues and eBay has stood by my side on all. 
   eBay has both the buyer and seller covered, best policies and they are fair to all, eBay is my go to app when I need to shop for anything, best prices, service and most of all,  they have your back. Thank you eBay,   Tom",5
2788,"Friendly Shop App: I’ve been using this for many years since 2003. I like the way they set it up. But there’s some seller that are trying to ruin your days if they don’t help you after you paid the item. Which up to now there are some. Other than that it’s a good app.
My advice for this app,  make the shipping better.",5
2789,eBay: I love this app for so many reasons I’ve been bedridden for the last year but shopping has kept me from falling into a depression everything I order and it’s a lot of things comes on time and I always get it I used to worry that maybe I wouldn’t get what I paid for but that’s not the case I get everything I order in a timely manner,5
2790,"Great for Buying and Selling: App allows us to conduct the sales end of our business (listing and shipping) with ease. Very flexible on the sales side which was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Buying is a snap with the app, as well. Very pleased with the stability of the app, as well. You would expect the app to crash from time to time but we haven’t experienced any issues.",5
2791,"🥇⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🎖: eBay, still the original anything you can imagine at anywhere in the world marketplace, and still the pioneering number one in my humble opinion. I’m able to count on less than one hand how many reviews I’ve left in my entire life, and happily did so when requested by The eBay App to do so. Proud to continue on as a buy n’ sell eBayer for life.",5
2792,Free shipping on most items: I purchase a lot of auto parts from companies that charge a fraction of what I would pay at a auto parts store. I make soap and purchase most of my supplies from reputable companies the sell quality product. Free shipping on products  it cost way down. I just ordered sodium hydroxide from a company(not on EBay). 2 pound bottle was $8.95. Shipping was $15. I will now purchase mine on EBay from now on.,5
2793,"Sellers Beware: Absolute failure is what eBay has become.  I can not express the dismay and utter disappointment felt with what used to be a fun / positive experience.  The “seller” no longer has any stance or recourse regarding anything they are selling.  Deadbeat bidders can easily come along and exploit the process, cancel their bids after the auction is complete or even force returns on used / non-returnable items!  Just being a normal joe, I’ve sold minor items from time to time for the last 14 years.  Up until now it was a fair and equitable process and return.  What eBay has become is inexcusable and pathetic.  FAIL!!",1
2794,eBay customer service: There comes times when we would have to contact eBay via telephone or chat service and eBay always takes care of the concerns we would have contacted them about and eBay has been our site of buying things and selling for 23 years now and we hope for many more years with this wonderful company!,5
2795,"Improved app makes shopping more fun: I’ve used eBay for decades, well before smartphone apps. I am buying a bit more on the eBay app now because of the notifications and text updates I receive about items I’m watching. I’ve also found that it’s now easier to communicate with the seller in a way that seems a bit more efficient and professional.",5
2796,"The new changes are not beneficial: I like to sell from the app bc using my phones camera is easier than with a camera and a laptop. However the changes now won’t let u rearrange photos. 
Also with sales when they are relisted they automatically add ‘accept best offer’ even when that was not on the original listing. That is for the laptop version as well. 
Also when purchasing the app doesn't remember PayPal login and it needs to be reentered every time I buy something.",3
2797,"Shopping on EBay: I am new customer of Ebay since January 2020 and I always enjoy shopping on Ebay because there product prices are reasonable besides that Ebay customer service including Sales person are excellent and very reliable and trustworthy most likely I buy every on Ebay except groceries I am very loyal customer of Ebay.
                                    Thanks a lot",5
2798,Does most stuff right but it doesn’t do a basic function which should be easy to find: There is no way to download your shipping label from the mobile app or the mobile web once you generate it. If there is a way I can’t find it after going through all of the menus. I would give it a 5 otherwise.,5
2799,eBay is excellent but App is lacking a bit for selling: I buy and sell on eBay using the app exclusively. It’s excellent most of the time but there are a few unusual things that a seller still can’t do on the app and those few occasions that I have to borrow a laptop to do something that should be really minor but turns into a major production really irritate me.,5
2800,"Going downhill: The application used to work flawlessly. After the last upgrade, when I try to list recently purchased items it states that I have no new purchases. The layout was more convenient with the prior version.

Also, several listings which state shipped from U.S.A., take so long to arrive that I suspect they are shipped from overseas.",5
2801,"Problems with the latest update?: Used to work great, seamless, no problems. Now the scroll doesn’t work, the filter buttons don’t apply when selected, the app frequently freezes, and when I want to look at an item in my watchlist I tap and the app doesn’t respond. Very aggravating. Please fix!  Also, please add ability to delete items from the shopping cart in the app, increase the maximum watchlist capacity to allow watching of more items, and add item description to the default view when an item is clicked on on the app.",2
2802,Worst app do not buy from here!: I bought a “JBL” speaker which it was not a JBL by the way. I payed 70 dollars for a speaker that did not work it would not turn on. And to top it of it was fake. I contact the seller to send me a label and he/she did I sent the item (I got proves) and I never got a refund back. Not from the seller. I contacted eBay and they said the couldn’t do anything about it. I recommend not buying from here.,5
2803,"Latest update still a FAIL: Your recent update didn’t bring back the search box in the categories , and without that it’s harder to search for specific items. I get it Ebay, y’all want buyers to sort through a vast amount of items with hopes they will buy things they weren’t searching for. I no longer enjoy shopping with this app, I’ll use my notebook. Bye !",5
2804,Still cluttered purchase list: After yet another update this app still makes all purchases appear in the purchased item list appear once they are 3 months old. Why make them show up again? They can’t be clicked on to buy the same item again. All they do is get in the way. Make the deleted item stay that way. Make a history area if you really want to put them someplace. They are unnecessary,4
2805,Disappointed: Recent changes auto re list any item put up using the app up to 8 times using up your listings for items that did not sell the first time. It also automatically turns on best offer on auction items so if I start an item at $10 that value is around $100 I have to receive offers for $10 and less I then have to respond to each one or it looks like I don’t respond to my customers.,4
2806,"Horrible Platfotm: First let me start with the app. Although the phone is a convenient way to buy things, eBay makes it incredibly hard to do anything else but buy. It is very hard to make payments to ebay. Anytime I have to make a payment I need to do it in 15 steps because it’s so out of date. Second of all, ebay will always side with buyers even though they are completely in the wrong and in some cases don’t read descriptions. Ebay charges unfair fees for things ebay approves that is out of your control. Their customer service tells you one thing but quiet the opposite happens. Terrible app and experience.",1
2807,"No more sort when browsing by category: eBay, why did you remove the sort option when browsing by categories?  That pretty much kills my browsing capabilities on the iPad.  I can no longer go into computer components, pick graphics cards, cpus, or motherboards and sort by ending soonest.  Oh well, I was spending to much money on eBay and this will force me to take a break for a while.",5
2808,"Fix your problems!: I have used the eBay app for years.  Now that I have the new and improved version, I have constant problems accessing my account information.
I’ve tried to call your customer support and they don’t have a clue as to your questions and complaints.
A lot of people in the eBay community are angry, so get on the ball listen to us then fix the problems!!!",5
2809,"Great for sellers: This is an incredibly convenient app for sellers. There are many tools such as the “sell one like this” and the upc look up that allow my 12 year old sons to research and sell items around the world with ease. The only complaint I have it for stores with more than 600 listings. You can’t see all of your listings in the app if you have more than 600 listings. This is troublesome when we want to edit, share or verify something is listed.",4
2810,"Not Better:  Easy to Un-Save Search AND No Search-Count: When is an update, not an update — when the App is not improved or becomes worse!

In your last update, you moved the saved-heart to the left-side top and removed the item-count.  These changes made it very easy to un-save a search by grazing the saved-heart when pressing the back-arrow (<) above  it AND you made the App less efficient in regard to item-search information by removing the item-count.

Seriously, what are you thinking????

Searches should be purposely removed, NOT accidentally removed due to poor placement of the saved-heart.

Item-count is important for searches and provides helpful information for the user.

Why don’t you try using the App for a while?  If you use the Apps that you create then you would notice the problems that you have created and incorporated into the Apps.  Apps are for use — try using them before you release your next “updates”.",1
2811,Nothing works and it’s super slow!!: I usually never complain about apps because rarely does an update affect what I’m doing in the app until now! Now my views and watcher counters remain at zero. Sometimes they appear and sometimes they don’t. When I click to see what I’m selling it just keeps spinning and spinning and sometimes I can’t click on those auctions. So now I can’t choose my own date on a “buy it now” auction?? eBay you now took away the sale increases we get surrounded around an auction about to end. We will never get that now. Lastly the app freezes and locks up when I’m creating new listings. Way to go eBay!,1
2812,"Must have App/ But does have its downsides: This is a must have App!  It makes listing on the go possible.  It does have a lot to improve on that’s why I have it 4 of 5 stars.     There are many things it can't do that the desktop version does.  I find myself starting a listing with this app, and then finishing it up on the desktop version.   I look forward to them adding more functionality to this app. With that said I use it all the time.",4
2813,"The app checkout: When clicking on shopping cart if there is a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff in saved. You have to one by one delete stuff and in saved you have to one by one move to cart or delete. 
You also loose your place when you go from saved to cart and back or cart to search and back to cart

Need a multiple select tool",5
2814,"Works for buying not selling: This app is useful when you are buying only. However, it freezes up (server timeout) when using selling features and does not have all the features of ebay on a computer browser. This app has gone through several updates without fixing this issue. Cannot edit details for multiple items. Turns on intl shipping when you dont want. Never gave me option for immediate payment required. Now I have unpaid buyers and will have to fight to get the fees back from ebay after canceling these orders.",2
2815,I love ebay: I have used ebay for years for both selling and purchasing items.? I do wish that they protected sellers a little bit more. They definitely protect buyers from scams but not so much sellers. Someone opens a case and your funds get frozen. Leaves sellers open to scams of people claiming to not receive an item or to have received an item damaged. I feel that a couple things could be improved. Especially since we pay seller fees and final fees..,4
2816,"Have it at your door soon.: I retired the first of the year. Seems like I was always thinking of something I could use. My first thought was, do they make such of a thing, then, where can I buy one, and how much should it cost? Go to The Ebay app, describe what you are looking for, and like magic, instantly, photos, descriptions, price, and when it will be at your door. How rest life is in our age.",5
2817,"SELLING ON E BAY!!!: My name is David Bork and I’m new at selling anything on E Bay. E Bay seems to be a great way to place things for sale that you would like to get rid of and make some cash. The only drawback I have found myself is that it’s lacks customer assistance to help you when you have a question about how to make sure you are listing your property properly . So do be prepared to spend some time when listing your first item as you are going to have to figure it out for yourself. However, once you get your items listed you sit back and watch the bids come in. Thank you and the best of luck in selling or buying your new stuff😊😎👍🪼🐡🦀🦜🦈⛵️🚙🏝️.

2818,"Cannot upload photos from filesystem: For some reason, they decided to design this app in such a way that you can only add photos for a listing from the Photos app. So, if you have photos of the item that you're selling saved to your desktop, you cannot add them into the posting with this app. I've tried a dozen different ways and it is not possible. The only workaround is to add the photos of the item that you're selling into your Photos app, which doesn't make any sense because those photos would be deleted after the item sold.",1
2819,"Make offer market is useless in most: When it comes to (Make offer market is useless in most or best offer), it looks it’s not been watched by eBay. I feel some sellers put it just to attract buyers , in most they either don’t respond or reject or counter back offer with Pennie’s below their list price. Even in some they answer bad back offer with higher than their first counter back amount. Clearly was listed to attack buyers to buy now then that’s all.
Hope eBay move to fix this rigged process.
Thank you",2
2820,"Flex head ratchet: I ordered a flex head, Snap on ratchet The seller did not lie about the tool being used and told me that the switch was broken when I received it it was A little more beat up than I thought. I think I paid too much for the ratchet when I could’ve spent 30 more dollars for a brand new one but it did come in pretty quick.",5
2821,"Keeps shipping to old address even though I have deleted it: I moved and deleted my old address from my Ebay account. Nevertheless, somehow any time I order something off Ebay it gets sent to my old address despite the fact that I have completely deleted it from my account and specify my new address when I order items. I am at a loss for what to do. I have ordered multiple items and specified my new address only for them to get delivered to an old address, money wasted. Guess I cannot use Ebay anymore as nothing I order will actually get delivered to me.",1
2822,"Please fix addresses! 🤬: There are 5 different addresses for eBay. The app, however, only shows 1. So if you change this 1 address it is only changing your shipping address the other 4 addresses are buried in your settings, but you can only access from a PC 🤬 And nowhere is this explained I had to find it on a forum… so I had only been changing my shipping address for the past 13 years I’ve been using eBay I sold that the purchaser returned and it went to my original address that I had 13 years ago. Needless to say I never got the item back and was out $600 🤬🤬🤬",1
2823,"Refunds are terrible: The refunding system should be revised eBay takes your money directly out of your account and you have to wait 5 to 7 business days for your refund. Very deceptive it caused me to have insufficient funds in my account for my purchase after a mistake I made on the address. The money’s said refunded but in ALL ACTUALITY IT WAS NOT THERE! And am still having issues with getting my money’s refunded. There are more and easier ways to handle these circumstances. 
The customer service is very hard to understand because they do not understand the English language very well.",1
2824,"Does not properly honor iOS settings: I have the ios setting “In-App Ratings & Reviews” turned off in the settings app.  However, this app still asked me to review and provide feedback. This app is not properly respecting my iOS settings.

Description for this setting is as follows:
“Help developers and other users know what you think by letting apps ask for product feedback.”
Please stop asking for product feedback when this setting is off.",3
2825,"Zegna for $35–WTF?: Today I bought an Ermengildo Zegna, subtle grey window-pane plaid sport coat for $35. I know this 2-button, peak-lapeled, twin-vented jacket was $15-$2k when new. The seller saw that I looked at the coat yesterday and sent the offer. The all-wool expensive fabric will make a pair of jeans look great when worn with dark brown Johnson-Murpheys I bought last week for 4.99+$12 shipping. At worst, I’ll spend $30-40 having my tailor shrink the jacket’s arm holes and sleeves. If you know what to look for, Ebay is a wellspring of bargains—and cheap entertainment. It’s fun!",3
2826,"eBay review: They have been an outstanding source of items, and products that I have needed over the years were enjoyable to see what’s on for sale and what’s bedding stuff. I have this gauge trains, and I can always count on them and having a large variety of items that I need keep up the good work PS don’t lay off too many people!!!",5
2827,"Review: Enjoy the way I can order the items that are available, it’s just the easiest and most convenient way to get the things that I want for myself and avoid the hassle of going to the big box stores. I’m a single Dad raising a child and working also so it’s a no Brainer for getting the things done easier across the board",5
2828,"eBay Wants Its Pound of Flesh: Don’t buy or sell on eBay. Since breaking from PayPal, eBay has decided they need to devour up to 60% of every sale. EG: I sold an item for $95…and was paid $56. I sold another for $50 and was paid $20. Etc. etc. All the missing money disappears in eBay’s hidden fees, which are all too easy for them to hide from those using this app. As a result it’s also more expensive to BUY on eBay, since people have to make up for eBay’s exorbitant charges, and the variety & quality of what’s on sale is vastly diminished. Don’t bother with eBay and don’t bother with this obfuscatory app.",1
2829,"Needs updating: The app is for the most part alright but if I’m being honest here, this app appears to be out dated and not very smart at all. It is 2024 now and there are a lot of apps out there that make it look like the eBay owners just don’t care to update their app or fix the bugs. For the price sellers pay to sell on this platform seems like eBay would have top notch software. Just a thought.",4
2830,"Seller Feedback: Thank you, seller experience is getting better by the year! A couple scams to avoid here and their, but it appears you take care of them rather quickly. I will point out people gut electronics and return them, so i will start avoiding them as much as possible (unless guaranteed profitable.) Thanks again and a great source for extra income!",5
2831,eBay: What ever you want they have it from any swim bait made to your everyday use what I like the most is the wide selection of lures at your fingertips from top water to worms. If you’re auto parts store doesn’t have it rest assured eBay has it at less the cost and it’s better quality. From everywhere on earth if you need it they have it !,5
2832,"Horrendous selling platform: If you’re a big company or a pawn shop type business selling stuff, no problem. But if you’re an individual seller just selling stuff around the house, don’t bother. Their new system and processes are HORRENDOUS. They now control EVERYTHING. You can no longer accept PayPal or any other payment method. eBay controls all aspects of payments. They then hold your funds and take forever to release them. It doesn’t matter if you’ve been buying and selling for over 20 years. All that matters is that you registered under their new system. It’s horrible.",1
2833,Items are USED: Since Covid over 90% of the items I’ve orders are sold as new but are clearly used. This happens almost every single time I order an item from a huge variety of sellers. I’ve been on eBay since 2013 and I never want to use it again. This week I bought shoes for a wedding advertised as new and they were completely used! I can’t contact eBay to tell them and once you return an item you can’t leave feedback anymore. These sellers have zero repercussions! No accountability! And I lose every time. The standard has completely dropped.,1
2834,"Best and my Favorite App: EBay has been one, actually it is my favorite site to buy original items. I also like the fact that they do have items that are new, but I often search for items that are reusable. And a lot of these reusable items are priceless to me. 
eBay is my favorite app for purchasing unique items!",5
2835,Big world known well run: I have done a bit with e bay and only little things that were just miss understandings authentication is very much enjoyed questions answered fast from what I have witnessed no tolerance for less than horrible behavior the only reason I don’t invest in the company they don’t pay a dividend lol all in all wish all companies ran as well as E Bay,5
2836,"I love eBay: eBay is a great place to shop I have shopped here for years and it is so useful to find great stuff at a discount it is like a karm or goodwill but you know your going to find great stuff here. And they usually have free returns and if you don’t like something and they won’t let you return it then sell it on eBay. Have a great day and god bless you all.
Hope this helps.",5
2837,Please update the app: I’m leaving only 3 stars because the app gives me constant slow access no matter how many times I refresh the app. The notification section takes hrs before updating in real time compared to the website. I’ve noticed this weeks lots bugs and glitches with the site on the app for IOS. I hope you'll correct these issues going forward. Thank you for taking time to read my feedback.,3
2838,"DoNotUse: Would not recommend using eBay to sell. All policy is skewed in favor of the buyer who can at any moment declare your item defective forcing you to eat the cost of the item, shipping fees round trip, and processing fees. You aren't allowed to leave honest feedback regarding buyers and your experience with them. There's numerous scams that occur within the app that never receive any real attention. For example, someone can send a high bid on your item and then flake on the payment which locks your item up and doesn't allow you to sell until eBay eventually decides to step in.",1
2839,"Selling Items.: I don’t recommend in any way using this app because they don’t let you sell certain things for example: I attempted to sell something Fire Department related, turns out I cannot sell a flashing light because it’s “police/government related” on top of that they charge to much when it comes to buying an item, eBay wants more than you can give them. I recommend using the app “Mercari” a better version of eBay that lets you sell anything in an easier more complex way, they still take a percentage off you selling but it’s not as much as eBay.",1
2840,Friend of EBay: I have used EBay for years and always enjoy looking around to see what all I can find. I have never been disappointed. It is a great way to find items from the past. It brings back many happy nostalgic memories just looking at some of the items from my childhood and younger years of growing up. Thanks EBay Lucindy,5
2841,"eBay Does It Best: I have been a member of eBay for 23 years.  Yeah, way back when things were much more difficult to do etc.  Isn't it amazing how selling a PEZ dispenser started something, and how it has grown and improved over the years.  Life changes and eBay has done well by us, it's customers and in turn, we have benefited.  Thank you ebay.",5
2842,"I’ve never not been able to find what I want: As a seller for over 10 years and a buyer for even longer, I can’t recommend eBay more. There isn’t a single product I’ve searched for that I haven’t found, and all but a small handful of over 2,000 sales were paid for (and quickly). Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or both - this is the app to have!",4
2843,"Terrible watch item reminders: Why would anyone want watch item reminder notifications? They are useless and annoying; especially when they spam your phone dozens of times per minute.
You can’t turn them off without disabling other notifications that you need.",5
2844,Shopping on EBay: I just love to shop on EBay ! They have most of what I need! I’ve ordered fish and they arrive alive and healthy most of the time! They don’t always have free shipping but I am grateful when they do! I ordered 3 Oscars at a very good price and they sent me four! I will order more fish from them again! The Oscars were so cute and healthy! I will continue to shop on EBay!,5
2845,"App has a ton of scammers: Purchasing items has been fine. The few items I bought came and were exactly as described. Selling on the other hand…

I’ve been trying to sell items in here. Each time I get a buyer, it’s a scammer asking me to text or email them to complete the transaction. Days go by and the buyer doesn’t make payment through the app and I end up having to cancel and repost the item. It’s an endless cycle. eBay, please do better about the amount of scamming that goes on with “buyers”.",2
2846,"Changes: Stop making changes that are confusing! Make a place for everything I goto selling and it takes me somewhere else. Little arrow in the top left is confusing. Your fees are too high, and your payout deal is more confusing than ever! Printing shipping label freezes and everything you can do from the web version should be in the app. Version. Way too confusing! And like every app it’s hard to contact customer service.",3
2847,EBAY⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🤗: eBay has been a great source for buying things from around the world. I Love those pieces of history dug from the earth with so much history behind them. Ebay has something for everyone and I’ve never had a problem since I’ve been using this sight. I just need to learn to start putting some of my things for sale now!,5
2848,"Still too clunky to sell items using on phone app: I stopped for a few years and started selling things again recently and it still seems clunky and non-intuitive.  There’s just way to many categories and thing to enter.  Things should be better pre-populated based in UPC codes or other items.  Regardless, the interface and entry is just too busy.",4
2849,Greedy company leaves room for scammers: This platform will charge you for every little thing 10-20% which is very high. But they don’t actually protect buyers/sellers. They leave too much space for people who want to take advantage to do so. If you receive an item you can damage it and return it. If you sell an item you can claim it was never damaged eBay has no way of knowing and they don’t care. They’re getting paid regardless and so is the shipping service. They don’t remove counterfeit sellers even after multiple reports. This platform is a wreck. I don’t recommend.,1
2850,eBay didn’t have my back: I bought some comics from this dude and asked if he could consolidate shipping cost since I bought many comics from him. He didn’t and shipping cost a lot. I told eBay about it and they said if they tried to intervene they I may be forced to send the books back and not get my money back and that they couldn’t really do anything about it. No other solutions or anything. I’m just S.O.L. So I was at a stand still. I really liked eBay but after that speaking with the rep from eBay had me change my outlook on them. The seller was bad to deal with but eBay disappointed me,1
2851,"eBay app as a seller: As a seller I would like to see a seller dashboard on the app. I like to see daily, weekly (Tue-Mon same period as payouts) and monthly sales. I would also like to see current and processing available balance for payout. All this data is available on desktop. But most sellers we are on the go and it will be nice to have this data within the app.",5
2852,How ebay could be more helpful to me: If sellers would just provide measurements for the clothing they sell they could sell more stuff sooner. Buyers would not pass up things they like. Who really wants to wait for a return email to provide measurements? It’s easier just to keep shopping. I have trusted standard sizes and been stuck with the cost of returns too often. One wash & dry and the garment size may be off.,4
2853,"6 Updates in a Month??: Don’t know what is going on there, but in just over a month’s time, I have gone from one of the BEST online selling experiences to the absolute WORST!  Managed Payments is a colossal disaster - help screens are helpless, off-shore tech support staff is poorly trained, if at all, mobile version functionality does not come close to duplicating desktop versions, AND eBay’s “take” of your sale has gone UP!  Amazing to me how anything that once worked so well, could now work so poorly!  Ebay, you can do better - a whole lot better! (I feel another update coming on!)",1
2854,"Lack of backwards compatibility: The ebay app tells me it’s expired and i need a newer version ofmios yet my ios says it’s the most up to date version. I only suspect that the newer ios cant be installed on my ipad. Ebay app prompts for a download of an older bersion but when i select download, it goes to an endless loop ofmthe same prompt. In other words, it wont let me install an older version compatible with my ios. I certain am not buying a new $500 device when mine works fine and ebay wont support backwards compatibility. I guess i wont use ebay on my apple device.",1
2855,Too good to be true Scams!!: There are so many scams. They use inactive accounts and price items way cheaper. Then they ship the order right away so you can’t cancel the order. There’s no tracking number. The seller does not respond. In fact when I emailed seller to cancel my order and right they shipped it. I tried to spot it at the bank end but they can’t stop pending charges. Now I have to wait for the payment to hit and dispute the charge. I continued browsing after I noticed red flags on the item I purchased and there’s a lot more fake listings. I knew it was too good to be true,1
2856,Awesome App: My go to app every time I need something I go to eBay first and not just this app but eBay in general because it’s important to know no matter what you buy if any problem should arrive like lost packages eBay has year after year had my back and put your money back into your account and no hassles of contacting this or that place.,5
2857,Terrible app to sell on: I sold a few items on eBay thinking it would be a great experience. Little did I know that was not going to happen. I sold them about 3 weeks ago and never received my payment. I contacted 3 different people from eBay and they all said the same thing that my PayPal account was not verified. I have verified my account multiple times and even contacted PayPal where they said I was all good to go. I have never had such a worse experience while selling products online. I’m definitely never going to use this app again and I hope no one else makes the same mistake as I did.,1
2858,No seller protection!!!!!: EBay offers no seller protection and it is all automated. I was scammed by a buyer and if a human being read the communications I had back and forth with a buyer it would have been obvious. Also don’t believe anything is free with them those days are gone too. Beware !! and use another site I won’t ever buy or sell from them again .,5
2859,"Frustrating: Terrible place to sell something. Have put two items up. Both were “bought” but I have to now sit around and wait for their payment. But wait, they never submitted their payment so now I have to start the process of canceling their purchase which takes another few days. Right NOW, I am currently “awaiting payment” for 4/5 days for an item! Good stuff eBay. Wish eBay would be more stringent with purchasers and payment. Such a frustrating and annoying experience. Just sell elsewhere not eBay. Save yourself the stress and aggravation.",1
2860,Excellent availability of items when in difficult times: I love eBay as during this covid 19 lockdown situation I found almost everything so far that I needed urgently especially when other retailers had out of stock and didn’t had the shipping options  due to unavailability .. I must say when it matters the most for the thing you want to get from this site  it’s valuable  !,5
2861,"Missing key functions: Great app and user interface in most areas. But it is hard to manage multiple listings when you cannot move messages and organize messages into folders on the mobile app. It is inconvenient having to go and do it on the desktop website when I am on the go on a mobile device. Bring the feature ASAP, it is a key feature in communicating on the go! Especially when you manage 100 items a month!",3
2862,Stop auto revisions on my listings: Stop changing my listings to accept offers... if I want to accept offers I will do this myself...  if you keep changing my listings I will stop listing and sell elsewhere where..  This is a big waste of my time to receive these stupid low offers that I will not except and have to go and revise my listings back to the way I had them.. so please stop changing my listings.,5
2863,"Sign in issues: I’ve been trying to log back into my eBay account. I just got a new phone and the app denies my account. It apparently recognizes me but then doesn’t go through completely. The search engine is no help at all, keep saying to download the newest version of eBay when there isn’t any option for that. I would like to get this working again please. I have several gift cards I had linked to the account and now can no longer redeem because the app won’t let me log in. I really love the app, it’s been great for me through the years I’ve had it since, and so this is frustrating.",1
2864,"EBay is a good place to sell but some people ruin it: Ebay is a tad expensive with ebay dues, I have sold for years on here with some great transactions but people mostly ruin it wanting to return items with no valid reason and that’s ok cause it’s Ebay money back guarantee so take advantage of it right, Trying to get through with Customer Care is another story.",5
2865,"Recent searches deleted every day: Since the recent update, my list of the 10 most recent searches are deleted every day. It takes a long tim to manually entry in all of the search titles and filters (by most recent, categories, price range etc). I enjoyed being able to just click on the previous searches, since I did the same ones every day. On the other hand, customer service is very responsive when I have a problem, and I appreciate that.",3
2866,"The Only Place I Shop: Because of eBay I’m able to get beautiful quality timeless pieces without spending a ton of money. My friends are always surprised when I tell them what I paid for great clothes and shoes. Especially when they’re shopping in New York and other cities. Also, I like the sustainability aspect. Not fast fashion that polluted and ends up in a landfill.",5
2867,"This version of app is slow and buggy: This update is not working well. Photos either won’t upload or the app locks up. It crashed several times today while I was trying to list 9 items. What should have been a quick process since we were organized and ready to go, was painful. Extremely painful.",5
2868,"eBay Overall: For years I navigated the eBay site which I found easy. When I downloaded the app initially I thought it would be a tapered down version that I’d find frustrating. 
   To my surprise I found it had nearly all of the same features, but in a streamlined form. Very happy with the app and my eBay experience overall.",5
2869,Why EBay needs a Major App Change: Ebays mobile app is not sophisticated enough for the current trend of today’s consumers and sellers.  The area of issue arises with the lack functionality of the app compared to desktop application.  Another key issue being the co fusing layout of the interface.  It’s been a nightmare of implementation.  Photos which displaying with much higher detail on desktop can not be accessed on the mobile phone even though other sites have fixed this issue.  Without a serious update this app is rapidly falling behind its competitors and integration tools other marketplaces provide.,1
2870,"Annoying Update: So, recently ebay added a function where if you hold the screen for a second on an item and move it “searches for items like that item” this is SOOOOOOO ANNOYING! When I’m trying to scroll through items it suddenly searches for other items. This is not the right approach to this function. Rather, there should just be a button that says “search for items like this?” So that if you want that function you just press it.",3
2871,"Complete garbage: There is a known issue with the mobile eBay app where old purchases from years ago pop up even though they’ve been hidden and won’t go away and just show up as unavailable and you can not delete them. This has been an issue for months and eBay has done nothing to fix it

Edit. 
After several updates they still have not fixed the issue stated above and it also looks like they have no intention of doing so, and to make matters worse as of the newest update the app just crushes even after restarting my phone, and deleting and re installing the app",1
2872,"Some bugs: eBay has some bugs in their app they need to address. Sometimes when I sell an item it moves to the unsold category. Once, a seller posted a shirt from all angles but my app didn’t show me the picture of the front even though she kept insisting that picture was uploaded. I keep finding counterfeit items (like designer purses) for sale on here even after I report them to eBay. They don’t seem to care if people get ripped off.",4
2873,Was 5 stars: This most recent update has taken away features that I need & use when listing items. I can no longer add my store category while listing. I now have to log onto my computer afterwards & go back into the listing to change the category within my store. Also bullet points have been removed from the text options. Then it automatically tries to fill in the price & shipping options. It doesn’t like it when I change it to accurate information. Instead of fixing bugs you added new ones...,2
2874,"App needs an update: I love the app but when I try and check my eBay gift card balance I get the error message “you have tried too many times to check your gift card balance please wait a moment and try again later”!
So I get completely out of the app restart my phone and i still get the same dang message! Yo what’s up with that?
Please update ASAP for this is unacceptable period! Thanks!
Ps when you fix that then I’ll give you a 5 star rating provided there are no other issues!",3
2875,"Simply The Best: I find more of what I want here on Ebay then any other place. I’m an avid wrestling figure collector and I have found that the sellers here can and will negotiate their prices. But, at times, you may have to really pay for what you want, due to other bidders who want it just as much. You just have to stick around. Because, there will be another one or ten available, eventually.",5
2876,"Disappointed with Shipping in new version: Very disappointed with this new version.  When determining shipping options, it used to bring up a list with the associated pricing so it was easy for me to choose which option(s) I wanted to offer.  Now you have to choose each option, one at a time, to see the rates.  Very inconvenient and frustrating.  I'm really getting frustrated with eBay and their modifications. Each time they ""enhance"" their program, they, in reality, make things worse.  You would think a company as large as this would have better usability and design experts on their IT team.",1
2877,"If only no stars was an option. . . validate before you release is the basic requirement: Was required to update a perfectly functioning app to this latest release. Now every time I try and use the app it states that an update is required, and kicks me out of the app . . . Every time. 

When I go back to the App Store, Apple says I have the latest release.

Guess I'll shop elsewhere.",5
2878,How great it is: Love this website to the max not just do you buy and sell stuff but it’s international and you can literally find anything your looking for in eBay love how it tells you everything watching bids best offers sales shipping info tracking info also it’s eBay protected. New or used stuff at a decent price something you won’t find anywhere else it’s like a worldwide swapmeet,5
2879,"Great marketplace, high fees and lousy customer service: Great place to look for bargains. If you know your stuff especially in collectibles and are patient, you are likely to find bargains. Really good bargains can be found from sellers who have no idea what they are selling. If you are a seller, fees are high and going higher all of the time. And if you have a problem, you'll find it hard to reach a person.",5
2880,"Ebay Monopoly: Ebay is a monopoly, the charge on the front end and then screw you in the back. Plan on paying 15% to them, getting no seller protection in return and easily the worlds worst customer service.

2881,"Not functioning well: Most of the time is not loading or updating to the latest event.

Bottom line is you can't run a store or business with just the mobile app.",4
2883,Outsiders tool: I highly recommend eBay as a platform for sellers of all kinds. I have been on eBay for over 20 years and was innovative enough to teach myself the old HTML basic style before all this new fancy technology came out.

2885,"Super frustrating: I have attempted to use Ebay twice for both selling and buying but both times have been nothing but frustrating. When attempting to sell, there were a lot of issues after the buyer purchased the item and trying to put the money into my account. I ended up refunding the buyer leaving us both upset. When trying to buy an item, I got charged twice when I was 100% certain I only had one in my cart. Im attempting to get that figured out at this moment but I might have just lost $400+. I would honestly stay away.",1
2886,"Pleas help: Dear employees, please solve the problem with the automatic account blocking, our store did not violate the rules and certainly did not deceive the buyer, all disputes were resolved during and the goods were also shipped at the time, yes, we had refunds, but this is absolutely normal, because the store is alive and the buyers are all different. I don't understand your policy, if you want to close the store, we opened the 2nd store for the company and it worked 100% perfectly......

If i was interested in the item, then I would save it in my list.  Make sense… right???  Now it send out notifications for items that don’t even apply to what I’m looking for. Maybe should just turn off notifications or delete the app.  Notifications were very useful before.  Now, eBay is just trying to push you to buy stuff that you don’t want. You may want to reconsider installing if this nonsense continues.",1
2888,"It’s just the best: eBay has always been my goto online shopping app. Never had a problem that couldn’t be solved. The deals on here are sometimes unreal. Whither it be new, used or refurbished the prices are always competitive and the app is very accessible,  it’s very easy to use with little to no ads. It really doesn’t get much better.",5
2889,"You FINALLY RUINED IT FOR ME!!!: One of the best features of eBay’s home page was having the “Recently Viewed” items visible with barely a scroll, if at all needed to overlook at a glance for perhaps a return to the listing for a purchase or to wait out longer before decision.

Now have to go to “My eBay” to see it thus making your app a bit less streamlined and perhaps even somewhat more of a kludge now.

The home page is now cluttered with stuff rather loosely related to my past searches and history, but in typical eBay fashion, also includes stuff I may have only searched for or purchased one time out of need or circumstance at the time only to now be visible for “eBayternity”!

Oh well, been transitioning to other sites anyhow as have been finding many of them to be nicer in many other ways over eBay so sooner than later, my post above will all become moot when I’m finally away from eBay!",1
2890,"eBay has it ALL!!: I have been shopping on eBay for nine years now. I have found parts for my car, parts for a motorcycle, an iPhone, tires, a beautiful Antique Kerosene Lamp, etc. The prices cannot be beat anywhere. If you have something you need or a part you’re looking for, eBay has it and at the best prices! I don’t know what I would do without eBay!b",5
2891,"eBay, you have to step up: Hello eBay, I love that eBay lets me buy things on a lower price thank you for that! but my issue is that I bought a thing or charger for my MacBook Pro and the filler that she left it I mean it wasn’t her fault that the shipping service lost it but I haven’t received my refund and I open a request from eBay and eBay closed it. I can’t open another one he doesn’t let me so how how I’m going to receive my payment you eBay need to step up",3
2892,"Very Upset: Dear Ebay —

Your user experience is unclear. 
The defects in your user interface/experience are causing customer and buyer issues. 

In a nutshell— on almost all other online buying platforms, a person can put an item into their shopping cart without ACTUALLY INTENDING TO BUY IT. 

Since this isn’t made ABUNDANTLY CLEAR by Ebay, users are ACCIDENTALLY “infringing the buyers agreement” and getting suspended and annoying sellers. 

Why don’t you just make it like everyone else? 
I just got suspended for NOT KNOWING that ebay’s selling/buying platform is just different than all the others. 

The only way I can get reinstated, is to spend $200 plus shipping on a blender I don’t want or need. 

Fix the problem!!
At the VERY LEAST make some sort of WARNING pop-up when a person taps to put in the cart that will warn them they’re entering a CONTRACT to buy the item, and their account will be suspended if they don’t buy it.",1
2893,"I ❤️ eBay: So thankful for this app & eBay as a whole. I was born into persistent poverty, but selling on eBay has allowed me to afford food/clothes since I was a preteen. I am now in my late 20s. Getting to send alternative fashion around the world has also fulfilled many dreams of mine. Seeing my demonias go to burning man was the best. Sure the fees can be steep, but they do a lot of good work for us on here. Thanks eBay ❤️",5
2894,"Accommodating: eBay’s support makes selling easier. they are very positive, and friendly to their approach which is very helpful when you are new to selling on eBay.  I feel their fees are a fair exchange for the assistance, and broad customer base they provide. I absolutely recommend eBay to other people for both buying, and selling items.  eBay helps to ease my mind of the worry, and uncertainty that can come with selling items online.  That’s worth a lot to me, and I can actually say that I’ve never had any issues with ebay as I’ve come and gone over the years.",1
2895,Just a couple tweaks that would be nice: Saved items on the app should atomically be removed from your saved list once they are no longer available.  Also things that you can’t buy because a seller has blocked you shouldn’t show up in your feeds.  For long time users or people purchasing thousands of things these tweaks would be great.  Wasting time on the app makes for a more frustrating experience,3
2896,W eBay without eBay I wouldn’t have a desktop: W eBay I got a gaming pc from E bay for a good price the only thing is watch out for who your gonna buy off because you don’t know if it’s a scam because some sellers are scam but don’t worry it’s not a scam you don’t get rip off it’s a good place to shop off thanks eBay I will make sure to buy more stuff off here.,5
2897,"A buyer’s perspective: The app is pretty useless as a transactional communication tool. The tracking function does not work at all because it is not integrated with the courier’s electronic systems. This is primitive. The message function does not work properly either. You get a notification and open the message, but you have to open the message a second time in the app before the blue dot disappears. eBay rests on its laurels and needs some real competition to up its game.",3
2898,"eBay has taken a turn for the worse: Selling on eBay?  Expect eBay to tax the buyer “sales tax” then add that sales tax to what you sold the item for, then take 13%!  This is criminal and forcing sellers to charge sell items for way higher prices!  This process is unethical and should be looked into by authorities for business ethics and violations!  eBay has turned into a greedy business & will be looking into selling on other platforms that aren’t taking advantage of people and causing prices to be inflated!   Ridiculous after being a avid buyer & seller on this platform for 13 + years!",1
2899,"Horrible customer service: Refused to refund an item that was not as described, it did not fit my vehicle as described. The seller ignored my messages. eBay refused to help because I selected the “wrong” reason for return. Customer service put off helping me by saying that I had to wait a certain amount of time so the seller could have time to respond. I waited as long as they said then reached out to customer service again. They then said that the return window had closed and I had selected the wrong reason for return so they could not help me. There is no eBay motors guarantee. It’s a scam.",1
2900,"Thank you, Ebay: I’ll tell you what I love Ebay I get my rings from them I get all kinds of things from them I don’t know what I would do without Ebay. They have helped me so much picked out some beautiful things and I’m thankful I have even talk to agents that have helped me pick out certain things and I’m grateful for them. Thank you so much Ebay and God bless you.",5
2901,"Terrible customer service 😔: It is very difficult to contact customer support in person and their website doesn’t have many options to resolve certain issues. Besides that, I had a rude service member, after I got a hold of their number, that gaslighted me about an issue on a purchase (I also didnt fully understand the issue so had a hard time explaining but he just mocked me) 

Long story short, I lost over $500 (difficult situation- Ebay doesn’t seem to side with buyer and doesn’t look over a difficult situation).

Beware Ebay isn’t Buyer friendly.",1
2902,"Payouts: I like the good o’ days of paying and receiving through PayPal right away and using that money for shipping costs if selling. Needed some extra cash for Christmas so sold some collectibles. All items sold in mid December but have to wait until January 11th-14th for “my” money to be deposited into my bank. Had to spend money for shipping as even added shipping cost you don’t see till pay out. Doesn’t make sense. eBay wants you to ship immediately, but if you don’t get the money for the shipping cost to ship the item. 🤪",2
2903,"I get to sell things out my room thanks to ebay: Ebay has given be a creative way to clear stuff out my room but also make some cashy for it. if it wasn’t for ebay I wouldn’t be as happy and clear as I am now. My room is a huge part of my life, so getting rid of so much meaningless stuff my life has now become more meaningful. Thank u ebay I love u🫶🤗",5
2904,Great selection: Many styles in any size. This is my Go To place for very good merchandise. I prefer broken in and rather soft shorts over new stiff ones at a considerably higher price.  I have purchased many items with no disappointments. I had an issue with one as the fiber posted was not what I received. My return was no problem and return shipping paid.,5
2905,eBay: I love the eBay app it just make things more easier so no needing to go on computer every time but like messages system to where someone text you can actually message them. Make a change though where you edit account information only allowed via desktop version.,5
2906,What happened to the product description?: With the new update no listing I click on has any product description at all it is a item categorization and a bunch of similar products with no info on the item listed??!!!! This makes the app worthless if I can not view the full item listing.,5
2907,eBay is my one stop shop: I love eBay I buy almost everything off of it. It’s just so darn convenient to have everything all on one site. I love that I don’t need to go to multiple different  sites to get different types of products. I would not want to shop on line as much without eBay. The prices are always Darn good too! Thanks eBay!,5
2908,"Not a good way to buy things: Honestly, could this platform for buying and selling be any worse? First of all, once you bid you have to wait days locked into a sale that you may not get. There is no way to know if your bid is above the reserve price. And then at the last minute it all comes down to seeing who can squeak in the final bid. So basically you waste a week  with your money locked into  the possibility of a sale and then youll probably loose out and get nothing.  
    
I won’t be waisting my time again.",2
2909,"Purchases: I’ve ask numerous times for help with my purchases screen and I still haven’t seen a response, when I scroll through my purchases it flashes them for a few seconds then says I have no purchases even though I do…..very frustrating since I’ve been spending a lot of money on purchases",5
2910,"In-app needed improvements: When I’m in the cart and I scroll through the items, if I remove something it then takes me back up to the top when I want to stay at that spot. Like when I’m in emails. So whenever I go into an item on a list I just want to maintain my spot when I get back out. This is the case when I’m in the search list so that’s good.  But the cart list, uuuuugggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!",4
2911,Mediocre: Many features you can only get to through the desktop website access. As a seller not being able to have the funds available immediately to pay for shipping is absolutely ridiculous since now they force you to work outside of PayPal. And you can forget getting a hold of anyone through customer service. Downhill slide.,4
2912,"UPDATE: saved searches GONE!: A week ago, not even triggered by an update as far as I can tell, two-thirds of my (well over a hundred) saved searches were gone. There the day before, gone the next morning. Sent an immediate email to support, took ten days but - feels like a small miracle - all saved searches have been restored. Scary but good service.",5
2913,"Review-- Hate This Update!! Put Back the other one!!!: Love the eBay app. The only thing is that if you bid on something and some- one else outbids you and you don't wish to bid again, you can't get rid of that item until it sells, this creates a lot of extra clutter on your iPhone if your bidd- ing on several items. Other than that it's a Great App. Thanks!!",5
2914,"ebay app: this is really great because it makes even listing convenient.  the only drawback using the phone is you do loose some options in shopping.  You can't research what things have sold for, only what they are listed for at that time.  and a few other things, but overall great to be able to search, buy, and sell with just your phone!",4
2915,Review: Like eBay and app and availability of items although sellers should be looking to use different shipping methods because USPS is terrible and shipping of items is taking way to long you when you can pay a dollar or two more and get items within a day or two from ordering it with other sites...,5
2916,Updating info necessary but it doesn’t work.: eBay says we need to update our details or we will “not get paid in the future” so I followed the link on the app to update my details. They want date of birth and social security number. Ok I get it but if you ask for us to update our info so we can get our money then you better have a page that works! The calendar on the date of birth will not let you change it. The scroll wheel just keeps rolling back to today’s date. I haven’t even tried the Social Security function yet. Cannot get past the DoB.,1
2917,Real bad customer service: App does actually work really well but that means nothing with horrible eBay customer service. On my app it shows 5% back on rewards for eBay bucks and my check out is just only showing 1%. Emailed customer service and nothing got done. App is good but if something does glitch on it customer service does nothing to help out with it.,5
2918,"A streamlined version of the normal site: I almost like the app better than the normal website. It’s got what I need and use and a lot less of all the complicated stuff that just takes up space. I love using it to bid. Great notifications. Occasionally a few things are tough to access, like making the “sold” button move over so I can see what has sold, but it’s very minor. Overall I love it. (So please EBay don’t send me any live spiders) 😳😉",4
2919,Needs some updating: Quick and easy to use but does not have all the functionality as logging on to the actual website via browser. If you need to complete additional actions around an item you bid on or an item you bought (such as retracting a bid or opening a case) you have to log on to the website via a browser which is slightly annoying.,4
