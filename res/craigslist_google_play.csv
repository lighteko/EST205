5,This app is cloned,1

131,"Deleting this because the app's search forces me to use a map search with a radius instead of a city name and captures a much wider area than I can visit, and this means every search I make includes 100s of listings that are of no use to me and I can't filter them out. I don't live in a perfect circle. If there's a way to get rid of the map search and only search based on city name, I can't find it.",1
132,very helpful,5

721,"The new Chat notification feature is buggy. Using two-way anonymous Chat messaging directly in the app, instead of using a separate masked email address, or a separate masked phone number, is a great idea to streamline communications between buyers and sellers. But, we have good cellular/wifi connectivity, and the red Chat notification dot for a completed transaction will not go away. We can not tell if it is old or new, and are tired of checking. Uninstalled until this is fixed.",1

752,Shouldn't remove postings so fast. Assuming others flag and customer support never replies emails.,3
753,Craigslist has no customer service. Why would people give their business to companies that do not give them any customer support? We are out!!!,1
754,still useful,5
755,"Cool. Liked the older version but oh well. So iam confused here. How do i manage my posts like before? Judging by the lack of response from the reviews here , i can say the app is now vaporware. Unfortunate Edit: Ok seems you have to close then open the app again to gain access to the post settings. Still kind of annoying. Changed rating",4
756,just started selling some items and am hopeful. i REALLY am impressed at the ease of use of this app. i expected it to be arduous.. but i was pleasantly surprised it turned out the opposite. kudos to all involved.,4

And she thumps and they saying say sweet kind and said that shes clean. But her paws and her feet were yellow and her tail and CONSTANTLY being disrespectful. And the owners who sell there rabbits on craigslist for expensive prices so they can have the money to themselves! This app is trashüóë,1

769,How come no one ever answers Craigslist email. Why is it even there. And everyone in Craigslist chat is a scamer. How bout all listings all should be required to add valid (confirm/verified) contact info before posting quit wasting peoples time. All i do is flag listing when only Craigslist email avaliable,1
770,"Always my go-to when selling something that still holds value. It's also great when I need to purchase anything that doesn't have to be brand new or have a warranty. There are still the scammers who are just looking to steal your data. Best to use a burner phone (cheap tracfone on ebay) for calls and text. Otherwise you will have your # sold to spammers. Remember, rhe alternative is offerup which is mostly lonely trolls and kids wanting everything for free, if not they have a tantrum.",5
771,Its a great location,2
772,Great response from people.,5
773,"I use this app on my Motorola G7 Play 2021 and Craigslist is great for finding remote work and finding help doing whatever it is you made need done and especially for keeping up with the general community off where you're located.

816,This app has come a long way in the last few years. It is fairly easy to use now. If there was just a way to weed out the thousands of generic sales ads.,5
817,Craigslist is excellent for selling items. You can sell just about anything on here. My only complaint is its gigs and jobs section. It's terrible. I haven't had a good experience yet,3
818,Really good app for buying and selling stuff The only thing I don't like about it are all the scammers that try to tell you that you need to prove that you're a real person so give me this code I'm going to send you and the code says do not give this code to anybody but obviously some people fall for this when it makes no sense always tell the person oh yeah I'll prove to you I'm a real person trust me I'm not a Terminator. They're like vultures.,4

They fallow the DO NOT GET SCAMMED RULES by the BOOK! It's like Craigslist gave them the directions to do it! Most of us were taught, if it's not yours don't take it, if you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing, so remember this when you are scamming or leaving a review, SCAMMERS WE DO NOT NEED YOU HERE!",5
1008,"yay, free listing's with less scams than facebook marketplace. I said less, don't get excited.",5
1009,"Craigslist has just gone further and further downhill over the years. It's impossible to buy or sell anything because the platform is so full of scammers, prank callers, etc. CL has made it difficult to report any abuse made to the seller and defaults reporting to just reporting the ad while having to jump through extra hoops to report harassment and scammers trying to scam the seller. It is no longer a legit way to sell online, and Facebook marketplace is just as bad. Grow a pair, Craigslist.",1

1045,"I used to consider Craigslist a go-to app to search for many things, to learn things about other cities in forums. Perhaps it is the effect of social media such as Facebook but it almost seems like a sleeping app where people put devices over-priced to sell in no hurry. The app seriously needs a Craigslist, but I think that by appearances some type of revitalization here would be helpful. It's still a great idea and perhaps the designers need to come together to bring it back in 2024.",3

It has phantom clicks: opens pictures for no reason without me pressing buttons, brings up a menu to ""save to downloads"" for no reason without me clicking on anything at all. All while I'm just trying to browse. It happens a lot, it wastes my time a lot because it significantly increases the amount of time it takes to simply look at listings. If I'm not clicking on stuff, I shouldn't have to waste time backing out of stuff back to back to back again & again",1

1631,very useful,4
1632,"Craigslist has been my primary connection to others for buying and selling all sorts of stuff for many years. Recently I even started looking for a job on Craigslist. My only problem came when I was looking for housing (apartment or room to rent) when I encountered a lot of spam. If I were not so naive, I would have realized ""if it sounds too good to be true, it is"" and eventually I figured out how to tell the difference between the spam and what was real. I should have flagged all that spam.",5

1959,best way to sell,5
1960,"The only thing I don't like , is that you have to email the seller. I rarely use email, it's all text messaging for me. I'd rather be able to send the person a text message. If there was a messenger type option, I would use Craigslist a lot more. Maybe craigslist should create its own messenger. üò¨ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§û",3
1961,I've tried multiple to post a roommate wanted add and no matter how I try and change and reword it keeps getting removed and I have no idea why would be nice if the app would tell me why,1
1962,One of the truly great apps!,5
1963,scammer are bad,4
1964,Awesome!,5
1965,Use it all the time and can usually find what I'm looking for within a week or two. The turnover of merchandise on Craigslist means you need to be quick to buy if you see a good deal which is kind of fun. Would have dropped a star for scammers and duplicate adds on the site from a$$ monkey businesses that I now avoid based on their marketing tactics but bumped back up to five stars because I haven't gotten killed by any of the 100 or so sellers I've met so far and you can't beat that.,5
1966,My item sold in a reasonable time and for what I listed it! Very Happy with outcome!,5

1974,quick response,5
1975,Good. My only complaint is that it sometimes loses my data such that I have to reset where my location is and it loses any saved searches. That honestly might be more of a problem with my phone.,4

2213,"I'm not sure how this Craigslist official app is pulling 4.6 stars. Craigslist plus was far better. Craigslist in an app version is about the only positive side. The inability to select specific cities is the worst feature they've implemented. A radius circle by distance is a very bad idea. This isn't a trader magazine, it's classified adds. Give an option of one or the other at minimum. The inability to have a default sorting option is very annoying. Sorting by distance should default.",3

A good home does not mean Rich and a Poor home does not mean scumbag.

4395,"well I downloaded the app because I've enjoyed using craigslist over the yrs and have always had a five star opinion of the way it's set up for use. However, I can't say I'm all that impressed with the app in that it shows the ""nothing found"" more often than not for any given search request where doing any of the same search request's without using the app the expected content shows up everytime in no time at all.

4691,"Kind of hit and miss for me, I try and remain open, but I refuse to purchase anything that could possibly be stolen. I always ask how/where/why they are selling a particular item. If I don't get a straight answer I move on. I don't understand why people put prices on ""free"" items, then get passed off when you ask why!",3
4692,I get to find all kinds of good deals,5
4693,"Pretty good and a stable app. One wish: when a starred listing is removed or expired, please let the item (even if it's just the thumbnail and title) be visible. It's sometimes nice to know what got away!",4
4694,Pretty good. App is great. There are way more scammers on Craigslist now than there were a few years ago. Caveat Emptor.,4

Other than the weird fact I put a bike up for say, a Mongoose Mack Mega Wheel like new with tons of accessories for 150, posted the IDENTICAL ad here and in FB Marketplace. I got 75 IMMEDIATE hits to buy without question, like, ""PLEEEAASE, I'll come right this minute!"", yet I got not a SINGLE HIT, not ONE RESPONSE, from Craigslist.

4788,Ab,2
4789,"with Craigs List, I feel safer . I think its a more community kind of listing service so fewer scammers or time wasters. CL gives more options for providing information for my listings. The app works like a charm.",5

4791,Very handy!,4
4792,sold items that were listed,5
4793,"well this time around iam very happy I posted puppies I followed there rules and it wasn't taken down and I appreciate that alot a time before I think I had to repost over 22 times don't know why this time was any different someone shouldn't take someone else's post, adds to the problem, finding every animal a home is a must, regardless if it's viewed for sale ,there's only a small little time frame when there puppies or kittens and that is an important factor on finding there forever home.",5
4794,Great app. very helpful. always works well,5

4810,I have had great luck with Craigslist. love it!,5
4811,"great app, I sold my bike in 3 weeks for free!!",5
4812,Severely lacking functionality. The location filtering doesn't work. Still showed me things from the rest of the Lower Mainland despite being set to the sub area of Vancouver specifically. Also you can't use the search modifiers to filter like in the browser version. In the browser version you can put a minus before a term (-student for example) and it will subtract any results with that term. Its vital for filtering housing ads. It's bizarre that the app doesn't allow such a basic function.,1
4813,too hard to navigate,2
4814,Google Play Store has Frozen Craigslist Editing! Or a Craigslist problem and their interferace with Google Play Store! Needlessly blocking editing an existing Craigslist ad! Why involve Google Play Store At All? One more thing to go wrong - and it did. Why? Have tried everything: updating (pointless and useless Google Play Store Craigslist App) already latest version of course. Error message repeatedly blocking editing- I want to lower the price! Stop Google STOP!!,1
4815,"Craigslist, a great place to go online for great deals. place an ad to sell something and check the ads to buy that something you've been looking for.",5

4968,website can be updated more lots of adds,4
4969,Would be infinitely better if you would enforce your policy on respect posts. There are abusers on the site here posting thousands of posts,3

4983,Husband Marvin giles,5
4984,You can always find what you're looking for online with Craigslist,5
4985,Craigslist is great at getting results. Use good common sense to filter out scammers. Where Craigslist fails is its inability to be contacted and to correct mistakes.,4
4986,Very convenient app I have been able to make a few successful sells. Easy to use. the only con I would say is that there's lots of scammers and creepies so be careful!,5

4993,Good,5
4994,"would absolutely sell through this app again,very easy and ,fast",5

5004,So thankfull I have Craigslist to post items. Years of blackmail from the Local Newspaper are all gone now thanks to Craigslist. You changed the world..,5
5005,Terrible. They remove every ad I place in less than 72hrs. With no explanation given. Yet other ads stay up with similar content. They were better off staying just a dot com. Wish I could give 0 stars,1
5006,"May feel sketchy, but it works",5

5027,People won't reply promtly or don't show. When the reply they say I'm working or ad been filled. This is criminal heaven for fraud and getting people to waste their time. Avoid for a safer life,1
5028,sometimes the app is clunky but it gets the job done,4

5041,ok,5
5042,CL has always been a great place to get rid of stuff,5
5043,I had not sold anything on the internet for quite a long time. Between Covid and the government cramming 5g down my throat l 'd been severely annoyed. I had accumulated quite a lot of items and had been wondering what I should cast my lot with. I had been pleased with Craigslist as a simple easy to use venue that kept itself straightforward with minimum HOOPLA. I find the app to be very well thought out and easy to use.,5
5044,awesome search engine for things we need or want to get rid of,5
5045,What you'd expect,1
5046,pretty good app,4

5053,Using Craigslist for years. Still a great way to sell.,5
5054,"does what it's supposed to do: search, check notifications create modify and remove posts. great app!",5
5055,Sometimes hard to find things,4

5067,I can always find at least a good laugh here anyway...üòÇ,5
5068,"Everything I've posted on here has sold very quickly and always sells for a reasonably close price to my asking price... if I post something it always sells...I could post the same item on Facebook and it would take take forever to sell!! in my opinion, this app is above most others for selling ur stuff and highly recommend u try it out",5
5069,took two months but I finally sold my honda scooter for asking price. lots of messages from morons though,5
5070,enjoy selections to choose from,5
5071,Craigslist is good spot just be careful,5
5072,Used to be a great app for buying and selling. Now it's completely useless.,1

5077,easy to use. üëç like it alot,5
5078,great place,5
5079,simple. to the point. nothing to complain about.,5
5080,l pretty much just give stuff away and Craigslist brings immediate results; Freecycle doesn't.,5
5081,"I previously used the Craigslist website to list items for sale. Recently, I installed the Craigslist app. The app installation went smoothly, and the program is user-friendly. Once again, I have success. Thank you, Craigslist.",4
5082,The fact that you don't let posters ad websites addresses for their service business like painting or other services doesn't make any sense. I see ads with all kinds of links. I just don't understand how they are doing it. I guess I'll have to figure out how they are getting around your rules.,3
5083,"Love this app, I'm on it several times each week.",5

5089,the best hands down,5
5090,"I like posting items on the Craigslist classifieds. It is easy to post items, and easy to use. I've had fairly good luck with advertising on Craigslist. The biggest effect is the economy. Most people are kind and considerate. I have purchased numerous items myself. Happy shopping !!",5
5091,Trying to rehome my pup in their rehoming pets section. Either a competitor or someone who can't afford the rehoming fee keeps flagging every single post I make. They have to have flagged about 100 reposts in the past 2 days. It's waaay to easy for someone to get your ad removed on Craigslist. Each time they remove the flagged post I repost and its flagged for removal again. I've gotten so many they don't even email me about the flag for removal anymore they just remove the posts.,1
5092,far better for searching specific item then Facebook marketplace. but people on Facebook marketplace are too stupid to realize this and I think it's a price problem so they lower their price. buy off of Facebook sell on Craigslist best thing ever,5
5093,Very quick and easy,5
5094,We have sold a lot of bigger items that I didn't want to do a garage sale for. CL is a good sales site.,5

5111,"I have been using Craigslist now for way over 10 years but I'm not real sure when the date was, but one of my carpenter buddies first showed me a meet and date part of your app , and he kept on showing me these men who wanted to meet other men , "" For a Hook-Up at some motel "", and I'm straight and thought he was , but he just kept on showing me men. Well for quite some time I thought that with the name Craigslist, it must have been one of websites where people meet other people to Hook-Up.",5
5112,nice way to sell,5

5120,Keeps reseting itself. So all your favorites or marked ones go away. Difficult to contact sellers and overall just keeps getting worse the more I use the app.,1
5121,it just works - not complicated- find what you need at best prices.,5
5122,Often better than fleabay.,5
5123,five stars one universe and a black hole,5
5124,Worked great.,5
5125,The first person I met through Craigslist because she was a bartender and she worked Monday through Friday 12 hours a night and she was like the type that doesn't care about her feet and shoes lol. Also she loved it when I stared at her every time she pulled up her feet to get air phew I was just positive her feet wee extra sweating and stanky. When I picked her up from her job. I begged for her to hold her nasty flat over my nose the entire way so people can laugh at me lol. There is nothing,5

5163,Triang to figure out some logical expertease,1
5164,intuitive and easy to filter the things you want.,5
5165,"Craigslist has the most garage sale locations, but the GUI is poor. The problem is poor integration of gps. I can't see my location when I am looking at the map. Garage sale locations I have visited look like locations I haven't visited. when the app passes lat & log data instead of the address it can, at times, be wildly off. These three issues make using the app to efficiently track my progress and determine the shortest route between sale locations difficult.",2
5166,Hard to use,4
5167,Helpful for the community,5
5168,It's our first time using this app. I like Craigslist because it's a unique site that matches me perfectly unlike others. It was no surprise that the app also matched us very well! It safely starts up right away as the app organization feels great in ways most normal apps don't. It's actually quite a fluid experience that I did not expect from my first time connecting to Craigslist like this. I really wish I wasn't distracted working so much and could focus on personal use on this stellar app <3,5

5426,Gotta love craigslist!!!,5
5427,pain in the but to search outside your area. updates are huge but probably not as unnecessary as offerups updates which is generally for more advertising,4
5428,"I fully understand the reason behind ""Terms of Use"" and the need to flag and remove questionable content. But when a person is trying to locate someone, mentioning events that took place that are not only true, but polite also, containing nothing crude, suggestive, volger or otherwise out of line, where and what is the ""questionable content""?

5484,excellent platform,5
5485,fast sell,5
5486,Great product. Easy to use.,5
5487,the opportunity craigslist offers for free is so generous even with some abusing it's generosity didn't tarnish my scoring. I don't give 5 stars very easily. Takes a lot to make me consider it but even greater of opportunities must be possible to recieve 5stars from me,5
5488,Horrible.it used to be a great app. Now I can't respond or post or create aj in A,1

6061,"Quirky, frustrating to navigate, and when you go to swipe left to see a picture of what you want to look at, the app instead takes you to the next listing instead many times. It needs a dead space that's larger for scrolling while in an ad, and leave only the farthest edges for moving to next listing. Also zooming in and out is clunky, jumps you into other pictures too easily when you just want to look at the details of a single photo instead. It's just plain sloppy UI, needs some work.",3

6609,Nice,5
6610,"Like the app, as easy as the website itself but when I go do a search it doesn't let select multiple categories like the website does. I've also noticed that some posts don't show up on the app but they do on the website. I decide to uninstall because when I search on the website, it moves me to the app without asking.",2

6627,"Occasionally loads, usually doesn't. Shows items that have been removed from the website, alerts on replies are hit or miss. Randomly restarts. I've done all the normal ""fixes"", and nothing changes. Another app that was designed to gather downloads, with no concern for whether it actually functions. Uninstalled, might reinstall if they push another update out to see if it's changed.",1
6628,sold in 24 hours,5
6629,it is terable do not use this app unless u want to be called a scammer,1
6630,Great,5

6647,"Does not show all contact info! I use craigslist all the time, and generally appreciate the streamlined interface of the Android app, but after a frustrating email exchange with a seller that insisted on only discussing details via phone, and many careful re-reads on different devices, I finally discovered that the ""reply"" button on the app does not provide all of the contact information that is available through the standard web interface. I'll have to delete until this issue is fixed.",1
6648,Don't know yet just got it.,1
6649,It's a classic. Functional and easy to navigate.,5
6650,Craigslist is a great place to re home pets except for all the flagging that goes on. If there was a way to only have craigslist people flag and give a real reason it would be so much better.,4
6651,the original marketplace platform its to bad that the site charges you if you wanna post something but have many leads to whatever that is that you looking for and for the best prices,5
6652,Android products... App works very well! I've been using it for years and bought many things and posted a couple. Easy to use with few bugs. Can't believe others even try to compete with Craigslist. Just pollutes the market.,5

6687,move everything fast,5
6688,I used to be able to select multiple pictures at one time when listing items on my phone but I can't do that anymore. I have to go in and out for every single item and that wastes so much time for someone like me who has lots of pictures on my phone.,3

6727,Why is my app not working well it is ask for update and I have done that yesterday,1
6728,"Pretty good app interface. Never have issues with posting an item unlike other selling apps. And they added a chat system! Only BIG issue is I get signed out every week, or sometimes a couple days after my last sign in. Not sure why a selling app needs so much security.",4

""We are all Britons and I am your king"" But in all seriousness Jesus is in Prison he crossed borders illegally and tryed to overturn a apac fund raising table.",5
6748,love it a plan comes together,5
6749,"easy n straight forward, but...every/any'thing that u post r put up fr sale u r guaranteed 2 get a very quick response 2 it that is very obviously trying to screw u into giving up your own info, like on top of doing a very basic, copy/paste. then follow it with incorrect grammar + asking, if 'IT's is still available? , u fall 4 it just long enuff 2 reply, 'yea, got 'em, any preference?...then obvious by 2nd text they try 2 get evry1 2 give up info, then doing not good with it.

6758,Craigslist is a far more reliable and has far less scammers then online marketplaces like Facebook.,5
6759,These apps are horrific.They jump all around on things you don't even want to see or can afford.Thumbs down to the entire app today.There software issues with them and Autotrader are bad.,1
6760,I believe that the new policy for selling vehicles on Craigslist for $5.00 should be for 60 days and not 30,4

6763,"I like using the app on my phone because it in convenient but it could use some efficiency improvements. I rated it three because it is just average, it works, I get random errors which go away. I just think it needs some improvements. To CL: for a flat fee I will give you requirements as a software professional.",3
6764,we t quickly,5
6765,"Just your typical CL but in a app. Wrought with over posters, scammers, deviates that CL refuses to enforce and ban. They ask your opinion but do absolutely nothing to stop honest ppls ads from being flagged yet the scammers continue to rob ppl blind on fake post after post about tickets, pets, etc. Sexual pervs run free will trying to hook up or sell their used, nasty undies and socks. Overposters just keep overposting page after page of the same junk for months on end. SAME AS ONLINE Ver.",1
6766,helped me sell a car and table saw to some of the nicest people. just use common sense when meeting or interacting with people. While this is still true.

A good example is I did a search for mini excavators and most of what I got was lawn mowers, tractors and pages and pages of metal fabrication advertisements. The whole experience left me irritated and angry at my wasted time. I will be going elsewhere for my research in the future.",1
6857,better then Facebook marketplace by 100x,5

6868,"App freezes up on my Samsung Galaxy A53 since the last update. Can't manage posts without getting an ""app is unresponsive"" popup. Too bad, it was 5 stars prior to this.",1
6869,At this point you would think they would have the option to review people you and buy and sell with but no. This results in the outmost ridiculous low-ball offers that you feel forced to take because no one is offering more. Countless times now I've had customers flake on me because there is no obligation and it's too easy to just ghost someone. No experience other than this in the last 5 years. Offer Up is a much better alternative with a trust system and option to review buyers/sellers,1
6870,Not a lot of request on here but overall nice app,5
6871,CL is non essential! It's simply a for sale site.,1
6872,great app I usually find everything I'm looking for,5
6873,Pros:. easy to use for listing and tracking general sales. Cons. limits searches to local areas...harder to navigate listings than using a web browser. it works well for my needs,5
6874,"This is Not Craigslist, nothing is local, I type in the location and it shows items from all over the world üåéüåç not just in this stupid search area.

6875,"I previously wrote a review that went unanswered so let's see if the developers respond. The problem is, when replying to an add and selecting yahoo mail, it won't work. Gmail will work.

6879,Awsome!,5
6880,Damn thing worked for me! Wish ads again. Great way to get laid! hint hint Craigslist;),5
6881,This used to be a decent app but for about a month or so.now I have to delete and then re-download the whole app to get it to work again. I wish someone would fix it because I am sick of having to do this every other day when I try to open it again.,1
6882,"post worked well , sold very fast,,,",5
6883,Cool.,5
6884,some postings are not legit,4
6885,good,5
6886,it does what I expected and functions pretty well so it's a good app,5
6887,best app ever üëç,5
6888,"Decent for selling big dollar items locally. Terrible spam, at least 5 fake buyers for every listing and you get more up to a week after posting. Occasionally it's also laggy too. You shouldn't have to pay to post anything unless you actually make money from it.",2

6928,The app itself is fine but they allow people to charge outrageous prices.. craigslist used to be the place to get good deals now everything on it is wayyy higher than Kbb prices. It's not even worth using. My suggestion is to limit what people can charge for the item they are selling because as is it's unrealistic. Nobody is going to pay 7k for a pos vehicle with 200k+ miles worth maybe 1200 total.,1

7190,"Might be nice, but I've never been on it yet!!!",3
7191,Tons of things! Things u will buy,5
7192,excellent,5
7193,Old school but works,5
7194,Very helpful and love the difference and very nice things to buy not so high but nice price for things you want.,5
7195,"Craigslist is a tried and true method for selling things. I have used it for many years with great success and sold items here that didn't sell through other methods such as Facebook, etc. I think Craigslist has a cult following that may only use Craigslist exclusively when looking for items to buy. I have found many items for sale on Craigslist that were not cross posted or advertised elsewhere, so it's a good habit to always check postings here before giving up your search.",5
7196,my posts keep getting flagged for no reason. retards!,2
7197,I want to sale a coca cola stand and cocacola tablet,5
7198,Craigslist is the best!,5

7201,Craigslist is the safest place to buy and sell from. You don't have to deal with scammers getting your personal info when you go through Craigslist's email server.,5
7202,Always good,5
7203,I have used craigslist for over a decade now and I love it,5
7204,nice app. easy to setup and manage posts.,5
7205,Great,5
7206,The update really helped! Now the app works 10% of the time instead of 5% of the time! Excellent work development team!,1
7207,Easy to create a post. My only problem was selecting the right category. There were limited choices. I needed farm but there was only the pet option.,4
7208,sold 12hr thank you craigslist......,5
7209,extremely satisfied,5
7210,Great way to sell and buy things! Have had fantastic luck over the years with Craigslist!,5
7211,I love the details. Wasn't expecting that. First time user. And the person bought my item within a few days. Was shocked. Actually going home now from sale typing this. Would definitely use this app again.,5
7212,"very easy to use. post what you need and you will receive. I live the new chat setting, it is very convenient.",5
7213,I have enjoyed this app for a long time. The only change I would really like to see is to have the ability to block or mute a poster that might continually have several daily posts of items that are of no interest to me. Other than that it is a very good app!,5
7214,intuitive and effective,5
7215,sold my car 1st week,5
7216,Great way to Shop,5
7217,cool app,5
7218,"Craigslist is still my go to for getting furniture, getting rid of boxes, and a ton of other stuff.",5
7219,great results!,5
7220,sold a vehicle on CL easily and fast. Thank goodness for the fees to sell now. hopefully that will get rid of most of scammers and spammers.,5
7221,this is a super site for selling stuff,5
7222,sold in less than a week,5
7223,it is great,5
7224,"love craigslist,",5
7225,This app is so SLOW. I'm trying to post something for someone and while pressing the required buttons on the app and filling out the fields the app takes FOREVER to register the input,1
7226,Very üëç,4
7227,Like it üòä,5
7228,Half the time won't work unless it's opened in playstore. Even right after update.,2
7229,yes I love it,5
7230,"Great app/portal para job search, rent search, roommates, relationship and much more. Congratulations to the development, production, maintenance team...",5
7231,I regularly use this app to make connections successfully,5

7233,"Totally satisfied, I found my companion",5
7234,Good resource,5
7235,Duh everybody likes how fast you can sell things on here with little to no effort,5
7236,always sucessful using craigslist,5
7237,love Craig's list,5
7238,"Why does it keep telling me to put in my email address when it should already be there. This is my second time having to do this, makes me think it's a hack to the app. Would like some answers on what's going on",3
7239,A little clunky but a good overall app. The $5 charge for post a vehicle is odd. Every other platform allows it for free. I don't get it.,4
7240,"Vehicle sold on 6th day. The first two inquiries were suspicious because they wanted me to provide name , street address and phone number so they could send check for me to deposit before they had seen the vehicle. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a duck. The other four inquiries were legit.",5
7241,Works everyone and no fees!!,5
7242,"Works pretty well. I've purchased a few things, sold a car or two and browsed free items. Absolutely the best online sales app.",5
7243,"finally they put out an app. it is convenient, and they keep on improving it to make it more user-friendly",5
7244,So far good,5
7245,"simple, just like craigslist ought to be.",5
7246,"good app. not sure why it does not stay on the same page when closed/opened. would be 5 stars, except for this problem. web browser does not do this.",4
7247,is good,5
7248,"I love this app.... OFFERUP Doesn't HAVE anything on craigslist,",5
7249,Usually pretty good need to put location of what is for sale tired of going through multiple listings with no location now you hit email to respond and just flips back to regular ad Have tried help items to no avail.dont think anything I know of has changed on phone Don't really understand all the lingo on help cure this problem listing???????????,4
7250,Craigslist has been great haven't had any problems buying and selling things and am thankful for this app,5
7251,"Usually gets the job done. Yes it is free, but every now and then an obvious shortcoming becomes apparent, and this is frustrating. To name a couple: - Sellers often spam the listing pages with their same ad ad nauseam, forcing us to waste our time sifting through and beyond them - Same sellers put infinite keywords in their listing, and they're not even selling that thing in the listing, but they make us have to see their shite listing in the search pages Better than offerup imo, still.",4
7252,sold quick,5
7253,Don't like it,1
7254,easy to search for and sell items,5
7255,since when do you have to pay $5,4
7256,sell anything. need more ppl to start posting on here then market place!!!!,5
7257,Great tool for helping lost/found pets. I'm proud to say that mine had a happy ending. Thank you Craigslist.,5
7258,"Very simple to use, and does what it's supposed to. Depending on your area it can take a bit to sell items. Also has a bit of spam and insincere buyers so I think there should be a way to rate accounts.",4
7259,this app. is the best!!!,5
7260,"app easy to use, like the interface",5
7261,"I have to admit! I was skeptical about the Craigslist app; if it was easier to use... I am absolutely 100% Satisfied! I received lots of texts & emails, just as I'd planned. Now I'm going to use this app to find things that I need. ‚ò∫",5
7262,great app I like it it works and helps me when ever I need it and thanks to the owner of it for creating it it's a great one and it does help when help is needed,5

7272,it's craigslist. on an app. it works.,5
7273,resets every 3 days and have to resave all of the posts I'm watching. really unhandy to watch current price trends on items if that is something you are into...,1
7274,Uses some Google play settings to Mahe a connection now so doesn't work,1
7275,awesome response to my listing,5
7276,A refreshing change to other sales apps. oldie but goodie.,5
7277,Great Easy,5
7278,"works just like the site. for an app, that's really saying something. no bugs, always does what it's supposed to do.",5
7279,"I prefer using the website in a web browser. My biggest complaint is this: When someone emails me about something I've listed, I always click on the link to my posting to make sure I know which item they're interested in (I sell a lot of similar items.) Now when I click the link it launches to the apps navigation menu, not my listing. The only way around this is to relaunch the app it or long press on the link and specifically choose to open in rhe browser.",2
7280,"Love it but has issue. Crashes when I'm posting and get to the 2nd or third line of text. Slows right down, like 1 letter every 10 seconds of typing then ultimately crashes.",1
7281,made reuniting possible between a Girl and Her Dog Thanks Craigslist! I Posted that I Found a Dog on Many Sites if it wasn't for Craigslist it May not have happened!!!,5
7282,"thanks , love Craigslist",5
7283,great if you are a very patient person; way Too many repetitive ads from dealers for the same item ???,4
7284,this app is very user friendly and I was able to sell my car quickly.,5
7285,Craigslist isn't what it used to be. Bad in a good way!!. Find some pretty interesting things,5
7286,"smooth, quick transaction. All via email.",5
7287,"An ok app for the most part. It's pretty basic and could use an update on design and layout, but it works for what it is, or usually does. I just updated some apps on my phone, not sure if this was one of them; I haven't used it for over a month, I'm trying to create a post, and it freezes a few lines in, every time, forcing me to close the app and lose my progress. Also, not as many users as there once was. CL needs to make some changes if they want to compete with FB Marketplace.",3
7288,post and transaction was easy,5
7289,able to get what I m looking for,5
7290,Best classifieds app ever,5

7313,I put my post up and within a half hour I got a response and got rid of my roosters,5
7314,app works great on my tablet,5
7315,"Why do we ""report"" posts when all that does is immediately delete them? When you report something, that's giving the impression (Nowhere does it say different) that the post will be looked into to see if it breaks any rules. This is not done. So, instead of having the word ""report"", just change it to ""delete post"". If you report a crime to the cops, they don't immediately just arrest the person.",1
7316,craigslist is better than eBay because they don't make you pay any fees. thank you for another positive sale craigslist,5
7317,is real,5
7318,I love craigslist. The app and browser site are significantly different in what they choose to post especially in timing of recent postings,3

7324,WAY TOO MANY SCAMMERS,4
7325,Worked like a charm.,5
7326,It doesn't save settings so you can never log in and see what you're looking at before. Sucks A**. Time consuming POS.,1

7341,Great app rehomed my dog in one day.,5
7342,It doesn't work anymore. It won't connect to the internet for some reason. Use to work without a problem.,1

7344,I love Craigslist you cannot beat the price the app is so easy to use I am one hundred percent satisfied with their app the system they use is up-to-date and awesome and easy to use they're just a bunch of good old people there.,5
7345,it sold !!,5
7346,Not as smooth and friendly for users as it used to be. P probably due to covid cuts of staff or developers or something. Like Wikipedia they probably need to have a donation page that we have to get through before we can access.,4
7347,I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for all the scamers the bombarded me when I first posted,4
7348,the best...thank you so much.. I will recommend this web.,5

7383,always good for selling stuff,5
7384,"easy to use, we were very pleased with the sales obtained from Craigslist.",5
7385,"its so hard to contact seller via email, sometime its impossible.",5
7386,sold in hours great place to buy and sell,5
7387,"Very helpful tool, but you have to be careful because MANY of the ads, and replies to your ads, are scammers. And now for some reason, I can't just reply via email to an ad anymore. I have to copy paste their email, leave the craigslist app and go into my email app if I want to contact anyone",3
7388,too many robo caller's trying to scam your information,3

7394,Badass app,5

7455,Easy to create ads and easy to shop for items,5
7456,I gave you a four out of five I believe the app could be easier to use I like more pictures to guide me through what I'm doing it was a little unclear to me when I was posting which section to post it on the layout I guess is what I'm saying could have been better,4
7457,Keeps crashing. How can I post an ad I can't complete. What a waste of time!,1

7474,Love it,5
7475,it was good but I think the ui is a bit outdated,5
7476,"You'll deal with a few crazies, but not more so than anywhere else. You can't beat the price for the exposure you get, and I've had relatively good success with several listings. IMHO it's worth starting on Craigslist first for selling items, just don't fall for the scam artist's ploys that you may receive right after posting. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Be mindful of what personal info you divulge to buyers, and public meet-ups are the safest, provided it's not in a shady place.",4
7477,"I think you have more work to do on your latest update in January of 23. The app will not let me search, it comes back with a 'please make sure you are signed in to Google Play and check your Play services and Play Store are up to date'. Updated, checked and checked. Restarted my phone. Tried to log into Craigslist and failed, multiple times. Its normally a great app, and makes it easy to find items of interest!",3

7501,I've posted twice and successful twice,5
7502,"Great service for locals, but all the ads distract me from purchasing!!!",5
7503,I have always had good luck with Craigslist. With all the other apps and stuff out there I always search here first. Never had a bad encounter and it just seems that sometimes it makes the most sense to just keep it simple.,5
7504,"Very professional, there were some glitches on my part but all in all a very smooth transition. A very skilled, trained and helpful staff that was eager to attack any problem that arrived during the set up process. Many thanks to the team and I will be spreading the word and using CL again thanks!",5
7505,Like it a lot Thanks .,5
7506,Need better scammer and commercial monitoring,5

7528,"Great way to sell and buy. I've done both for years. Easy app to use in all aspects. Must be careful with transactions due to dangerous app users, but not CL fault. Just a reality these days. Sellers beware of scammers. Many more of them out there than actual buyers. Some oversight and blacklisting from CL would be helpful on the crooks.",4
7529,Nice,5
7530,"I shop for Bmx bikes and subwoofers. I can't search for ""Bmx"" or ""subs"" or ""amp"" on the app anymore. Everyone who sells those things uses those terms in their adds. Seems silly. It's basically ruined CL for me. Let me know if you remedy this. Cheers.",2
7531,usually easier to use than the website because it can get all the posts that are nearby me because I'm between two of the big cities you can select,5
7532,Great app. Get that fifth star if app stops requiring intermittent signing in again.,4
7533,So glad this app still works on Android. The new version for iPhone is a useless pieceof garbage with lots of fancy new features but ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO ACCESS OR MANAGE YOUR POSTINGS!,5

7831,Most frustrating app. As soon as I put up a post it's immediately deleted. No customer service. No explanation why they won't let me post anything.,1
7832,I sold an object using this computer program,5
7833,Always have had no problems with Craigslist... and I'm talking about years of use. Great job and keep it up Craigslist. maybe it's because most people are good & honest too helps.,5
7834,wonderful,5
7835,App not working for the last week or so,2
7836,Scammed in a trailer park!!!,1
7837,I use this site/AP for anything from buying new/used cars; to selling my metal and wood art. it's even great for finding free furniture you may need when your in a pinch and broke as $H!T as many of us are after the pandemic!!!,5
7838,"easy to use, and lots of functionality.",5
7839,"used Craigslist for many years, thumbs up.",5
7840,Lags and freezes,1
7841,Your new update is broken every time I go to use this app it's saying I need to update Google Play on Google Play Store. But that's already up-to-date and this only started happening when I updated Craigslist app today. please fix it.,1
7842,Very nice üôÇüëçüèº,5
7843,"Literally everything gets flagged, and half the people I message or message me are just scams. I can sell stuff decently quick but its aggravating to have to keep posting because people keep flagging for no reason.",1
7844,can't beat the old CL.....,5
7845,great results !,4
7846,"old school, but effective w old schoolers",5
7847,app does the job!,5

7849,"great app! Craigslist gets a bad rap, it's really better than any selling site!",5
7850,was a great app until they started charging to post.. won't post if I'm charged.,4
7851,Craigslist works!,5
7852,Craigslist still delivering for me all these years. Love Craigslist.,5
7853,"This app isn't too bad. Would have given 5 stars except it likes to freeze a lot. Especially while trying to create an ad. I have to type my post else where, copy it, then paste it to my ad.",4
7854,Junk. Email links for alerts do not open in the app. It just shows some useless help/Google Play error. Don't waste your time.,1
7855,"Worked great for many years. Now it says not signed in and doesnt work (cant serach, cant post listings, etc). Please fix.",2
7856,Great app for buying and selling. Very easy to use and best of all it is FREE!,5
7857,fast and easy!,5
7858,Works as the oc version,5
7859,easy to use!!!!,5
7860,"It appears that I installed the rare bad version? Quite simply, the app just doesn't work at all. Photos don't match item being sold. Refuses to display any results for searches. Pretty much doesn't do anything it's supposed to!",1
7861,best advertising for rehoming pets,5
7862,"BASICALLY HAD WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, AND MORE! ü§®",5
7863,I don't like the fact that when I installed the app and I want to use the classic web version of Craigslist everytime I search for anything it takes me to the app version! instead,3
7864,Excellent,5
7865,Drops out frequently. I need to Uninstall and reinstall.,3
7866,watch out for spammers!,3
7867,I really like craigslist It is easy to use,5
7868,"The flagging and removing posts is ridiculous. They just get removed for NO reason when plenty of other people have the same posts and/or are able to spam the site with BS scams, but we struggle to keep an honest, legit, and NOT AGAINST ANY RULES post from being removed within 3 to 5 minutes of posting it. No customer support whatsoever. Craigslist SUCKS! We need a much MUCH better alternative!!!",1
7869,Stopped working recently - something about not connecting to Google play service... why does this even need to be connected to Google pay service to provide listing? App is no better than their mobile web page and the app frequently lost my login before all this.,1
7870,awesome,5
7871,I have better results on craigslist Than on marketplace,5
7872,Terrible. Will not verify me. Does not take my password or the link sent does not confirm. Cannot get on at all. Tried to uninstall and reinstall and still won't work. Terrible app.,1
7873,useful app. does what you would expect it to.,5
7874,Great way to clean out your excess items and meet some great people.,5
7875,really like the ability to search a wider area in multiple markets,5
7876,It is stressful to use . you post an add and someone who doesnt like your add they flag it . basically it's unusable.,5
7877,great,5
7878,Jake it's me mom I love u miss ur smart mind,5
7879,Keeps freezing up when posting add needs update,1
7880,"Sort function misaligns item with photo from other ads. Basically, useless.",1
7881,Nice ! You can find whatever here,2
7882,The app is great but cl needs to allow personals for dating again!! Thank you!,5
7883,"I'd give you a 5 if there weren't so many scammers on here. Even though most of your users can figure it out I can't believe there are 6 or 7 items that all have the price of 1000 dollars. The worst categories are RVs, trailers, cars. still a great service and I use it a lot with good results. Not sure how you can handle all these scammers.",4
7884,"I've been on a number of selling sites but none compares to Craigslist, I posted last monday and already made enough to pay my auto insurance, plus Craigslist is free! other site I was on for 4 months and not one sale,, it was so unnecessarily complicated, monthly fee, creating a store, blogging, paying for a domain... I just wanted simple online selling, no BS or fees, used to take me a couple hours to create a listing now, 10 minutes if that. thanks Craigslist u rock!!!",5
7885,"So easy to use, even this old man can do it. thank you Craigslist",5
7886,works great!!,5
7887,Go,5
7888,finally CL app! I like it. works great üëç,5
7889,After many years CL IS STILL one of the simplest ways to list and sell items!,5
7890,"Craigslist hands down is far and above The very Best App to Sell your Cars, Trucks, Trailers, or a ton of other possibilities to Local people. It seems like every person that contacts me on Craigslist is a serious interested buyer. Where Craigslist Competitors I won't dare mention there name, because CRAIGSLIST DESERVS ALL THE NANE RECOGNITION AND CREDIT, BECAUSE THERE THE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY BEST!!!!",5
7891,Functions well and let's me get rid of stuff I don't need.,5
7892,seems i can always find someone who wants my stuff.,5
7893,No good No good,1
7894,Mobile app won't work without Google/CIA spying. App won't work without Google tracking you. Totally ruined. Delete app for privacy. Use desktop with VPN.,2
7895,easy to use. reaches many people.,4
7896,Horrible. Fails everytime,1
7897,"I rented the rooms I had quickly. Excellent communication with those interested who were very polite, respectful, and courteous.",5
7898,"excited to see app for CL but it does not work. despite granting permissions all i get is a failure to retrieve results. tried everything to fix still wont work. i have etteruck and more accurate results on fb marketplace, nextdoor and other apps. CL is FULL of BS scammers and ads now its almost impossible to find a legit seller. there seems to be zero scammer mitigation. if you report one you have to report 10 more from same seller im not using CL anymore, pointless",1
7899,seems to reach a lot of people...,5
7900,"Amazing app thank you Craigslist üòä I've found alot of great legit stuff on this site, even free stuff. Posting, selling, and giving way stuff is free.. It's a free app to use, free and clean to post",5

7914,amazing üòç,5
7915,"Awesome app to be able to make posts for selling unwanted and unnecessary items, as well as being able to browse other posts and purchase the second hand goods locally! I've made over a thousand dollars in the month utilizing this app, and I love it!! üòÅ",5
7916,Craig list is Awesome .Just like my brother David Craig,5
7917,Somehow the format has changed to double columns and now it's awful to scroll through.,1
7918,Great app. Always gives me notifications on my saved searches.,5
7919,like the other setup better!,3
7920,I'm giving three stars because I have somebody maliciously reporting my ads even though they are completely legit and follow the rules so I'm being harassed but when I report this to Craigslist nobody ever answers me,3
7921,Dis exactly what it's supposed to do. Get the info out.,5
7922,"Ah, easy to use. I love it. I've been using Craigslist since high school.",5

7925,"It's craigslist, the best the Internet ever gave us.",5
7926,"ad brought in the renter, thank you!",5
7927,I really don't know about this app. I was looking to buy some car parts for a friend on this app quickly. I found out it's more of a sex app than anything else,1
7928,"I was hesitant to even try the craigslist app...I was wrong to ever doubt it, it's really quite user friendly and displays great on my Google pixel 6a.",5
7929,Horrible app. Filled with bugs. Freezes all the time. Horrible developer. Please fix,1
7930,Will not work with new app updates. I have used the Craigslist app for years with no problem.,2
7931,"when using app, it has a hard time pulling up correct add. you click on a post and it might be the one above or below the one you want to look at.",3

7938,I posted an item and it sold. What more can you ask for.,5
7939,needs a faster way to communicate with buyers email can be to slow,4
7940,Listed a few times and have been fortunate to sell to a good buyer.,5
7941,so far I like app,5
7942,great,5
7943,"The application is horrible! Who made this 1? What the H*LL were they thinking??? Stick to the:""Craigslist"" Website!",2
7944,Craigslist is well known for good service and an easy to use posting system.,5
7945,love it just be careful of scammers,5
7946,"Worked great until a couple days ago, now all searches just say ""error retrieving search results, please ensure you are signed into google play store...""; I am signed into the play store and have verified that the play store and play services are up to date, have cleared all data and cache for both the play store and play services, and have reinstalled the craigslist app and the issue still persists.",1
7947,"Barely works 75% of the time. If you dare manipulate any of the filters, it only leads to unusable chaos.",2
7948,"App wouldn't display a category. Kept saying that my Google Play Store and Google Play services needed to be updated. When I checked, I confirmed that I had the most up to date versions of both apps on my phone already. First time any app from the Play Store has given me that error.",1
7949,it's Great!,5
7950,ok,3
7951,"I can't login to my own account. Can't get help from anyone to see what's wrong, and can't search for anything.",1
7952,much better than market place,5
7953,me gusta,5
7954,"Digitally enhanced, bodies edited, skin perfected, very few if any actually look that way in real life. Pics AND videoed are edited & girls are made up and Airbrushed, cosmetics done by A.I. images, digitally enhanced, body parts reformed, etc. Men are drooling over fake images and cartoons. Perverts. Men have NO RIGHT TO OBJECTIFY WOMEN especially looking the way 98% of them do. Bald, fat, w erectile dysfunction, it's always the unattractive, porn addicted, out of shape, compulsive masturbators",1
7955,always classic always successful!!,5
7956,love it,5

7959,Great source of items,4
7960,Lousy,1
7961,"Still need some work, regularly freezes, post don't match thumbnails",3
7962,Pretty good for listing things and browsing to shop. The chat function doesn't seem to be very popular.,4
7963,Infested with scammers,1
7964,a was selling through the Craigslist app s follow their advice and the sales can be fast and safe...,5
7965,Won't let me sing in,1
7966,splendid,5
7967,"Great ,easy to use.",3
7968,They blocked my account and didn't say why....I sell washers and dryers for a living so I need my account to work....screw these guys,1
7969,lot of being Flag or not posting.,1
7970,still the tried and true way to offload nearly worthless stuff that still has some life left for someone else.,5
7971,It's better than using the mobile site. The one issue I had has been fixed. Overall its a really well developed app.,5
7972,Keeps lagging and not responsive. Anytime I try to post anything keeps freezing. Please fix or help solve this issue,1
7973,I love all free or new and used add for me it's higher than ten app,5

7980,sell your sheet!,5
7981,very simple and easy to use! love this app.,5
7982,Simple and elegant. Gets stuff sold fast.,5
7983,people posting the same thing flag your posts so they have a better chance of selling and you have to repost your stuff over and over and craigslist support won't help or fix the problem.,1
7984,Awesome,5
7985,sold fast,5
7986,Terrible slow clear cache good for awhile and then pictures scrambled. You to look at an ad based on picture of course....but picture doesn't match ad at all and did my previous look. Tired of fighting it just to have to uninstall and reinstall to work. Freezes also.,1
7987,"I think Craiglist is great. Only suggestion I'd make is that a buyers email stays encrypted just like a sellers email, because there are so many scams, it isn't fair someone have any personal info of mine when they aren't even sharing their own email, but trying to sell something. Also, sometimes the app doesn't load up when I search for something different after already viewing a search. I have to refresh it twice sometimes after I have already entered and searched a new subject.",5
7988,still a good way to sell things.,5
7989,"Trash, if it didnt have all that spam",1
7990,very useful app. works well it is reliable,5
7991,Fantastic,5
7992,I've been using Craigslist on my browser for years and only just came across the app. It's nice having all the CL sites I have been checking in one place (by radius) but it isn't doing a very good job searching. Many of the favorites I'd saved on the browser are not being found by the app including my own posts.,2
7993,process went fairly smooth sold my lawn mower in under 30 days,4
7994,App is not supposed to have access to my phone yet it was able to send a text to another account. Can you fix this?,3
7995,great,5
7996,Crashes everytime I try to post,1
7997,I needed to sell some Roosters. the response was fast and easy!,5
7998,The app is useful and well organized - a great complement to the website!,5
7999,Account put on hold for?? What reason? No explanation or resolution. Highly recommend Facebook marketplace and neighborhood app. Remember that poor woman who had her baby cut out of her due to craigslist listing. Three good things for craigslist goodbye good luck good riddance,1
8000,CL is a great ap!,5

8019,Easy to maneuver. Well organized website.,5
8020,so much easier to post then off My computer....,5
8021,"I love Craigslist. I wish criminals did not ruin the original version which was a wonderful community ad space. However, I keep using it because I want to take it back to that wonderful space...and I don't want it to go away. App works great.",5
8022,This app is easy to use,5
8023,easy to use,5
8024,The app is working great. much better than OfferUp. If they got rid of all the dealerships and stores advertising on here to make it easier for private party sales it would be perfect.,3
8025,My momma felly loves my phone because of this game,4
8026,"Great app if your looking to buy, sell, find help with something! Its all around a pretty awsome app!",4
8027,been working great for me. thank you,5

8029,awesome,5
8030,I find it very helpful and informative.,5
8031,works well glad cl has its own app rather than the third party ones although cplus was actually pretty good. i do kind of miss the alert ones where you could set a search parameter and it would notify you if someone posted something,5
8032,sold my stuff in under 48 hours,5
8033,What is this new error...Credibility check fail?,1
8034,love craigslist,5
8035,Total False advertising. I would not suggest anyone use this app unless your want to be misled or hacked.,1

8037,Very useful app,5
8038,üëç,3
8039,Ease of use is going bad for me I noticed,3
8040,excellent,5
8041,Great place to find just about anything!,5
8042,best app for sale your stuff,5
8043,Rofl. I hope it's better than the rest of craigslist. It's got a bunch of scammers selling stolen car parts ...lol,4
8044,I don't know what is wrong with this app but the pictures and descriptions don't match. Otherwise it would be a useful tool....but not as it is atm. Very annoying...the website is better.,2

8056,very useful and easy to understand,4
8057,I like the Craigslist app but it needs to not be as buffery and glitching I hope they work that out and fix this app cuz I like it,4
8058,Can FB Marketplace just die already?,5
8059,craigslist...the best at what it does. One suggestion. I'm the bicycles for sale they should mention the frame size doesn't equal tire size. Frame size is the most important thing to consider when buying a bike.,5
8060,Like it very much,5
8061,Craigslist is awesome,5
8062,I'm not sure why more people don't use this. App is very easy to use.,5

8069,"good app, good service. Craigslist helps me buy/sell goods that really don't need to go to the local dump, eh?",5
8070,This ape has so far been pretty good and. Help me sell or give. Away items with out freezing up. I do better on here than fb market place or. Offer up. But you still have to watch out for scamers. That try to offer you. Other payments than. Cash. Or wants you to ship items. I try to only deal local. Or. Deliver in person. With. Some one with me. About the people who do not follow rules. . And post the same add. In. Mutable. Sites. Let's flag them.,5

8080,since 2012 i been finding gigs economic is hidden jewe everything.,5
8081,"Craigslist is great but the app has too many bugs for me - I would go back to the old Craigslist but it makes you go through way too much ridiculousness to prove you're a real person - all you should have to do is hit one button that says you're real - a robot would not be able to do that so having to pick out all the boats or airplanes or motorcycles - 2 pages of it at that is extremely ridiculous - that's the only reason I got the app but the app sucks (sorry, just being honest) I hate the app",2
8082,idk if many ppl use this app anymore,4

8096,go's back to where you just came from too often,4
8097,"very basic app but with a few useful features that make the app better than using the website. A search will bring up results within a set distance of your home address instead of staying just within your designated metro area. App also connects to your comm apps but has a chat feature to communicate with other parties. Only complaint is that sometimes in gallery view, the pictures and the captions get misaligned.",4

8128,very easy,4
8129,Good morning,4
8130,we got our dog back because of this add,5
8131,Craigslist is run by rape cultured misogynists FOR their fellow sex offender misogynists,1
8132,Craigslist is top shelf. They really set the standard.,5
8133,great AP,5
8134,Hreat üòä App. easy to use. But constantly getting flagged would rate a 5 Star if it wasn't for that. I would pay to advertise if I had that.option ..,3
8135,there are a ton of scammers but selling firewood and some machines ive made friends. never trust anyone saying there busy so gmail there wife. low life scamers sell your email. just be smart.,5

8148,"Wasn't sure this app would work great but it does, I set an alert for rentals and now it's giving me instant alert notifications in my phone as soon as something in my filtered search is new üòÑ",5
8149,With Craigslist I've yeah I used to shoplift a lot and I stopped so Craigslist has been a huge help to that in the free ads as I've gotten a lot of the free things from there and been able to sell them to make money so it's been a huge help to me and my recovery and yeah I would absolutely recommend it to anybody stuff usually sells pretty quick and the immediate audience is massive no matter what city you're in anyways Christopher McFadden absolutely approves Craigslist.,5
8150,so easy to use,5
8151,works 100% of the time for browsing. works 90% for listing. for whatever reason app likes to crash when editing a post.,4
8152,"Utterly useless as a selling platform, never made a sale here over years of trying, nothing but scammers looking to send bad checks or wanting your phone number. I would stay away from CL and never consider it for any reason. Even sellers are scamming, text them and they have your number, no replies back unless they're trying to get more info. Email is anonymous but they instantly need to talk over the phone for no reason.",2

8160,posted my refrigerator and sold it in 2 days,5
8161,Too many scammers on Craigslist. it was a real hassle trying to weed out the legit buyers from the cons. I ended up finding a buyer using another ad site. CL is not the good ol site to sell things on I remember from prior times. Doubt I'll use it again.,1
8162,May need an upgrade to a more modern look and feel but I love the original vibe,4
8163,Any post no matter what it is gets flagged even if it doesn't go against the guidelines It's been getting worse for years,1
8164,I am able to use craigslist to sell my livestock. There are so many places that will not allow this and I'm always successful. Sometimes it takes a bit but I am able to sell my rabbits here.,5
8165,I always find everything I am looking for .,5
8166,great app,3
8167,a bit glitchy. you may have to restart app a few times to do what you need. better to brows or manage posts. not to make or edit.,3
8168,App freezes anytime trying to post,1
8169,love this site just always remember be safe and be smart,5
8170,worked great,5
8171,I recently used Craigslist to sell a piece of some stuff and had a great experience. The platform was easy to use and I was able to quickly create a listing with clear photos and a detailed description. I received several inquiries within a few hours of posting the listing and was able to sell the item within a day. I felt confident that I was dealing with reputable buyer,5
8172,"The app freezes constantly, location for posting is way off, I have to try at least a dozen times before being able to post. What's happened?",1
8173,Craigslist has always been a good site. I hate that anyone can just delete your posts. Craigslist needs to change that even if there is a fee.,4
8174,Trying to sell appliances but I need some kind of code in order to sell my things on Craigslist where do I find or how do I get these codes,1
8175,You have to pay to post on here now. 5 dollars a post. Just go use letgo or Facebook market place. Or literally any other free thing that is like craiglist. There's a ton....,1

8198,Still a great way to buy & sell.,5
8199,I'm always able to sell things when I advertise at the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I state that the price is firm and it's cash only. Craigslist remains a great way to get rid of stuff I no longer need,5

8279,"For people like me who don't want to be on social media to advertise or search for everyday items now and then, CL is a great resource. That being said, there is a lot of room to improve when it comes to the scammers, the prolific dog sellers, and the businesses advertising as owners instead of dealers (if they cheat CL for $5, they'll cheat you too). I have used CL since shortly after the dial-up days of the internet. I fear that one day the legitimate buyers and sellers will be outnumbered.",3

8377,great app use it all the time,5
8378,This app is good if you're looking for used products in your neighborhood there is a lot of different people selling different things it's quite useful but this app could use a little work in being able to save favorites of searches that you've wanted to keep and it doesn't seem to quite have that ability like it does on the website. Other than that it's a very good app to use when you're looking for certain products.,4
8379,What happened to this app? It freezes up about 2 minutes into making an ad and there's no using it after that. Super frustrating!,1

8396,it's a,4
8397,Great app to sell your products,5
8398,"This app keeps crashing before I can even login. Same error report, ""credibility check failed""... wth does that even mean?",1
8399,Craigslist is great the app doesn't work very well,3
8400,it took a while but it finally sold.,3
8401,"like the classified ads, free stuff section, you can find good things",5

8404,Useless Sale Site,1
8405,Very fun,5
8406,Pictures and listing often don't match up,1
8407,"Can search for what I want in the area I want. Craigslist is a great free electronic version of classified ads. Be smart and don't send money before getting service or merchandise, and meet in a public place. Bring a friend if you're buying something expensive with cash.",5
8408,I'm on a pixel 5.5 and when I click to look at photos and the carousel of photos launch I have to close the app to dismiss the carousel. So frustrating makes the app almost unusable,1

8414,"This has to be the only actually free app without anyone trying to sell you something, collecting data, or harassing pop up. A real service to the community. You can rent a vacation home, find a ride, free baby clothes without anyone trying to get their cut. I hope they'll resist being bought off by some Uber or airbnb who value themselves in the millions for doing basically the same thing. Some bug exists when matching pictures and ads in search results but I'm grateful for them.",5

8536,Great,5
8537,"Use it for 2 decades. Constant improvements are awesome. Ads never bother. Short of my wife and kids, I got most of my stuff through CL. Apartment, cars, job, and younameit, CL got my back!",5
8538,the ability to reach soo many different individuals is priceless,5
8539,Not just window shoppers. Definitely better than OfferUp,5
8540,Follow the recommended rules and CL is great.,5
8541,"Craigslist has not adapted to the times. It is FLOODED with fake ads, posting bots, spam and scams. They still rely on user flagging to rid themselves of these parasites, but often ads arent removed when theyre flagged, just hidden from the flagger. Ads are too easily reposted after being constantly flagged/removed with no changes required. Repeat offenders are never banned. Its no wonder the site is basically useless these days. Too bad too, it used to be great.",2
8542,Easy,5
8543,"the app allows you to get rid of that (1 man's junk"" is another's treasure) extra stuff that has taken up room in the garage. Love it!! ü§ôü§ô",5

8652,"Craig's list has been good and especially now that the personal or bad dating hookups has stopped; m4m, f4m etc ..... Thank you Craigslist!",4
8653,the only reason I didn't give five stars is because it's a little difficult to figure out where your existing listings are. there should be a your listings tab. other than that it's a decent and relatively easy to use app,4

8725,I had to post this 4 times due to it getting removed for whatever reason after sharing several times... I would have people tell me my post was removed. It's very time consuming to the point where you are discouraged to repost.,3

8735,Interesting little app. Seems simplistic enough to work well.,5
8736,Great and fast,5
8737,It's ok still haven't found what I wanted yet,5
8738,No flakes,4
8739,maybe people are not putting ads on from Altamonte Springs there are so many ads for Orlando just wish there were more from Altamonte Springs Florida,3

8760,sold took awhile but it sold,5
8761,craigslist is the best!,5
8762,Easy to post an ad...Posted ad was effective in getting the item for sale sold,5
8763,Lots of spam. If they would filter how much spam adds there were it would be a good add.,1
8764,"Effective and plain text, free from annoying colors and pictures, rare to find such apps. Please allow the readers to make some fixed sets of comments (say, overpriced) or questions (say, when), without making the site bulky or clumsy, so that the postings can improve.",5
8765,iiiiiii like it,5
8766,Great mobile UI for Craigslist!,5
8767,This is one of those apps that are crucial to even living in your life. There is an area of Craigslist where they list all of the items that are free that people just want to get rid of. This is what I would consider the old classified ads that we used to read in the newspapers these are people who are renting homes buying homes selling stuff buying stuff animals there's a community where you can meet people or have activities is endless classified ads it's like classified ads on steroids,5
8768,As soon as I posted items for sale I got texts. The ppl asked me for a code I was sent. I didn't give them the code but I also didn't understand why they wanted it.,3
8769,great app,4
8770,good app it does do it's thing !,3
8771,"Compared to using the main website, the app is a complete dis-service to users. It does not give you the date of the posting & it does not give you the location. After scrolling down the page I discovered that I was looking at older postings that were more than 75 miles away but only because I bothered to click on a photo. All of that information is available without going to individual posts when you use the main website. I have uninstalled this app as it is only a waste of space on my device.",1
8772,cuss it's almost there when I need to buy something or find it free,5
8773,8 was hacked but$#boy is still messing with us. We work for the government. Hrlp,1
8774,y'all know,4
8775,It's Craigslist.,3
8776,great,5
8777,"I used to love CL before it became invested with bots, trolls, and scammers. The basic idea of CL is still good but the amount of nonsense from misuse by illegitimate users has become overwhelming to the point where it's not the best place to advertise items or services. It's still not bad for buying things but the volume and variety of items for sale has suffered greatly due to the scammers and other riff raff that are looking for opportunities to try to take advantage of others.",3
8778,too many scammers trying to. send codes,1
8779,Flag system broken.,1
8780,always very satisfied with everything,5
8781,"Wow very great app in Jobs, I really enjoy it .",5
8782,This here is truly the best app. I'm able to purchase specific items w/o leaving my home until i find the item. the only thing is that i wish people would delete post when sold it no longer on the market. Perhaps the app could auto delete a post after a year? Just a thought,5
8783,Okay,5
8784,"I am so thankful for craigslist,The reason why is because I was able to sale the things I sold and for a very good deal and I didn't had no problem or anything like that but people was so happy to get what they wanted,I am proud to put smile üòä on people face, craigslist you are so awesome",5

8789,"Update more for middle Tennessee like pulaski,Lawrenceburg, leoma etc..",4
8790,I love craigslist it helps allot but what I don't like is when anyone can flag your ad for whatever they choose. I think that's lame.,4
8791,Craigslist lot better marketplace easy to find what you want,5
8792,"Scam all the way. Anyone that contacts you, wants you to give them ur cell. So they can, so call, verify you.",1
8793,great place to find a good deal!,5
8794,"Was awesome until it made us start paying to post vehicles for sale. They should have stuck to completely free app... But other than that, I use this app daily. I especially love it for community postings and finding local jobs.",4

8813,"I like the app better than just going online the old-fashioned way; nice job on creating an easy-to-operate or navigate version! Blessings, C J, Denver, Colorado",5
8814,it logs you out every week that's such a pain. also the expired/sold ads disappear so you don't even know what it was. needs lots of work,3
8815,a lot of cool things in here,5
8816,"If there was more effort on Craig's part to lessen the scam attempts I'd give you 6 stars. I've bought and sold 90% of the vehicles I've ever bought or sold through Craigslist, and I've bought and sold many other things through Craigslist in my lifetime. No attempt was made to scam me in the first years of using Craigslist, but in the past few years I've been contacted by scammers 100% of the time I've sold anything through the app. Luckily I'm smart enough to avoid it, but most people aren't",5

8824,Not a good app. I posted an add verified mts3lf it was instantlt blocked for no reason. Its a white owned company that is extremely racist. Plenty of people hsve been murdered using that app and the killers are craiglist employees,1

8844,"Why would a person try your stupid app when your stupid website doesn't work? Maybe, JUST MAYBE, you all should of squared away your site before taking on more responsibility. If your site doesn't work, your app doesn't work. Quite frankly, I'm tired of patronizing organizations that half-a** everything they do.",1

8858,"Craigslists (CL) use to be wonderful, now there are alternatives sites to post ads. I ranked CL with 2 stars as when you place a renters ad, anyone offended or doesn't like what you post, they can Flag it and you have no recourse! If CL wanted, they could have a preferred ad where they charged $10 to $25 for a month long ad, they could have an employee read it to comply with CL policy which would prevent somebody, from Flagging it. This would be great.",2
8859,"Horrible experience, tons of replies everyday that are spam and scams, as a business owner this is a massive waste of my time just for a few sales.",1

9038,2007 I don't have a lot of money at the time and someone told me about this website. I was very skeptical and then as I looked I actually found what I needed for a tremendously low price. Believe it or not I have gotten every one of my cars except for one off of there and I'm talking about eight cars in that time frame and I don't know if it's luck but each one was a great car and ran until I either I kept them or got rid of them. The three out of the four cars I have now are from Craigslist,5

9050,I am not paying to place an ad for someone I may or may not want for a temporary housesitter job. I'll go elsewhere thanks.,1
9051,"work well mostly, but search is often inaccurate.",4
9052,I've been with Craigslist since they started and just had my account and IP banned for warning the community about a child molester contacting people through ads. Craigslist supports pedophiles over decades old users.,1
9053,"Came for the backpage, stayed for the free stuff.",3
9054,It's arite haven't seen visual improvements in decades or somewhere around them but I gotta b honest as a bunny mommy who has needed to find a bunny to love n adopt that this is the only app I've found that has good seelers in my exp who sell their animals privately or otherwise I use it primarily for finding pets or in search of pets needing a home so ty as u have certainly helped to find good homes 4 I'm guessing thousands of needy homeless animals & for that u will always have my support ‚ù§Ô∏è,5

9065,"big fan of the Simplicity of the UI. Everything about the app is great EXCEPT for one tiny issue I have being the thumbnails in the for sale section.. items will be mismatched and it's difficult to find what I'm interested in.. example: Page full of cars for sale, first 5 listings have the correct title.. after that, I'm looking at a Jeep Wrangler titled 4runner.. then right under is a Ford Edge titled Toyota Prius.. I don't know why, but the order is always wrong on any page I look at",3

9089,Could not have been easier!,5
9090,"Very useful searches, but site ""options"" parameters procedures are cumbersome. ""Distance"" parameters once selected are not observed. When localized distance is selected, results offered stack up as much as 3 states away (quite aggravating). Options selected need faithfull adherence.

After I posted my items for sale, days later, my items are all being archived/deleted by the own app itself! üò° Also, there are tons of SCAMMERS/SPAMMERS texting me and asking me for some stupid verification codes, name, and email address.

9354,"I like Craigslist but app is useless. The photos accompanying the listings are completely scrambled. Listings for say, a brown mid-century couch will show a white Ikea three seater etc. When you click on a given listing and it launches the correct photo appears but I am clicking on items I might like to buy, only to see different items I wouldn't want for free. (I turned off AdBlockers and my VPN -- which you shouldn't have to do on a well-designed app -- but the photos are still scrambled.",1

9391,Ali check this out buddy,5
9392,NO STAR! posted 2 listings and the very second i posted i was getting text from like 5 different numbers and they were trying to get me to verify a code and send them information to send a check. In the end it was a scammer every single number was the same person pretending to be someone different and ended up being close to 10 different numbers being all the same person. I kno it was same person bc conversations all got heated bc of my suspicion and he would say something that was same as other,1

9407,Very user friendly,4

9425,"The app sucks. I'm in NY yet the craigslist app gives me listings in VT, NH and Quebec. If I search a smaller area hardly anything comes up for sale locally. Prior to the app you could find things locally.",1
9426,"The whole idea of an ""Open Local Classified Listings Platform"" is a million dollar idea; however, it is so poorly regulated & monitored to prevent having to endure constant unprofessionalism, unchecked scammer attempts, and a near endless flood of listings from Big Businesses rather than the Local Personal Ads- which is solely what Craigslist was Taylor-Made to facilitate. You guys need a complete re-haul and a much better screening process. Thank you kindly, 'SteadyAdPoster79'",2
9427,Good app,5
9428,Awesome,5
9429,i love the app but i wish there was an easier way to exchange phone numbers,5

9445,love it,1
9446,A very handy app for someone who peruses Craigslist as much as I do. The ability to look for the same item in different towns or at different distances from my town is great. Love being able to mark a searched item as a favorite and check back. Easy to use. Very helpful.,5

9459,works fine. way easier than posting to the website and way more relaxed than marketplace's constant and unsubstantiated messaging,5
9460,Lost and found is the bestü•∞,5
9461,3 days is all it took!,5
9462,"even with all the scam artists you have to weed through, there are genuine people still using the site and since the site isn't taking 15+20%of your sales price it makes it easier to haggle with people.",5
9463,Havnt been able to get past entering zipcode will not do anything after you enter zipcode,1
9464,its useless app not help at all,1
9465,I like using the desktop version on my web browser on my phone. You eliminated that option and your app is trash. Thanks but I guess I'll be using FB and OfferUp now.,1
9466,nice,4
9467,the app is amazing. people that use it are kinda sketchy,4
9468,still the best place to buy and sell locally,5
9469,"still an effective platform to find what I need despite their decision to charge users. I understand their need to clean up the romance posts, maybe too much intervention from law enforcement, but I don't think they needed to remove it completely. like I said, just clean it up. otherwise, they offer a great service.",4
9470,Free and Simple!!!,5
9471,craigslist is better than the others.,5
9472,"This is such a smorgasbord as long as you're coming to it with an informed eye and keeping watch on the way you might get scammed. I bought a phone thru CL 4 yrs ago turned out stolen from a nice drag queen I traveled down but also got a car last year that was under $1000 an 05 PT Cruiser in orange and it's still running smoothly only put $700 in repair/maintenance in 19 months. Wrong place to find a date who won't expect cash at night's end. I knew 2 ""working girls"" using CL to get clients.ü§∑",4
9473,Craigslist keeps deleting Posts. No response from support to help. Support appears non-existent.,1
9474,Could not post my ad it is inpublished,1
9475,never had a problem,5

9492,sold my camper in 3 days,5
9493,No one real wanted anything the ones that did wanted you to meet in weird places and when you suggested a neutral place the would stop communicating.,1
9494,Craigslist has definitely stepped up their game & would consider this app being a top ranking app again with how many improvements that have been done and how much better it has become. I can happily look past the small fees they have added to post listing on this page now because I am very happy with the results I get from using their service for my services or to find services as well as selling goods,5
9495,it's cool,5
9496,This is a great app for when your looking for cheap items,5

9518,"Continually logging me out. Obviously they hardly put any effort into this website or app, but even trying to use it is so annoying when it is always logging me out. I really cannot fathom why. Painful, clunky and unnecessary and makes me want to use it less. Urgh.",2
9519,great free way to sell and find good deals on stuff,5
9520,Craiglist is always effective. I have often posted an ad for usable items that I no longer need and immediately found someone who could use the items. Much better that a yard sale.,5

9523,The most convenient app to sell/buy,5
9524,great place to find good deals.,5

Update 09/21/22. The app is a straight trash. I kept sending emails and posting and they keep removing my posts. Still not one word from the developers or website managers for weeks now.

9755,C.L. is great...just have to side step the scammers.,5
9756,The app does not offer information on how many sellers they car has gone through. Also there are quite a few private sellers that are scammers...,3
9757,I'm trying to sell stuff but can't log on.,1
9758,"Like old way, more direct to find items where l want to search. .not a good move!! JP",1

9768,love it period.,5
9769,way better to use the app than the website,5
9770,We now call it Dead's List. As one time it was the best listing service for auto and pickup sales. Now Facebook Market Place and other internet providers have taken over. Very sad as Craigs List was a Pioneer and was a great service once.,2
9771,Trying to put my rental in craigslist,5
9772,The best,5
9773,awesome app,5
9774,Great site to post vehicle for sale. Allowed me to upload about a dozen photos of my vehicle. This was instrumental in illustrating different angles of my car to prospective buyers. Sold my car in less than 2 weeks after posting it! Would definitely recommend using this.,5

9783,Still the best place to buy and sell!,5
9784,Great app. A ton of inquiries when listed item(s).,5
9785,Craigslist has been very helpful for me. 99% of the people are courteous and prompt. for me I've had nearly the opposite experience with Facebook Marketplace. so yeah I think Craigslist is the best selling platform for me. as I'm retiring due to health conditions I was able to liquidate most of my construction tools through this site and all of my transactions felt like a win-win situation together with the buyers. thank you craigslist.,5
9786,Awesome,5
9787,"I had a problem with a buyer who seemed scary. there was no way to report him to CL, you could only report sellers I was afraid to sell on CL for about a year. The buyer was really angry when I called off the sale, I was relieved!",3

9789,"Working great for me, Hope the same for everybody else",5
9790,this app is good for business,4
9791,a great way to sell your vehicle.,5
9792,"Craigslist is pretty easy to use and I do get results either through searches or selling. if you are selling many items, it does become harder to manage because you can't truly delete sold items or items that explored and you renew. When you repost the expired item, it now leaves two postings in your postings list. Not as clean as it could be from an organizational stand point.",4
9793,It's so much easier than the old version. I love it!,5
9794,always a great place to buy or sale,5
9795,I posted my post for the recliner on Facebook for over a week. It took only 2 days to get my recliner sold on Craigslist. Big difference between the two.,5
9796,great information,5
9797,a platform that gives us some free advertising. The app is controlled by the nwo types that only allow their approvable type of content but still we are able to get some content seen here.,4
9798,Not worth describing?,2
9799,"I placed an ad for a much needed job and in less than a week I was hired and with a company who offered me more than I had expected. Again, I seem to get more success when asking for a job, services I can render, etc.",5

9809,I don't like it that people can flag your post and they absolutely know nothing about you or what you're trying to do they just don't like the fact that you're trying to rehome dogs 3 home dogs and if they thand if they think their opinion is more important than yours they're allowed to flag our post so with that being said I give you a one star.,1

9830,"Great way to sell or trade your no longer needed items. Be safe and be aware though. This app is great, but there's people out there seeing these postings that are looking to rip you off. Always sell from your home location or in a public setting. Sad times.",5
9831,great place to sell even though there's a lot of scammers trying to get your Google code sent to them! (just ignore them) but I got plenty of people that wanted to buy it in the first day! and it sold within 24 hours!,5

10043,I like the simplicity of Craigslist. I also don't like the simplicity of Craigslist. i wish they would automate and add intelligence as ui/ux improvements. keep it simple works but maybe we're at the point where me complex can be made really simple,5
10044,Craigslist is very efficient on reaching lots of people for replies. Thank you Craigslist.,5
10045,great app!!!,5
10046,love Craigslist no bullcrap SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT MESSAGE WANTING TO BUY SOMETHING SEND SUCH RIDICULOUSLY LOW OFFERS THEN WILL TELL YOU A SOB STORY CANT STOP THE MEATBALLS THO,5
10047,great,5
10048,Good app for craigslist but could be better. Sometime search parameters are difficult. Attached photos to my posted ads on Craigslist frequently lose the photos. I don't know howthis is possible but it does happen often.,3
10049,Great way to find deals and save favorites,5
10050,Excellent site,5
10051,lots of scams as soon as post was live. but item sold in 24 hoirs,3

10055,can't really tell the difference in people who are just messing with you giving you a hard time or are really interested in buying something,3
10056,works as advertised,5
10057,"too many ""no shows""",3
10058,been enjoying Craigslist for almost two decades... just checking..,5
10059,I have become addicted to scrolling through Craigslist. I cannot stop,5
10060,"I just love Craigslist. I can't tell you how many items have been spared the dump, and reused instead. It makes me happy. The ""Free"" category does just that. Please do the same whenever you can ; )",5
10061,Always a good way to find what you need.,5
10062,It's not as good as it used to be,3
10063,Exactly what you need.,5
10064,love shopping on the app. just wish there were more people who gave you there number. not email,5

10069,I received 23 scam texts/calls in 10 mins,1
10070,nice app to sale items you no longer need,5
10071,I've used CL for a looong time. It used to be great. It's a bit harder now because when you post something it gets pushed down so fast. the app is nice and convenient. I just wish there was maybe a chat or instant message system. Especially since they warn you so much about giving your email and phone numbers. Overall still a great resource for classifieds. I think the millenials use it less.,4
10072,The app and subsequent sale were both flawless,5
10073,Easy to use,5
10074,7 and 3 quarters thumbs up,4
10075,got a job thank you,4
10076,great ... new improved website. thanks.. craigslist...,5
10077,the only real complaint is that they dont police duplicate postings. i see people postong the same thing literally dozens of times. Craigslist needs to put some controls on this.,3
10078,great,5
10079,Craigslist needs to go back to the way it was where you can go to Google search craigslist and it would go to desktop On a note 9 you can do just that on a note 22 you can not do that And for a person with the disability this app does not work at all for me,1
10080,"Works better then before, little should give third another Try. I wish it had a messaging system like OfferUp smh",5
10081,Housing post not live . But why ??,5

10088,"I think this website has no business on the internet and it's sloppy, and nothing but trash.",1
10089,Craigslist is always my first choice when I want to buy or sell everything. The majority of the people here are polite and friendly.,5
10090,"I love your new app. I only wish that it will save your changes in the ""sort"" option instead of having to do it everytime I open up the app.",4
10091,fast and easy,5
10092,"Awesome, and more awesome, is that is, 100%percent, FREE!",5
10093,I've been using craigslist for over 10 years. Aside from the one time I flew out to Vegas to meet someone I met on personals and then found out he was married (I proceeded to kick him out of Vegas but that's another crazy story for another day) I have never had more positive experiences on any other buying/selling platform. I will never switch to marketplace or letgo. they have nothing on CL,5
10094,love it,5
10095,Great for farm animal sales,4

10098,LONG.LIVE.CL,5
10099,great app,5
10100,This app is to confusing. What was wrong with the old App? If you want to explore a different area then you'll need to know that zip. It's a real pain in the butt.,1
10101,Haven't used Craigslist in a couple years. The format has changed a lot but learned how to use it quickly.,5
10102,easy-to-use interface.,4
10103,la mejor forma de poner en venta y r√°pida su venta.,5
10104,great app! it's helped me so much in life. thank U Craigslist!,5
10105,works well except it doesn't sync well with the browser site (i.e. items posted to sell on app won't show up in browser to manage post),4
10106,useful to use,5
10107,"It sucks I would give it a negative if I could, don't bother downloading it , it won't even bring up one ad",1
10108,Craigslist is an awesome source for selling your stuff. The app is super simple to use. I posted some stuff for sell and it sold the very next day. It's also a great way to buy things you need. I always check craigslist first when I'm looking for high dollar items and can't afford to pay new item prices. Give em a try!,5
10109,"Craigslist continues to be a successful tool for us when occasionally selling items. Sold cars, furniture and sporting goods over the years. Has worked well for us.",5
10110,Every time I put a posting on here to try and rehome a kitten they remove it. No reason as to why just take it down. I had a stray come and give birth on my porch and now I'm trying to find homes for these little blessings and they keep removing them. I don't want money just good homes but nope now they go to the pound because my landlords wants 25 per month for each. Thanks Craigslist,1

10164,I really love craigslist because I found apartments on here even rooms and affordable products plus I sold my car on here and even got jobs on here. Please be watching and stay attentive all post may not be good for you so If it sounds to good to be true it likely is!!!

10300,"Mixed feelings about this app. On one hand it's the greatest to find awesome paying work and to get rid of literally anything for some extra cash or even free. But on the other hand, seems to be more then 50% people looking for secret affairs and flings. Isn't my business really but between Ashley Madison and this app... It's shocking there's still as many relationships and marriages as there is these days... For couples to bring in others as a decision they make together is different though.",3

It is also buyer and seller friendly, unlike Ebay that almost always sides with the buyer independent of the evidence. There is a caveat, though. There are plenty of scammers!

10751,excellent,5
10752,"if trying to sell anything, expect many scams trying to get you to confirm a six digit number they send you, but it's actually your security code for Google or some other account. DONT FALL FOR IT.",3
10753,"Needs work on the user interface other than that it also needs better location tracking, search results and memory savings issues have been a problem.",1
10754,great adult behaving customers who always come through unlike OfferUp,5

10769,"Good interface to CL. Normally prefer posting with my laptop, but this app will get the job done almost as easily.",5
10770,"App 'refreshes' itself back to the opening screen way too often and thus renders the app too frustrating to be functionally usable. Writing a draft, but have to look up some specs? App reboots to the opening screen when you come back into the app. Wading through 250 items in a CL search and you pop out to Google to research one of the items. App reboots back to the opening screen. Hope you remember where you were in that list of 250 and have fun getting there.",2
10771,I like this app. It offers features such as a notification list that emails me when something on my list is posted. The Craigslist app is user friendly too. Nice!,5

10778,Just what I am looking for! Every time!,5
10779,this app is so streamlined it's somehow even easier than using the PC version,5

10858,"Very effective. It's just annoying how most of the COMPLETELY NORMAL ads you post get taken down moment after you list it. You can list that very same ad on a different account, though, and nothings wrong with it. The meaningless removals are quite inconvenient and annoying when nothing is wrong with your post and your following all guidelines, but other than that, I recommend this app when wanting to advertise anything.

11002,I like using Craig's list but watch out for the scammers,3
11003,"App works well, navigation is fine but there is just an overwhelming amount of SPAM... Cars salesman will sell under every single category, no matter what you look at theres car sales spam everywhere. As of now Craigslist does nothing about SPAMMING... When they fix that I'll rate again. Also side note an expiration for post would make a lot of sense! Far too many old post that the creator never removes that stay on Craigslist. Lowering rating to one, and deleting scammers own Craigslist",1
11004,Easy for me to get free firewood,5
11005,too much spam!!!both through text and email. almost as soon as I posted.,1

11012,I like it very much and it helps my life,4
11013,sold lots of stuff. u must ignore buyers and sellers sending codes or asking to reply to alternative emails. they are scammers. just ask if buyer is local and deal with them. good luck!,5

11017,"This is getting worse instead of better.. Maybe even 2.5 stars at this point. It keeps flagging my ads, no customer service as to why. I'm posting even paying to post exactly the same things that are listed and my ads get flagged almost immediately.. waste of my time. And the SPAM response is insane. Most of your responders. Are spammers. Fake Ads. fake buyers.. it's just AWEFUL. A real ad gets blocked, but fake phishing ones stay listed. I just don't get it.",1
11018,Convenient,5

11032,Loved it.,5
11033,design is awful,3
11034,you or someone is always flagging our post and we are legit. why don't you control the situation? Craigslist you suck,1
11035,Every time I post for my puppies I get flagged and I am very legit. Craigslist should do something about this or let me know what to do.,1
11036,Sometimes randomly resets and you lose all your saved posts. More importantly they sell your info in the form of your interests/searches. Would get ads for things i had only searched around the app for,1
11037,I have always used craigslist it's a sure deal,5

11052,"When I updated the app it will not let me send replies from email. In the send to space it shows a red area in the send to space. I went to the att store and they said it's a problem with the app, not my phone. They need to fix it with a new update.",1

11054,great place to place an ad. better than facebook. easier to deal with. thank you craigs list. your a blessing,5
11055,great app,5
11056,"So many car dealers have their ads that pop up when not wanted because there is no enforcement and they've figured out the algorithm. If I'm looking for an equipment trailer from a private seller, I don't want to have to wade through 200 ads from dealerships.",2

11058,needs more info,4
11059,"Decent overall but unlike on a Windows machine, doesn't save login credentials: an identity verification email is necessary just as when accessing account using a bookmark on an Android device. Only advantage is a better UI.",4
11060,Craigslist!,5
11061,Slow,3
11062,Quick response.,5
11063,first day free listing was picked up and removed in the same week,5
11064,Great,5
11065,Exellent place to purchase and sell any kind of items. Unfortunately spam always comes up but you can believe just in the ones with phone number to have more secure that they are true.,5
11066,I like craigslist better than offerup. It is a more open format.,5
11067,"good, but not fast enough",4
11068,The previous craigslist was fine,1

I love it.,5

11093,who doesn't love Craigslist?,5
11094,it works can't ask for more than that.,3
11095,Nothing but scammers answered my ad.,1
11096,Too bad the interface has changed. I liked the old format where I could pick what states and areas I would search. Not happy about the new circle radius format,5
11097,it's okay,3
11098,"Great app but you guys should disable the ability to swipe to the next listing. Listings that have several photos require users to swipe to the next photo and often times what happens is instead of swiping to the next photo, it swipes to the next listing. This gets irritating fast.",4
11099,sold in two days,5
11100,This app is great for searching Craigslist but I especially like the notification feature that tells me when new ads match my search!,5
11101,can't believe they charge $5 to post a vehicle for sale.,4
11102,"Great information.. I can sell anything, legally, find a place to stay..this it..be careful.",5
11103,Looking for safe affordable place,4
11104,Post your items and sell them. I successfully sell items all the time. Be smart and don't show items unless you personally speak by phone to this person. Go on your gut after speaking with them. Most people are very nice. No negotiating until you show the item. Don't take text messages wasting your time. If the item is small enough meet them at a bank or very public place. Price it to sell with a little wiggle room if necessary. You will get the most $ on Craiglist. Good luck!,5
11105,Kinda retro but it's nice to not have to deal with a company that wants to own your life.,5
11106,so much more convenient than going to the site! I have searches set up for the stuff I'm looking for and once I purchase that item I turn off the alert.,5

11121,Clean and simple can ask for much more,4
11122,Love to find cash paying jobs,5
11123,This app sucks just period logs you out randomly and the mobile version is 1/10 at best,1
11124,Public flagging is a mistake.,5
11125,"So far I think this app has nothing to really do with Craigslist, first it looks different from when you just search it on Google, and only responses I get are from scammers. I mean I'm really legit trying to sell my stuff, and don't like having my time wasted. I did it thru the app, since Craigslist has gone thru from stupid changes, which is why I rarely use it anymore. This is so beyond frustrating. I wouldn't recommend getting this app.",1
11126,Craigslist was actually pretty good but right now something happened to Craigslist I don't know what's going on I can't even log in to do anything,4
11127,craigslist the OG of selling stuff!,5
11128,chicks dig my purchases and listings. nothing too crazy,5

11130,I've gotten a few cars without any problems...,5
11131,Love this app. Had so many different things to see what other people are giving away for Free! Just put in your zip code and find many things to go put up. Even tells you how far away it is to get it!,5

11133,Glad to see app usability improvement!,5
11134,"I have good luck with buying and selling on these app. The main thing is, if the person doesn't want to talk on a live cell line. Don't waste your time with scams.",4

11140,No service,2
11141,Creeps looking daily to delete good posts to promote their hidden disgusting posts. They have never updated tells me they got paid and ran. Could have been so much better of an app.,1
11142,there used to be a lot of stuff on this app but it seems like people got bored with it or something to me it seems like not too many people as far as dating are pretty slim pickings a lot of girls seem to be trying to sell themselves but I use it often thank you,3

11155,"it's a well built, simple app that does exactly what it should, no less, and without stupid extra features.",5

11163,"CL reaches a lot of buyers. However, there are a lot of scammers so beware and be safe.",5
11164,I've had a lot of success selling stuff on Craigslist. Tools and household goods have sold relatively quickly. Not much success with clothing. I have never had any problems.,5
11165,"Great app, and I usually don't do reviews. I like simple and reliable and know that this is hard to do well. My only wish would be that it doesn't forget saved searches every couple of months.",5

11168,great app hope it stays around,5
11169,"Craigslist list has consistently been the most important application for me as I've been able to find work, browse sales, furniture and much much more. Craigslist is the best.",5
11170,There is nothing like craigslist. Buy nothing! It's all right here. There is still something human to be found in this platform. (And the app makes it especially easy to post curb alerts as you pass cool stuff on the street),5
11171,Great improvement over the website. Makes it much easier to post listings when you can use your camera directly. Long-term things like in-app communications could make this better.,4
11172,This is a great app. The only thing I would say is I could only do a 250 mile radius. It didn't appear that I could put multiple cities outside my 250 mile search perimeter. I've only been using this app for a couple weeks so it may be user error. Otherwise I like it alot.,5
11173,craigslist is a good platform for selling. I am always successful.,5

11684,I use this app quite a bit for farm related buy swap and sell. so far I have found it very easy to navigate and use. the only thing I could say is sometimes the connection to the maps app isn't perfect. but that hasn't caused me any real issues. definitely a very functional and useful application and craigslist has been a very long lasting and useful platform.,5
11685,Can you stop allowing DoorDash to post the same ad multiple times a day. I mean its getting annoying seeing 6 doordash ads for the same thing,1
11686,Awesome rescued my pooch here!,5
11687,Easy to use.,5
11688,Love this app,5

11695,excellent experience,5
11696,very easy to use,5
11697,Great,5
11698,I would just use the online version of Craigslist where there's no ads. Also if you are a big user of Craigslist clear your cashe after every uses. The app slows üêå down a lot,3

11705,The app is much easier to use and than mobile.,5
11706,"I've sold a few items here on Craigslist with pretty good results. The only issues I have are when looking through items sometimes the posts are not from my area. I can search in Oklahoma/Kansas area and have received posts from as far as Hawaii. Another issue is from users asking if I still have something and then ghosting me when I reply yes, but I know that is pretty universal across all online selling markets.",4

11719,Craigslist is a great app to buy and sell stuff with.,5

11721,app a little confusing but worked my way through it. I couldn't find where to mark the item sold,4
11722,Craigslist is awesome,5

11734,so far so good,5
11735,"I gave CL only 3 stars for one reason: scams. long term house rentals in OR, almost no scams. But long term house rentals in Charlotte NC, literally ALL scams. If CL could vet scams out before they are posted somehow then it would without a doubt be the single best buy/sell app there is and it is already better than offerup or similar apps, but the scams are horrible and overwhelming. it it's not dealt with quickly, it will destroy CL.",3

11865,That's great until you leave it to check something out on any other app when you come back to it it forgot where you were at and has to reload and you have to reload put all your research criteria back in there which is pointless seeing how one can just use the browser like we've all been doing for eons and never have to re-enter your search criteria. Well I guess if you'd like repeating yourself over and over you must enjoy it,1

11926,With in a few minutes I found and had contact with the seller of the car I wanted. Very Nice üëçüò∏,5
11927,So much easier than the desktop website I've always used. Craigslist is great to buy and sell items. I love cycling thru new-to-me items and recycling items. I've been able to sell things on to other people when I'm redecorating or moving instead of having to move them. And then I get to use Craigslist to look for great finds through it as well. Wonderful tool to help reduce your consumption and carbon footprint. Just be wise and avoid anything other than in-person cash transactions.,5

12251,I still prefer using Craigslist over other social media to post things for sale.,4
12252,The layout of the app far exceeds the website. The website looks like it's stuck in 2004 while the app is nice to look at and things are easy to find. Sorting your searches is much easier in the app too.,5

12265,"I would give 5 stars but whoever the developer is, they need to keep better track of the people who don't follow the rules. Exactly how many puppy mills and breeders are there? And how many duplicate ads can a property make for the exact same apartment? All I find on Craigslist anymore is the same apartment ad 30 times in a row and breeders wanting $1,000s for a ""rehoming"" fee. That's not a rehoming fee, that's highway robbery. Monitor your app guys!!!!",1
12266,For a smartphone app it is quite usable and offers a fairly detailed interface. This was my first sale using Craig's list on any platform and it couldn't have been easier.,5

12298,great website for me I've been buying and selling cars motorcycles for 25 years or so and also I have a passion for music so buying and selling music instruments as well I don't use any other websites for advertising there Numero Uno I can say a lot more but I'm limited to 500 words here so I'm just going to say with the freedom you get to edit your ad how many times you want a day and the fact that it's free it's a no-brainer for me and it shouldn't be for anybody else I'll give it five stars,5
12299,Bloated with spam. Advertising spam is so rampant it's impossible to actually find anything. Uninstalled.,1

12352,another of things I like,5
12353,good work,4
12354,administrators for the app itself could do a better job at removing scam posts but other then that great app to find side gigs and etc,3
12355,"You have improved a lot as far as it used to take a long time to post an item to sell.But now,I can load the images n post much faster. BIG improvement in that area! What I don't like is that if I want to post in the gigs section,then it costs several dollars to post, and after 1-2 days,my post is far at the bottom, BURRIED, because big companies post 10 in a row, which shouldn't be allowed.(Make a daily/hourly LIMIT please). I'd have to pay over $150/mo. to advertise on CL! Which is CRAZY! ü§ô",4
12356,sold my item with no problems.,5

12368,perfect,5
12369,Hate the format and color schemes available. Hard on the eyes and VERY busy. I'm not a 12 year old. Keep it simple. Going back to PC mode.,2
12370,Everytime my husband and I go to place an ad our ad is posted for a possible 15 minutes and then someone flags it for no reason. I think that is very unfair that the public has the right to flag your post and automatically makes your post be deleted. So as far as Craigslist it is very unfair more and more each minute we try and use it.,1
12371,Good App to have! It's better now then before.,5

12374,"I completely love this app. it's very practical and versatile. in terms of productivity I give it a 5 stars out of 5. the content isn't consistent, because it's user generated. nevertheless, it's extremely effective for local broadcasting of so many types of notices or general posts.",5

12383,"Pretty decent app. Like the ability to quickly expand the search area. One issue is that you can't sort or select in the ""cars and trucks"" category by owner listed or dealer listed. When I am looking for a vehicle, I may not want to see the 200 Carvana listings.",4

12407,Love that there's an app now. Has some quirks but great overall,4
12408,"There should be in app messaging for reply to your posts. It would eliminate the robo texting and spam emails in my email account. App developers, if you're listening, you really need to implement ""in app messaging"" for reply to posts. Otherwise pretty cool app. Loads faster than the website.",4

12430,I was reaching out to artisan souvenir vendors for a cultural event which we will be hosting and my posts got flagged. The people running this company definitely have a prejudice against people of many different ethnic backgrounds coming together. I will definitely no longer use this company for anything and I will pass this experience along to others so they don't come across a similar situation.,1
12431,"Easy to use for both finding things and for posting things. I've had good luck with this app. You can also change the location, so that if you're traveling you can see what's available in the area. The website is great, but on your phone the app is easier to use.",5

12453,Have not had an opportunity to experience this yet ..,3
12454,I still am having issues where favorites keep disappearing. Also would be nice to be able to ignore listings from businesses. I don't like seeing the same listing 6 times in a row under a category. I would like to be able to block those sellers entirely... I lowered it to one star due to getting no help from anyone in regard to the issues above. Feedback was given through the app and nothing...,1

As soon as someone shows interest and asks for additional pictures or says that they're over seas, or in one of the Armed Forces, it's GUARANTEED to be a scam...I promise! It's a bummer that you are required to pay to post now, but it's worth the $5 investment.",5
12504,looks great! Janet Hobson thanks üòè,5
12505,"If I could give this no stars I would. Never been so frustrated in my life with an app. Trying to re home my German Shepherd pups, but every time I try to list them the listing gets flagged, even though it says its OK to list them as long as you use the words ""rehoming fee"" and not ""selling"". Looked at other posting and worded my ad like it said and others have done. Never fails. I have had around 10-15 postings flunless. Its not right",1

12538,Craigslist has an official app? WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?! I remember when the good 3rd party app got taken down. Nothing compared. I'm excited to finish the download to compare the two!,5

12541,"This App is not user friendly. Everytime I post something on the community tab,on one of the sub sections it gets flagged IMMEDIATELY. How do you create a app that revoles around Meeting and exchange, when no one can meet and exchange cause everything gets flagged. Even though most posts I see follow the guidelines. Someone high up needs to fix the moderator system, this is just uncalled for. Someone who flags multiple post without reviewing it, should be banned Immediately. Stop ruining the app",1

12557,"Worked, watch out for scammers though",5
12558,love it,5
12559,"Back to basics! I dropped selling items on F#&*Marketplace because I can't stand the induced paranoia they cause due to their rating analytics. When you use ""their"" platform, you are subject to their rating system so not only can your products/page be ""de-throttled"" if your rating gets downgraded, but apparently people who don't even buy your products can down-rate you if you don't answer back within nanoseconds from their instant messages. So here I am, back to good'ol Craigslist!!!",5

12564,solid app.... no frills and gets the job done... easy to upload photos and manage your posts,5
12565,Craigslist needs to do a better job filtering all of the scammers who list non-existent things to buy. The scammers only intention is to steal from honest people who use this forum. If Craigslist wants to offer this service they need to take some responsibility towards protecting the users. This is one reason why Facebook marketplace is quickly becoming the place to go to sell and purchase in this forum.,3
12566,"Stable, and a faithful representation of the browser app.",5

12594,"Search options and results available nowhere else. Just remember. Craigslist is awesome. People listing and buying include both wonderful people, and risky üò¨ dangerous folk. Do not carry cash for any purchase. Arrange to meet for exchange in recorded parking of a nearby bank or credit union, or a local branch law enforcement office. You may be able to use their notary for title transfers. and exchange cash in their lobby. Be smart, cautious, and plan for your safety.",5

I've posted with Craigslist before. I know the rukes. And today I would reword it, republish it, and again flagged and removed immediately. It was never viewable. I LITERALLY copied and pasted am ad for kittens that was already published. It ALSO got flagged and removed immediately. A whole day of my life gone.",1
12614,"Great option for anyway who doesn't want to have to join an invasive social network just to find goods and services in their local area. Never had a problem with anyone who I have interacted with that advertised on Craigslist for years now.

Not everyone wants to air their personal life online just to land a job or sell a dresser, me included.",5
12615,I have seen lot's of good things and opportunities in this app,5
12616,"This app would be excellent if there were safeguards against scammers. Geeze, I am always being harassed by scam ""buyers"" regardless of how I choose to be contacted. Also, BEWARE of the scammers who are trying to get you to ""verify that you aren't a scammer through Google voice. They will steal your phone number! Also, a friend of ours was scammed for over $2,000 through a Craigslist rental ad, and my mother would have been scammed as well if I hadn't warned her before it was too late.",1

12658,I find this app great for managing CL posts,5
12659,Great way to buy and sell locally. Only problem I have is the amount of scammers that attempt to defraud you.,3
12660,Dont bother....any jerk can flag your post and have it removed. I cant post anything without someone flagging it. It doesnt matter if you follow the rules. Someone can remove your post if they dont want you to sell what you post.,1
12661,love Craigslist but the desktop is better,3
12662,I turned down 3 jobs on Monday that all paid more than $18 hr each. I now have a $50k yr job.

12678,Easy to use and if u price things right you will sell,5
12679,craigslist gets the job done . all good,5
12680,This app is garbage. Never loads. Always freezes up you have to wait. EVERYTIME!!! Then there's the flagging system. Garbage posts and ads sit on pages for weeks while normal honest ads and posts get deleted within minutes. Craiglist is a joke and their app sucks.,1
12681,"Great responses to my post, appreciate people using CL for their housing searches ..and free for me to post!",5

12711,it's craiglist#1üëç,5
12712,Easy peasy app to use.,4
12713,Using the App is better than the website. It prefills your contact info and location as you want whereas the website does not,4
12714,works well,5
12715,when you hire someone from Craigslist you have to be vigilant. never hire anyone from Craigslist without talking to them first. Ask them for references or for their location online. If they don't have presence online then you need to shy away from them. Your safety depends on your research nowadays,4
12716,Great transaction as always No better way to sell something you no longer use,5
12717,"Too many scum bags responding with scams. Unfortunate reality of this new world. The site isn't to blame. Human nature of ""screw everyone else, if possible"" is. Too bad I can't meet these guys in person....",2

12732,Great place to post a rental property!,5
12733,the best,5
12734,The app does not condense everything it really works well.,5
12735,it's the balls,5
12736,"software is spot on.... people who you deal with buyers and sellers can be disappointments. Wish Craigslist would make this more accountable; maybe charge an annual fee and verifications for users, it would make it so much more safer.",5
12737,Not sure!,5
12738,works as it should,5
12739,It works really well. The new interface is intuitive and posting is easy.,5
12740,love the app.,5
12741,"The UI's outdated, but the app works fine either way.",4
12742,"I am able to view more post in the app as opposed to the website. The app is much easier to jump from one category to the next without having 30 chrome tabs opened on my phone. You are still able to flag, star as a favorite and even hide a post from your view. I definitely will give the app 2 üëç's up!üòÅ",5
12743,"Most of the posts on this app for housing and renting are scams. People are just posting property willy-nilly as if it belonged to them and trying to get money or screw up someone's life.

12755,i put my tricycle up for sale and right away the next day I got it sold thanks to craigslist,5
12756,Wish I could give Craigslist a better rating but I am pretty upset. It's frustrating when you make a post about something without breaking any guidelines/policies and someone who is angry or has a grudge against you flags the post and it gets taken down immediately without investigation. There's gotta be a better system for this. God forbid I cancel a transaction because I'm uncomfortable and then the other person makes posting anything very difficult. Flag and run right? üôÑ,3
12757,"Easy to use and manage, and very easy and quick to post.",5
12758,great app and easy to navigate,5
12759,Always The Best Results!,5
12760,Don't seem to get as many calls for items like I used to.,5

12762,always great with Craigslist postings especially for tools and car parts. thank you CraigsList,5
12763,Buggy as heck when trying to upload images for a listing.,2
12764,The app is very not user friendly. When searching for things it doesn't use the keywords typed in. My husband will pull up ads on the desktop version that i then can barely find using the app because it is soooooo unreliable. The regular and mobile website are much more user friendly. Don't waste your time or the space on your phone downloading this app.,1
12765,great app!,4

12850,giving away things I don't want anymore on craigslist is a great way to get rid of them.,5
12851,I like that the Craigslist interface stays the same and don't have to relearn with every update. The items I have posted are sold often in days and for the more unique items a couple of weeks. Often use the free option to clear out items.,5
12852,it way better now then the last time I downloaded it but that was 3 years ago to tho,5

12902,My post gets flagged immediately after I post it. I follow the rules!!!

12914,"Craigslist is outdated and way too temperamental, I can't even post my item at all pretty much because I did it early a couple times. Now 3 days and you still remove my post every time, it's just not a good app to sell stuff on at all. Maybe for jobs or something but for the seller just get a different app cause they make it almost impossible to advertise even though that's what the site is supposed to be for. God forbid you post a similar item within 38 hours or so. pretty ridiculous. Over it",1

12974,Very smooth experience!,5
12975,I would have given 5 stars but they done messed up. How are you going to flag a post I made without even looking at it? There was not one thing wrong with it. But because someone didn't like me or a troll happens by and flags me you take it down. No questions asked. Dumb. I hate when sites do that. Look before you delete. People put time into these ridiculous posts. Everyone is too sensitive around here,2
12976,Best app their is.,5

13035,I usually prefer using the browser. instead of an app. but Craigslist app is weed faster.,4
13036,Truthfully I was going to give it a four but you ready for this my thumb is frozen because I have to sleep outside cuz I'm homeless and it was below freezing again and there's no way to change my rating except leave this review. But I was going to say Craigslist is always had the opportunity beautiful to set the radius of a circle when I'm looking for something close to me. It's got plenty of categories and opportunities to go back and forth and conduct business/look for rooms and apartments cuz,3

13315,you don't keep up to date postings they're from a week old to several months,1
13316,These guys have really forgotten what it was that made them so popular in the first place. A free platform where people could get a good deal and get stuff moved quickly but now you've got to pay for a post and everyone is a jerk and the only people allowed to do what they want are the scammers. Just go to a real platform don't take the risk here since you have to pay anyway.,1

13428,"Once the sequence of entry to give something away for free is learned, entering the info is quick and easy. Updating listings is easy too. Add more photos or change text. It could be quicker if Craigslist would let more than one photo at a time be selected for inclusion in the listing...",4
13429,3 Starz only because cregslist should do background checks I have seen so many suspicious apts for rent by creapy perverts who should be in prison. If your just buying or selling it's perfect not like other apps that have adds just be careful Don't expect anything but cash. No cashier checks No money orders CASH only be safe. üôè,3
13430,They sell your data to some really shady operations. Be prepared to be inundated with marketing calls...like...NONSTOP.,1
13431,satisfied overall with the amount of things offered on this app... making postings are simple ‚ô•Ô∏è and usually successful .,4
13432,one or two scamers trying to make contact. But had a lot of views and requests to see trailer. very happy with the amount of contacts regarding the sale of my trailer.,4

13457,very useful for saving searches! thanks,5
13458,This app sucks! It rarely has anything you are looking for and when it does find what you are looking for there are a lot more things that you are not looking for.,1
13459,Completely useless app. Shows everything EXCEPT what you're looking for. Complete garbage.,1
13460,Got a scammer call 30 minutes after I posted -- wanted me to respond directly to their email instead of through Craigslist. I responded through Craigslist - never heard from them again. Three days later got a message of interest - traded emails through Craigslist for next hour until potential buyer was convinced I wasn't a scammer. Set up a meeting to inspect merchandise and sold the next day. Overall it was one of the better selling experiences on Craigslist.,4

13569,I love Craigslist! I've got so much stuff because of this app. you can find whatever your looking for,5
13570,"I have used Craigslist was very resistant to using Craigslist bad stuff happening when you meet someone for a sale. I went by the 3 rules 1. Always meet in a very public place ( especially anyone under the age of 18 and women ) 2. Only take cash from the buyer never take a check ever, I make them bring a truck or vehicle big enough to transport their purchase or purchases. Don't take them back to your house to pickup what you're selling. Bring it with you or borrow one. 3.Gut feeling follow it.",5
13571,Craigslist has cleaned its app up a bit with is great and I'm still using it today.,4
13572,A very convenient way to let people know I had something for sale. They were able to contact me easily and it worked out well.,5
13573,"the only thing I'd like to add is maybe some way to respond to adds like offer up has, some sort of messaging and inbox other then that the app is f-in sweet",5
13574,Would be an amazing place to post if they actually investigated posts that get reported instead of automatically removing them as the town I live in reports anything anyone assigned female at birth posts and even though they don't go against community guidelines it gets removed! Can't even find people for my music career! This needs changed as it's been for sexist reasons!,2
13575,ease if use is what I've been hoping for!!!,5
13576,"I've been using craigslist for years. It's really nice they have an app now. Be very careful of people trying to take advantage of you if you have a listing. Just never give out personal information unless you know that person is legit. Besides being heads up on that we've found some amazing deals and we've sold a lot of things successfully on this platform. I'd highly suggest using it! Be respectful of someone else's time. If you say you are going to pick something up, actually show up!",5

13606,Easy going,3
13607,great experience,5
13608,craigslist cool,5
13609,very nice.,4
13610,The app is easier to post from than online from your phone. No annoying ads. No notifications. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't prohibit selling firearms.,4

13630,"I love Craigslist, I always sale a few days after I post",5
13631,I love Craigslist. it was the original successful classified ads online. I don't use it as much as I used to but I love the reach that it has and the people that you can find. Still probably the most useful classified ads system online today. Thanks Craigslist,5

13649,It's a nice place for selling and buying.,4
13650,so far everything works as it should,5
13651,pretty easy to list and the ad got good traffic right away. They charge $5 to list a car but it's money well spent.,5
13652,This app is trash. A complete waste of space. Every post is flagged. It's highjacked with bitterness. What used to be helpful is now just a passed concept.‚úåüèøI subtract my one star rating.,1
13653,can not send emails to vendor,3
13654,"""Credibility check failed""",1
13655,Craigslist is trash. They really know how to ruin a good thing with their stupid auto delete function. Expect about half of your ads to be randomly deleted for no reason.,1
13656,easy to use. had a different CL app that wasn't near as good,5
13657,people should use Craigslist more.,5
13658,quick sale,5

13662,great response and a sale to a wonderful person,5
13663,What a deal! I have sold three cars on Craigslist now. The last two each sold within 24 hours. I can't believe it was only $5 to post. I wasted $49 with the big guys (something trader).,5
13664,sold my car within two days after posting it. Thank you guys! I'm unemployed by way of an accident and the cash came in very handy!,5

13676,"Absolutely useless. Can't log in, can't search. Gives me an error each time. Was this app developed by some idiot hired off Craigslist? What a üí© show",1
13677,Well looking at houses on this site apparently opened me up to getting hacked and now I can't even log into my own account which is frustrating so I will stick to other outlets from now on I've used this site for many many years so this is disappointing. I think this site is over taken by the scammers and I don't feel that the users accounts are protected enough.,1
13678,Ok let you know,5
13679,This app is great! Makes cl much more user friendly,5
13680,Excellent,5
13681,I've always found it a great site to unload my used goods. Quick and relatively easy.,5
13682,"The new ads (take tok) make this app basically useless. Every search makes you watch an ad, when you go back, search another ad, rinse repeat. Long time user, uninstalling.",1
13683,awesome transaction very smooth,5
13684,I was surprised to see the Ecoflow blowout.,5
13685,Craigslist is still the best.,5
13686,This app is an amazing tool and co tinues to expand its reach. Good Job Craigslist!,5
13687,Craigslist came through again I got ready what I had to get rid of professional fashion,5
13688,Craigslist is always my go to when I need to sell something quick & fast you get üëçüèæüëçüèæ from me.,5
13689,"Great for acquiring things. Also a good place to trade stuff for other people's stuff. All in all neat application. Thanks a bunch Craig, I always knew that you'd make it in life, high school was a real blast though buddy. At any rate people, hope you find all the treasures and delights you have a hankering for.

13714,Good postings.,5
13715,Easy to use simply app,5
13716,"Perhaps not perfect, but this app is very useful and pretty reliable. Using the map with the search isn't perfect when you zoom in or out, but that feels like nitpicking. Overall this app is reliable, fast, and not overcomplicated. I haven't tried posting an ad yet, but it's been great otherwise",5
13717,love it,5
13718,Great,5
13719,Dumbest move you ever made was breaking your deal and losing your your App years ago. I think your so far behind FB now that you will never catch up. Sucks because it was awesome back then.,3
13720,Extremely useful tool to find property rentals of any kind & any place.,5
13721,Great for selling items.,4

13727,"wasn't eager to use app due to satisfaction of regular website, however this app is easy and full of smart features!",5
13728,good,5
13729,"Abruptly stopped working, won't connect to the server. Removed, reinstalled, nothing. Prior to that my only dislike, preferences had to be set every time you returned to the home page. Viewing items with pics and bundling duplicates should be the default, not the other way around.",2
13730,The CL app is great!,4
13731,The text now. or email feature is awesome!,5

13738,Great app.,5
13739,doesn't always remember me but otherwise works great.,4
13740,"CL itself is wonderful, of course, but the app leaves a little to be desired. It's free, as is CL, so it's just a little petty little niggle that the back button doesn't take you back to where you were, but back to the start screen, losing your place in a long list.",4

14077,"I love cl. However they do nothing to prevent people from flagging legitimate posts. There is no review process, and no consequence for frivolous flagging.

14124,"Worst app ever. Now there are some good things but the bad severely outweigh the good. Unfortunately there is no way to stop scammers, so only buy locally, and in person. There are people that do nothing but flag and remove posts all day because Craigslist gives everyone too much power with that option. People selling items don't remove when sold or don't reply, and people buying want everything for free or they flag you. There is a good chance you will lose faith in humanity using this app...",1

14134,great experience,5
14135,This app allows cyberspace trolls without a social life to flag/remove any post they want (even though it doesn't violate any rules/terms set by Craigslist). So basically CL isn't monitoring anything.. bunch of bots running the site.,1
14136,alot better,5
14137,Craigslist is a tool I use to find gigs(jobs) daily and weekly it comes in handy on a mobile today's life app where everyone is on the go very useful easy to download and navigate through the catagories.,5

14194,"It would have been five stars but there is one big problem I have. If people are going to sell their things on Craigslist, put down an email or number for the person to contact you. No contact, no sale. Creators should seriously do something about making it a NEED for some source of contact info cause I can never get a hold of anyone on there. What's the point of the app than?

14378,Easy to use fo browsing and posting,5
14379,although it did cost me $5 the post and sell a vehicle it was worth the $5 Craigslist works great one little problem with searching for my ad and it was simply a year thing I didn't put in enough digits other than that great app works fine.,5
14380,Never mind the fact that I post a lot of vehicles for sale and if they change the app like they have I do not want to post vehicles for sale because who is going to want to go through all the trouble of trying to find something that is actually near them Craigslist had a right for so many years until this very last update I don't mind paying to post my vehicle but at the same time I will not pay the post vehicles that it is so hard to search for these vehicles now in your area Craigslist :-(,1

14707,Thank you Craig for having this app so we can find rooms to rent over the internet. we love you! You just need to fix the flagging issue please n dismantle the flagging so people can't flag us so our time is not wasted posting ad's. Just let the computer expire it like it does for the ad. Looking forward to running into you in Publix Grocery Store months ago near the customer service desk if that was you dear with your name on a automatic blue shirt n a black kid was standing to your right. üòÇ,5

I am available also tomorrow before 12 in the afternoon so I can pick it up tomorrow before then, it works for me. I can bring them to work with me tomorrow if that works.

14962,works pretty good most of the time.,4
14963,"A simple site gets a simple app - I suppose that's fine. I'd give it another half a star but that's not an option. A bit confusing of an interface. Zero bells and whistles - not much are needed, but maybe things like reminders and warnings to renew a listing, asking if it's still available, etc. would be helpful. And biometrics instead of passwords would be great. But the price can't be beat.",3

15316,"app works great, useful",5
15317,always works,5
15318,"This is the worst site ever. Someyumes it requires you to log into your account and other times it doesnt depends on its mood. Also, no matter what password I choose, it's "" too weak"". I hate craigslist. Put it out of its misery already.",1
15319,"I have used it multiple times to buy and sell items, and I have not had any issues with the app, or other parties(thankfully). It has worked just like I wanted, and expected.",4
15320,nothing but scammers replying. poor true customer base,1
15321,love this site to search many things but fraud is a big issue always think before you send money,3
15322,Terrible,1

15341,best of all the third party craigslist apps. and yes ive tried them all.,5
15342,got quite a few responses on selling 2 leather chairs,5
15343,The issue with this app is they allow dealerships to spam post on their website. I look up specific motorycles and all that shows up is dealership posts. The only good feature ive never seen before is being able to trash posts that you dont like.,2
15344,so glad they made an app! works great!,5
15345,Great way to sell or buy used stuff!,5
15346,so far the app works great and what can you say about Craigslist One of the best things there is.,5

15374,Produced quality candidates. Excellent exposure. Thanks.,5
15375,It's FREEüôâ,5
15376,Ridiculous that if you search for general cars you find the same dealers stating their car is 199 or 537 dollars along with spam posts as if that is going to increase their chance of buyers. It is scummy and they should be flagged. Besides that the official Craigslist app is solid. Sometimes when searching it searches something else but it is minor. Edit: NOOOO THEY ARE KEEPING THE SPAM POSTS. TWO STARS.,2
15377,thank goodness for CL in general and the app is super impressive in usability.,5
15378,Greatest,5
15379,the app was really helpful I got a couple of potential clients and sold the item thank you,5

15419,"great, sold it faster than the other site",5
15420,"So there are plenty of things I can complain about. Like the repetitive fake listings by low life realtors or apartment hunters that bombard the authentic real posts. However, I am trying to be more positive. I have found decent clients on here as a business man and bought selective items. It still works if you can sift through the cesspool.",4
15421,"effective selling tool. the app isn't the most intuitive, but it gets the job done!",4
15422,"Been using CL a long, long, long time. But all of a sudden they keep deleting ALL of my posts AND won't allow me to post any more! I have done nothing wrong and have posted nothing wrong. I've tried to reach out the last 3 years and have never heard anything back.",2

15440,craigslist has always been a good source to buy and sale just about anything..,5
15441,I like the electronic option. The format works great for selling animals. Other sites have too many restrictions animals. I don't like dealing with scammers. Which can happen any time. just be smart with who you deal with. I have also noticed that I get a lot of inquiries on my posts and I am quick to respond but never get a return email. I am starting to think that my reply is going to spam and not an inbox.,3
15442,"App works well. Remembers preferences. Sometimes it is slow, but overall, I cannot complain. Easier than the web browser mobile version.",5
15443,is useful to get rid of stuff fast but the website is horrible. still stuck in 1995.,3
15444,The app seems to be working better and is gaining the confidence of people again.,4

15466,very easy to use. great app,5
15467,"Does what is needed, as easy to use as desktop site. No complaints! It does ask for user authentication frequently with email/text option to validate though, but extra security is probably preferred with mobile apps so I don't mind.",5

15489,great,5
15490,great,5
15491,"I mostly like the app, and had been hoping to see an android version for some time. It does become difficult to use however due to the ease with which ppl flag posts and have them removed for no reason, or just spite. It really takes away from its efficacy. If it happens once, ok, no big deal. But time after time after time, and these people are using the app to make the app much less useful. A fix would be great, be it moderators, or some system to establish who can flag/remove a post.",3
15492,Great app,4
15493,this app is awesome! easy to use,5
15494,better than trying to use the website on your phone,5

15532,They don't have as many ads as in the past.,3
15533,The app is somewhat easier to use than the website since the search box combs all categories before you have to narrow down your search. Makes it easier to know how many different categories an item could be in. Also autopopulates an email for you. Very handy.,5

15639,"No matter what I do, my post gets taken down within 30 minutes. And I'm just trying to get kittens home from off the street! I hope who ever is flagging it can sleep at night knowing another kitten is left in the street because they had a bad day. I find it ridiculous that just because someone flags a post, it gets taken down immediately! It should have something like 3 flags and then Craigslist is alarmed or something. Then Craigslist can email us if something is wrong. This is unreliable.",1

15820,Craigslist has come a long way. This app is perfect. I like it better than all the other sell apps. Only thing with Craigslist is that there are tons of scammers on here that contact you. So just watch out for that and your good. Craigslist needs to increase its security somehow to decrease the amount of scammers. Do not give out your personal info in your ad. Let them either email you or text you but that's it.,4

15873,I was able to get my item gone.,5
15874,Easy to use,4
15875,I really wish this app would have not updated and changed. the older app had the option to save multiple areas to search and searching for an item in a lot of other places was incredibly helpful. the new app seems to only be able.to search off the map area. if there is a way to revert to the older I would love to know how. other than that it's ok.,3

15977,Can't authenticate account,1
15978,Something just started acting funny with this app today and its saying error retry again anywhere from logging in to searching for things. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still it's messed up.,3
15979,Why not working Craigslist is my favorite .I getting nothing but errors,1
15980,Not working today,2
15981,Doesn't work,1
15982,It never works. Error after error. OfferUp here I come.,1
15983,"Can't log in. Other app works, pc always works. I have other things I need to do than spend hours trying to figure it out.",1
15984,great resource,5
15985,Not working at all today! Most other days finds about 20% of what can be found on website. Completely ignores parameters such as distance.,2
15986,Garbage. Came log in half the time,2

15994,sold my car within 1 hour of posting,5
15995,the best survival tool ever..thanks,5
15996,CL is not what it once was due to the email scammers and category spammers. No effort is made to stop this stuff so it's becoming a relic. Hello offerup.,3
15997,"Worked well, simple enough for an old guy!",4
15998,just the best way (especially for someone without a whole lot of means such as myself) to buy and sell in the public domain,5
15999,still same great craigslist,5

16013,It's been fair,5
16014,Lots of feedback. Thank you!,5

16017,love it!,5
16018,Love xxoo,5
16019,My most favorite app of all craigslist craigslist why you shouldn't even have to ask why it's the best app. App. Barnone..Bubba kitty üò∫ s,5
16020,suky,5
16021,Great App,5
16022,Great app,5
16023,good app,5
16024,Too many spam messages on few posts and keeps going on till you remove that ad and post again.,3
16025,Bunch of scams on it. Hard time selling anything. Not updated a lot. Yet I do live in a small town on a site no one barely uses anymore thanks to Facebook,2
16026,"Easy to use, better than Facebook market place.",5
16027,"Not worth the headaches, not even posting or logged in and get ""credibility check failed"". What's the point if you can't even browse",1
16028,worked,5
16029,sold thanks,5
16030,good way to surf for things. helps you save saved items with the star icon.,5
16031,App sucks when posting you have to go Uninstall the app go through the web page to put your real location,1
16032,easy to use and very convenient to have the app over using the website,5
16033,"My first experience with Craigslist and it was a good one overall. There are, however, some scammers out there who you must be mindful of. They seek your personal information and have developed ways to trick you into providing that information. But that's not against the craigslist app. It's directed towards the dishonest people who prey on the decent people. That aside, it was a good experience and I would use Craigslist again.",5
16034,Great place to find stuff,5
16035,"The app makes it easy to shop and sell on Craigslist. Simple, clean, intuitive.",5
16036,I didn't know they finally came out with an app and it's easy to post/read/respond to postings. thumbs up,5
16037,make sure you use craiglist when you have something to sell,5
16038,Not bad,4
16039,no problems,5
16040,gave me success in selling my items,4
16041,"Every time I've posted on craigslist, I've had good results.",5
16042,"I really enjoy the craigslist app it seems to do everything I needed to in a simple and easy to use platform or interface. every now and then a post is submitted without any contact information and that can be annoying but that's hardly the apps fault at all so just remember to put your contact information somewhere on there if you want somebody to buy your stuff or use your services. I've never had a major issue with it and every time I use it,which is almost every day, it works flawlessly.",5
16043,Seems like it's all right app,5
16044,Works for me!!!,5
16045,My posts keep getting removed for absolutely no reason WHY??,1
16046,Wasn't sure how to use it but I do know that Craigslist is a great place to buy and sell things,5
16047,I've done well with CL for over a decade.,5
16048,Sold my item fast,5
16049,Craigslist did not fail me this time!,5
16050,very simple app but it gets the job done,5
16051,Always Works to list in Craigslist,5
16052,In my opinion this app is very poorly designed. The interface is particularly bad; every time I use the app I get frustrated. Nothing is intuitive.,2
16053,I didn't get any responses from my ad on FB Market Place. I did get responses from CL and sold the items.,5
16054,Right on app,4
16055,"works great, helps me score some good deals",5
16056,"Easy to use, have used successfully",5
16057,If people would learn to add contact info to their posts or respond to emails it would be great. Overall the app is good though.,4
16058,been selling on Craigslist for years thanks for a great app,5
16059,Craigslist is the place to go for buying or selling an item. I have always used them and always have been successful. the only drawback to trying to sell an item is that there are scammers that try and get you to go onto a webpage they've created. They send text acting like they're real people when they aren't. that's not Craigslist fault though. And if you talk in person you don't have to deal with those people.,5
16060,What a fantastic medium I get to sell so many different things on here that wind up being useful for somebody else and works nice works a nice for me also,5
16061,it's exactly like the website just easier,5
16062,awesome,5
16063,Unorganized,1
16064,"Cool AP, I used it to help out someone in need.",5
16065,Fun,5
16066,makes posting fairly easy. Though the categories are limited.,4
16067,"works just like the website, usually get responses in a matter of days. Just be aware of scammers but that's not craigslist fault.",5
16068,Simple and straightforward way to sell your stuff,5
16069,nice local info,5
16070,really enjoy craigslist. can find anything anywhere!,5
16071,Online system NOT trying to make a buck off every sale!,5
16072,always the right thing when I need it,5
16073,when did CL start charging $5 to post 1 item???? scam,1
16074,Great results. Easy to use,5
16075,wish communication was a little more reliable with sellers but i dont suppose that falls on the app so much as is does on the individuals ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,4
16076,Works as it should.,5
16077,Crashing!!!!!!!!!!!,1
16078,Much Better version than previous. works well!,5
16079,Had a good response to my posting. Did have some scam messages but not a big deal. Ended up selling through FB market place.,5

16082,It'd be nice to submit photos more that 1 at a time,4

16085,This is the best app for selling stuff. It's free too!!,5
16086,great place to buy,5
16087,I received many calls. I have used Craigslist and other sites to rent this house many times and I always get the most responses from Craigslist by far.,5
16088,"The only craigslist app I'll run, better then most the glitch filled craigslist apps.",5
16089,Luv this app!,5
16090,The App is Awesome!!!! Really!!!! Allot better than the web sight for looking for jobs......lol,5
16091,Most items sell quickly on craigslist. It's not as many scam attemps when you don't allow texts. Covid times have been a hard time to sell as it seems everybody has too much money to buy used.,5
16092,i love this app it helps in all aspects of buying a used vehicle.,5
16093,The go to place to buy or sell.,5

16103,works well...,5
16104,I sold my car in one day,5
16105,sold less than 6 hours,5
16106,Craigslist is a great way to buy and sell. They have done a great job recently with weeding out spam and keeping things anonymous until you're ready to complete your transaction. Definitely recommend.,5
16107,Sometimes canbe difficult to get into what o want and not any categories for somethings.,3
16108,"Indescribably sketchy from top to bottom but it's useful, fast, and it has no ads biotchh",4

16111,Good job,5
16112,"Love searching on this app, but the app often tells me it didn't verify my registered account though I just confirmed it through my email.",3
16113,easy,5
16114,great exposure excellent I highly recommend it,5
16115,I use this app all of the time and recently it's started crashing constantly when I open listings,1
16116,Scams,3
16117,This app did not work. I tried to search for a vehicle and a popup keeps blocking me saying i have no internet connection. I'm connected to wifi and it's not working.,1
16118,craigslist is always great despite the myriad of weirdos,5
16119,Craigslist was better whenever they did the casual encounters sections too I understand why they got rid of it but yeah I kind of satisfaction myself it's a great way to actually meet people and hang out,3
16120,easy to use,5
16121,You have to pay $5 to post anything. This contradicts what it was built on.,1
16122,"awesome, thanks!",5
16123,great app,5
16124,was great in just a couple had alot of request and have a great new room mate,5
16125,Post in Craigslist rented in less than a day. Craigslist is the place to advertise!,5

16137,"fabulous!! i love craigslist, been using it for a long while now. great ressource in so many ways!",5
16138,great promo,5
16139,"Your app was perfect for what I was selling. I sold some alcohol I never used and your competitor offer up doesn't allow the sale of alcohol, so again Craigslist has been the one for me, thanks so much, and just one more thing, over the past years I have sold over 200 items on your website, I LOVE CRAIGSLIST üòäüòäüòä",5
16140,If you can ever get anybody to contact you back that's one of the bad things about Craigslist you never get anybody to contact you back on buying a car that is not a fraud. Getting tired of constantly have to log in to Craigslist everyday I'm on the verge of deleting Craigslist I'm filing a complaint,1
16141,ap is easy to use.,5

16155,"Craigslist routinely ""Removes"" ads that confirm to their rules in every way, saying only that the ad ""may"" violate their rules but they never get more specific and will NOT respond to an email asking them why.",1
16156,Generally not as good as FB Marketplace but gets job done. One star downgrade is for changing for some adds while still including advertising.,4
16157,works every time !!!,5
16158,"Biggest Flaw is, uploading pictures you should be able to select all pics you want at once, instead having to do it one at a time, and having to search through your gallery for each photo! This is very time consuming, and other similar apps let you select all pics at once, also should be able to see how many people viewed your auction (as other similar apps do) otherwise I would give 5 stars!!!",4
16159,Super helpful service and app,5
16160,"This app sucks. It's for people who want to hide their history or leave no trace of such. There's no other point in having this app it's far worse than the site itself. For instance, minimize your screen and reopen to find your search wiped and app restarts. Stupid. No thank you. It's for losers who post perv ads.",1
16161,very handy app,5
16162,I find opportunities here that I don't find in other places. very handy.,5

16194,it's easy to use and I got responses and sold items as soon as I posted some of them,5
16195,"This is an okay app. There are way too many unauthorized versions of Craigslist apps, and the only way to be sure you're connected to Craigslist is via their web address. But this app seems to do the job for now.",3
16196,everyone trying to get an email out of u is ignoring. probably robots,3

16213,I love this app,5
16214,I just love Craigslist.,5
16215,my favorite app for all things I need that I didn't know about before looking through the app listings daily .,5
16216,very useful when you buy and sell online easy to post convenient but can run a little slow sometimes maybe it's just my outdated phone.,4
16217,Gotta love good ol Craigslist,5
16218,CL has become useless. 99% of posts are scams & genuine posts looking for housing/jobs/information is removed. Uninstalled & will NEVER use CL app or website again.,1
16219,awesome app.,5
16220,"still the number one site for tracking scams, and you might even sell your items sometimes",4
16221,Good,5
16222,Great app. Thank you Craig,5

16227,It was so easy to post & to sell on Craigslist,5
16228,the go to place for stuff,4
16229,great,5
16230,Great site to sell pretty much whatever you want to sell. I've sold multiple items over the years using Craigslist South Jersey. Only downside is there are A LOT of scammers on here. Everytime I've posted something I'd get emails and now text messages trying to get me to do something. asking or saying weird things. I only have people contact me thru Craigslist now. I don't give out my number or personal email unless there's a transaction.,4
16231,pretty decent app to buy and sell stuff does need work on moderating spam/scams but overall pretty good.,4
16232,Easy to use,5
16233,I can't edit my posts or make a new post. It just says credibility check failed,1
16234,works good,5
16235,"Not that great. App is easy to use, but I feel like it doesn't show all the items up for sale or jobs available compared to the actual website itself.",2
16236,SOLD....says it all,5
16237,Great app!,5
16238,Very helfull,5
16239,"The add was posted just hours and had a couple to see the Jeep that Sunday, on Monday they came back and paid cash for it. Fastest response I've seen yet.",5
16240,Needs update,3
16241,excellent app,5
16242,"The original marketplace. Better than Facebook marketplace. You can always find what you're looking for here on Craigslist. Thanks to Craigslist they now have a wonderful app that works tremendously well. Really enjoying the app, thanks team Craigslist.",5
16243,"wasn't sure about getting the cl app, but I'm glad I did, it's done well and it's smooth.",5
16244,Hard to use app. I have to just go to website by my computer browser.,1
16245,good for once,5
16246,"easier than offer up & let go. have to be more careful with buyers/sellers, but the contact process is much easier",5
16247,"I Used the community ride share for the 1st time, much better and faster then Lyft",5
16248,find great local deals with filters,5
16249,I got more success sell here than any other site.,5
16250,Its so hard to find things in my area,1
16251,good to go wow,5
16252,"good, has great finds although sometimes clunky to use. overall nice",4
16253,very contented with the service and opportunity to shop and sell.,5
16254,I think it is totally stupid to charge somebody 5 dollars to post a add that's not guaranteed to sell. And craigslist has the most robberies and attacks going on... so I will use letgo or offerup,1
16255,the best way,5
16256,Great app.,5
16257,so easy to find what you are looking for.,5
16258,"I'm on here every day, for something",5
16259,Always get a response.,5
16260,awesome,5
16261,awesome site,5
16262,I ended up going to the PC to finish posting this ad. It's easier on the regular app compared to the mobile app,3
16263,by FARRRR.... one of the best apps out there to get!!,5
16264,awesome! just what I needed,5
16265,Wow I can't believe how quickly I got a response thank you,5
16266,better than a garage sale.,5
16267,sold 2 yrailer wheels and tires in one day!,5
16268,great app,5
16269,Great place to buy and sell within the community üëå,5
16270,easy to use,5
16271,great job,5
16272,"When you cut out the tire kickers with a straight forward add, price things to sell and are willing to reasonably negotiate sales happen within a few hours.",5
16273,"love Craigslist, most buyers are serious and helps me give a second life to my used items.",5
16274,easy way to sell my unwanted stuff,5
16275,i was suprised that it was so easy to post. it also was very nice to have a buyer 10 minutes later!,5
16276,Good FREE app.,5
16277,"Very useful and simple UI,",5
16278,Find a lot of stuff,5
16279,Craigslist is doing it's best to keep it a great place to buy and sell. But unfortunately the perverse nature of the homosexuals who like to post ads everywhere for the purpose of sex is crazy! Since they removed the personal section gay ads are in every catagory. It's PATHETIC HOW DESPERATE FOR SEX THESE GAYS ARE!Just completely ruins the experiencebwhen I see obvious ads trying to get their pipes cleaned or their rear plowed or stress relieved or other gay code words. PERVERSE & PATHETIC!!!!!,5
16280,Still bears FB hands down.,5
16281,I love the app!,5
16282,When buying used items this is good. Once in a while you get someone that doesn't know how to do a transaction. I wanted to purchase an electric item and the seller wanted to meet me near a school on a Sunday. I laughed at him and i said how will i know if it works without having a place to plug it in?? Seller had no comment so he lost a sale with me. Most of the time sellers know how to make a transaction like i said once in a while you get someone that doesn't seem to care.,5
16283,My only complaint is that the pictures load very slow compared to the browser ver . Love the fact you can change the search area much easier. over all love it,4

16285,Great app easy to use.,5

16290,"My husband uses it quite often and it seems to work very well for him. Anything that he's looking for he can either find or he's able to find someone that can lead him towards what he's looking for. Plus, my son was in a car accident & we're looking a used vehicle, that he doesn't have to make payments on, or at least not for long, & w/all 3 of us looking, I hope, it won't take long to find!

HOWEVER, you will be spammed immediately by people that want you to click an email link and get creepy calls to meet at unsafe places. Jeez! Also, too difficult to log in.

I raised it myself from a toadlet I did not breed it and I'm only asking a super small rehoming fee for just my toad in an attempt to keep my rehoming fee small and affordable for anyone who might be a good home.

16503,It worked for a few days and almost immediately it came up to me and said give us a review. Okay. So I've always liked the website. I might get on the Craigslist app at home and I got on at work. Now it decides I'm some kind of criminal or scammer apparently based on what IP address I'm coming in from. Well I never attempted any of the scams that they seem to think I'm guilty of I'm just browsing. So I just uninstalled it. Credibility check failed or something,1
16504,Got it sold in 1 week.,5

16678,Craigslist is great,5
16679,keeps deleting my saved searches and favorited posts :/,3
16680,"Craigslist gets results, and is relatively easy to use. I just sold a car in one day, probably got 3 interested queries in the first 3 hours, and a dozen that day. The car sold that evening after 4-5 legit queries came in, along with as many bogus low-ball offers from professional trolls - occupational hazard when you list a vehicle for sale. I prefer Craigslist over other apps - I just get better results. Your mileage will, of course, vary.",5
16681,good app but they keep deleting my postings for some weird reason and it's ridiculous and unreasonable and unfair. not sure why they keep deleting my posting but this needs to be fix,1
16682,Good for local sales and buying,5
16683,"Sold a mower, not much traffic anymore so sold it way underpriced just to get rid of it. Other than that buyer was friendly and prompt to pickup.",4

16713,"the best selling app there is, hands down. I just wish everyone would use it. I don't like having to search other apps because some people can't get over the ""craigslist"" lable it has earned by offering a place for everyone. I guess if I was to complain it would be about the jerks that post the fake ads to get email data. oh, and I think car audio should have its own category.",5
16714,A simple straight forward Craigslist app,5
16715,I was able to sell my generator in less than a week.,5
16716,"Better than the internet version, but miss some things like distance. Would also be nice to delete items from the list screen. Last, but not least being able to eliminate certain listers.",4

16774,"Nice grafics,",5
16775,Great app,5
16776,"posted about giving something away and was successful in about 4 hours, which was surprising. the design of the app was made by a 5 year old but it's simple and it got the job done so I don't care. thanks Craigslist",5
16777,The app is very easy to use and I was surprised how much interest the postings generated.,5
16778,"The comments do not allow enough space to explain all the problems with craigslist these days. For example a simple filter that blocks ads with keywords would stop people from seeing the same ad posted 400+ times so they can see other ads. As they have it currently they limit each account to 2 ads per subject and if bots didn't make a new account for each ad, that would work well. I use to use this app for everything, now the only thing it is good for is curb watch for free junk.",1
16779,"I had kind of an inconsistent time posting, however, that might not be the apps fault.",4
16780,"Everything I like about the website, in a much more mobile-friendly format.",5

16791,Great app for a great site. There seem to have been interface improvements in the last 6 months,5
16792,I mostly use the app to give homegoods away. It has gone well each time.,4
16793,Great way to sell items locally.,5
16794,wonderful thank you so convince this app,5
16795,if you have need of money you have many things around your home or in your yard that you're no longer needing why not turn it into money for your needs now!,5
16796,üòÅ,5
16797,really like your sight,5

16812,Not what it used to be but it's people's fault not Craigslist's.,5
16813,it's ok not what it used to be scared lots of people away they need to rethink they're web sites use a buyer fee not seller fee,5
16814,a good tool to buy & sell items.,4

16833,"I had good luck with Craig's list years ago, it worked to sell and buy, now nothing works as I have that problem with new apps, they work and then they keep changing them and not for simplicity. I find even facebook doesnt have a list of simple tasks, and they do not work. just all nonsense today. They keep updating apps and they are worse than years ago. Technology as it improves should be user friendlier not more work. All is changed today for money only not for making things better.",3
16834,Great way to find side jobs.,5

16840,Real treasurer,3
16841,it was very easy and my item sold in three days,4
16842,The Christian right wing have taken over this site. It used to be fun seeing weird things that were out in the world but it seems like these people just flag anything that doesn't fit their narrative. I feel like there's a particular group that is taking over and Craigslist is doing nothing about it.,1
16843,fast sales.i like that.craiglist rocks,5
16844,It's the same Craigslist as always I mean what can you say it I wish that they would let me let it store my contact information somewhere from the ads that I see,5

16875,Great for growing my business!,5
16876,"Sometimes this site still proves useful. However, the expanded automatic search criteria makes it hard to get relevant listings or replies. Also, the current Craigslist population is roughly 75% scammer, 25% human and their community moderation makes it feel like it's policed by unemployed hall monitors with a grudge and no life. Though sometimes it comes in handy, for the most part I avoid this site like it's a pandemic. The buttons don't even tell you what they do and can get posts removed.",3
16877,great,5

16911,"I use Craigslist all the time as I sell things from my home as I prepare to downsize. Generally for most items of value I get almost immediate response, or certainly within a few days. I've been very impressed with Craigslist and how it keeps you and the other parties anonymous from each other until each mutually agrees to share contact info. If I had any feedback I would say a nice feature to add would be a way to ""ping"" potential buyers when they do not respond to a seller after 1st contact.",5

16918,It is only the third time I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app it says credibility check every single time that I try and open the app. The developers really need to work on their app to make sure it never has a credibility check other than that without the credibility check issue I won't have given this app 5 stars,1

Not only CL keeping people from selling, they're also turning away more customers than just the sellers. $5 will not deter scammers/fraudsters alike.

It crashes all the time, it doesn't save search settings so you have to re-enter them every time you start up the app, and it has a clumsy interface for sending and receiving messages.

17570,got him sold fast. Didn't get any spam calls this time. Hope they are weeding them out.,5
17571,"Too many scams on this app! Compared to the desktop site, I noticed there are lots of fake posts for some strange reason. My dad almost got scammed out of $500 until I noticed lots of inconsistencies in the posts and email conversations. I ended up deleting the app and sticking to the desktop version. I haven't had any issues since.",1
17572,Very impressed! I sold my car in one day. I couldn't believe the response I had. Thanks Craigslist!,5
17573,easier way to manage your Craigslist stuff. works well,5

17591,I have been using this many years & for big items like furniture it works just great. Not so much for smaller items like jewelry but the reason it didn't make the 5 starts is bcus of the spam on here. There is too much & it needs to be taken care of.,4

17598,Thought it helped me find the right person for the job but the rating usually gets rated higher so I gave it one star less. But not for the lack of search was pretty easy to navigate. Cars job search and buy and sell they have it all.,3

17620,"This ""app"" sucks now. Now, I have to sign in to the Google Surveillance Store to use the Craigslist app? Really? Stop that. You don't need access to my contacts for me to look on Craigslist for a used lawn mower. You don't need access to my location for me to look at Craigslist and sell a dirty trash can. The level of surveillance on here is astounding. Done with Google. Done with ""apps"" that serve little more purpose than to spy on its users, and sell personal information to 3rd parties.",1

This is a warning that all should remove this app from any and all cell phones.,1

I have seen many many posts that are pictures of the same kittens by in different city's and discriptions as more expensive cats. I really bothers me that no one says anything about the same person rehoming kittens that had no shots no vet records. Not Sayed or neutered nothing.

IT'S A SCAM. If they want to send you a ""code"" to verify--or they say, ""I want to buy your ""ITEM"" ... it's a scam!",5

18050,"Had a puppy to re-home, found a very nice young couple to take good care of her! However, please be wary of scammers. If someone contacts you asking if you received a voice code, delete it and don't converse with them. I don't know what kind of game they're playing but they get rude and demand more info trying to intimidate",5
18051,"Not as comfy and reliable as getting on Facebook, and dealing with 'locals' via the miriad of garage sale sites. And.. sometimes seeing a 'profile,' then meeting them in person seems a bit safer. Also, Craigslist app could employ simpler interface, more colors?",4

18082,I was able to rehome my pet without an issue to a great home. I still get updates and everything,5
18083,"App is generally OK, but the CL algorithms kind of haphazardly flag mundane content for deletion with no feedback as to why. Be sure to check your ad occasionally to see if your ad really ""posts"" because sometimes it's there one minute and gone the next (replaced with a cryptic FLAGGED FOR REMOVAL message). Generally great for getting of free things, but dicey in other regards. Hit-or-miss site, but, hey, it's free. ;-)",3
18084,great way to get rid of unneeded items!!!,5
18085,"fantastic working with craigslist, as always!",5

18092,Craigslist is an awesome site to sell or buy things on. Love It,5
18093,Great app!,5
18094,Fun,5
18095,Craigslist has brilliantly eliminated their once overwhelming scam and fraud problem by implementing an insignificant $5 listing fee. Now allll the fraudsters have migrated right over to Fascistbook Marketplace. just wish they could find a way to run all the buyer-scammers away. Does Anyone really fall for those bullsh!t scam0s about overpaying and shipping overseas? Meh. They're easy enough to deflect.,5

18876,"It's great except for having to login every single time I open the app, this isn't a banking app or something that stores Financial or personal information, I don't understand strict security for having to log in all the time.

18877,Easy to post great app,5
18878,"Logs me out every single day. I understand this behavior from very secure applications. But it's an app where I am putting stuff on the curb for free. There's no reason to be more secure than my email client. Also it's probably a mistake so there's that, lol Great otherwise",2

18885,Craigslist didn't sell my car but did drive a lot of traffic to TRED where the sale ended.,5
18886,"Great resource for selling, but lacking in support to fine tuning ads. I listed an electric bike for sale but was given no option to make sure it was also listed under BOTH bicycles and electric bicycles. Instead it was just dumpted in with the 400+ listing under bicycles.",3

19183,It was easy to list but the first person to ask about an item was very creepy.... asking my age and asking for used panties. Just creepy. But otherwise I think it would have been a good selling app.,5

19226,"I use cl often and am pleased with the site, my only complaint is when sellers post the same car/truck several times, i understand why the car lots do it cuz that advertising pays for the site so it's free for everyone else atleast that's what I think!

19265,After over an hour still hasn't loaded yet.,1
19266,Was simpler at first now too complex.,3
19267,"good simple app, just like the site itself",4
19268,I have always been able to sell most of what I have listed. About 95%of the time. If you pick the correct category to post the item in then give as much information as you can then you will get it sold.,4

19286,"quick and easy to post, much better than the webpage",5
19287,cool easy to use,5
19288,Great app for selling and finding things.,5
19289,gold standard,5
19290,I had a good experience. posted two items that sold within a week. buyers were great and everyone was happy.,5
19291,I have been using this app for a few years now and find it to be one of the more successful selling apps. It seems to cater to a more mature buyer and seller and I feel more confident that interested parties will follow through. The only downfall would be the spam asking for code verifications after a listing. Not much Craigslist can do about that.,5
19292,Sold all kinds of stuff on there bro. For real. Brah. Bruh.,5
19293,Easy navigation,5
19294,I listed My 5 ft Kubota Mowing deck and sold it to a guy from Georgia! He just picked it up! I have had such great experiences with my craigslist post so far!,5

19296,Very good deals from very good people.,5
19297,Surprisingly well executed. The search function has useful filters that make it effective and easy to use. I love that you can favorite postings without having to log in.,5
19298,Requires registration to just do a basic search. No thanks. Fortunately a mobile web browser still works and is now easier to use than the app. Don't bother with this.,1
19299,Awesome app!,5
19300,I think that Craigslist is a great place to buy and sell.,5
19301,Again app for Stars only because it's hard to contact the people that are on this list the info doesn't show their names doesn't show who doesn't give a telephone how about for the ones that don't know how to read,4

19349,still free,5
19350,Great work,5
19351,Smooth fast sales no problem. Setting up the post was painless and easy with step by steo instructions. I am very happy with Craigslist. When they warn you about scams regarding codes and checks plus bogus texts & emails take it very serious. If your not alert to the b.s. they will get you. It took a text and email before I figured out the first scam artist who contacted me about 7xs with different hustles.,5

19364,Great source for buying and selling products,5
19365,"There's lots of scammers out there so beware -- but it is still the best place to rent an apartment. Landlords - no matter how seemingly nice or trrustworthy somebody is, get a copy of their license and conduct an online search. You'll be amazed at what you find and will decide NOT to rent to the person. And, when you do find a decent person, get at LEAST first and last month's rent. I've lived and learned and it is not easy to get rid of a scammer.",5
19366,great app,5
19367,Always easy and fast,5
19368,always on the lookout for bargains. If you can take sometime it works. got a 40 in digital tv for 20 bucks just 6 blocks from my home,5

19379,Good experience!,5
19380,Good,5
19381,it works alright but why does the UI have to be so dated?,4
19382,could be better as too many log ins for email addresses to respond to add is limited and shuts you out for a few days. pretty lame,3
19383,RELIABLE ALWAYS CAN FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR LOO,4
19384,"after watching marketplace get hijacked , glad to be using craigslist again",5
19385,I sold my car super fast on here it costs 5 bucks but it was well worth it. I was apprehensive at first because it was always free to post before but it took 24 hours and my car was sold for a fair price. I would use it to sell again,5

19407,Works well enough. Had to uninstall it to end the constant barrage of results from the search I performed once and no longer wanted.,2
19408,I have bern getting a bunch of scam emails of people trying to get my personal info. from this site,1
19409,Ok,5
19410,always something to find on Craigslist app!,5
19411,Easy to use and effective!,5
19412,good app,5
19413,I have found that most younger individuals who grew up with internet have moved on to more advanced platforms. If what you are selling is geared towards someone 40+ you might have some luck. If not I'd suggest using something different. In three months I've gotten ONE hit on each fairly priced listing. This is much lower traffic then say 8-10 years ago. It was also disappointing when I tried to sell a 21 year old junker car that wasn't even running for $500 and it wanted me to pay $5.,3
19414,great app!,5
19415,helped me sell what I needed to sell. Easy to use app.,5

19421,Good app.,5
19422,Trying to update as needed. So far Ive been waiting 15 mins. Still not completed. Guess im done with craigslist. Too much trouble to keep active...... Still waiting. 30 mins. now. If i cancel i have to start all over again . tried that once before. This is rediculous.,1
19423,always works,5
19424,it does what it says it will do,5

19461,I have used CG for years and always find good deals on it.,5
19462,The ser v ice is great. My biggest frustration is when an advertisement appears 10 times. The app would be improved by having the stability to filter out a vendor that one is not interested in.,4
19463,Saved my work for me consistently,4
19464,just gotta be careful who you sell to...always meet in the daytime only at a place with lots of people around...always carry your weapon on you at all times... just in case you have to protect yourself.,4
19465,Wonderful!,5
