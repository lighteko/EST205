Still showed me things from the rest of the Lower Mainland despite being set to the sub area of Vancouver specifically. Also you can't use the search modifiers to filter like in the browser version.

Go on your gut after speaking with them. Most people are very nice. No negotiating until you show the item. Don't take text messages wasting your time. If the item is small enough meet them at a bank or very public place. Price it to sell with a little wiggle room if necessary. You will get the most $ on Craiglist. Good luck!,4,,None
