And I get so much attitude for asking that. People want the guinea pig, but they also want me to provide the food and water dishes, a month’s supply of food and hay, a cage, and a carrier that they can keep for travel purposes.
I helped out a person once, I made sure the guinea pigs she was getting had the food, and she got them the cage and the other things. 2 weeks later she returned them because “they were too much work”. I’m sorry, but if you are getting a pet, it is YOUR responsibility to make sure the pet has all that it needs. In addition, do the research. Don’t go in blind because “they’re so cute”. They are. But these are not easy animals to take care of.
I’m definitely looking elsewhere to rehome the guinea pigs that need to go elsewhere, because I’m done with the attitude and the weirdness of these people.

4,2024-08-21T02:34:30.367000+0000,Possible scam - advice on communication and next steps? : r/craigslist,"Hey there - got an issue and I'm looking for some advice.
I sold an espresso machine to someone out of state (OR to MT). I've dealt a lot locally before and consider myself pretty savvy at avoiding scams. But this is a new one, not sure what to do. Basically, the buyer seemed legit, even though they were out of state - I would have stayed far away if anything seemed amiss - definitely a real person, looked up the name, had legit questions about the machine, had a few email conversations prior to the deal. Buyer paid me via PayPal and upon receipt I shipped the unit via USPS. A few days later the buyer emails me saying the machine arrived but is broken, dented, scratched, etc. which is almost 100% not the case. I say almost because obviously occasionally things can go wrong in shipping, but the extend of the damage they are describing sounds outrageous - on top of which, it was carefully packaged in the original box, etc. They are asking me to refund them about 60% of the charge. The buyer says they will take pics, but has not sent any yet.
This just went down a few hours ago. I have not responded at all - not sure what to do. Do I engage and ask for pics, but defend myself? Do I ignore completely? Does the buyer have any leverage here? They said ""I know you know the tank was broken because it was glued"" which is absolutely untrue. But I'm worried about the ramifications of either engaging or ignoring. What's the best course of action here? Thanks in advance for any advice or similar experiences. And yes, I will never sell across state lines or non-face-to-face again.
Edit: the buyer sent pics... what they describe as ""DEVASTATING"" is like... normal wear and tear?! very tiny scratches on the surface, a few coffee grounds in the works of a used espresso machine? Should I just tell them how used items on craigslist work?? or not engage at all? sheesh!

I went to Airbnb and found a host with good reviews and relatively long history who is offering a lower price if rented through craigslist as a sublet. The property itself has several good Airbnb reviews but they’re all from 2019 and I’m not sure why. The host’s phone number and name are the same on both Airbnb and Craigslist. They’re asking to discuss over phone call things like ID, short-term lease, and dates. Could this be a potential scam? If we moved forward with sublet via craigslist we would be renting site-unseen because we're across the country, but the property advertised on Craigslist is, as far as we can see from photos and general location, the same on Airbnb with the same contact and name information for owner/host. Just trying to figure out why she’s referring me off of Airbnb and over to Craigslist with a different offer amount ($2600 + fees on Airbnb versus $2200 through Craigslist).

The item went down in price by $5-$10. I finally contacted the seller. They answered all my questions and asked when I could pick the item up. I responded that I would like to purchase via Paypal and that I could pick the item up the next day.
Seller agrees to Paypal but then says they won't be available until the following month 2-3 weeks away. (This was not mentioned in the ad or any of the other ads from this seller.) I'm slightly suspicious but I agree and tell seller I will make payment when they return. (I should also mention the seller appears to live in a posh neighborhood, which is probably why I gave them the benefit of the doubt.)
The next message from the seller is that they have been getting offers from other websites and they would still like to sell it to me but for a little more money...... I didn't respond. A couple days later the item is listed at a higher price. Its been several days now and the item is still listed. I don't actually mind paying the higher price but I'm convinced this is some sort of scam. Advice please?

Someone contacts me and we quickly agree to a pickup time. That time comes and they ask for a couple more hours.

I just thank them for the update and it was cool to come later.
People show up and I help them load the couch, then the lady hands me cash and thanks me. She is super excited for her new couch. I am confused but just thank her for the cash and assume they are insisting on paying for it. I chalk it up to a lucky day.
Later the person who had emailed checks in to make sure the people got the couch and says they gave cash because Venmo didn't work. Again confused, I just said there was no issue. She emails back and says again that they gave me cash and I needed to Venmo it to her.
Oh, wait... Is this a scam where someone out there grabs free stuff listings and posts them for a price on another platform?? Was she selling my free couch?

First one from May 14 (exact words): ""Hello! I am interested in renting your parking spot. What is the address?  Do you accept direct deposit?"" I answered those questions about payment, but did not provide any of my contact info until she replies back. As of this post, she has not.
Second one from May 15: ""Hello, I am interested in your posting for the parking space. My vehicle is a Toyota Camry. Is the space still available?"" I replied that yes, the space is still available and we can discuss further. I have not heard back.
What's funny to me was I responded to their e-mails just minutes after receiving them. Is waiting 24 hours after their last e-mail message more than enough time for me to move on and either call them a Craigslist Flake or a possible spammer who wants to know my e-mail address (and other contact info) that they could exploit? I remember doing a Craigslist post several years ago, where this actually happened and I got flooded with spam e-mails for weeks. If they are not spammers and actual real people, why would they flake out so quickly when obtaining private parking spots in local neighborhoods, at least in my area, are hard to find and in demand?

I texted again that I was here and the garage opens. A man who could moonlight as Santa Claus waves me into the small 8 car garage. I immediately think this is a bad idea but think maybe I will keep my car on the gate. Red Flag #1 Against my better judgment drive in. The heavy gate slides shut. I get my husband on the phone - and begin the transaction with the man who says his name is Joe. I don’t see the portable dishwasher. The gate is closed. I am alone and no one really knows exactly where I am. Red Flag #2 Joe pulls out keys and pops the hatchback of a vehicle and a new in the box portable dishwasher is there. I hand him the money. He thrusts the money in his pocket without counting it and waves me over to his car. I don’t move. “Can you please put it in my car? I pop my hatchback and have my driver door open. I find myself looking for escape. He smiles and goes to get the large box. Red flag#3 He sets it in my car and then pulls it out immediately wanting me to inspect the item and discuss its features. “That’s fine Can you please put it my car?” “Let me call my wife.” he responds and dials but never speaks to anyone. Red flag #4 “I’d be more comfortable if the gate were open I say.” “ oh sure” he says “ here is my wife “ who comes from some where behind me and now I am between two stranger and my car is blocked by a dishwasher and a closed security gate. He loads the dishwasher into my car but does not open the gate. “Please open the gate” I say shakily. “Oh sure” the man fumbles with keys. The woman takes the dishwasher out of my vehicle- saying” I need to check if I left something in it” The gate slides open. I feel a bit of relief as the woman wants to tell me about how the dishwasher also washes vegetables.
Husband-are you still there? I say into the phone. “Yes” “Okay well thank you, but I really need to get going. If there is anything of your in the box I will return it and I am sure we can figure out the dishwasher. “ they start telling me how they are pet and house sitting here. They don’t live here. I offer thanks and say I need to go. Red Flag #5 The woman repackages the dishwasher. The man holds a small black object in his hand. The gate slides closed. I look for emergency exits and consider running for a side door. “Please open the gate “ I manage to say in a raspy voice holding off sheer panic. “Oh sure” the man points the small object at the gate and it slides open. I reach up to press the button on the tail gate to close my car boot as soon as the woman placed the dishwasher in the back. “Did I tell you it washes vegetables. Here I can show you.” And starts to pull it out again and the tailgate safety feature kicks in and pops back open. “Thank you so much I am sure it’s lovely but I really have to go now!” I can feel that I am shaking and now both of the man and woman are in front of me not sandwiching me in. The gate slides open and I rush to my driver seat I shut and lock the door. Red Flag #6 The man goes to passenger door and tells me it’s a tight space and to pull into a stall to turn around and gestures to empty spaces on my left. I am like forget that and immediately begin reversing out of the garage. Crash! I lower my window to see what I struck, I expected another car but it the left tail side struck the gate as it was closing! The safety feature of the gate sent it back open. The man is standing on my left now with black remote in his hand. “I crashed your gate!” I don’t want to stop long so I continue reversing to get to public view. “It’s okay” and cares about the gate about as much as he cared the money-not at all. Red Flag #7 He is looking at the remote and holding it with both hands. He shouts a warning “not clear “ but it was clear and I don’t stop.
I get away and make a police report about everything even the gate. My car has some damage but I am okay. No AirTag detectable on the item purchased.
Maybe they were just friendly bumbling fools or maybe, like my gut sensed, I was in very real danger. Lessons learned -that’s for sure.

So i reposted it at $40 then after a few days still no sales. the listing got buried so I later reposted again at $30.

At this point I would be fine with getting 10 bucks out of it (although I think people would get suspicious at that point). Or just give it for free
Before listing i gave it a good shine, included photos of all angles of the monitor, included with all the accessories and a photo of it turned on as proof that it works.
Should I just bite the dust and donate it? I still havent gotten a single call or reply. I even offer to deliver for free locally.

What would be the reason for doing this?

47,2023-06-02T22:02:59.866000+0000,I ran away from meet up. It sounds possibly dangerous right? : r/craigslist,"Ok, so let me say I know I did not handle this the most mature way. I am working on being direct and assertive, and while driving off and then turning my phone off definitely is not how I wanna handle situations, I felt like my lfie was possibly threatened and did not feel like this was the right time to practice my therapy skills and get over my fear of, “Awkwardness from uncomfortable interactions.”
That being said, I made a post looking for some extra help with my house. I just needed a bit and all the other apps wanted 60 dollars I was like bro I just need to play catch up then hopefully I’m good. So anyways, I make my ad, yadi yada, lots of replies, and the first one doesn’t show and says he slept through. Anyways, I contacted this girl who sounded sweet and she was available. We met at Walgreens and she seemed sweet (I’m also female). I could tell from the start she was a bit older and did (or atleast has done) drugs. I didn’t care, like I wish her well but I was like ok that’s probably partly why she’s looking for extra cash off Craigslist but like people with addictions can still be nice people right, they’re not all criminals, whatever.
Where it gets sketch. Her friend drove her, which is whatever. She runs to get her wallet from the car, which I didn’t think anything of (to buy snack). Anyways, I ask her if she’s following me and she said no she could come with me and her friend could wait for her. I was like uh ok (I thought she had a car, but not everyone has a car, doesn’t mean anything). Ok so then she asks if I want her friend to wait there or at my place? I’m thinking bitch I don’t want your friend to exist, the fuck, you didn’t mention dragging some grown ass male into this I don’t want two on on. I say I guess here, she then said she had to get her phone from the car. Ok fucking weird. Most adults have their phones on them and can figure out cordinationatuln, here’s where I was like yea I’m out. She told me to WAIT there, as I was driving her to her friends car, like implying me to stay away. This is where I thought fuck no. I don’t know what’s going behind those tinted windows, why the fuck there’s another person so involved who CLEARLY is not screening me for her sake as he has not seen me. Anyways she goes in the car and she’s in there a while and I’m just like you know what fuck this I don’t want her over with this dude waiting right here I don’t trust this shit fucking waste of time it’s not worth the risk.
Now… normally I would feel very rude having someone meet me and then driving off and ghosting them, and I did, but I wasn’t gonna risk my physical safety over someone’s emotions and didn’t know how to really be direct. That sounds sketch right? Idk it just didn’t sit right with me. Doesn’t one hundred percent mean they were planning something, but that sounds kinda sketchy right?

To prevent spam, I started writing in my ads, ""Geographic area associated with single area code"", and then the rest of my phone number.

It seemed cheap but not crackhead cheap, and the add didn't really set off any red flags (other than the unusual phone number) so I wasn't concerned. Dude got back to me right away and said ""it's available"" but then was non-responsive so I assumed he sold it.
A week or so later I saw another CL ad for a very cheap Honda, again, other than the low price not a ""scammy"" ad. When I messaged I realized it was the same number as the Porsche. I played along and ever set up a time to go see the car and he provided an address. When I looked up address on Google maps I could tell right away it did not match the pictures of where the car was parked in a driveway. I then asked him if he sold his ""grandpa's Porche"", to which he replied, ""yes I did"".
Now, several weeks later I see the Grandpa Porsche listed again. Photos are the same, wording of the ad is slightly different and phone number is as well. What in the hell kind of scam is this? I've been craigslisting for a long time and have never encountered anything like this. The only thing this guy seems to be getting are phone numbers. I don't really care because I use a google voice number whenever I respond to CL ads. Has anyone encountered this before?

61,2023-04-01T22:26:22.478000+0000,Craigslist vs FB Marketplace (Discussion About User Identity) : r/craigslist,"I've been doing some research on some of the popular local buy/sell marketplaces, and it appears FB Marketplace is taking significant market share from platforms like Craigslist and OfferUp. It seems a lot of people really like that on FB Marketplace you can screen the buyer/seller by looking at their profile before agreeing to meet up for a transaction. Of course FB also has a ton of users which is great for market liquidity, but I wanna keep this discussion focused on the identity of users. I may be in the minority, but I personally don't like linking the things I buy and sell to my personal profile on FB.
One of the biggest issues with Craigslist, as many people know, is that spam/bots/fraud is rampant and seriously degrades user experience. This problem is especially acute for Craigslist because the barrier to entry (ie creating an account to participate) is so low. In fact potential buyers don't even need to create an account to message sellers.
I wanted to get people's thoughts on whether they see Craigslist's lack of user identity as a strength or weakness?
If Craigslist could figure out a way to significantly reduce spam/bots/fraud posts & messages would you use it over FB Marketplace assuming both sites had the same number of buyers & sellers? Or would the lack of identity on Craigslist make you prefer FB Marketplace instead?
I'd love to hear what everyone thinks about this subject, whether it's a direct response to the question or just sharing your thoughts and opinions!

The graphics card is an MSI AMD Radeon R9 280 which is quite old but still functional. The post correctly listed this part and the computer (tower and monitor) for only $200 (cheap for a PC). The buyer called and left a voicemail this afternoon upset about the graphics card saying ""I don't think that's what was advertised"" and asked for me to call them back. They did not make any threats on the voicemail, but they simply seemed unhappy by tone of voice.
Unfortunately, the buyer did buy it by picking it up from my apartment which I am now regretting seeing as they know my address now.
I do not want to give a refund, seeing as I did not make any false advertisements (and it's on the buyer to do their own research on parts). I am debating on what I should do to avoid any confrontation and stay safe. I have not returned their call or contacted them yet.
What do you recommend as the best course of action to avoid confrontation and stay safe? Just ignore their message, or send them text with something along the lines of ""Sorry you are unhappy with the part, but that was correctly listed, and I am not taking refunds.""?
EDIT/UPDATE:
Thanks for everyone's advice! I was a little stressed by their message, but I amassed the courage to send them a text with ""Hey buyer_name, I got your voicemail. Sorry, I'm not sure where your confusion stems from. My Craigslist ad correctly listed the graphics card as MSI AMD Radeon R9 280, and I mentioned it was a 280 when you visited. If you aren't satisfied, you can always replace the card or resell the card/machine.""
They replied with ""I downloaded the driver from the link you sent and system info recognized 200 not 280. Otherwise it's all good.""
Turns out their confusion was that the 280 comes from the AMD Radeon R9 200 series and system information only showed the 200 series number not the 280. I told them the link to driver would not of worked otherwise and they can verify with a tool like GPU-Z. Crisis adverted, sorry if it's a bit of an anti-climatic update lol

I had a computer graphics card sent to me by the manufacturer as a warranty replacement. Sold it 7 days ago. The buyer contacts me last night, says there is a problem with it, and it crashes while running.
I asked that he take a pic of the back of the card showing the serial # so I could contact the manufacturer. I offered him two options, either to set up a return with a prepaid label and have another replacement shipped directly to him, OR that I would meet him and even exchange a similar model.
I did not get a response until this morning while at work. Buyer says neither of these options work for him and he wants a refund. When I sold the item, I had to drive out about 25 minutes to meet him, so this would entail losing an hour of my day to refund a card he's had for a week. I feel like both of the options I offered were reasonable, considering about half the people on CL likely wouldn't respond.

I just sold a 2015 model smart tv on craigslist. I posted the model number and I priced it about half price of recently completed sales of the model on ebay. I had a guy come buy it today. He wanted to make sure it worked before he took it (understandable) but to do that i had to let him into my apartment where there was an outlet.
Turns out, he gets home and he realizes it doesn't have an hdmi port. He would have to buy an adapter. He's unhappy and wants to return the tv. I told him to check and see if he can find a cheap hdmi adapter somewhere. He says the sale is not complete because there is no adapter and hdmi ports are on every tv made now.

88,2023-01-18T07:29:12.289000+0000,Angry and shady buyer - need advice : r/craigslist,"Had two weird experiences today. I'm new to selling, looking for advice.
The angry buyer
Today, I met a Dutch man wanting to buy a guitar and amp from me today. The exchange was going OK until he asked me for my guitar case I'm carrying. I say the case was not in the original listing, but I'll let you have it for 20. It's a cheap POS case. He says, 'Nah, nah, nah, nah, you can give it for free. Come on...'I tell him the case was not in the original agreement (guitar and amp), it's extra. I bought it for 40 and I would make a loss. He can get it for 20.
He says no, give it to him for free, gets incensed and angry, asking for his money back for the guitar and amp, saying he's 'not here to haggle', and walks off saying 'Have a nice day!' Dude wanted to strong-arm me to include a free case for his guitar and then got mad, cancelling his deal.
2. The shady buyer
This is a shady experience I need advice on. I am talking to a buyer on Facebook Marketplace, I'm selling a guitar. It's listed at 630, he started to haggle, 'Got discount?', after some bargaining we agree 510. We are organizing a meet, I gave him a mall I know well between 12 and 7.30 pm for a time, cash on delivery. He then asks, 'Can you do any other place? After 8 pm should be fine too'. I don't want to meet this guy after 8pm for obvious reasons, so this is a red flag.
I insist on the mall, then he says, 'Okay, if I can't make it by 5 pm I'll arrange a delivery driver. I'm at the edge of the state'. He says he will make a transfer instead of cash, and I can give the guitar to this delivery driver. I say no, and just now insisted on meeting at a police station which he said yes to but didn't give a time. But I'm actually thinking, this amount of red flags, just drop it with this guy. What do you think?
EDIT: I dropped the sale with the guy who wants his ""delivery driver"" to meet me at night at a place of his choosing and do a transfer instead of cash. I sold the guitar to a known music shop instead.

89,2023-01-17T18:24:13.276000+0000,Going back on agreement to sell : r/craigslist,"I'm conflicted on this. There's a guy I agreed to sell my monitor. The original price was listed at 120, he asked if the monitor was in good working condition and I said yes, there are some minor scratches on the back but it's fine and sent extra pic of that. Then he asked (100 ok?) which I agreed to, and we arranged a place and time tomorrow, thinking it was fair because the scratches were not in the original picture I listed and bc I didn't know if there were any more potential buyers.
Then he starts to get a bit pushy saying ''I'm staying at xxx street' though we're in the same area, like he wants me to come deliver it to him. Then he states that he will 'collect it from me'. We finally organized a time and place tomorrow.
I've recently been messaged by a different buyer who wants to pay 140 for it.
I don't like the original guy sounded pushy and that I lowered the price for him. I want to go back on it. But I am conflicted because it would be perhaps morally wrong to go back on my word given that I agreed to sell to him for 100 and arranged a time and place. What do you think I should do?
UPDATE. Guy sent me a new message, he said, 'Since we're in the same area, I'll just transfer money to you and pick up the monitor from outside your front door'. This changes what we agreed on, cash on delivery and public meetup. I cancelled his sale.

I figured if they were concerned about the $100 they could ask the cashier at the gas station, but I don't want it to be weird or anything.

99,2022-12-30T03:35:38.493000+0000,"Need advice on safely accepting payment, with some complications : r/craigslist","So I'm looking to sell some large woodworking tools I've inherited, and I've gone through some of the posts here looking for advice on how to safely sell higher dollar items (in the range of $1000-1500). Problem is, a lot of the most common advice (meet the seller at a bank with the item and watch them draw out the cash there, then deposit immediately) won't really work for me. I've got a couple of complications:
My bank isn't in-state, and doesn't have any Deposit ATMs anywhere in my state (withdrawal-only ATMs) and they don't accept mail-in-deposits for cash. I know paypal has a way to deposit cash at particular stores for a small fee, so I can probably get a cash payment into my accounts that way, but I've heard warnings about fraudulent bills and would have no way to guard against that. Is this something I should be worried about?
The woodworking items are all quite large and extremely heavy. I am disabled and cannot move the items myself (nor do I have a friend with a truck), so the buyer will have to come to my house to pick up any of the tools they buy themselves.
With these complications in mind, how should I proceed?

Buyer sends me a text saying they wants to buy the item. Strings me along for an address where to meet. I always meet at a local starbucks. Doesn't negotiate the price at all.
I also always use a google voice number to talk to potential buyers. And the messages took a crazy amount of time to go through, half of which never went through. Kept giving me send errors for simple texts.
In both situations, after the time and place to meet is established, they claim to know the location I'm referring and them recently visiting that location. And say they are going to meet me soon.
Then suddenly. They want more pictures of the item. They want more information about the item. I instantly refer them back to craigslist listing. They ask for more pictures, but I normally never take more pictures then already posted. And If I do, I only upload the image back to the listing.
When they give up on getting more information, and/or pictures. Suddenly the item is too small or too big. And they tell me they needed the item in metrics measurement and not in inches. The questions they ask me, are clearly answered in the post as well...
So what is the deal with this? Has anyone ran into a situation like this? Are they looking for a geolocation? Chinese hackers?

Growing increasingly deseperate for a job after getting rejected from my billionth interview, I decided to post on Craigslist stating in pretty much the most straightfoward way possible that I'm looking for a job. Any job.
Naturally, this resulted in lots of people emailing me. Most of them were either obvious scams or trolls, but there was one that looked seemingly legit.
I don't want to get into the specifics about it, but it looked pretty legit til I woke up today to see they responded to an email about me returning scanned documents to them...at 3am. This wouldn't have been suspicious if it wasn't for the fact ""we"" are supposed to be in the same timezone
This led to me actually looking this stuff up in more detail, which quickly led to me realizing it was all a scam. I just got blinded by desperation making me take what looked like a 'real' job opportunity
Now I'm concerned. I didn't send them a scanned copy of my ID or SSN card, but I did send them scanned copies of the 'employment' letters I needed to put my info in...which includes my SSN among the I-9 Form.
I wasn't wary of it at the time since that's pretty standard of the form, but now that I know it was all a scam I realized to myself I gave them my SSN anyway. I don't even want to imagine what are they gonna plan to do with that
So to sum things up, don't be like me. Someone who's too clever by half. I had my guard up the entire time, yet all it took was letting it down for a second to be played like a fiddle

I can understand people feeling bad about accepting a big loss on a bike that they spent $1500-$2k on and only used ""a few times,"" but obviously $1k is too much to ask because these bikes aren't moving. Given that even Peloton has halted production of new bikes, it's not like there's a huge future market for these things either.

This is a beauitful home located in a prime location and I will be more than happy to have you over to get a look at it !! Just let me know when you might have time to come on over !!"". Immediately I notice that they're talking really oddly, with typos and the exclamation points, and don't even send any pictures, just asking me to come see it. Later they ask me to call them after I say I'm not sure when I'd be able to come see it, giving me their phone number. More typos and strange punctuation. They also say ""I suppose it's best to call me tommarow between 1 pm and 8 pm !!  This home will provide you with a fully furnished private room!!

This all just seems really odd to me. They gave me the area the property is in, their phone number, and wanted to meet in person right away, but the way they talk and keep saying those same lines just seems really odd, and the fact that they didn't send pictures when I asked is strange. Is this a scam, or are they just strange?

Because of his age, he doesn't understand email or texting and prefers voice calls. So I make sure I include his phone number in the body of the ad, as well as the section at the bottom of the form to include the phone number and click the box that phone calls are okay.
Usually this goes without a hitch, until last night.
At the screen where you get a warning message about posting your phone number due to phishing and scams, the website wouldn't let me click the ""continue"" button. I got around this by editing the ad and publishing without the phone number, and then going back and editing the ad to add the phone number back in.
That all seemed to work fine last night, but as of today, the ""Reply"" button only has ""show email"", and after passing the captcha for ""show contact info"" in the body of the ad, I get error messages.
This is the same across multiple ads I placed for my friend last night.
I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Is there some new rule against phone numbers? Or might this be some temporary technical issue that will hopefully be resolved...or I should contact Craigslist about?

Details: some entitled little 16 year old lied about a bunch of stuff and sold me a sick animal, which then got my other animals sick, etc.
I had no idea they were 16, because for one we only communicated via text until we met up for 30 seconds to swap, and I just assumed you had to be 18 to sell stuff on Craigslist.
I texted them asking to either take the animal back and to the vet, or reimburse me for the animal and/or vet costs. Then their mom texts me that 'I'm harassing her underage child and they'll press charges for ""harassing a minor"" which is laughable and the exact Karen response I'd expect from the mom of this kind of kid.
But obviously, I want no part of any law-breaking that even has the word 'minors' associated with it, and honestly don't even care if I get the money back(sure would be nice, but I'm guessing it won't happen).
I just want this shitty little teenager to stop abusing animals.
So, besides misrepresentation (fraud maybe? I dunno) which are both entirely accurate, also long shot to actually get anywhere.
If nothing else I'd like to waste some of their time and resources so they maybe possibly think twice about doing this shit again, or at least have something on the record in case something worse happens later on.
Basically just trying to figure out if I should pursue it or drop it and hope her poor abused animals rise up against her one day in some great act of karma.
(And no, I don't generally buy/adopt animals off Craigslist, this was an exception that I should have listened to my gut about it, but...lesson learned.)

The home is supposed to have 2 in each bedroom and the rent I paid was for a shared room. But of course that wasn’t what I was aware of beforehand.
The case worker was shocked and told me she was at risk for termination because she has a female that was supposed to be in my room. Thankfully, since it’s a government agency, they knew my rights and the laws and it was a peaceful conversation.

So the low price is one red flag. The other is that they advertised it as ""Dagger Kayak"" - no model name. An avid kayaker will usually know the model name, and put it in the ad. Then again, if someone swipes a kayak off a rack, they won't usually have the accessories to go with it. So what do you think? Am I being paranoid? What should I do in terms of due diligence- I read somewhere about asking for the serial number and checking with local law enforcement to see if it's been reported, but I feel that the local police in my area can't really be bothered with stuff like that.

I guess I could put it outside just before they come over.
Since then, about 10 people have responded, also interested. I read some of the other replies, and I just feel more in tune with one or two of the other people. The person who responded first said nothing about themselves, they didn’t even have a full name. So I’d like to change my mind, but I feel bad about it. I know that we are not required to give the first person who responds the item. In fact we are we encouraged to let a few other people respond first. I wish I had done that.
What would be a reasonable way for me to tell this person that I would like to see more responses first? Would it be enough just to tell them that? Along with an apology, of course.

Do there actually exist people who are willing to put up with this? The post is several months old, and I can't imagine their strategy is very successful. Their way seems like more work than just putting the info in the posting.
What are strategies to deal with this? Presumably I could set up a meeting, which I'm not going to do without more info. Or I could forget it since they're acting like a putz, which is my inclination. I also tried sending an email with what I think is a fair price, but got no response.

Friday night I went to a guy’s house to pick up a barbell, plates, and a flat bench after we agreed on a price.
Guy immediately tells me that he has extremely poor eyesight. I believe this is true. (He’s old, squinting heavily, house is messy, his TV was extremely bright and on the ground right in front of his couch). Important for context.
He also says he can’t find (2) of the 45 pound plates he agreed to sell me for the asking price. Okay, fine.
I load the remaining plates and barbell into my car. However, the bench won’t fit.
The guy offers to drive it over to my place in his truck the following day. I say sure. I offer to pay half for taking the barbell and plates with me. He refuses, and says that he “trusts me” and we’ll handle payment tomorrow. Okay. So we agree to meet at 10am Saturday.
He doesn’t get back to me until 3pm. He says that he couldn’t find his phone. Again, dude’s house is messy and he (presumably) can’t see. He says that his friend is coming over tomorrow to help him look for the missing 45 pound plates. Okay. So we agree to meet at 2pm Sunday.
It’s now 5:30. He last responded at 3:30 saying that his friend is over and they’re looking for the plates. Obviously I’ve been texting him all afternoon today and yesterday and that’s as much as I’ve gotten out of him.
So am I getting scammed?
My thoughts: If he wanted to scam me, why would he have let me take HIS stuff without paying??
Update: Guy texted me back at 9:30 saying he can’t find the (2) plates. He’s offering $20 off the asking price and if I can’t do that, please bring the weights back. I tell him plates are worth $1/lb so the price should go down more than $20, no response. Jesus Christ why are people like this

Ads are not being taken down by Craigslist but I have a few vacancies right now that are taking more than usual to fill.
I’m paying them a salary and I also have expenses, utilities and mortgages to pay. Plus my family’s and kids’ (18-20) college expenses to pay.
The main employee that takes calls and does showings says she has not been receiving much calls, yet the postings are not being taken down. And I have no way to track that because I got them standard “pay-as-you-go” phone numbers to use.
⋯ ～ ⋯ ～ ⋯
I am attempting to try Google Voice for business through Google Workspace, or Nextiva to be able to have access to call, SMS, and voicemail logs so I can start tracking what’s going on. Plus, it’s going to give the business a more professional look since I’m developing a website.
Has anyone ever attempted this? Does Craigslist allow VoIP business lines in their ads such as Nextiva or Google Voice for business?
Thanks so much in advance for the help!

I replied that I'd prefer to correspond by email until I knew he was serious. 5 days later (today), he emails me with a similar, but not identical message, asking me to call him.
It could be that he just missed my reply, but I was wondering if this was a scam tactic to get my number for a call list or something.

227,2022-02-10T00:05:35.383000+0000,Is this a scam? Meeting tonight : r/craigslist,"Hey guys. Just selling a guitar for about $400 dollars on Craigslist. Dude texts me says hes coming from ny and he’s on his way to Florida and I’m along the way (I’m in east pa).
He didn’t ask me anything about the guitar. I told him I want to meet at a grocery store parking lot and the price is final and cash only. He said ok. Was going to come around 7 and now he’s saying battery trouble so should be here around 9. I told him okay but we are meeting at the entrance to the store where it is well lit and there’s cameras.
He hasn’t responded to that yet.. I’m feeling that this is an obvious scam and why would someone waste their time over a $400 guitar?
Am I being paranoid or what?

228,2022-01-28T04:39:31.411000+0000,Legitimate tactic or not? : r/craigslist,"Increasingly, I encounter sellers who arrange more than one buyer to show up at the same time for an item. Happened long ago with a car, but more recently happened three times with antique furniture. Obviously, one buyer is going to walk away unhappy, especially if the drive is far. The seller always seems to think this is their right, and if you don't like, don't come. I think it is opportunistic and they're hoping for a bidding war. I won't go on principle if informed in advanced someone else will be there. I would never do that to anyone as a seller myself. However, it is not illegal and maybe this comes from retail practices. Any thoughts, good or bad?

""Toys""

I contacted the poster and asked if I could come by tomorrow around noon, and he said he'd leave the door open since he'll be out running errands. Do I need to be concerned with the fact that I won't be meeting him? I.e. is this some kind of scam? I reverse searched his number and he seemed legit fwiw.
